(b) The bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (except with respect

the Surviving Corporation, in each case to hold office in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until the
earlier of their death, resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected, designated or qualified.

 _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

 

Section 2.1 _Effect on Securities_.

 

(a) _Effect of Merger_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the
holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

(i) _Cancellation of Company Securities_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock") held by the
Company as treasury stock or held directly by Parent or Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration or payment shall be delivered in
exchange therefor or in respect thereof (such shares, "Canceled Shares").

 

(ii) _Conversion of Converted Shares_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is held
by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary
of Parent (other than Merger Sub) (collectively, "Converted Shares") shall be
converted into and become such number of fully paid and non-assessable common
shares, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation such that the
ownership percentage of any such Subsidiary in the Surviving Corporation
immediately following the Effective Time shall equal the ownership percentage
of such Subsidiary in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(iii) _Conversion of Company Securities_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Canceled Shares, Converted Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted
into the right to receive, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (A)
$93.33 per share in cash, without interest, from Parent (such amount of cash,
the "Cash Consideration"), and (B) a number of validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Parent
(the "Parent Common Stock") equal to the Exchange Ratio (and, if applicable,
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable in accordance
with _Section 2.1(c)_) (such shares of Parent Common Stock and any such cash
in lieu of fractional shares, together with the Cash Consideration, the
"Merger Consideration"). Each share of Company

 



-2-  Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in this _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_ shall no longer be
outstanding and shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist, and
the holders of certificates (the "Certificates") or book-entry shares ("Book-
Entry Shares"), which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such
Company Common Stock, shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Company Common Stock other than the right to receive, upon surrender of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2_, the
Merger Consideration.

 

(iv) _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. Each share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) fully
paid share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

(b) _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement,
if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, any change in the number or type of outstanding shares of
Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall occur as a result of a
reclassification, recapitalization, exchange, stock split (including
a reverse stock split), combination or readjustment of shares or any stock
dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, the
Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may
be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. Nothing in this _Section
2.1(b)_ shall be construed to permit any party to take any action that is
otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this Agreement.

(c) _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Company
Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to any Parent Common Stock
or to vote or to any other rights of a holder of Parent Common Stock. All
fractional shares that a single record holder of Company Common Stock would be
otherwise entitled to receive shall be aggregated and calculations shall be
rounded to three (3) decimal places. In lieu of any such fractional shares,
each holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to such
fractional shares shall be entitled to an amount in cash, without interest,
rounded down to the nearest cent, equal to the product of (i) the amount of
the fractional share interest in a share of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder would, but for this _Section 2.1(c)_, be entitled under _Section
2.1(a)(iii)_ and (ii) the Parent Stock Price. As soon as practicable after
the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of
Company Common Stock in lieu of any fractional share interests in Parent
Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amount, without
interest, to the holders of Company Common Stock entitled to receive such
cash. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional share interests pursuant to
this _Section 2.1(c)_ is not a separately bargained-for consideration.

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Designation of Exchange Agent; Deposit of Exchange Fund_. Prior to the
Closing, Parent shall enter into a customary exchange agreement with the
transfer agent of Parent, the transfer agent of the Company or another
nationally recognized financial institution or trust company designated by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent") for
the payment of the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_.
Prior to or substantially concurrently with the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, for exchange in
accordance with this _Article II_ through the Exchange Agent, (i) book-entry
shares representing the full number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable pursuant to  _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_ in exchange for outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) cash in an aggregate amount necessary
to pay the Cash Consideration portion of the Merger Consideration, and Parent
shall, after the Effective Time on the appropriate payment date, if
applicable, provide or cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent any
dividends or other distributions payable on such shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to _Section 2.2(d)_ (such shares of Parent Common Stock and Cash
Consideration provided to the Exchange Agent,

 



-3-  together with any such dividends or other distributions with respect
thereto, the "Exchange Fund"). Parent shall make available to Exchange Agent,
for addition to the Exchange Fund, from time to time as needed, cash
sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with
_Section 2.1(c)_. In the event the Exchange Fund shall at any time be
insufficient to make the payments contemplated by _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_,
Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with
the Exchange Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount
required to make such payment. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to _Section 2.1_, except as
expressly provided for in this Agreement.

 

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, and in no event
later than the fifth (5th) Business Day thereafter, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery of Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be
in the form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify)
and (ii) instructions (which instructions shall be in the form and have such
other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for (A) cash in an amount equal to
the Cash Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common
Stock previously represented by such Certificates, (B) the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock (which shall be in book-entry form) representing, in the
aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder has the right to
receive in respect of such Certificates pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_,
(C) any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to  _Section
2.2(d)_ and (D) cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
payable pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_.

 

(c) Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a letter of transmittal
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as promptly as
reasonably practicable (i) cash in an amount equal to the Cash Consideration
multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by such Certificate, (ii) the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock (which shall be in book-entry form) representing, in the aggregate, the
whole number of shares that such holder has the right to receive in respect
of such Certificate pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_, (iii) any dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(d)_ and (iv) any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section
2.1(c)_, if applicable, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) so surrendered shall be forthwith canceled. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no holder of Book-Entry Shares
shall be required to deliver a Certificate or letter of transmittal or
surrender such Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent. In lieu thereof, each
Book-Entry Share shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to
receive, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Exchange Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as promptly as
reasonably practicable, (i) cash in an amount equal to the Cash Consideration
multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by such Book-Entry Share, (ii) the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock (which shall be in book-entry form) representing, in the
aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder has the right to
receive in respect of such Book-Entry Shares pursuant to _Section
2.1(a)(iii)_, (iii) any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
_Section 2.2(d)_ and (iv) any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_, if applicable. Until
surrendered, in the case of a Certificate, or paid, in the case of a Book-
Entry Share, in each case, as contemplated by this  _Section 2.2(c)_, each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed, from and after the Effective
Time, to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this _Section 2.2(c)_ and any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(d)_. The Exchange Agent shall
accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and make such
payments and deliveries with respect to Book-Entry Shares upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent
may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange

 



-4-  practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders
of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the cash or other Merger
Consideration payable hereunder.

 

(d) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. Subject to applicable
Law, there shall be paid to the holder of the Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange for Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_,
without interest, (i) at the time of delivery of such Parent Common Stock by
the Exchange Agent pursuant to  _Section 2.2(c)_, the amount of dividends or
other distributions, if any, with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii)
at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions, if any, with a record date after the Effective Time but prior
to such delivery of such Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent pursuant to
_Section 2.2(c)_, and a payment date subsequent to such delivery of such
Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_,
payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

 

(e) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the
appropriate amount of Merger Consideration (and any dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock as contemplated by _Section
2.2(d)_) may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered is registered, if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer (and accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the Exchange
Agent) or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share or establish to the satisfaction of Parent
that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or its
designee upon demand, and any such holders prior to the Merger who have not
theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent as general creditor thereof for payment of their claims for Merger
Consideration and any dividends or distributions with respect to
Parent Common Stock as contemplated by _Section 2.2(d)_.

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Parent Common
Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash held in the
Exchange Fund delivered to a Governmental Authority pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificate shall not have been surrendered or Book-Entry Share not paid, in
each case, in accordance with _Section 2.2(c)_, immediately prior to the date
on which any Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority, any such Merger Consideration in respect of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of all claims or interest of
any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(h) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that no such
investment shall relieve Parent or the Exchange Agent from making the payments
required by this _Article II_, and following any losses Parent shall promptly
provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders
of Company Common Stock in the amount of such losses. Any interest or income
produced by such investments will be payable to Parent or its designee as
directed by Parent.

 

(i) _Withholding_. Each of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and
the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code or any provision of applicable Tax Law.  Any amounts
so withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

 



-5- Section 2.3 _Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Company Restricted Stock Awards_. As of the Effective Time,
each award of Company Common Stock subject to vesting or lapse restrictions
(each a "Company Restricted Stock Award") that remains outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall, to the extent not vested, become fully
vested, and shall be canceled without any action on the part of any holder or
beneficiary thereof and converted in accordance with the procedures set forth
in this Agreement into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
respect of each share of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Restricted Stock Award, treating such shares in the same manner as
all other outstanding shares of Company Common Stock for such purposes.

 

(b) _Treatment of Company RSU Awards_.

 

(i) As of the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award relating to
shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Company RSU Award") that was granted
(A) prior to the date of this Agreement or (B) to a non-employee director of
the Company, and that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall, to the extent not vested, become fully vested, and shall be
canceled without any action on the part of any holder or beneficiary thereof
in consideration for the right to receive the Merger Consideration as promptly
as practicable following the Effective Time (but in no event later than seven
(7) Business Days thereafter) in respect of each share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time,
less any applicable withholding or other Taxes or other amounts required by
applicable Law to be withheld; _provided_ that to the extent that such Company
RSU Award is subject to performance conditions, the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be deemed to be equal to the target number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award; _provided_
_further_ that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, any payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of any such
Company RSU Award which immediately prior to such cancellation was treated as
"deferred compensation" subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made on
the earliest possible date that such payment would not trigger a tax or
penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

 

(ii) As of the Effective Time, each Company RSU Award, other than any Company
RSU Award that is described in  _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)(i)_, that is granted
on or after the date of this Agreement and that remains outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, without any action on the part
of the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and converted into a restricted
stock unit award of Parent covering that number of shares of Parent Common
Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares) equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to the Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time
by (B) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio; _provided_ that to the extent that
such Company RSU Award is subject to performance conditions, such number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award shall be
deemed to be equal to the target number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company RSU Award, and the corresponding Parent restricted
stock unit award will be subject to the time-based vesting schedule
applicable to such Company RSU Award and will be settled as provided in the
award agreement applicable to such Company RSU Award, subject only to the
continued service of the grantee with the Surviving Corporation, Parent or an
Affiliate through each applicable vesting date (except in the event of an
earlier qualifying terminations of service occurring after the Effective Time
as provided in _Section_ __ _ 5.1(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter_) but
shall not be subject to any performance conditions following the Effective
Time.

(c) _Treatment of Company Stock Options_. As of the Effective Time, each
compensatory option to purchase Company Common Stock (each a "Company Stock
Option") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether
vested or unvested, shall be cancelled without any action on the part of any
holder thereof in consideration for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (but in
no event later than seven (7) Business Days thereafter) in respect of each
Net Option

 



-6-  Share subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, less any applicable withholding or other Taxes or other
amounts required by applicable Law to be withheld. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Net Option Share" means, with respect to a Company Stock Option,

__ the excess, if any, of the value of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) __ the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) __ the value of the Merger
Consideration. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the value the Merger
Consideration that consists of shares of Parent Common Stock shall equal the
product of (x) __ the number of such shares of Parent Common Stock and (y) __
the Parent Stock Price.

 

(d) _Treatment of Company DSU Awards_.

 

(i) As of the Effective Time, each stock unit credited to the account of any
current or former participant under the Rockwell Collins Non-Qualified
Savings Plan, the Amended and Restated Rockwell Collins 2005 Non-Qualified
Retirement Savings Plan or the 2010 Deferred Compensation Plan, as assumed by
the Company, that relates to shares of Company Common Stock (each a "Company
DSU Award") that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
and payable in cash by its terms upon the consummation of the Merger shall be
canceled without any action on the part of any holder thereof in
consideration for the right to receive a lump sum cash payment as promptly as
practicable following the Effective Time (but in no event later than seven (7)
Business Days thereafter) with respect thereto equal to the product of (i) __
the value of the Merger Consideration and (ii) __ the number of shares of
Company Common Stock relating to such Company DSU Award, less any applicable
withholding or other Taxes or other amounts required by applicable Law to be
withheld. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the value of the portion of
the Merger Consideration that consists of shares of Parent Common Stock shall
be equal to the product of (x) __ the number of such shares of Parent Common
Stock and (y) __ the Parent Stock Price.

(ii) As of the Effective Time, each Company DSU Award that is outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time and payable in shares of Company
Common Stock by its terms upon the consummation of the Merger shall be
canceled without any action on the part of any holder thereof in
consideration for the right to receive the Merger Consideration as promptly as

Business Days thereafter) in respect of each share of Company Common Stock
relating to such Company DSU Award, less any applicable withholding or other
Taxes or other amounts required by applicable Law to be withheld.

of Company Common Stock subject to the Company DSU Award immediately prior to
the Effective Time by (B) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, which shall be
settled in cash or shares of Parent Common Stock as provided in the plan
document applicable to such Company DSU Award on the date or dates provided
under the applicable election.

(e) _Company ESPP_. Except to the extent it is otherwise determined by Parent
and communicated to the Company that the Company ESPP should continue in
effect under its current terms, promptly following the date of this Agreement
upon confirmation by Parent prior to such action being taken, the Company
Board (or, if applicable, any committee thereof administering the Company
ESPP) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other necessary actions such
that (i) with respect to any Offering Period (as such term is defined in the
Company ESPP) outstanding as of the date of this Agreement under the Company
ESPP, such Offering Period shall terminate and each Option (as such term is
defined in the Company ESPP) shall be deemed to have been

 



-7-  exercised upon the earlier to occur of (A) the day that is four (4) complete
Trading Days prior to the Effective Time or (B) the date on which such
Offering Period would otherwise end, and no additional Offering Period shall
commence under such Company ESPP after the date of this Agreement; (ii) no
individual participating in the Company ESPP shall be permitted to (A)
increase the amount of his, her or its rate of payroll contributions
thereunder from the rate in effect as of the date of this Agreement, or (B)

contributions to the Company ESPP on or following the date of this Agreement;
(iii) no individual who is not participating in the Company ESPP as of the
date of this Agreement may commence participation in the Company ESPP

(f) _Company Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide
such notice, if any, to the extent required under the terms of the Company
Equity Plans, adopt applicable resolutions, amend the terms of the Company
Equity Plans or any outstanding awards, and take all other appropriate actions
to give effect to the transactions contemplated herein. To the extent such
notice or actions are required, the Company shall provide Parent with
documentation evidencing the completion of the foregoing actions (the form and
substance of such documentation shall be subject to review and approval by
Parent, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) not later than the Business Day preceding the Effective Time.

(g)  _Parent Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take
all actions necessary to reserve for issuance a number of shares of Parent
Common Stock in respect of each Parent restricted stock unit award or Parent
deferred stock unit award granted pursuant to this _Section 2.3_. Effective
as of the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form
S-8, Form S-3 or Form S-1 (or any successor or other appropriate form), as
applicable, with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each
such award and shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the
prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such awards
remain outstanding.

 

Section 2.4 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled
pursuant to this _Article II_.

Section 2.5 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, to the extent that holders of Company Common Stock are
entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and held by a holder who has properly exercised and perfected his or her
demand for appraisal rights under Section __ 262 of the DGCL and not
effectively withdrawn or lost such holders rights to appraisal (the
"Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, but the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be
entitled to receive such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to
Section __ 262 of the DGCL (it being understood and acknowledged that at the
Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist and such holder shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the right to receive
the "fair value" of such Dissenting Shares as determined in accordance with
Section __ 262 of the DGCL); _provided_ that if any such holder shall have
failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his, her or its
right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL (whether occurring before, at or
after the Effective Time), such holders shares of Company Common Stock shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and
such shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. The Company shall
give notice to Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable of any demands for
appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands
and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company
relating to appraisal demands, and Parent shall have the right to participate

 



-8-  in all material discussions with third parties and all negotiations and
Proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to or settle or compromise or offer to settle or
compromise any such demand or Proceeding, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

Section 2.6 _Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights_. After the Effective
Time, there shall be no registration of transfers on the stock transfer books
of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
are presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent for
transfer following the Effective Time, they shall be canceled against delivery
of the applicable Merger Consideration, as provided for in _Section
2.1(a)(iii)_, for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

Section 2.7  _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is determined by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to be
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest
the Surviving Corporation or Parent with full right, title and possession of
and to all rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company with respect to
the Merger, the officers and managers of Parent shall be fully authorized (in
the name of Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and otherwise)
to take such action.

 

ARTICLE III

 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

 

Except as disclosed in (i) the Company SEC Documents filed with (or furnished
to) the SEC by the Company or the Applicable Company Subsidiary on or after
September 30, 2016 and prior to the date of this Agreement (but in each case
excluding any risk factor disclosure contained under the heading "Risk
Factors" (other than any factual information contained therein) or in any
"forward-looking statements" legend or in any similarly non-specific,
cautionary, predictive or forward-looking statements) and to the extent
publicly available on the SECs Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and
Retrieval System ("EDGAR") or (ii) the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company
hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 

Section 3.1 _Organization; Qualification_. Each of the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized and validly existing under
the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, formation or organization,
as applicable, and has the requisite corporate or similar power and authority
to conduct its business as it is now being conducted and to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets in the manner in which its properties and
assets are currently operated, except where the failure to be so validly
existing and authorized (a) __ has not been, and would not reasonably be
expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, materially adverse to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (b) would not reasonably
be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, impair in any material
respect the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or to consummate the Merger, or prevent or materially delay the
consummation of any of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the character or location of the property owned, leased
or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such

Section 3.6 _Company SEC Documents; Financial Statements_.

Subsidiary has timely filed with (or furnished to) the SEC all forms,
reports, schedules, statements, exhibits and other documents (including
exhibits, financial statements and schedules thereto and all other information
incorporated therein and amendments and supplements thereto) required by it to
be filed (or furnished) under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act
(collectively, the "Company SEC Documents"). As of its filing (or furnishing)
date or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of the
last such amendment, each Company SEC Document complied in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the
Securities Act, as the case may be. As of its filing date or, if amended
prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of the last such
amendment, each Company SEC Document filed pursuant to the Exchange Act did
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. Each Company SEC Document that is a registration
statement, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the
Securities Act, as of the date such registration statement or amendment
became effective prior to the date of this Agreement, did not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made therein not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
amendments or modifications to the Company SEC Documents that were required to
be filed with (or furnished to) the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement,
but that have not yet been filed with (or furnished to) the SEC. No
Subsidiary of the Company is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of
the Exchange Act. All of the audited financial statements and unaudited
interim financial statements of the Company and the Applicable Company
Subsidiary included in the Company SEC Documents (i) comply in all material
respects with the applicable accounting requirements and with the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii) have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and except,

Form 10-Q of the Exchange Act) and (iii) fairly present in all material
respects the financial position, the stockholders equity, the results
of operations and cash flows of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries

letters received from the SEC staff with respect to any of the Company SEC
Documents, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, none of the Company SEC
Documents are subject to ongoing SEC review.

designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the
Companys financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in conformity with GAAP. The Company has evaluated the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting and,
to the extent required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable Company
SEC Document that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q or any amendment
thereto its conclusions about the effectiveness of the internal control over
financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by such report or
amendment based on such evaluation. The Company has no "significant
deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" (as such terms are defined in Auditing
Standard No. 5 of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, as in effect
on the date of this Agreement) in the design or operation of internal control
over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information. Since September 30, 2013, there has been and is no fraud,
whether or not material, that involves senior management or other employees
who have a significant role in the Companys internal control over financial
reporting.

(e) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that all
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to
the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications of the chief executive
officer and chief financial officer of the Company required under the Exchange
Act with respect to such reports.

(f) To the Knowledge of the Company, as of the date of this Agreement, there
are no SEC inquiries or investigations, other inquiries or investigations by
Governmental Authorities or internal investigations pending or threatened, in
each case regarding any accounting practices of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any malfeasance by any director or executive officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Since September __ 30, 2015 through the
date of this Agreement, there have been no material internal investigations
regarding accounting, auditing or revenue recognition discussed with,
reviewed by or initiated at the direction of the chief executive officer,
chief financial officer, chief accounting officer or general counsel of the
Company or, to the Knowledge of the Company, the Applicable Company
Subsidiary, the Company Board or any committee thereof, or, to the Knowledge
of the Company, the board of directors of the Applicable Company Subsidiary or
any committee thereof.

 

(g) Each of the principal executive officer of the Company and the principal
financial officer of the Company (or each former principal executive officer
of the Company and each former principal financial officer of the Company, as
applicable) has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or
15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act with respect to the Company SEC Documents, and the statements contained in
such certifications are true and accurate. For purposes of this Agreement,
"principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have
the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Company does
not have, and has not arranged any, outstanding "extensions of credit"
to directors or executive officers within the meaning of Section 402 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

(h) Since September 30, 2015, (i) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written or, to the Knowledge of the Company,

of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or unlawful accounting or auditing
matters with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) no
attorney representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not
employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a
violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
officers, directors, employees or agents to the Company Board or any
committee thereof or to the general counsel

 



-14-  or chief executive officer of the Company pursuant to the rules of the SEC
adopted under Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, except, in each case, as
has not been, and would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in
the aggregate, materially adverse to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole.

 

(i) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate,
on the other hand), including any structured finance, special purpose or
limited purpose entity or Person, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as
defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act), where the
result, purpose or effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or

Section 4.6 _Parent SEC Documents; Financial Statements_.

 

(a) Since December 31, 2016, Parent has timely filed with (or furnished to)
the SEC all forms, reports, schedules, statements, exhibits and other
documents (including exhibits, financial statements and schedules thereto and
all other information incorporated therein and amendments and supplements
thereto) required by it to be filed (or furnished) under the Exchange Act or
the Securities Act (collectively, the "Parent SEC Documents"). As of its
filing (or furnishing) date or, if amended prior to the date of this
Agreement, as of the date of the last such amendment, each Parent SEC Document
complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as the case may be. As of its filing
date or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of the
last such amendment, each Parent SEC Document filed pursuant to the Exchange
Act did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. Each Parent SEC Document that is a registration
statement, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the
Securities Act, as of the date such registration statement or amendment
became effective prior to the date of this Agreement, did not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made therein not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
amendments or modifications to Parent SEC Documents that were required to be
filed with (or furnished to) the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement, but
that have not yet been filed with (or furnished to) the SEC. No Subsidiary of
Parent is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.
All of the audited financial statements and unaudited interim financial
statements of Parent included in Parent SEC Documents (i) comply in all
material respects with the applicable accounting requirements and with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii) have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during
the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and
except, in the case of the unaudited interim statements, as may be permitted
under Form 10-Q of the Exchange Act) and (iii) fairly present in all material
respects the financial position, the stockholders equity, the results of
operations and cash flows of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of
the times and for the periods referred to therein (except as may be indicated
in the notes thereto and subject, in the case of unaudited interim financial
statements, to normal and recurring year-end adjustments).

 

(b) Prior to the date of this Agreement, Parent has furnished to the Company
complete and correct copies of all comment letters from the SEC since
December 31, 2016 through the date of this Agreement with respect to any of
the Parent SEC Documents, together with all written responses of Parent
thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or
unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC staff with
respect to any of Parent SEC Documents, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, none
of Parent SEC Documents are subject to ongoing SEC review.

 

(c) Parent is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable listing
and governance rules and regulations of the NYSE.

(d) Parent maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of Parents financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in conformity with GAAP. Parent has evaluated the effectiveness of Parents
internal control over financial reporting and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, presented in any applicable Parent SEC Document that is a
report on Form 10-K or

 



-32-  Form 10-Q or any amendment thereto its conclusions about the effectiveness
of the internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the
period covered by such report or amendment based on such evaluation. Parent
has no "significant deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" (as such terms are
defined in Auditing Standard No. 5 of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board, as in effect on the date of this Agreement) in the design or operation
of internal control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect Parents ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information. Since December 31, 2013, there has been and is
no fraud, whether or not material, that involves senior management or other
employees who have a significant role in Parents internal control over
financial reporting.

(e) Parent maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that all
information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files
or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to Parents
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications of the chief executive officer and
chief financial officer of Parent required under the Exchange Act with respect
to such reports.

 

(f) To the Knowledge of Parent, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no
SEC inquiries or investigations, other inquiries or investigations by
Governmental Authorities or internal investigations pending or threatened, in
each case regarding any accounting practices of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or any malfeasance by any director or executive officer of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries. Since December 31, 2016 through the date of this
Agreement, there have been no material internal investigations regarding
accounting, auditing or revenue recognition discussed with, reviewed by or
initiated at the direction of the chief executive officer, chief financial
officer, chief accounting officer or general counsel of Parent, the Parent
Board or any committee thereof.

 

(g) Each of the principal executive officer of Parent and the principal
financial officer of Parent (or each former principal executive officer of
Parent and each former principal financial officer of Parent, as applicable)
has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the
Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect
to Parent SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications
are true and accurate. Parent does not have, and has not arranged, any
outstanding "extensions of credit" to directors or executive officers within
the meaning of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

(h) Since December 31, 2016, (i) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received any written or, to the Knowledge of Parent, oral complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim regarding accounting, internal accounting
controls, auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries, or unlawful accounting or auditing matters with
respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) no attorney representing
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a violation of securities Laws,
breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or
agents to the Parent Board or any committee thereof or to the general counsel
or chief executive officer of Parent pursuant to the rules of the SEC adopted
under Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, except, in each case, as has not
been, and would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the
aggregate, materially adverse to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.

 

(i) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Parent and any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate, on the
other hand), including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined
in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act), where the result,
purpose or effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries in Parent SEC

Section 5.3 _Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement; Company
Stockholders Meeting_.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, (i) the Company, (with Parents reasonable cooperation) shall
prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement in preliminary form and (ii)
Parent (with the Companys reasonable cooperation) shall prepare and file with
the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4, in which the Proxy Statement
will be included as a prospectus, in connection with the registration under
the Securities Act of the Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger.
Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (A)
cause the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement to comply with the applicable rules
and regulations promulgated by the SEC, (B) have the Form S-4 declared
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such
filing (including by responding to comments from the SEC), and, prior to
the effective date of the Form S-4, take all action reasonably required to be
taken under any applicable state securities Laws in connection with the
issuance of Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the "Parent
Stock Issuance") and (C) keep the Form S-4 effective through the Closing Date
in order to permit the consummation of the Merger. Each of Parent and the
Company shall furnish all information as may be reasonably requested by the
other in connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and
distribution of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement. As promptly
as practicable after the Form S-4 shall have become effective, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be
mailed to its stockholders. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the
Form S-4 will be made by Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement
to, the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company, in each case without
providing the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
(which comments shall be considered by the applicable party in good faith)
thereon if reasonably practicable; _provided_ that, without limiting _Section
5.9_, with respect to documents filed by a party which are incorporated by
reference in the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement, this right to review and
comment shall apply only with respect to information relating to the other
party or such other partys business, financial condition or results of
operations. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information
relating to Parent or the Company or any of their respective Affiliates,
directors or officers, should be discovered by Parent or the Company which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either the Form S-4 or
the Proxy Statement, so that either such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be prepared and, following a
reasonable opportunity for the other party (and its counsel) to review and
comment on such amendment or supplement, promptly filed with the SEC and, to
the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the
Company. Subject to applicable Law, each party shall notify the other
promptly of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective, of the issuance
of any stop order or suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common
Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of
the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments
or supplements to the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or for additional
information and shall supply each other with copies of all correspondence
between either party or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the
SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement, the
Form S-4 or the Merger. 

(b) Subject to the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 7.1_, the Company shall, as soon as practicable following the
effectiveness of the Form S-4, duly call, set a record date for, give notice
of, convene (on a date selected by the Company in consultation with Parent,
which date shall be within, subject to adjournment or postponement as
provided below, sixty (60) days of the effectiveness of the Form S-4)

 



-41-  and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholders Meeting")
for the purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder Approval, and shall submit
such proposal to such holders at the Company Stockholders Meeting and shall
not submit any other proposal to such holders in connection with the Company
Stockholders Meeting (other than an advisory vote regarding merger-related
compensation and a customary proposal regarding adjournment of the Company
Stockholders Meeting) without the prior written consent of Parent.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company shall not adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting
without Parents prior written consent; _provided_ that without Parents prior
written consent, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders
Meeting (i) after consultation with Parent, to the extent necessary to ensure
that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement or Form S-4 required
by Law is provided to the stockholders of the Company within a reasonable
amount of time in advance of the Company Stockholders Meeting or (ii) if
there are not sufficient affirmative votes in person or by proxy at such
meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholders Meeting or
to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, to allow reasonable additional
time for solicitation of proxies for purposes of obtaining a quorum or the
Company Stockholder Approval, _provided_ that unless agreed to in writing by
Parent, (x) any such adjournment or postponement shall be for a period of no
more than 10 Business Days each, and (y) the Company shall only be permitted
to effect up to two (2) such adjournments or postponements pursuant to this
clause (ii) (in the aggregate); provided, further, that no postponement
contemplated by this clause (ii) shall be permitted if it would require a
change to the record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ ,
further, that, if requested by Parent, the Company shall effect an
adjournment or postponement of the Company Stockholders Meeting under the
circumstances contemplated by this clause (ii) for a period of up to (10)
Business Days each ( _provided_ , that Parent shall only make up to two (2)
such requests, and no such request for a postponement shall be permitted if it
would require a change in the record date for the Company Stockholders
Meeting). If the Company Board has not made a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change in accordance with _Section 5.6_, the Company shall, through the
Company Board, make the Company Recommendation, and shall include such Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, and use its reasonable best efforts to
(A) solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and (B) take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the
Company Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
its terms, the obligations of the parties hereunder shall continue in full
force and effect and such obligations shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company of any Company Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Company Superior
Proposal).

 

Section 5.4 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the parties hereto
will cooperate with each other and use (and will cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to consummate

Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or
that would otherwise prevent or delay the consummation of the transactions

Agreement, including the Merger, and to carry out fully the purposes of this
Agreement. Each of the parties hereto shall, in consultation and cooperation
with the other parties and as promptly as reasonably practicable, make its
respective filings under the HSR Act and any Antitrust Law as set forth on
_Section 6.1(d) of the Parent Disclosure Letter_, and make any other
applications and filings as reasonably determined by the Company and Parent
under other applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, as promptly as practicable, but in no event
later than as required by Law. Neither the Company nor Parent will withdraw
any such filings or applications without the prior written consent of the
other party. Parent shall pay all filing fees and other charges for the
filings required under any Antitrust Law by the Company and Parent.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, without
the prior written consent of Parent, none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates will grant or offer to grant any accommodation or
concession (financial or otherwise), or make any payment, to any third party

(b) In connection with and without limiting the efforts referenced in _Section
5.4(a)_, each of the parties hereto will (i) furnish to the other such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in
connection with the preparation of any governmental filings, submissions or
other documents; (ii) give the other reasonable prior notice of any such
filing, submission or other document and, to the extent reasonably
practicable, of any communication with or from any Governmental Authority
regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and permit the
other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views,
and secure the participation, of the other in connection with any such filing,
submission, document or communication; and (iii) cooperate in responding as
promptly as reasonably practicable to any investigation or other inquiry from
a Governmental Authority or in connection with any Proceeding initiated by a
Governmental Authority or private party, including informing the other party
as soon as practicable of any such investigation, inquiry or Proceeding, and
consulting in advance, to the extent practicable, before making any
presentations or submissions to a Governmental Authority, or, in connection
with any Proceeding initiated by a private party, to any other Person. In
addition, each of the parties hereto will give reasonable prior notice to and
consult with the other in advance of any meeting, conference or substantive
communication with any Governmental Authority, or, in connection with
any Proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, and to the extent

submissions, correspondence and communications between it and its Affiliates
and their respective Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental
Authority or members of any Governmental Authoritys staff (or any other
Person in connection with any Proceeding initiated by a private party), on
the other hand, with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each party may, as it deems advisable and necessary, reasonably
designate material provided to the other party as "Outside Counsel Only
Material," and also may reasonably redact the material as necessary to (A)
remove personally sensitive information, (B) remove references concerning the
valuation of the Company and its Subsidiaries or Parent and its Subsidiaries
conducted in connection with the approval and adoption of this Agreement and
the negotiations and investigations leading thereto, (C) comply with

their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates, shall take any and all

 



-43-  steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority so as to
enable the consummation of the Merger as promptly as practicable, and in any
event prior to the Termination Date, including (i) proposing, negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, or
otherwise, to sell, divest, hold separate, lease, license, transfer, dispose

Parents or any of its Affiliates ability to own or operate any assets,
properties, businesses or product lines of Parent or any of its Affiliates or
any assets, properties, businesses or product lines of the Company or any of
its Affiliates and (ii) in the event that any permanent or preliminary
injunction or other Order is entered or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be
entered in any Proceeding that would make consummation of the Merger unlawful
or that would otherwise prevent or delay consummation of the Merger, taking
any and all steps (including the posting of a bond or the taking of the steps
contemplated by clause (i) above) necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such
injunction or Order; provided, that no party hereto shall be required pursuant
to this _Section 5.4_ to commit to or effect any action that is not
conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Company shall not, unless requested to do so by Parent, commit to
or effect any action contemplated above in this _Section 5.4(d)_.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent is not
required to commit to or effect (A) any sale, divestiture, lease, holding
separate pending a sale or other transfer or disposal or (B) any other
restriction or action contemplated by this  _Section 5.4(d)_ if (I) in the
case of clause (A), such action would require the sale, divestiture, lease,
holding separate pending a sale or other transfer or disposal of any assets,
properties, businesses or product lines of Parent, the Company or any of
their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries representing, in the aggregate,
more than $850,000,000 of annual revenue generated (x) during the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2016 (in the case of assets, properties, businesses or
product lines of Parent or its Affiliates or Subsidiaries), (y) during the
fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 (in the case of assets, properties,
businesses or product lines of the Company or its Affiliates or
Subsidiaries (other than assets, properties, businesses or product lines that
were, prior to the Applicable Company Subsidiary Acquisition Closing, of the
Applicable Company Subsidiary or its Subsidiaries)) or (z) during the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2016 (in the case of assets, properties, businesses
or product lines that were, prior to the Applicable Company Subsidiary
Acquisition Closing, of the Applicable Company Subsidiary or its
Subsidiaries), or (II) in the case of clause (B), such restriction or action,
individually or taken together with all sales, divestitures, leases, holding
separate pending a sale, transfers, disposals and other restrictions and
actions contemplated by this _Section 5.4(d)_, in the aggregate would or
would reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse impact on the
Company, Parent or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, in each case
measured on a scale relative to the size of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (without giving effect to the Merger), or on
the expected benefits to Parent of the Merger (either of clause (I) or clause
(II), an "Unacceptable Condition").

 

(e) Each of the parties agrees that, between the date of this Agreement and
the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 7.1_, it shall not, and shall ensure that none of
their Subsidiaries shall, consummate, enter into any agreement providing for,
or announce, any investment, acquisition, divestiture or other
business combination that would reasonably be expected to materially delay or
prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 5.5 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. The Company shall (and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford reasonable access to Parents
Representatives, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice,
throughout the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time
(or until the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 7.1_), to the personnel, advisors, properties, books and records of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and, during such period, shall (and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to) furnish reasonably promptly to such
Representatives all information concerning the business, properties and
personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and to provide copies thereof,
as may reasonably be requested; _provided_ that nothing herein shall require
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to disclose any information to Parent
or Merger Sub if such disclosure would, in the reasonable judgment of the
Company, (a) violate applicable Law or the provisions of any agreement to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or (b) jeopardize any
attorney-client or other legal privilege; _provided_ , _further_ , that in
each such case, the Company shall cooperate with Parent to enable Parent
and Parents Representatives to enter into appropriate

 



-44-  confidentiality, joint defense or similar documents or arrangements so that
Parent and Parents Representatives may have access to such information. No
investigation or access permitted pursuant to this _Section 5.5_ shall
affect or be deemed to modify any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made by the Company hereunder. All information furnished by the
Company, its Subsidiaries and the Companys officers, employees and other
Representatives pursuant to this _Section 5.5_ shall be kept confidential in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the parties hereby agree and acknowledge that the
standstill and similar restrictions in the Confidentiality Agreement shall not
apply upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement to the extent required
to permit any action contemplated hereby and in accordance herewith and
solely until any valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms.

 

Section 5.6 _No Solicitation by the Company_.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time
and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with  _Section 7.1_,
except as provided in _Section 5.6(b)_ or _Section 5.6(d)_, (i) the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, and its and their respective officers
and directors to, immediately cease, and shall instruct and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective other
Representatives to immediately cease, and cause to be terminated all existing
discussions, negotiations and communications with any Persons or entities with
respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal (other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), (ii) the Company shall not, and shall not
authorize, and shall use its reasonable best efforts not to permit, any of its
Representatives to, directly or indirectly through another Person, (A)
initiate, seek, solicit, knowingly facilitate, knowingly encourage (including
by way of furnishing any non-public information) or knowingly induce or
knowingly take any other action which would reasonably be expected to lead to
a Company Acquisition Proposal, (B) engage in negotiations or discussions
with, or provide any non-public information or non-public data to, any Person
(other than Parent or any of its Representatives) relating to or for the
purpose of encouraging or facilitating, any Company Acquisition Proposal or
grant any waiver or release under any standstill, confidentiality or other
similar agreement (except that if the Company Board determines in good faith
that the failure to grant any waiver or release would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company may waive any such
standstill provision in order to permit a third party to make and pursue a
Company Acquisition Proposal) or (C) resolve to do any of the foregoing, (iii)
the Company shall not provide and shall, within one (1) Business Day of the
date of this Agreement, terminate access of any third party to any data room
(virtual or actual) containing any of information of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and (iv) within one (1) Business Day of the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall demand the return or destruction of all
confidential, non-public information and materials that have been provided to
third parties that have entered into confidentiality agreements relating to a
possible Company Acquisition Proposal with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 5.6(a)_, at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval, if the Company receives a bona fide written
Company Acquisition Proposal from a third party that was not initiated,
sought, solicited, knowingly facilitated, knowingly encouraged, knowingly
induced or otherwise procured in violation of this Agreement, then the Company
may (i) contact the Person or any of its Representatives who has made such
Company Acquisition Proposal solely to clarify the terms of such Company
Acquisition Proposal so that the Company Board (or any committee thereof) may
inform itself about such Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish
information concerning its business, properties or assets to such Person or
any of its Representatives pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with
confidentiality terms that, taken as a whole, are not materially less
favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement
(provided, that if any such confidentiality agreement does not contain
standstill provisions, or contains standstill provisions that are more
favorable to such other Person than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Company shall promptly (and in any case within twenty-four
(24) hours) provide Parent notice thereof and a copy of such provisions, if
any, and upon such notice, the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to be

Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement permitted by
_Section 5.6(b)_) (any action described in the foregoing clauses (i) and
(ii) of this sentence being referred to as a "Company Adverse Recommendation
Change").

(d) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
the Company Board receives a Company Acquisition Proposal that the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, constitutes a Company Superior Proposal
that was not initiated, sought, solicited, knowingly facilitated, knowingly
encouraged, knowingly induced or otherwise procured in violation of this
Agreement, the Company Board may (i) effect a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or (ii) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(c)(ii)_ in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing
for such Company Superior Proposal if, in each case, (A) the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (B) the
Company has notified Parent in writing that it intends to effect a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section 5.6(d)_ or terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_, (C) the Company has

5.6(d)_, the Company shall have discussed and negotiated in good faith and
made the Companys Representatives available to discuss and negotiate in good
faith (in each case to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) with Parents
Representatives

 



-46-  any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so that the failure to take
such action would no longer be inconsistent with the Company Boards
fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to any material term or condition of any Company Superior Proposal
shall require a new notice and a new negotiation period that shall expire on
the later to occur of (I) two (2) days following delivery of such new notice
from the Company to Parent and (II) the expiration of the original four
(4)-day period described in clause (D) above), and (E) no earlier than the
end of such negotiation period, the Company Board shall have determined in
good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, and after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or
modification to this Agreement, that (x) the Company Acquisition Proposal that
is the subject of the notice described in clause (B) above still constitutes a
Company Superior Proposal and (y) the failure to take such action would still
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_
that any purported termination of this Agreement pursuant to this sentence
shall be void and of no force and effect unless the Company shall have paid
Parent the Company Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 7.3(a)_ prior
to or substantially concurrently with such termination.

 

(e) Other than in connection with a Company Superior Proposal (which shall be
subject to _Section 5.6(d)_ and shall not be subject to this _Section
5.6(e)_), prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company
Board may, in response to a Company Intervening Event, take any action
prohibited by clause (i) of _Section 5.6(c)_, only if (i) the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (ii) the
Company has notified Parent in writing that it intends to effect such a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section 5.6(e)_
(which notice shall specify the facts and circumstances providing the basis
of the Company Intervening Event and for the Company Boards determination to
effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in reasonable detail), (iii)
for a period of four (4) days following the notice delivered pursuant to
clause (ii) of this _Section 5.6(e)_, the Company shall have discussed and
negotiated in good faith and made the Companys Representatives available to
discuss and negotiate in good faith (in each case to the extent Parent desires
to negotiate) with Parents Representatives any proposed modifications to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement so that the failure to take such action would no longer be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law
(it being understood and agreed that any material change to the relevant facts
and circumstances shall require a new notice and a new negotiation period that
shall expire on the later to occur of (A) two (2) days following delivery of
such new notice from the Company to Parent and (B) the expiration of the
original four (4)-day period described above in this clause (iii)), and (iv)
no earlier than the end of such negotiation period, the Company Board shall
have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, and after considering the terms of any
proposed amendment or modification to this Agreement, that the failure to
take such action would still be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from (i) disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated
by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from
issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its
position thereunder, or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that the failure of the Company Board to make such disclosure
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ that (A) in no event shall this _Section 5.6(f)_ affect the
obligations specified in _Section 5.6(d)_ or _5.6(e)_ (or to the
consequences thereof in accordance with this Agreement) or the definition of
Company Adverse Recommendation Change and (B) any such disclosure (other than
issuance by the Company of a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication
of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) that
addresses or relates to the approval, recommendation or declaration of
advisability by the Company Board with respect to this Agreement or a Company
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change unless the Company Board in connection with such communication publicly
states that its recommendation with respect to this Agreement has not changed.

 



-47- Section 5.7 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities, including advancement of expenses, for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of
the current or former directors or officers of the Company (the "DandO
Indemnified Parties") as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, the
Bylaws or any indemnification Contract between such directors or officers and
the Company (in each case, as in effect on, and, in the case of any
indemnification Contracts, to the extent made available to Parent prior to,
the date of this Agreement) shall survive the Merger and shall continue in
full force and effect. For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses equivalent to the provisions of the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time and
shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any DandO Indemnified
Parties; _provided_ that all rights to indemnification in respect of any
claim made for indemnification within such period shall continue until the
disposition of such action or resolution of such claim. From and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall guarantee and stand surety for, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to honor, in accordance with their respective terms,
each of the covenants contained in this _Section 5.7_.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of or after the
Effective Time to, purchase a six (6)-year prepaid "tail" policy, with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than
the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance, with respect
to matters arising on or before the Effective Time (including in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions or actions contemplated by this
Agreement), and Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force
and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be
honored by the Surviving Corporation, and no other party shall have any
further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance hereunder; _provided_
that the Company shall not pay, and the Surviving Corporation shall not be
required to pay, in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the
Company prior to the date of this Agreement in respect of such "tail" policy.
If the Company or the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such
"tail" insurance policies prior to, as of or after the Effective Time, Parent
shall, for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the current policies of directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained
by the Company with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective
Time; _provided_ that after the Effective Time, Parent shall not be required
to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by
the Company prior to the date of this Agreement in respect of the coverage
required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as
much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount.

 

(c) The covenants contained in this _Section 5.7_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the DandO Indemnified Parties
and their respective heirs and shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which any such Person is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract
or otherwise.

 

(d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors or
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.7_.

 

Section 5.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Subject to applicable Law, the
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt
notice to the Company, of (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of

 



-48-  any event whose occurrence or non-occurrence, as the case may be, would
reasonably be expected to cause, in the case of the Company, any condition
set forth in _Section 6.2_ not to be satisfied, or in the case of Parent,
any condition set forth in _Section 6.3_ not to be satisfied, at any time
from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, (b) any notice or
other communication received by such party from any Governmental Authority in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or from any Person alleging that the consent
of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, if the subject matter of
such notice or other communication or the failure of such party to obtain such
consent would reasonably be expected to be material to the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent and (c) any claims, investigations or
Proceedings commenced or, to such partys Knowledge, threatened in writing
against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party
(including its board of directors) or any of its Subsidiaries that relate to
this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no
such notification shall, in and of itself, affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties hereunder.

 

Section 5.9 _Public Disclosure_. So long as this Agreement is in effect,
neither Parent, nor the Company, nor any of their respective Affiliates, will
disseminate any press release or other public announcement or disclosure
concerning this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, except as may be required by Law or the rules of a
national securities exchange or to the extent disclosed in or consistent with
the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4, without the prior consent of each of the
other parties hereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. The parties have agreed to the text of the joint
press release announcing the execution of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (a) without prior consent of the other parties, each party may
disseminate information substantially consistent with information included in
a press release or other document previously approved for external
distribution by the other parties, or is otherwise not subject to such
approval, in each case, pursuant to the first sentence of this _Section 5.9_,
and (b) this _Section 5.9_ shall not apply to (i) any press release or other
public announcement or disclosure in connection with any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change effected by the Company Board in accordance with this
Agreement or (ii) any press release or other public announcement or disclosure
by the Company or Parent of any information concerning this Agreement, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement in connection
with a determination by the Company in accordance with _Section 5.6(b)_ or
_Section 5.6(d)_ that a Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or may
constitute, a Company Superior Proposal or any dispute between the parties
regarding this Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , that in the case of either of clauses (i) or (ii), to
the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, the disclosing party gives the
other party reasonable advance notice of (including the contents of) its
intended release, announcement or disclosure.

 

Section 5.10 _Employee Benefits; Labor_.

 

(a) For purposes of this _Section 5.10_, (i) the term "Covered Employees"
shall mean employees who are actively employed by or on a legally protected
or approved leave of absence from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) the term "Continuation
Period" shall mean the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on
the first anniversary of the Effective Time.

(b) Except as set forth on _Section 5.10(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter_
or where applicable Law or the provisions of a Labor Agreement require more
favorable treatment, during the Continuation Period, Parent shall, or shall
cause a Subsidiary of Parent to, provide to the Covered Employees for so long
as such Covered Employees remain employees of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries during the Continuation Period, compensation (such term to
include salary or base rate of compensation, annual cash bonus opportunities,
commissions and severance) and benefits that are substantially comparable in
value, in the aggregate, to the compensation (excluding any retention, change
of control, transaction or similar bonuses) and benefits (excluding any
defined benefit pension plan but including any retiree medical and life
insurance benefits) being provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries to
Covered Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



-49- (c) In the event any Covered Employee first becomes eligible to participate
under any Parent Benefit Plan following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or
shall cause a Subsidiary of Parent to use commercially reasonable efforts to
(i) waive any preexisting condition exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to any Covered
Employee under any Parent Benefit Plan providing medical, dental or vision
benefits to the same extent such limitation would have been waived or
satisfied under any similar Company Benefit Plan the Covered Employee
participated in immediately prior to coverage under the Parent Benefit Plan;
and (ii) provide each Covered Employee with credit for any copayments, out-
of-pocket requirements and deductibles paid prior to the Covered Employees
coverage under any Parent Benefit Plan during the plan year in which such
Covered Employee first becomes eligible to participate under such Parent
Benefit Plan, to the same extent such credit was given under any similar
Company Benefit Plan that Covered Employee participated in immediately prior
to coverage under the Parent Benefit Plan, in satisfying any applicable co-
payment, deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under the Parent Benefit
Plan for the plan year in such Covered Employee first becomes eligible to
participate under such Parent Benefit Plan.

(d) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall recognize, or shall cause a
Subsidiary of Parent to recognize, all service of each Covered Employee prior
to the Effective Time, to the Company (or any predecessor entities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries) for vesting and eligibility purposes (but
not for benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit pension plan) and
for purposes of determining future vacation accruals and severance amounts to
the same extent as such Covered Employee received, immediately before the
Effective Time, credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan
in which such Covered Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective
Time; _provided_ that service of each Covered Employee prior to the Effective
Time shall not be recognized for the purpose of any entitlement to participate
in, or receive benefits with respect to, any (i) non-elective employer
contributions under any plan of Parent under Section 401(k) of the Code, (ii)
Parent retiree medical program in which any Covered Employee participates
after the Effective Time or (iii) any Parent Benefit Plan that is
grandfathered or frozen or for which similarly situated employees of Parent
and its Affiliates do not receive service credit. In no event shall anything
contained in this _Section 5.10_ result in any duplication of benefits for
the same period of service.

 

(e) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to perform the Companys
obligations under the agreements set forth on  _Section 5.10(e) of the
Company Disclosure Letter_.

(f) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall use reasonable best efforts
to satisfy all legal or contractual requirements to provide notice to, or
carry out any consultation procedure with, any employee or groups of employees
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any labor or trade union, labor
organization or works council, which is representing any employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(g) The Company shall amend the Rockwell Collins Master Trust  Deferred
Compensation and Non-Qualified Savings and Non-Qualified Pension Plan (the

Rockwell Collins Non-Qualified Pension Plan, the Rockwell Collins Deferred
Compensation Plan, the Rockwell Collins 2005 Non-Qualified Retirement Savings
Plan, the Rockwell Collins 2005 Non-Qualified Pension Plan, and the Rockwell
Collins 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan to the extent necessary to (i) remove
any funding obligation that would otherwise be triggered by the Merger, (ii)
cause the grantor trust governed by the Trust Agreement to remain revocable
following the Closing, and (iii) to remove any provisions requiring the
appointment of a third party administrator as a result of the Merger.

(h) No later than thirty (30) days following the execution of this Agreement
(provided that Parent shall consider in good faith any reasonable request by
the Company for extension of such period by up to thirty (30) days), the
Company shall provide Parent with copies of all material documents embodying
and relating to each material Foreign Plan, including the Foreign Plan
document, all amendments thereto and all related trust documents, the most
recent summary plan description, the most recent actuarial valuation report,
and the most recent tax return filing, in each case, to the
extent applicable.

 



-50- (i) No later than sixty (60) days following the execution of this Agreement
(provided that Parent shall consider in good faith any reasonable request by
the Company for extension of such period by up to thirty (30) days), the
Company shall provide Parent with copies of all Labor Agreements.

 

(j) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this _Section 5.10_ with respect to employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties
hereto and shall not create any right (i) in any other Person, including
employees, former employees, any participant or any beneficiary thereof, in
any Company Benefit Plan, or (ii) to continued employment with the Company,
Parent or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates. Notwithstanding
anything in this _Section 5.10_ to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement,
whether express or implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other
modification of any Company Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit plans
of the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates
or shall prohibit Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates from
amending or terminating any employee benefit plan.

 

Section 5.11 _Merger Sub_. Parent will take all actions necessary to (a)
cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to
consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement
and (b) ensure that Merger Sub prior to the Effective Time shall not conduct
any business, incur or guarantee any Indebtedness or make any investments,
other than incident to its obligations under this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.12 _Rule 16b-3 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
the Company shall take all such steps as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable (to the extent permitted under applicable Law and no-action letters
issued by the SEC) to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) or
acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company
or will become subject to such reporting requirements with respect to Parent,
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

Section 5.13 _Treatment of Existing Debt_. If requested in writing by Parent

use reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent prior to the Closing Date, an
executed copy of a customary payoff letter from the administrative agent under

Agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent relating to
the repayment in full of all obligations thereunder and the termination of all
commitments in connection therewith.

Section 5.14 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection
with the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official

Section 5.15 _Financing and Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things reasonably necessary to consummate the Financing or any
Substitute Financing in an amount sufficient, together with cash on hand,
amounts available to be drawn on the Parent Revolving Credit Facilities, and
any other committed financing that replaces or supplements the Financing
consistent with the terms set forth in this _Section 5.15_, to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby no later than the
Closing, including, to the extent necessary to consummate the Merger and such
other transactions, using reasonable best efforts to (i) (A) maintain in
effect the Debt Letters and in all material respects comply with all of their
respective obligations thereunder and (B) negotiate, enter into and deliver
definitive agreements with respect to the Financing reflecting the terms
contained in the Debt Letters (or with other terms agreed by Parent and the
Financing Parties, subject to the restrictions on amendments of the

 



-51-  Debt Letters set forth below), so that such agreements are in effect no
later than the Closing, and (ii) satisfying on a timely basis all the
conditions to the Financing and the definitive agreements related thereto
that are in Parents (or its Subsidiaries) control. In the event that all
conditions set forth in _Sections 6.1_ and _6.2_ have been satisfied or waived
or, upon funding of the Financing, shall have been satisfied or waived,
Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts
to cause the Persons providing the Financing (the "Financing Parties") to fund
on the Closing Date the Financing, to the extent the proceeds thereof are
required to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby. Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, as the same shall become due
and payable, all fees and other amounts under the Debt Letters.

(b) Parent will keep the Company reasonably informed on a timely basis of the
status of Parents efforts to obtain the Financing and to satisfy the
conditions thereof, including providing copies of any amendment, modification
or replacement of the Debt Letters (which may be redacted in a customary
manner) and shall give the Company prompt notice of any fact, change, event
or circumstance that is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a material adverse impact on the Financing necessary for the
satisfaction of all of Parents obligations under this Agreement, including
the payment of the Cash Consideration portion of the Merger Consideration and
all fees and expenses to be incurred in connection therewith. Parent may
amend, modify, replace, terminate, assign or agree to any waiver under the
Debt Letters without the prior written approval of the Company, provided,
that Parent shall not, without the Companys prior written consent, permit any
such amendment, replacement, modification, assignment, termination or waiver
to be made to, or consent to any waiver of, any provision of or remedy under
the Debt Letters which would (i) reduce the aggregate cash amounts of the
Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original
issue discount) unless the aggregate amount of the Financing following such
reduction, together with cash on hand, amounts available to be drawn on the
Parent Revolving Credit Facilities and other financial resources of Parent on
the Closing Date, is sufficient to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby (it being understood that any such
reduction in such amounts in accordance with the terms of such Debt Letter
shall be permitted) or (ii) impose new or additional conditions to the
Financing or otherwise expand, amend, modify or waive any of the conditions
to the Financing in a manner that in any would reasonably be expected to (A)
materially delay or make less likely the funding of the Financing (or
satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing) on the Closing Date, (B)
materially adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights
against the Financing Parties or any other parties to the Debt Letters or the
definitive agreements with respect thereto or (C) materially adversely affect
the ability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to timely consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby; provided, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may modify, supplement or amend the Debt
Letters to (1) add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents
or similar entities that have not executed the Debt Letters as of the date of
this Agreement and (2) implement or exercise any "market flex" provisions
contained in the Debt Letters. In the event that new commitment letters
and/or fee letters are entered into in accordance with any amendment,
replacement, supplement or other modification of the Debt Letters permitted
pursuant to this  _Section 5.15_, such new commitment letters and/or fee
letters shall be deemed to be the "Debt Letters" for all purposes of this
Agreement and references to "Financing" herein shall include and mean the
financing contemplated by the Debt Letters as so amended, replaced,
supplemented or otherwise modified, as applicable. Parent shall promptly
deliver to the Company copies of any termination, amendment, modification,
waiver or replacement of the Debt Letters. If funds in the amounts set forth
in the Debt Letters, or any portion thereof, become unavailable, Parent shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event (x) notify the Company in writing thereof and (y)
use reasonable best efforts to obtain substitute financing, including, as
applicable, a commitment to provide such substitute financing (on terms and
conditions that are not materially less favorable to Parent, taken as a
whole, than the terms and conditions as set forth in the Debt Letters, taking
into account any "market flex" provisions thereof) sufficient, together with
cash on hand, amounts available to be drawn on the Parent Revolving Credit
Facilities and other financial resources of Parent on the Closing Date, to
enable Parent and its Subsidiaries to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms hereof
(the "Substitute Financing") and, promptly after execution thereof, deliver
to the Company true, complete and correct copies of the new commitment letter
and the related fee letters (in redacted form removing only the fee
amounts, pricing caps, the rates and amounts included in the "market flex")
or related definitive financing documents with respect

 



-52-  to such Substitute Financing. Upon obtaining any commitment for any such
Substitute Financing, such financing shall be deemed to be a part of the
"Financing" and any commitment letter for such Substitute Financing shall be
deemed to be the "Debt Letters" for all purposes of this Agreement.

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.4_, prior to the Closing,
the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives to,
on a timely basis, upon the reasonable request of Parent, provide reasonable
cooperation in connection with any debt or equity financing in connection with

Agreement and the fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment
bankers, experts and consultants, incurred by Parent and Merger Sub in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in an amount not to exceed $50,000,000 (the "Parent Expenses");
provided that any payment of the Parent Expenses shall not affect Parents
right to receive any Company Termination Fee otherwise due under _Section
7.3(a)_, but shall reduce, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, any Company
Termination Fee that becomes due and payable under _Section 7.3(a)_.

 



-60- (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
parties agree that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
Parents right to receive payment from the Company of the Company Termination
Fee pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_ and/or the right to receive payment of the
Parent Expenses pursuant to  _Section 7.3(b)_, shall, in circumstances in
which the Company Termination Fee or Parent Expenses (as applicable) are
payable hereunder and are paid in full, constitute the sole and exclusive
monetary remedy (other than (i) in the event of fraud or an intentional
breach by the Company of this Agreement and (ii) Parents right,
notwithstanding having received the Parent Expenses, to receive the Company
Termination Fee less the Parent Expenses in the circumstances expressly
contemplated in _Section 7.3(a)_) of Parent and Merger Sub against the
Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or
future general or limited partners, stockholders, members, managers,
directors, officers, employees, agents, Representatives or assignees
(collectively, the "Company Related Parties") for all losses and damages
suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder
or otherwise, and upon payment of such amounts when so payable, none of the
Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (except that the Company shall also be obligated with
respect to any amounts owing pursuant to _Section 7.3(e)_).

 

(e) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and (ii) without these agreements, the parties would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay the
Company Termination Fee or the Parent Expenses pursuant to this  _Section
7.3_ and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that
results in a judgment against the Company for the payment of the Company
Termination Fee or the Parent Expenses set forth in this _Section 7.3_,
the Company shall pay Parent its costs and expenses in connection with such
suit (including reasonable attorneys fees), together with interest on such
amount at an annual rate equal to the prime rate as published in _The Wall
Street Journal_  in effect on the date such payment was required to be made
through the date such payment was actually received, or such lesser rate as is
the maximum permitted by applicable Law.

 

Section 7.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of
the parties hereto in writing at any time before or after receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , that after the Company Stockholder
Approval has been obtained, there shall not be any amendment that by
applicable Law or in accordance with the rules of any stock exchange requires
further approval by the stockholders of the Company or Parent, as applicable,
without such further approval of such stockholders nor any amendment or change
not permitted under applicable Law; provided further that no amendment to or
waiver of any of _Section 7.4, 8.8(c)_, _8.9_ , _8.11(c)_ , _8.13_ and _8.15_
(collectively, the "Financing Source Party Provisions") that is materially
adverse to the Financing Source Parties shall be effective without the
written consent of the Financing Source Parties.

Section 7.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
subject to applicable Law, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b)
waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance with any agreement or condition contained herein. Any such
extension or waiver shall only be valid if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

Section 8.4 _Interpretation; Certain Definitions_.

 

(a) The parties have participated collectively in the negotiation and drafting
of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
collectively by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provisions of this Agreement.

(b) The words "hereof," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and "herewith" and
words of similar import shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to
any particular provision of this Agreement. References to articles, sections,
paragraphs, exhibits, annexes and schedules are to the articles, sections
and paragraphs of, and exhibits, annexes and schedules to, this Agreement,
unless otherwise specified, and the table of contents and headings in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the phrase "without limitation." Words describing the
singular number shall be deemed to include the plural and vice versa, words
denoting any gender shall be deemed to include all genders, words denoting
natural persons shall be deemed to include business entities and vice versa
and references to a Person are also to its permitted successors and assigns.
The term "or" is not exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the
extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends,
and such phrase shall not mean simply "if." The phrases "the date of this
Agreement" and "the date hereof" and terms or phrases of similar import shall
be deemed to refer to September 4, 2017, unless the context requires
otherwise. References to any information or document being "made available"
or "furnished" (other than to the SEC) and words of similar import shall
include such information or document having been posted to the online data
room hosted on behalf of the Company by Merrill Corporation at
https://us1.merrillcorp.com/bidder/index_frame.do?projectId=226117 and such
documents that have been filed as exhibits to the Company SEC Documents, in
each case, prior to the date of this Agreement. Terms defined in the text of
this Agreement have such meaning throughout this Agreement, unless otherwise
indicated in this Agreement, and all terms defined in this Agreement shall
have the meanings when used in any certificate or other document made or
delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. Any Law defined
or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to
herein shall mean such Law as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented, including (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable
successor Laws ( _provided_ that for purposes of any representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement that are made as of a specific date or
dates, references to

 



-63-  any statute shall be deemed to refer to such statute, as amended, and to any
rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, in each case, as of such date).
All references to "dollars" or "$" refer to currency of the United States.
For the purposes of this Agreement, to the extent any provision of this
Agreement refers to the Company and/or its Subsidiaries or otherwise any
Subsidiaries of the Company, such references shall include the Applicable
Company Subsidiary, and as of or in the context of any time or period of time
prior to the Applicable Company Subsidiary Acquisition Closing, such
references shall include the Applicable Company Subsidiary and its
Subsidiaries as of and/or during such time or period; provided that KLX and
its Subsidiaries shall not be included in any reference to the Company and/or
its Subsidiaries for purposes of this Agreement.

 

Section 8.5 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the Merger be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

 

Section 8.6 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto, except that Merger Sub may assign any or
all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to one or more direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent, or a combination thereof so
long as such assignment would not delay, impair or prevent consummation of the
Merger or otherwise have a Parent Material Adverse Effect and Parent
continues to remain liable for all of such obligations as if no such
assignment had occurred. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement
will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns. Any
attempted assignment in violation of this _Section 8.6_ shall be null and
void.

 

Section 8.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the exhibits,
annexes and appendices hereto), together with the Confidentiality Agreement,
the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter, constitutes
the entire agreement, and supersedes all other prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them,
with respect to the subject matter hereof.

Section 8.8 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended
to and shall not confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any
rights or remedies hereunder; _provided_ that it is specifically intended that
(a) the DandO Indemnified Parties (solely with respect to _Section 5.7_ and
this _Section 8.8_ from and after the Effective Time), (b) from and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Equity
Awards (solely with respect to _Article II_) and (c) the Financing Source
Parties (solely with respect to the Financing Source Party Provisions) are
each intended third-party beneficiaries hereof.

 

Section 8.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all Proceedings (whether
based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the
negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement hereof, shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of laws provision or
rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware, except that, notwithstanding the foregoing, subject in all respects
to the provisions of any other agreement (including any commitment letter or
definitive agreement relating to any Financing) between any Financing
Source Party and any Party hereto, all matters relating to any action or
claim against any Financing Source Party, and all matters relating to the
interpretation, construction, validity and enforcement (whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort, or otherwise) against any of the Financing
Source Parties in anyway relating to the Debt Letters or the performance
thereof or the Financing, shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York.

 



-64- Section 8.10 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that any party hereto does not perform the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of it hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties
acknowledge and agree that, prior to any termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 7.1_, the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

 

Section 8.11 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto hereby, with respect to any legal claim or
Proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (i) expressly and irrevocably submits, for itself and with
respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any appellate court
therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery
declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal
court within the State of Delaware), (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to
deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for
leave from any such courts, (iii) agrees that it will not bring any claim or
Proceeding relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement except in such courts and (iv) irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent it may legally and effectively do so, and agrees not to assert, by way
of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any claim or Proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that a final and
nonappealable judgment in any Proceeding shall be conclusive and may
be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by Law.

(b) Each party irrevocably consents to the service of process in any claim or
Proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect
hereof brought by any other party hereto made by mailing copies thereof by
registered or certified United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt
requested, to its address as specified in or pursuant to _Section 8.3_ and
such service of process shall be sufficient to confer personal jurisdiction
over such party in such claim or Proceeding and shall otherwise constitute
effective and binding service in every respect.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each party
agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim,
cross-claim or third party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or
in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing
Source Parties in any way relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing or the performance
thereof, in any forum other than any state or Federal court sitting in the
county of New York.

 

Section 8.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, all of which shall together be considered one and the same
agreement. Delivery of an executed signature page to this Agreement by
electronic transmission shall be as effective as delivery of a manually signed
counterpart of this Agreement. 

Section 8.13 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF

 



-65-  OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, MERGER SUB OR THE
COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF
(INCLUDING ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING AGAINST THE FINANCING SOURCE PARTIES
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, THE
FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES WITH RESPECT THERETO).

 

Section 8.14 _Certificates_. In executing any certificate or other
documentation in connection with this Agreement, directors, officers and
employees of Parent and the Company are acting in their corporate capacities
and are not assuming personal liability in connection therewith.

 

Section 8.15 _Waiver of Claims Against Financing Source Parties_. The Company
agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that none of the Financing
Source Parties shall have any liability to the Company or its Affiliates
(other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
financing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether at law
or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and that neither the Company nor
any of its Affiliates (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) will have any
rights or claims against any Financing Source Parties under this Agreement and
any other agreement contemplated by, or entered into in connection with, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any commitments by the
Financing Source Parties in respect of financing the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section
8.15_ shall modify or alter the rights of Parent under any commitment letter,
engagement letter or definitive financing document in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement between or among Parent and any of
its Subsidiaries and any Financing Source Party entered into in
connection with or as contemplated by this Agreement, and in the event of a
conflict between the foregoing and any provision in any commitment letter,
engagement letter or any such definitive financing documentation, as
applicable, the provisions of such commitment letter, engagement letter or
definitive financing documentation, as applicable, shall govern and control.
