**_ARTICLE  VII_**

 

 

**_SURVIVAL;  INDEMNIFICATION_**

representations, warranties, covenants,  obligations and agreements of the
Parties contained in this Agreement shall  survive the Closing for a period
of eighteen (18) months; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that in  the case of
claims arising out of breaches of the representations and warranties  set
forth in Sections 3.1(f), (g) (as to the first sentence only), (l) and 
(v),  such representations and warranties shall survive the Closing for a
period  of  thirty six (36) months; _provided_ ,  _further_ ,  that in 
the case of claims arising out of breaches of the representations and
warranties  set forth in Sections 3.1(a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) and Sections
3.2(a) and  (c),  such representations and warranties shall not expire. In
the event notice of  any  claim for indemnification under Sections 7.2 or
7.3 has been given prior to  the  foregoing expiration dates, the
representations and warranties and covenants  that are subject of such
indemnification claim shall survive with respect to  such claim until the
final disposition thereof.

 

 

7.2 **_Indemnification  by Buyer_**.  Upon  the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, from and  after the Closing, Buyer
shall indemnify, defend and hold Seller, its  Affiliates, and their
respective directors, officers, representatives, employees  and agents (and

that may be incurred by Seller resulting or arising from or related  to, or

covenant, obligation or agreement made by Buyer contained in this  Agreement.

 

 

7.3 **_Indemnification  by Seller_** **.**   Upon the  terms and subject to

that  may be incurred by Buyer resulting or arising from, related to or
incurred  in  connection with any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, obligation  or agreement made by Seller contained in this
Agreement.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-33-  

 

 

 

 

 


 

7.4 **_Limitations  on Indemnification_** **. ** Seller  shall not be
required to indemnify, defend or hold Buyer harmless from and  against any
Losses under Section 7.3 unless and until the aggregate amount  of  such
Losses (each of which individually exceeds $10,000) equals One Percent 
(1%)  of the Closing Purchase Price (the " _Floor_ "),  in  which event
Seller shall be obligated to indemnify Buyer solely for Losses  incurred by
Buyer in excess of the Floor, and only up to ten percent (10%)  of  the
Closing Purchase Price (the " _Cap_ "),  as  set forth more fully in
Sections 7.5(c)(ii)(C) and (D) and in the Indemnity  Escrow Agreement.

 

 

7.5 **_Method  of Asserting Claims_** **.**

 

 

(a) _Notice  of Claims; Time for Claims_.  In the  event that Buyer wishes
to make a claim for Losses under Section 7.3 (a  _" Claim"_),  Buyer  shall
give a written notice (a _" Notice  of Claim"_)  to  Seller and the Escrow
Agent (to the extent the Indemnity Escrow Agreement  remains in full force
and effect at the time such Notice of Claim is made).  The  Notice of Claim
shall (i) describe the nature of the Claim being made and (ii)  if known,
state the aggregate dollar amount of such Claim (and if not known,  estimate
to the extent reasonably practical the aggregate dollar amount of  such 
Claim; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  any disputes in respect of such
amount that Buyer and Seller cannot resolve  between themselves shall be
resolved in accordance with Section 9.2). If  such notice relates to any
claim or potential claim or the commencement of  any  action, suit or legal,
administrative or arbitral proceedings or investigation  before or by any
individual, corporation, governmental authority or other entity  other than
Buyer (a _" Third  Party Claim"_)  which  could give rise to a Loss, Buyer
shall give Seller and the Escrow Agent written  notice describing the Third
Party Claim within thirty (30) days of receipt  of  actual notice of such
Third Party Claim (or such shorter period as is reasonably  practical and may
be warranted under the circumstances (e.g., in the case of  emergency
proceedings or when a response to a notification must be given within  a
period in order to avoid a forfeiture of rights)) to permit Seller to
exercise  its rights hereunder. Whether the Notice of Claim relates to a
direct Claim  or a  Third Party Claim, Buyer's failure to notify in the
manner set forth herein  shall not affect any of its rights hereunder, but
Seller shall be obligated  to  Buyer only up to that amount of the Losses
which would not have been increased  but for Buyer's failure to give timely
notice.

 

 

(b) _Defense  of Third Party Claims_.

 

 

(i) From  and  after the delivery of a Notice of Claim in respect of a Third
Party Claim,  and  until such time as it is determined or agreed that Seller
has no liability  to  Buyer in respect thereof, Seller shall have the right
(but not the obligation)  to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim and
to retain (at Seller's  expense) counsel of its choice, reasonably acceptable
to Buyer, to represent  Buyer, _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  this
option shall not be available to Seller for Third Party Claims (i) which  may
result in criminal proceedings, injunctions or other equitable remedies  in 
respect of Buyer or its Affiliates or (ii) also involves Seller or its 
Affiliates as a party and counsel to Seller determines in good faith that
joint  representation would give rise to a conflict of interest, for which
defense  shall be assumed by Buyer with the right to retain (at Seller's
expense) counsel  of its choice, reasonably acceptable to Seller. Seller
shall have twenty (20)  days from the receipt of the Notice of Claim to
notify Buyer whether or not  it  desires to defend such Third Party Claim
failing which Seller shall be deemed  to  have waived such option and be
responsible for costs and fees incurred by Buyer  for defense of such Third
Party Claim. The Party assuming defense of a Third  Party Claim is
hereinafter referred to as the _" Controlling  Party"_  and the  other
Party as the _" Co-Defendant"_.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-34-  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(ii) In  defending the Third Party Claim, the Controlling Party shall act in
good faith  and use commercially reasonable means and defenses available to
it given due  consideration to the interests of Buyer. The Co-Defendant shall
take such  actions as reasonably necessary or appropriate under the
circumstances to  cooperate with the Controlling Party and its counsel in
defending such Third  Party Claim. The Controlling Party shall keep the Co-
Defendant reasonably  informed of the development of the underlying claim. In
the case where the  Buyer  is the Co-Defendant, the Co-Defendant shall have
the right to participate,  at  its sole cost and expense in the defense of a
Third Party Claim using its own  counsel (unless (x) the Controlling Party
shall not have employed counsel in  the  defense of such Claim after ten
(10) days notice; or (y) such Co-Defendant  shall  have determined in good
faith that joint representation would give rise to  a  conflict of interest,
and in either of the foregoing events such fees and  expenses shall be borne
by the Controlling Party).

 

 

(iii) Other  than settlements, compromises or agreements involving solely
monetary payment  obligations (in any amount in respect of settlement,
compromises or agreements  being made by Seller, and in any amount under Ten
Thousand US Dollars (USD  10,000) in respect of those being made by Buyer),
neither the Co-Defendant  nor  the Controlling Party shall conclude any
settlements, compromises, agreements  or  withdrawals in response to any
claims, verifications, or legal or administrative  proceedings in which it
may be involved without the prior written consent of  the  other party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, in particular  with respect
to the settlement of disputes with customers, for which customary  practice
and the commercial relationship shall be taken into account and  involving
the assets, business or operations of the Company.

 

 

(c) _Objection  to Notice of Claim; Payment_.

 

 

(i) If  Seller  wishes to object to a Claim or Third Party Claim made in a
Notice of Claim,  Seller shall give a written objection (an _" Objection"_) 
to the  Escrow Agent (to the extent the Indemnity Escrow Agreement remains in
full  force  and effect at the time such Objection is made) and Buyer within
fifteen (15)  Business Days after receipt of such Notice of Claim expressing
such Objection  and explaining in reasonable detail and in good faith the
basis thereof. Buyer  and Seller shall meet within fifteen (15) Business Days
following receipt by  Buyer of Seller's Objection to agree on the rights of
the respective parties  with respect to each of such Claim or Third Party
Claim. If Seller and Buyer  should reach an agreement, a memorandum setting
forth such agreement shall  be  prepared and signed by both parties and if
need be shall be furnished to the  Escrow Agent. If Buyer and Seller do not
reach such an agreement within such  fifteen (15) Business Day period, then
the matter shall be resolved in  accordance with Section 9.2.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-35-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) Subject  to Sections 7.4, 7.6 and 7.7, the payment of any sum due or
payable by  Seller under this Article VII will be made:

 

 

(A) in  connection with a Third Party Claim, no later than fifteen (15)
Business Days  (a) after expiry of such fifteen (15) Business Day period set
forth in  Section 7.5(c)(i) if Seller fails to respond to the relevant Notice
of  Claim, (b) after a final non appealable award against Buyer has been
rendered,  (c) after final settlement of a Notice of Claim has been reached,
as determined  by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller in accordance with 
Section 7.5(c)(i) or (d) after Seller is determined to be under the 
obligation to pay the relevant Loss as resolved between Buyer and Seller 
pursuant to Section 9.2;

 

 

(B) in  connection with a direct Claim, no later than fifteen (15) Business
Days (a)  after expiry of such fifteen (15) Business Day period set forth
in  Section 7.5(c)(i) if Seller fails to respond to the relevant Notice of

Section 7.5(c)(i) or (c) after Seller is determined to be under the 
obligation to pay the relevant Loss as resolved between Buyer and Seller 
pursuant to Section 9.2;

 

 

_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the relevant payments shall be made:

 

 

(C) first,  until the expiration of the Indemnity Escrow Agreement and in
accordance with  the terms thereof, by the Escrow Agent to Buyer in cash
credited from the Escrow  Account (as defined in the Indemnity Escrow
Agreement) in the amount of such  Loss incurred by Buyer; and

 

 

(D) second,  following the expiration of the Indemnity Escrow Agreement, or
if the Losses  exceed in whole or in part the Escrow Amount (only to the
extent Seller's  liability in respect of such Loss is not subject to the
limitations set forth  in  Section 7.4), by Seller to Buyer in the amount of
such Loss incurred by Buyer  which cannot be discharged through payment made
by the Escrow Agent. 

 

 

7.6 **_Duty  to Mitigate_** **.**   Buyer  shall take all commercially
reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss that it may  incur, including making
and diligently pursuing such claims as may be reasonably  justified against

particular insurance.

7.7 **_Tax  Effect of Indemnification Payments; Insurance_** **.**

 

 

(a) Any  Tax  or other Loss for which indemnification is provided under this
Agreement shall  be reduced (at the time and in the manner discussed in
Section 7.7(b)) by  any actual Tax Benefit arising from the payment of the
claim that gave rise  to  Seller making an indemnity payment. If Buyer
realizes any such Tax Benefit,  directly or indirectly, then Buyer shall pay
an amount to Seller equal to the  Tax Benefit realized, provided that in the
event an amount payable by Seller  is  reduced by the amount of such Tax
Benefit and there is a disallowance of such  Tax Benefit by a taxing
authority (based upon a reasonable and good faith  determination by Buyer)
such that Buyer is not entitled to all or any portion  of  such Tax Benefit,
then Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount of the Tax Benefit  that was
disallowed. For  purposes of this Agreement, the term _" Tax  Benefit"_ 
means the  amount of the reduction in the liability for Taxes (including
through recoveries  of Taxes through the carryover of net operating losses or
reductions in Taxes  attributable, in whole or in part, to basis adjustments)
as a result of the  payment or accrual by any Person of any loss, expense,
other amount or  tax.

 

 

(b) A  Tax  Benefit will be considered to be realized for purposes of this
Section 7.7  on (A) the date on which the Tax Benefit is received as a refund
of Taxes,  or  (B) to the extent that the Tax Benefit is not received as a
refund of Taxes  but rather is claimed as an item that reduces liability for
Taxes (on a with  and  without basis), the due date (including extensions)
of the Tax Return that  reflects such change in liability for Taxes.

 

 

(c) In  determining the amount of a Loss there shall also be deducted from
the amount  to  be paid an amount equal to the proceeds from third parties,
including insurance  proceeds, and interest thereon received directly by
Buyer or received by a  third  party (such as a claimant, vendor or lender)
in respect of such  matter.

 

 

7.8 **_Purchase  Price Adjustments_** **.**   Any  indemnification payment
made pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as  an  adjustment to the
Purchase Price for all Tax purposes.

a  deposit to cover the failure of the satisfaction of the condition
precedent  in  Section 6.1(m). If Buyer's shareholders do not approve the
transactions  described herein as set forth in Section 3.2(a)(i), then no
later than twenty  four (24) hours thereafter, Buyer and Seller shall execute
and deliver to the  Escrow Agent a written statement instructing the Escrow
Agent to release to  Seller the Deposit, without condition. If the Closing
