insurance policies that currently provide the SUSA Group coverage for various matters are not transferable and will be cancelled by their terms at Closing. To assist Purchaser and Investor A in arranging for the continuation of insurance coverage
for the Self Storage Business and the Properties following the Closing Date, Seller will use good faith, commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate discussions between Seller&#146;s existing insurers and the Purchaser and Investor A with respect
to the continuation of insurance following the Closing and/or the issuance of new or replacement policies. Such assistance shall consist of: (i)(x) permitting Purchaser and Investor A to participate in the process of renewing all insurance policies
of Seller and SUSA related to the Self Storage Business and the Properties that are scheduled to expire on June 15, 2005, (y) using commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be included in such renewal policies (I) a provision that permits a
change of control of New SUSA and the Self Storage Business to Purchaser and Investor A without causing the termination of such insurance policies and (II) a premium schedule that provides Investor A with the option of adding its existing self
storage properties to such policies and (z) negotiating a shortened policy period or an extended policy period, as the case may be, such that the terms of such renewal policies coincide with the existing policy periods of Investor A&#146;s current
