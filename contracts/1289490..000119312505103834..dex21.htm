-v- PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT



This PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of May 5,
2005, is entered into by and among Security Capital Self Storage
Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (" _Seller_ "), on the one hand, and
Extra Space Storage LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Purchaser A_
"), PRISA Self Storage LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("
_Purchaser B_ "), PRISA II Self Storage LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (" _Purchaser C_ "), PRISA III Self Storage LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (" _Purchaser D_ "), VRS Self Storage LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (" _Purchaser E_ "), WCOT Self Storage LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (" _Purchaser F_ "), (collectively on a
several basis, together with their designees permitted pursuant to this
Agreement, " _Purchaser_ "), Extra Space Storage LP, a Delaware limited
partnership (" _Investor A_ " and, collectively with Purchaser, the "
_Purchaser Parties_ ") and The Prudential Insurance Company of America, a New
Jersey corporation (" _Investor B_ "), on the other hand. The terms used in
this Agreement are defined in _Exhibit A_.



RECITALS:



A. Seller, directly and indirectly through SUSA Partnership, L.P., a Tennessee
limited partnership (" _SUSA_ "), and its other Subsidiaries is engaged in
the business of owning, managing, developing, marketing, leasing, franchising,
financing and operating a portfolio of self storage facilities described on
_Exhibit B_ as such  _Exhibit B_ may be amended to reflect Dropped Properties
or Properties which otherwise cease to be included in the Transfer in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Exhibits hereto (the "
_Properties_ ") and certain associated ancillary businesses (collectively,
the " _Self Storage Business_ ").



B. Seller desires to sell to Purchaser (or Purchasers designees) all of its
Interests in New SUSA, SUSA Management, Inc., SUSA Finance Corp., Storage USA
Franchise Corp., SUSA Kentucky, Inc., Storage USA, L.L.C., Storage USA Stone
Mountain LLC, and SUSA Holdings LP, as described in _Section 1.4_ (each such
entity, a " _Purchased Entity_ ," and the interests therein, collectively, the
" _Purchased Interests_ "), and Purchaser desires to purchase and acquire
from Seller the Purchased Interests, in each case as more particularly
provided on _Exhibit C_.



C. Immediately prior to the consummation of the Transfer pursuant to this
Agreement, Seller will cause SUSA to consummate certain
restructuring transactions (collectively, the " _Restructuring_ ") pursuant
to which, among other things, (1) SUSA will (i) form a wholly-owned subsidiary
limited liability company (" _New SUSA_ ") and (ii) transfer and contribute to
New SUSA or wholly-owned subsidiaries of New SUSA substantially all of SUSAs
interests in the partnerships, corporations and/or other entities, properties
or assets held by SUSA immediately prior to such contribution (as described in
_Exhibit C_ and the Reorganization Agreement by and between SUSA and New
SUSA, the form of which is attached as _Exhibit D_ hereto (the "
_Reorganization Agreement_ ")) in exchange for all of the membership interests
in New SUSA and the assumption of the obligations and liabilities of SUSA
incurred through the time of such contribution, excluding the senior unsecured
debt of SUSA, all as set forth in _Exhibit C_ and the Reorganization Agreement
(collectively, the " _Contribution Transaction_ "), and (2) SUSA will
distribute on a pro rata basis to the partners of SUSA all of the membership
interests in New SUSA, as described in _Exhibit C_ and the Reorganization
Agreement (the " _Distribution Transaction_ "). D. Concurrently with the consummation of the Transfer pursuant to this
Agreement, Investor A will purchase for cash or will exchange for units of
limited partner interest in Investor A, the interests in New SUSA received by
the Outside Partners pursuant to the Distribution Transaction who elect to
sell or exchange their interests, as more particularly described herein,
which purchase and exchange will be subject to and close concurrently with the
Closing hereunder.



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties and covenants contained herein, the parties hereto hereby agree
as follows:



I. PURCHASE OF INTERESTS AND PROPERTIES



1.1 _Contribution Transaction_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in _Exhibit C_ and the Reorganization Agreement, Seller shall cause
SUSA to consummate the Contribution Transaction immediately prior to the
Closing hereunder.



1.2 _Distribution Transaction_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in _Exhibit C_ and the Reorganization Agreement, Seller shall
consummate the Distribution Transaction immediately following consummation of
the Contribution Transaction. In the Distribution Transaction, holders of
common units in SUSA will receive one unit of New SUSA in exchange for each
common unit in SUSA held by them.



1.3  _Offers to Purchase or Exchange New SUSA Interests_.



(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, Seller shall
cause SUSA to convey an offer by Investor A to the Outside Partners to
exchange the interests in New SUSA that they shall receive pursuant to the
Reorganization Agreement for either (i) cash in an amount per common unit in
New SUSA equal to the Adjusted Exchange Value (the " _Purchase Offer_ ") or
(ii) with respect to Eligible Outside Partners, a number of common units of
limited partner interest in Investor A (" _OP Units_ ") per common unit in
New SUSA equal to the Adjusted Exchange Value divided by the Average Closing
Price (the " _Exchange Offer_ " and together with the Purchase Offer, the "
_LP Offer_ "). The " _Average Closing Price_ " of the OP Units shall mean the
average of the closing prices on the New York Stock Exchange of shares of
common stock of Extra Space Storage Inc. as reported in _The Wall Street
Journal_ for each of the ten consecutive Trading Days in the period ending
three Trading Days prior to the Closing Date. " _Trading Day_ " shall mean a
day on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading. Outside Partners
who do not timely and properly accept the LP Offer in accordance with the
procedures outlined below shall retain their interests in New SUSA that they
shall receive pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement. " _Eligible Outside
Partner_ " means an Outside Partner who, in Investor As reasonable judgment,
qualifies as an "accredited investor" within the meaning of Regulation D under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), based on
Investor As review of such Outside Partners responses to the Consideration
Election Form and such other customary matters as may be reasonably taken into
account by Investor A. No fractional OP Units shall be issued to any Eligible
Outside Partner in the Exchange Offer. Instead, the number of OP Units to be
issued to each Outside Partner in the Exchange Offer shall be rounded to the
nearest whole number of OP Units, with one-half of the OP Unit being rounded
up to a whole OP Unit.



 

-2- (b) The OP Units to be issued in the Exchange Offer shall not be redeemable by
the holders thereof for a period of one-year following the date of the
closing of the Exchange Offer. Outside Partners shall be offered the
opportunity to enter into a registration rights agreement (the " _Registration
Rights Agreement_ ") covering the resale by them of shares of common stock
issued by Extra Space Storage Inc. upon redemption of such OP Units, in the
mutually agreed upon form. The Registration Rights Agreement shall require
Extra Space Storage Inc. to use commercially reasonable efforts to file a
shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission no
later than one year after the date of such agreement and shall otherwise be in
a form that is substantially similar to the registration rights agreement,
dated as of August 17, 2004, among Extra Space Storage Inc. and the persons
listed on Schedule 1 thereto.



(c) The LP Offer shall be conveyed to the Outside Partners through a mailing
by Seller, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, of
certain disclosure documents which shall consist of a Transaction Information
Statement (the " _Transaction Information Statement_ ") and a Confidential
Private Offering Memorandum of Investor A (the " _Confidential Private
Offering Memorandum_ " and, together with the Transaction Information
Statement, the " _Offer Documents_ "). The Offer Documents shall be mailed to
Outside Partners as a single package and shall be accompanied by the
Consideration Election Form and such other documents that Seller and
Investor A determine are reasonably required to enable the Outside Partners
to consider, accept or reject the Purchase Offer and for Eligible Outside
Partners to consider, accept or reject the Exchange Offer.



(d) The Transaction Information Statement shall be prepared by Seller,
as soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, and shall be
subject to the prior review, comment and consent of Investor A (not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Transaction Information Statement shall
consist of information relating to the Self Storage Business, the terms of
this Agreement, the terms of the Restructuring, including the Contribution
Transaction and the Distribution Transaction, the reasons that Seller has
undertaken the transaction and entered into this Agreement, the eligibility
requirements for participation in the Exchange Offer, a description of the LP
Offer, a comparison of the interests in New SUSA and its operating agreement
to the existing SUSA units and the SUSA operating agreement, and such other
information (including tax disclosure reasonably acceptable to both Seller and
Investor A) customarily included in disclosure documents of this nature (other
than information designated for inclusion in the Confidential
Offering Memorandum) that Seller and Investor A reasonably determine to
include in such Transaction Information Statement. The Transaction Information
Statement shall also include, to the extent reasonably available at the time
of mailing, income statements of SUSA for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 2004, and for the quarterly periods ended March 31,
2004 and 2005, a balance sheet of SUSA as of December 31, 2003 and 2004 and a
balance sheet of SUSA as of March 31, 2005. Seller agrees that (i) all of
such financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied
on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
in the notes thereto, or, in the case of the unaudited statements, as
permitted by Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act) and shall
fairly present, in accordance with applicable requirements of GAAP (subject,
in the case of the unaudited statements, to normal, recurring adjustments,
none of which are material) consistent with past practices, the results of
operations and the consolidated financial position of SUSA and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, for their respective periods and as of their
respective dates and (ii) the annual income statements and the year end
balance sheets shall be accompanied by the audit report of KPMG. Seller shall
arrange for KPMG to consent to the inclusion of all of such financial
statements and such reports in the Transaction Information Statements.



 

-3- (e) The Confidential Private Offering Memorandum shall be prepared by Investor
A, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof and shall be
subject to the prior review, comment and consent of Seller and Investor B (not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Confidential Private Offering
Memorandum shall include or incorporate by reference information relating to
the business of Investor A, the eligibility requirements for participation in
the LP Offer, a description of the LP Offer, a comparison of the interests in
New SUSA and its operating agreement to the OP Units and the partnership
agreement of Investor A, a description of the capital stock and related
matters of Maryland law relating to Extra Space Storage Inc., the
qualification of Extra Space Storage Inc. as a REIT for federal income tax
purposes and such other information customarily included in disclosure
documents of this nature (other than information designated for inclusion in
the Transaction Information Statement) as Seller and Investor A reasonably
determine to include in such Confidential Offering Memorandum. The
Confidential Private Offering Memorandum shall also include or incorporate by
reference, to the extent reasonably available at the time of mailing,
financial statements of Extra Space Storage Inc. and its predecessor for each
of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2004, and for the
quarterly periods ended March 31, 2004 and 2005, a balance sheet of Extra
Space Storage Inc. and its predecessor as of December 31, 2003 and 2004 and a
balance sheet of Extra Space Storage Inc. and its predecessor as of March 31,
2005. Investor A agrees that (i) all of such financial statements shall be
prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto, or, in the
case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X
under the Exchange Act) and shall fairly present, in accordance with
applicable requirements of GAAP (subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal, recurring adjustments, none of which are material)
consistent with past practices, the results of operations and the consolidated
financial position of Extra Space Storage Inc. and its subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, for their respective periods and as of their respective dates. In
addition, the Confidential Private Offering Memorandum shall include pro forma
financial statements of Extra Space Storage Inc., giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the financing required
for such transactions. Such pro forma financial statements shall consist of
pro forma income statements for the annual period ended December 31, 2004 and
the quarterly period ended March 31, 2005 and a pro forma balance sheet as of
December 31, 2004 and March 31, 2005. Seller shall make available to Investor
A unaudited combined financial statements of the portions of the Self Storage
Business not currently included in SUSA to be used by Investor A in the
preparation of the foregoing pro forma financial statements of Investor A for
the year ending on December 31, 2004 and the quarterly period ending on March
31, 2005 and to be included in the Confidential Private Offering Memorandum.



(f) The parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other in the preparation
of the Offer Documents.



(g) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Investor A shall prepare a Consideration Election Form in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Seller (the " _Consideration Election Form_
"), pursuant to which, among other things, (i) each Outside Partner will (A)
certify as to whether such Outside Partner qualifies as an "accredited
investor" under the Securities Act, (B) have the option to elect to receive
either cash or  



 

-4-  OP Units in exchange for such Outside Partners interest in New SUSA, it
being understood that only Eligible Outside Partners will have the right
to elect to receive OP Units, and (C) have the right to revoke elections made
in the Consideration Election Form by following the procedures specified
therein, (ii) each Eligible Outside Partner who elects to receive OP Units
will agree to become bound by the partnership agreement of Investor A and the
Registration Rights Agreement and (iii) each Eligible Outside Partner who
elects to receive OP Units and who is currently subject to a Tax Protection
Agreement under which it has the right, which has not expired, to be
allocated liabilities for federal income tax purposes to elect either (x) to
enter into a special loss allocation and deficit restoration obligation ("
_DRO_ ") with respect to its OP Units or (y) to enter into a guarantee or
indemnity (" _Guaranty Agreement_ ") that is enforceable under applicable
state law on a "bottom dollar" basis (whether individually or as part of a
group of partners) of either recourse indebtedness of Investor A or non-
recourse indebtedness of Investor A secured by assets, that initially shall
have a value equal to at least three times the aggregate amount of all "bottom
dollar guarantees" of such indebtedness by other partners and at least
133% of the principal amount of indebtedness secured by such assets. The
aggregate guaranteed amount under the Guaranty Agreements shall not exceed $20
million. Each Guaranty Agreement will be in effect for the time and subject to
the conditions that would have applied under such Eligible Outside Partners
applicable Tax Protection Agreement and will terminate the existing Tax
Protection Agreement with respect to debt allocations for such electing
Eligible Outside Partner.



(h) An Outside Partner desiring to receive cash or OP Units in the LP
Offer shall accept the LP Offer by properly completing and executing the
Consideration Election Form and returning it to Investor A prior to 5:00 p.m.,
Salt Lake City Time, on the twentieth (20th) Business Day after the mailing of
the Offer Documents and the Consideration Election Form to Outside Partners as
specified in _Section 1.3(c)_ or such later date as may be specified in the
Offer Documents with the Agreement of Investor A (the " _Offer Expiration
Time_ "). If an Outside Partner fails to return a duly completed Consideration
Election Form prior to the Offer Expiration Time, such Outside Partner shall
be deemed to have agreed to remain as a holder of interests in New SUSA.
Seller and Investor A by mutual agreement shall have the right to make rules,
not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing the validity of
the Consideration Election Form and the issuance and delivery of the cash
consideration or OP Units pursuant to the LP Offer. Investor A shall, in its
reasonable discretion, determine whether a Consideration Election Form has
been properly completed, signed and submitted or revoked.



(i) Investor A covenants and agrees that, concurrently with the Closing, it
will admit each Eligible Outside Partner who validly elects to receive OP
Units as a limited partner of Investor A. Investor A will, concurrently with
the Closing, (i) issue OP Units to each Eligible Outside Partner
participating in the Exchange Offer in an amount equal to 95% of a number of
OP Units equal to the product of the estimated Adjusted Exchange Value (based
on the Price Adjustments taken into account in determining the Estimated
Purchase Price) times the number of units in New SUSA received by such
Eligible Outside Partner in the Distribution Transaction divided by the
Average Closing Price, (ii) pay to Outside Partners electing to participate
in the Purchase Offer an amount of cash equal to 95% times the product of the
estimated Adjusted Exchange Value (determined as provided above) times the
number of units in New SUSA received by such Eligible Outside Partner in the
Distribution Transaction and (iii) execute and deliver to such Eligible
Outside Partners the Registration Rights Agreement and a DRO election or
Guaranty Agreement. In addition, Investor A will, within five business days
after the SUSA Adjustment  



 

-5-  Amount is finally determined, issue the balance, if any, of additional OP
Units to which Eligible Outside Partners participating in the Exchange Offer
are entitled after the final determination of the SUSA Adjustment Amount and
pay over the balance of any cash consideration to which Outside Partners
participating in the Purchase Offer are entitled after the final determination
of the SUSA Adjustment Amount. Eligible Outside Partners participating in the
Exchange Offer shall be entitled to distributions from Investor A beginning
with the first regular Investor A distribution payment date occurring after
the Closing (pro rated for the partial first period) with respect to any OP
Units actually issued to them as of such distribution payment date. Investor A
agrees that it will, within five business days after any additional OP Units
are issued to Eligible Outside Partners as a result of the final
determination of the SUSA Adjustment Amount, make an additional distribution
to such Eligible Outside Partners in an amount equal to the total of the
distributions that would have been payable with respect to such additional OP
Units had they been outstanding as of the Closing.



(j) Seller and Investor A shall reasonably cooperate with each other with
respect to the matters set forth in this _Section 1.3_ and intend that the
offer of OP Units shall be conducted as a private placement, exempt from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act. Without limiting the
foregoing and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Investor A shall not be obligated to consummate the Exchange Offer
and the closing of the Exchange Offer shall not be a condition to the closing
of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, if, in the written opinion
of outside counsel to Investor A, the private placement exemption under
Regulation D under the Securities Act is not available for the
Exchange Offer. In such event, Eligible Outside Partners electing to receive
OP Units shall instead retain their interests in New SUSA.



(k) Each of Extra Space Storage Inc. and Investor A agrees that it will not
file after the date hereof and prior to the Offer Expiration Time
a registration statement relating to the offer and sale of shares of common
stock or units of limited partnership interest, as the case may be, or any
other security, the registration statement relating to which could reasonably
be determined to render unavailable for the Exchange Offer the private
placement exemption under Regulation D under the Securities Act, unless it
first obtains a written opinion from its outside counsel that the filing of
such registration statement will not render unavailable the private placement
exemption under Regulation D under the Securities Act with regard to the
Exchange Offer.

(a) Subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
other agreements contemplated hereby, at the Closing, Seller shall sell,

any, of the excess of the Estimated Net Assets over the Target Amount or (y)
decreased by the amount, if any, of the excess of the Target Amount over the

(ii) If the sale of a Property set forth on _Schedule 5.1(f)(i)_ (other than
Properties #541 and #634) is consummated after the date hereof but before the

decreased by the Adjustment Amount for such Property.

the Properties.



 

-7- (vii) The Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be decreased by the amount of credit
to which Purchaser is entitled pursuant to _Section 7.2_ , if any.



(viii) The Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be increased by the Adjustment

(ix) The Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be decreased by an amount equal to
the product of the Adjusted Exchange Value multiplied by the number of units

Transaction; provided that, for purposes of this clause (ix), the Adjusted
Exchange Value shall be calculated based on the Price Adjustments known on
the Closing Date.



(x) If Seller and SUSA are added as additional insureds to the environmental
insurance policies pursuant to _Section 5.22_ , the Unadjusted Purchase Price
shall be decreased by the amount, if any, equal to the increase in the
premium paid by the Purchaser Parties in relation thereto.



(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any of the Price Adjustments
arise from or out of any facts, circumstances, conditions or events that
overlap, there shall be no duplication of counting toward the calculation of
any such Price Adjustments.



(d) Price Adjustments shall not be limited by, applied against or otherwise
impact any limitations, deductibles, thresholds or maximum amounts relating to
indemnification obligations for Losses contained elsewhere in this Agreement.



1.6 _Payment of Estimated Purchase Price_.



At the Closing, the Purchaser Parties shall pay to Seller an amount equal
to the Estimated Purchase Price, in immediately available funds by wire
transfer to an account(s) designated by Seller, which account(s) must be
designated in a writing delivered to Purchaser at least two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date. 



1.7 _Closing Net Assets Adjustment_.



(a) _Estimated Net Assets Statement_. Not later than the tenth (10th)
Business Day prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a
statement (the " _Estimated Net Assets Statement_ ") setting forth Sellers
estimate of Net Assets as of 11:59 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on the last day
of the second (2nd) calendar month preceding the Closing Date (" _Estimated
Net Assets_ "). The Estimated Net Assets Statement shall be prepared using the
accounting principles set forth in the Balance Sheet Principles and shall be
based upon Sellers review of the financial information then available to it.



(b) _Closing Net Assets Statement_. As promptly as practicable, and in any
event prior to the later of (i) the date that is sixty (60) calendar
days after the Closing Date or (ii) September 30, 2005, Purchaser shall
deliver or cause to be delivered to Seller (i) a combined statement of assets
and liabilities of the Majority Subsidiaries on a consolidating basis as of
the Adjustment Time (the  



 

-8-  " _Closing Date Balance Sheet_ "), prepared using the Balance Sheet
Principles, and (ii) a statement setting forth Purchasers calculation of
Closing Net Assets prepared using the Balance Sheet Principles (the " _Closing
Net Assets Statement_ ").



(c) _Review of Closing Net Assets Statement_. Within thirty (30) calendar days
after the delivery to Seller of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and
the Closing Net Assets Statement (the " _Seller Review Period_ "), Seller
shall notify Purchaser of its agreement or disagreement with the Closing Net
Assets Statement. If Seller in good faith disagrees with Purchasers
determination of Closing Net Assets, Seller may deliver to Purchaser, prior
to the expiration of the Seller Review Period, a notice (the " _Seller
Objection Notice_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail (i) the items or
amounts with which Seller disagrees and the basis for such disagreement and
(ii) Sellers proposed corrections to the Closing Net Assets Statement
(collectively, the " _Seller Objection_ "). If Seller does not deliver a
Seller Objection Notice within the Seller Review Period, Seller shall be
deemed to agree in all respects with the Closing Net Assets Statement and the
items and amounts reflected thereon shall be final and binding upon Purchaser
and Seller.



(d) _Review by Accountants_. If a Seller Objection Notice is properly and
timely delivered and Purchaser and Seller are unable to resolve any
disagreement between them with respect to the determination of Closing Net
Assets within thirty (30) calendar days after delivery of a Seller Objection
Notice, Purchaser and Seller shall, within fifteen (15) calendar days after
the end of such 30-day period, cause Deloitte and Touche LLP (or, if they are
unable or unwilling to serve, a firm of accountants of nationally recognized
standing reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser and Seller) (the "
_Accountants_ ") to promptly review this Agreement and the disputed items or
amounts in the Closing Net Assets Statement for the purpose of resolving such
dispute. In performing their review, the Accountants shall apply the Balance
Sheet Principles and determine the accurate application of the Balance Sheet
Principles to only those items or amounts in the Closing Net Assets Statement
as to which Seller has, in the Seller Objection Notice, disagreed and such
other issues as may reasonably be affected by the items to which Seller has so
disagreed. The Accountants shall be required to deliver to Purchaser and
Seller, as promptly as practicable, but no later than thirty (30) calendar
days after the Accountants are engaged, a written report setting forth their
resolution and, if applicable, their calculation of the disputed items or
amounts. In no event shall the Accountants determination result in Closing
Net Assets that is greater than that set forth in the Seller Objection Notice
or less than that set forth in the Closing Net Assets Statement. Purchaser and
Seller shall promptly comply with all reasonable requests by the Accountants
for information, books, records and similar items.



Upon delivery of the Accountants report, such report and the calculations
set forth therein shall be final and binding upon Purchaser and Seller absent
manifest error, and in connection with such Accountants report, no party
shall seek recourse to the courts, other tribunals or venues pursuant to this
Agreement or otherwise, other than to collect any amounts due under this
_Section 1.7_ or to resolve disputes regarding manifest error in such
Accountants report. The cost of such review and report shall be split
equally by Purchaser on the one hand and Seller on the other hand.



(e)  _Cooperation_. Each of Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate and assist
each other, in each case in all reasonable respects, in the preparation of the
Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Net Assets Statement and in the
conduct of the reviews referred to in this _Section 1.7_ ,  



 

-9-  including (i) Purchaser making available to the extent reasonably necessary
or helpful books, records, workpapers and personnel of the Self-Storage
Business, and (ii) Seller making available to the extent reasonably necessary
or helpful books and records of Seller (as they relate to the Self-Storage
Business).



(f) _Final Payment_. Within three (3) Business Days after the calculation of
Closing Net Assets becoming final pursuant to _Section 1.7(c)_ or  _Section
1.7(d)_ , as applicable, (i) Purchaser shall pay to Seller, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to account(s) designated by Seller pursuant to
_Section 1.6_ , an amount equal to the amount, if any, by which Closing
Net Assets (as finally determined pursuant to _Section 1.7(c)_ or _Section
1.7(d)_ , as applicable) exceeds the Estimated Net Assets, together with
interest thereon at the Applicable Rate from and including the Closing Date
to, but excluding, the date of such payment, or (ii) Seller shall pay to
Purchaser, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a single account
designated in writing by Purchaser, an amount equal to the amount, if any, by
which the Estimated Net Assets exceeds the Closing Net Assets (as finally
determined pursuant to _Section 1.7(c)_ or _Section 1.7(d)_ , as applicable),
together with interest thereon at the Applicable Rate from and including the
Closing Date to, but excluding, the date of such payment.



1.8 _Effect of Closing_. If the Closing occurs, for all legal, accounting and
tax purposes, the Closing will be deemed to be effective as of the Adjustment
Time.



1.9 _Debt Guaranties_. At the Closing, following the purchase of the Purchased
Interests, Investor A shall purchase the notes guaranteed by the Outside
Partners and referred to in _Section 4(d)_ of _Exhibit C_ from Seller for an
amount equal to the aggregate outstanding principal balance of such notes
(which amount is included within the Unadjusted Purchase Price).



II. INSPECTION AND TITLE MATTERS



2.1 _Purchaser Parties  Inspections and Due Diligence_.

 



(a) Prior to the date hereof the Purchaser Parties have conducted and after
the date hereof will continue to conduct their title, survey, environmental,
physical, and structural examinations, inspections, testing, studies and
investigations of the Properties (collectively, the " _Due Diligence_
"), subject to the terms and conditions of this _Article II_. The Due
Diligence is at the Purchaser Parties sole cost and expense. Notwithstanding
the continuation of the Due Diligence, the Purchaser Parties shall have no
right to terminate this Agreement except as provided in _Article IX_.



(b) Seller shall (i) provide the Purchaser Parties and their lenders,
contractors, consultants and representatives (the " _Representatives_ ") with
reasonable access, during normal business hours, upon at least two (2)
Business Days prior notice to Seller, to all personnel, officers, employees,
agents, accountants, Core Properties and facilities of the Core Subsidiaries
and the books and records relating to the Core Subsidiaries and/or the Self
Storage Business and (ii) furnish the Purchaser Parties and their
Representatives with all such information and data (including copies of
Contracts and other books and records) concerning the Core Subsidiaries and
operations of the Self Storage Business as the Purchaser Parties or any of
such Representatives reasonably may request in connection with such
investigation; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such  



 

-10-  inspections or tests will not unreasonably disrupt or disturb (i) the
ongoing operation of the Core Properties; (ii) any services to the Core
Properties or the Self Storage Business; or (iii) the quiet possession of any
Tenants. In no event will the Purchaser Parties be permitted to perform any
intrusive physical inspections or tests or any Phase II environmental
inspection of any Core Property without Sellers prior written consent.
Seller shall have the right to have a representative present during any of the
Purchaser Parties or the Representatives visits to or inspections of any
Properties. The Purchaser Parties may request any and all publicly available
information about the Properties from Governmental Entities but will not
disclose to any Governmental Entity (unless required by Law) the results of
any inspection, sampling or testing conducted at any Property
without Sellers prior written consent. The Purchaser Parties and all
Representatives shall, in performing the Due Diligence, comply with the
procedures set forth in this Agreement and with any and all Laws applicable to
the Properties and will not engage in any activities that would violate any
Licenses, Leases and Permits or Laws. The Purchaser Parties and any
Representatives shall: (A) promptly pay when due the costs of all entry and
inspections and examinations done with regard to the Properties and (B)
restore the Properties to the condition in which the same were found before
any such entry upon the Properties and inspection or examination was
undertaken, but in no event later than ten (10) calendar days after such
damage occurs.



(c) The Purchaser Parties may not communicate or conduct interviews with any
employee, lender, partner or joint venturer of any Seller Person or any Tenant
without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Purchaser Parties may communicate with those employees of the Core
Subsidiaries that are designated by Seller, but such communication shall be
solely for the purpose of performing the Due Diligence contemplated herein. If
Seller does consent to any such interviews of employees, lenders, partners,
or joint venturers or Tenants, such interviews shall not unreasonably disrupt
or disturb (i) the on-going operation of the Core Properties, the Seller
Persons, or the Self Storage Business, (ii) any services to the Core
Properties, or (iii) the quiet possession of any Tenants under the Leases.
Seller will have the right to have a representative present at all times
during any interviews with any such employee, lender, partner, joint venturer
or Tenant.



2.2 _Due Diligence Indemnity_. The Purchaser Parties shall keep the
Properties free from all Liens and defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the
Seller Persons from and against all claims, actions, losses, liabilities,
damages, costs and expenses, whether arising out of injury or death to
persons or damage to any real or personal property, including any property of
Tenants or otherwise and including but not limited to, reasonable attorneys
fees and costs incurred, suffered by, or claimed against any Seller Person
caused by (i) the entry by any Purchaser Party or Representative upon the
Properties and any Due Diligence activities, including the costs of
remediation, restoration and other similar activities, mechanics and
materialmens liens and attorneys fees, arising out of or in connection with
the Due Diligence; and (ii) any breach of _Section 2.1_ by either Purchaser
Party or any Representative or any of their respective partners, directors,
officers, agents, members, shareholders, attorneys or representatives. The
provisions of this _Section 2.2_ shall survive the Closing or any termination
of this Agreement, and shall not be subject to any limitation of liability set
forth herein.



 

-11- 2.3 _Title Matters_.



(a) _Ordering Title Commitments and Surveys_. Prior to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, Seller has delivered or made available to the
Purchaser Parties or their respective counsel, for each Core Property
(excluding Core Properties subject to Building Leases) copies of: (i) the most
recent title insurance policy, commitment, or pro forma, whether owners or
lenders, if any, in Sellers possession (each, an " _Existing Policy_ " and
collectively, the " _Existing Policies_ "), and (ii) the most recent survey,
if any, in Sellers possession (each, an " _Existing Survey_ " and
collectively, the " _Existing Surveys_ "). The Purchaser Parties at their
expense have ordered, or promptly following the date hereof will order, from
First American Title Insurance Company, Chicago Title Insurance Company or,
if applicable, the title insurance company that issued the applicable Existing
Policy (together, the " _Title Company_ "), and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Title Company to deliver to the Purchaser
Parties counsel no later than May 31, 2005: (A)(1) title insurance
commitment(s) obligating the Title Company to issue for each Core Property an
owners title policy (or leasehold policy, as applicable) with a copy of all
exception documents set forth therein or (2) "date-downs" of Existing Policies
with respect to certain of the remaining Core Properties (collectively,
together with any updates thereto, the " _Title Commitments_ ") and (B)(1)
updates to the Existing Surveys and/or (2) new surveys for certain of the Core
Properties (collectively, together with any updates thereto, the " _Surveys_
").



(b) _The Purchaser Parties  Objections_. On or before (i) with respect to any
Core Property for which an initial Title Commitment and Survey have been
received by the Purchaser Parties or their respective counsel prior to the
date of this Agreement, the date that is ten (10) Business Days following the
date of this Agreement and (ii) with respect to any Core Property for which
an initial Title Commitment and Survey have not been received by the Purchaser
Parties or their respective counsel prior to the date of this Agreement, the
date that is ten (10) Business Days after receipt by the Purchaser Parties
counsel of any such initial Title Commitment and Survey for such Core Property
(the applicable date in (i) or (ii), the " _Initial Objection Date_ "), the
Purchaser Parties counsel shall notify Sellers counsel in writing of any
matters shown on the applicable Survey or Title Commitment that the Purchaser
Parties believe constitute Material Title Exceptions and/or Mandatory Removal
Exceptions, together with the Purchaser Parties good faith estimate of the
loss or other diminution in value caused by each such Material Title
Exception, which loss or other diminution in value shall reflect only the
decrease in the value of Sellers direct or indirect percentage ownership
interest in the Property (a " _Diminution in Value_ ") and together with such
notice a copy of the Title Commitment, Survey and related back-up
documentation relating to such matter(s) in Purchasers or their respective
counsels possession. If the Purchaser Parties fail to give any such notice,
the Purchaser Parties shall be deemed to have waived their right to object to
such matter or to treat such matter as a Material Title Exception or Mandatory
Removal Exception. With respect to any Material Title Exceptions and/or
Mandatory Removal Exceptions first appearing in any update to any Title
Commitment or Survey, which update is first received by the Purchaser Parties
counsel on or after the Initial Objection Date, the Purchaser Parties
counsel shall notify Sellers counsel of such Material Title Exceptions and/or
Mandatory Title Exceptions, together with the Purchaser Parties good faith
estimate of the Diminution in Value caused by each such Material Title
Exception, within five (5) Business Days after receipt of such update (such
date and the Initial Title Objection Date are sometimes referred to herein as
the " _Objection Date_ "). With respect to any matters shown on
the applicable Survey or Title Commitment objected to by Purchaser in
accordance with the terms hereof as to which the  



 

-12-  Purchaser Parties do not have either a reasonably legible, materially
complete copy of the document or a Survey (to the extent reasonably required
in order to locate any such matter objected to) with which to determine
whether the Purchaser Parties believe such matter constitutes a Material Title
Exception or Mandatory Removal Exception, the Purchaser Parties shall indicate
in a notice given on or before the Objection Date whether the Purchaser
Parties reserve the right to make such determination pending receipt of such
items and the Purchaser Parties shall thereafter give notice of such
determination within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of the applicable
items. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any objection notice
given by the Purchaser Parties pursuant to this _Section 2.3(b)_ shall be
given prior to the then scheduled Closing Date.



Any exceptions, objections and encumbrances to title or surveys that (x)
are raised by the Purchaser Parties on or before the applicable Objection
Date, (y) impair the use or value of a Core Property as a self storage
facility or the operation of the business conducted thereon by the applicable
Core Subsidiary in any material manner and (z) are not Permitted Encumbrances
or Mandatory Removal Exceptions, shall be referred to collectively as "
_Material Title Exceptions_." Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the parties agree that rights of first refusal, rights of first
offer, buy-sell rights and options, in each case to purchase any Core Property
or any direct interest in or portion thereof, shall be deemed to be Material
Title Exceptions unless the same are listed on  _Schedule 3.17_.



The Purchaser Parties shall not be entitled to raise any title or survey
objections after the Closing or the applicable Objection Date or with respect
to any Property that is not a Core Property, subject to the right of the
Purchaser Indemnitees to seek indemnification from Seller pursuant to
_Section 10.2(a)_ , _(b)_ or _(c)_ hereof, as and to the extent they are so
entitled under the terms of such Sections. Seller agrees to reasonably
cooperate with the Purchaser Parties in connection with providing
customary information to the Title Company for the purposes of obtaining
Title Commitments, title policies and Surveys for Core Properties. For the
avoidance of doubt, "providing customary information" shall not obligate
Seller to provide or deliver owners affidavits or to indemnify the Title
Company or otherwise incur any liability not specifically provided for in this
Agreement, except that Seller shall execute and deliver to the Title Company
at the Closing an affidavit substantially in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit 2.3(b)_ with respect to each Core Property (each, a " _Title
Affidavit_ ").



With respect to matters concerning the failure of a Core Property to be in
material compliance with any Laws relating to zoning, the Purchaser
Parties shall notify Seller of any such matter promptly upon obtaining actual
knowledge thereof, such matter shall be treated as a Material Title Exception
and the terms of _Sections 2.3(d)_ and _2.3(e)_ shall apply to the affected
Property. 



(c) _Permitted Encumbrances_. As to each Core Property, the following items
shall be deemed acceptable to the Purchaser Parties and all such items shall
constitute " _Permitted Encumbrances_ " hereunder to which the Purchaser
Parties may not object:

now in effect or which may be in force and effect after the date hereof with
respect to such Core Property, except to the extent that the Core Property is
not in material compliance with any Laws relating to zoning; the parties
hereby acknowledge and agree that the failure of any Core Property to have
any required certificate of occupancy or other permit or license (other than
on account of a failure of such Core Property to be in material compliance
with a Law relating to zoning) shall not be treated as a title or survey
matter and shall be deemed to be a Permitted Encumbrance;



(vi) any public record filings by mechanics, materialmen or other workmen or

necessary, from time to time by notice to the Purchaser Parties delivered on
or prior to the date then set for Closing (for a maximum adjournment period
not to exceed forty-five (45) calendar days in the aggregate), and to
postpone the Outside Date to a date no earlier than fifteen (15) Business Days
after the end of such adjournment, to permit the cure of any Material Title
Exceptions or Mandatory Title Exceptions. Seller shall not be required and is
not obligated to bring any action or proceedings, convey or acquire any
interest in real property, incur any expense or liability with respect to the
removal or cure of Material Title Exceptions or take any other action of any
kind or nature to render title to any of the Properties free and clear of any
title or survey exceptions, objections or encumbrances (except as provided
below with respect to Mandatory Title Exceptions), and the Purchaser Parties
shall have no right of specific performance or other relief against Seller to
cause any Material Title Exceptions to be satisfied or cured.



 

-14- (e) _Failure to Remove Material Title Exceptions_. If Seller is unable or
unwilling to remove, satisfy or cure any such Material Title Exceptions, then
the Purchaser Parties shall have the right to elect in writing, no later than
five (5) Business Days (and the Closing shall be adjourned and the Outside
Date extended during such period) after the Purchaser Parties receipt of
notice from Seller that Seller is unable or unwilling to remove, satisfy or
cure such Material Title Exceptions, to: (i) waive any rights with respect to
such Material Title Exceptions (in which event the Purchaser Parties shall be
obligated to and shall consummate the Closing without abatement of the
Estimated Purchase Price or any claim for Losses against Seller by reason of
such Material Title Exceptions, and such Material Title Exceptions
shall become part of and deemed Permitted Encumbrances); or (ii) by written
notice to Seller indicate those Core Properties as to which the aggregate
Diminution in Value as estimated by the Purchaser Parties or as otherwise
agreed by the Purchaser Parties and Seller for all uncured Material Title
Exceptions on such Core Property is greater than $350,000 and that the
Purchaser Parties desire to have Seller make one of the elections described
below with respect to each such Core Property. With respect to each Core
Property as to which the aggregate Diminution in Value for all uncured
Material Title Exceptions on such Core Property as estimated by the Purchaser
Parties or as otherwise agreed by the Purchaser Parties and Seller is equal to
or less than $350,000, the Purchaser Parties shall close without any credit
for the Diminution in Value. If the Purchaser Parties fail to give the notice
described in (ii) above, the Purchaser Parties shall be deemed to have made
the election in (i) above. 



Upon receipt of the notice described in (ii) above, Seller shall have five
(5) Business Days (and the Closing shall be adjourned and the Outside Date
extended during such period) to elect, by written notice to the Purchaser
Parties separately with respect to each Core Property affected by any such
Material Title Exceptions, to: (A) drop any such Core Property in accordance
with and subject to _Article VI_ ; (B) cause the Purchaser Parties to close
with a credit against the Estimated Purchase Price on account of the uncured
Material Title Exception equal to the Diminution in Value as estimated by the
Purchaser Parties or as otherwise agreed by the Purchaser Parties and Seller;
or (C) if the aggregate Diminution in Value as estimated by the Purchaser
Parties for all uncured Material Title Exceptions on such Core Property is
greater than $350,000, but Seller does not agree with such estimate, proceed
to Closing in accordance with (B) above except that an amount equal to the
Diminution in Value as estimated by the Purchaser Parties shall be withheld
from the Estimated Purchase Price paid at Closing and held in escrow until the
amount is finally determined by agreement of the parties, binding arbitration
in accordance with _Section 11.15_ or a court of competent jurisdiction. If
the Diminution in Value as so finally determined is equal to or less than
$350,000, then Seller shall be entitled to the entire escrowed amount relating
to such Core Property. If the Diminution in Value as so finally determined
is greater than $350,000, then the Purchaser Parties shall be entitled to the
Diminution in Value as so finally determined and Seller shall be entitled to
any remaining escrowed amount relating to such Core Property. For purposes of
determining the Diminution in Value, all relevant factors shall be
considered, including the following: the magnitude of the matter; the impact
of the matter upon the fair market value of the Property for its current use
and future transferability of the Property; the likelihood the exception will
be enforced or pursued by a third party; and the likelihood of success by said
third party.



 

-15- (f) _Resolution of Mandatory Removal Exceptions_. Notwithstanding the
provisions of _Section 2.3(c)_ , but subject to the provisions of _Section
2.3(b)_ , at or prior to Closing, Seller shall cause the Core Subsidiaries, at
the sole cost and expense of the Core Subsidiaries, to pay in full or cause to
be canceled and discharged, bonded or otherwise cause the Title Company to
insure over: (i) all mechanics and contractors Liens which encumber any Core
Property as of the Closing Date (other than Permitted Encumbrances under
_Section 2.3(c)(vi)_ ), and (ii) all Liens against such Core Property which
evidence monetary obligations of any Core Subsidiary (in each case, excluding
the Existing Loans and Permitted Encumbrances). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, Seller shall pay or cause to be paid in full
all past due taxes and assessments. The Liens, judgments and encumbrances
specifically referred to in this _Section 2.3(f)_ are collectively referred to
as " _Mandatory Removal Exceptions_ ". Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller
shall not be required to cause any Core Subsidiary to pay, remove or discharge
any Mandatory Removal Exceptions that secure or relate to obligations that are
or will be reflected as reductions, which reductions shall take into account
the proportionate share of Sellers direct or indirect percentage ownership in
such Core Subsidiary, of Estimated Net Assets on the Baseline Balance Sheet,
the Estimated Net Assets Statement or the Closing Net Asset Statement, and
such matters shall be deemed to be Permitted Encumbrances.



(g)  _Curing Title Matters_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Seller shall be deemed to have removed, satisfied or cured a Material Title
Exception or Mandatory Removal Exception if, in Sellers sole and absolute
discretion and at Sellers (or the applicable Core Subsidiarys) sole cost
and expense (and only to the extent of Sellers direct or indirect percentage
ownership in such Core Subsidiary), Seller shall either: (i) take such actions
as are necessary to remove, satisfy or cure (of record or otherwise, as
appropriate) such Material Title Exception or Mandatory Removal Exception;
(ii) cause the Title Company to remove such Material Title Exception or
Mandatory Removal Exception as an exception to title in the Title Commitment
or policy issued at Closing or agree to affirmatively insure against the same,
whether such removal or insurance is made available in consideration of
payment, bonding, indemnity of Seller or otherwise; (iii) deliver (A)
Sellers (or the applicable Core Subsidiarys) own funds (or direct that a
portion of Estimated Purchase Price be delivered), in an amount needed to
fully discharge any such Material Title Exception or Mandatory Removal
Exception, to the Title Company with instructions for the Title Company to
apply such funds to fully discharge same, and (B) if required by the Title
Company, such instruments, in recordable form, as are necessary to enable the
Title Company to discharge such Material Title Exception or Mandatory Removal
Exception of record; or (iv) agree to indemnify the Purchaser Parties for any
Losses incurred by the Purchaser Parties arising out of such matter by
entering into an amendment to this Agreement, provided with respect to this
clause (iv) that (x) such indemnification obligation will be considered an
obligation under this Agreement guaranteed by the Parent Guaranty and (y)
Seller shall have first used its commercially reasonable efforts to cure
the matter in a manner described in clauses (i)  (iii) above. Seller shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to remove of record mortgages
encumbering Core Properties that relate to loans that have been satisfied. To
the extent that funds are needed to cure any Mandatory Removal Exception or
Material Title Exception, Seller shall have the right to cause any portion of
the Estimated Purchase Price being paid at Closing to be delivered to the
Title Company to cure same.

Subsidiary maintain, put in place, or replace, indebtedness, whether or not
secured by one or more of the Core Properties, or (iii) requires that any
Core Subsidiary offer to any Person at any time the opportunity to guarantee

_Franchise Loan Documents_ ") have been made available to the Purchaser
Parties, and such documents previously made available to the Purchaser
Parties are true, correct and complete in all material respects. The Core
Subsidiary named as a lender under the Franchise Loan Documents has not
assigned, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise transferred the Franchise Loan
Documents. To the Knowledge of Seller, as of the date hereof, no borrower is
in default in any material respect under any of the Franchise Loans, except as
set forth on _Schedule 3.16(c)_.

-28-  otherwise possess legally enforceable rights to use all Intellectual
Property used in or reasonably necessary to conduct the Self Storage Business,
except where the failure to own, license or have rights to use such
Intellectual Property would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect.



(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of
the Transactions will not result in the breach of, or create on behalf of any
third party the right to terminate or modify any license, sublicense or other
agreement relating to any Intellectual Property or any software programs that
are not commercially available on a general basis, including any software
that is incorporated in or forms a part of any product or service sold,
licensed, leased or used by or expected to be sold, licensed, leased or used
by any of the Core Subsidiaries, except for such breaches and right to
terminate or modify as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect. _Schedule 3.19(b)_ sets
forth a complete and accurate list of (i) the patents, registered trademarks
and service marks, material unregistered trademarks and service marks, domain
name registrations, registered copyrights and material unregistered copyrights
owned by the Core Subsidiaries and (ii) all material software license

Core Subsidiaries or (ii) business or activities conducted by any of the Core
Subsidiaries infringes, violates or constitutes a misappropriation of, or has
infringed, violated or constituted a misappropriation of, any Intellectual
Property of a third party (including any software programs and applications
that are commercially available), except for infringements, violations or
misappropriations which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Seller Material Adverse Effect. None of
the Core Subsidiaries has received any written (or Seller has any Knowledge of
any) complaint, claim or notice alleging any such infringement, violation or
misappropriation.

Core Properties and a brief description of such policies, including the names

otherwise consented to in writing by Purchaser (or such other party as may be
applicable), such representation or warranty shall be deemed true and correct
on the Closing Date to the extent of such failure for all purposes of this

5.2 _Assumption of Obligations_. At the Closing, each Purchaser and Investor A
agree to severally assume all obligations of the Seller Persons (other than
the Subsidiaries and their direct and/or indirect subsidiaries) (each such
Person, a " _Guarantor_ ") arising under each guaranty, indemnity, letter of
credit or other undertaking in respect of one (1) or more of the Existing
Loans and third party loans to any Non-Core Subsidiaries (each, a "
_Continuing Loan Guaranty_ ") on such terms and pursuant to such documentation
as the lender or other beneficiary thereof may reasonably require or to prepay
any remaining Existing Loan in full; provided that such obligations shall be
assumed only by the Purchaser acquiring an interest in the Property related to
each such



 

-35-  loan. The Purchaser Parties and Seller will use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the lender under each Existing Loan or other beneficiary to
fully release and discharge each Guarantor from all obligations under each
Continuing Loan Guaranty to which it is a party or by which it is bound,
including each Purchaser, as applicable, and Investor A executing documents
reasonably requested by the lenders or other beneficiaries, and to obtain
payoff letters from the holders of the Existing Loans which the Purchaser
Parties wish to repay at the Closing. If any lender or other beneficiary is
unwilling to release and discharge any Guarantor from a Continuing Loan
Guaranty, Purchaser and Investor A shall severally indemnify the Guarantor
against any liability arising under the Continuing Loan Guaranty pursuant to
an indemnity agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
the Purchaser Parties and Seller. The Purchaser Parties and Seller will use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause lenders or other beneficiaries to (i)
accept replacement letters of credit from the appropriate Purchaser Party or
otherwise and (ii) release the current obligor and any cash or property
securing any such existing letter of credit.



5.3 _Reasonable Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement, the Purchaser Parties, Investor B and Seller will
use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly take, or cause to be taken,
as applicable, all actions, and to promptly do, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective
the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the obtaining
of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, permits and
approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
registrations as to which such consent, approval or waiver relates and filings
and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or
waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental
Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers
from third parties, (iii) in the case of Investor A and Seller, the
preparation of the LP Offer and the other materials and correspondence
conveyed to the Outside Partners of SUSA in connection therewith, (iv)
subject to the terms of Article X, the defending of themselves in any lawsuits
or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions and (v) the execution
and delivery of any additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate
the Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.



 

5.4 _No Alternative Transaction_. Seller will not take or authorize or permit
any Affiliate of Seller (or authorize or permit any officer, director,
employee, investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other
Person retained by or acting for or on behalf of Seller or any such Affiliate)
to take, directly or indirectly, any action to initiate, assist, solicit,
receive, negotiate, participate in any discussions, facilitate, encourage or
accept any offer or inquiry from any Person (a) that would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Alternative Transaction; (b) to reach any agreement or
understanding (whether or not such agreement or understanding is absolute,
revocable, contingent or conditional) for, or otherwise attempt to consummate,
any Alternative Transaction; or (c) to furnish or cause to be furnished any
information with respect to the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to any
Person who Seller or such Affiliate (or any such Person acting for or on their
behalf) knows or has reason to believe is in the process of considering an
Alternative Transaction. As used herein, " _Alternative Transaction_ " means
any sale or other disposition of the Purchased Interests, Properties or all or
any substantial portion of the Self Storage Business.



 

5.5 _Public Announcements_. Seller, Investor B and the Purchaser Parties shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to agree on the description of the
Transactions contemplated by  



 

-36-  this Agreement contained in the initial press releases to be issued by the
parties with respect to their execution and delivery of this Agreement. Each
party will use commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other
parties before issuing, and provide the other parties the opportunity to
review and comment upon, any press release or other written public statement
that contains a description of the Transactions (other than any such press
release or public statement that contains only such description as has been
previously agreed upon), and shall not issue any such press release or make
any such written public statement prior to such consultation, except as may
be required by applicable law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange. Each party shall be
entitled to discuss, on a confidential basis, the terms of the Transactions
and confidential information regarding the Self Storage Business with rating
agencies and potential sources of financing for consummation of the
Transactions. Except to the extent modified by the foregoing provisions,
the Confidentiality Agreement dated as of October 11, 2004 between Investor A
and Seller (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") shall remain in full force
and effect, notwithstanding the execution and delivery, or any termination, of
this Agreement.



5.6 _Conveyance Taxes_. The Purchaser Parties and Seller will reasonably
cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all Tax Returns,
questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real property
transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added and stamp Taxes,
any transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar Taxes
which become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.



 

5.7 _Allocation of Estimated Purchase Price_. The Purchaser Parties shall
prepare and present to Seller a proposed allocation of the Estimated Purchase
Price (and all other capitalized costs) among the assets of the SUSA Group in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " _Code_ ") and Treasury regulations thereunder (and any
similar provision of state, local or foreign law, as appropriate) within
sixty (60) calendar days after the Closing Date. Such allocation by the
Purchaser Parties shall be consistent with the purchase price for interests in
New SUSA set forth in  _Section_ _1.3_. Seller shall notify Investor A within
fifteen (15) calendar days of the receipt of the proposed allocation of any
objections that Seller has with respect thereto and the changes that Seller
would make as a result thereof. If Seller has no objections, or if the
Purchaser Parties agree to the changes proposed by Seller, such allocation (as
so modified) shall be binding upon Seller. If the Purchaser Parties and Seller
cannot resolve any disagreements with respect to the proposed allocation
within fifteen (15) calendar days after Seller delivers to Investor A any
objections thereto, the Purchaser Parties and Seller jointly shall select an
independent valuation expert to resolve such differences, with the fees
and costs of such valuation expert to be shared equally between the Purchaser
Parties, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, and with the decision
of such valuation expert as to any matters in dispute between the Purchaser
Parties and Seller to be binding and conclusive on the Purchaser Parties and
Seller. Seller, the Purchaser Parties and their respective Affiliates shall
report, act, and file Tax Returns (including, but not limited to Internal
Revenue Service Form 8594) in all respects and for all purposes consistent
with such allocation prepared by the Purchaser Parties (with such changes
thereto as shall be proposed by Seller and agreed to by the Purchaser Parties
or as shall be determined by the third party valuation expert as set forth
above). Seller, the Purchaser Parties shall timely and properly prepare,
execute, file, and deliver all such documents, forms, and other information as
may reasonably request in preparing such allocation. Neither the
Purchaser Parties nor Seller shall take any position (whether in audits, Tax
Returns, or otherwise) that is inconsistent with such allocation, as finally
determined as set forth above, unless required to do so by applicable law.



 

-37- 5.8 _Employee Matters_.



(a) Pursuant to a separate disclosure statement of even date herewith, Seller
has furnished to Investor A a true and complete list and job title of each
individual who is employed by a Seller Controlled Entity on the date hereof in
connection with the Self Storage Business (the " _Employees_ "), along with
his or her date of hire, position, base salary or wage rate and most recent
annual bonus. Immediately prior to Closing, Seller shall cause SUSA to
transfer all Employees of SUSA and SUSA-TN LLC to New SUSA, and Seller will
and will cause SUSA to terminate its employment relationship with each
Employee. Except as otherwise provided herein, the terms and conditions of the
Employees employment with New SUSA will be the same terms and conditions that
were in effect with respect to each Employee immediately prior to
each Employees transfer to New SUSA; _provided_ , _however_ , that for the
period of twelve (12) months from and after the Closing the Employees will be
provided with the same (or substantially comparable) employee pension,
welfare, severance and benefit plans, programs and arrangements that are
available to similarly situated employees of Investor A on the Closing Date,
but in no event will the pension, welfare, severance and benefit plans,
programs and arrangements and salary and wages provided to any such Employee
during such twelve (12) months period be less favorable in the aggregate than
the programs and arrangements and salary and wages applicable to such Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date;  _provided_ _further_ , that Seller
and Investor A shall cooperate in establishing such new employee benefit plans
and programs to be effective as of the Closing Date to effect the immediately
preceding proviso, and, with respect thereto, Seller agrees to provide
Investor A with all reasonable assistance as is reasonably necessary. In
determining an Employees eligibility to participate in and vesting under
Investor As employee pension, welfare and benefit plans, programs and
arrangements, and the level of vacation and sick pay benefits under Investor
As policies, the Employees will receive full credit for all service with
Seller Controlled Entities prior to the Closing (to the same extent such
Employees received such credit with respect to such plans, programs and
arrangements maintained by the applicable Seller Controlled Entity), but any
vacation or sick time taken for the year in which the Closing occurs while
employed by a Seller Controlled Entity will reduce the amount of vacation or
sick time that will be available to the Employee under Investor As vacation
or sick policy during the year in which the Closing occurs. Investor A will
provide group health coverage to the Employees and their dependents without
imposing any pre-existing condition exclusions, waiting periods or actively-
at-work requirements, except to the extent such requirements were applicable
to the Employee or dependent under a Seller Controlled Entitys applicable
group health plan immediately prior to the Closing Date. Any group health plan
made available by Investor A to Employees and their beneficiaries will provide
credit for any deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket limits applied or
made with respect to each Employee or beneficiary in the calendar year of the
Closing Date. Seller and Investor A shall each be responsible for fifty
percent (50%) of the cost of retention bonuses provided to the Employees
pursuant to any arrangements entered into by the Core Subsidiaries prior to
the Closing Date. Investor A shall pay all severance costs, but shall not have
any responsibility for the payment of severance costs with respect to the GE
Employees set forth on  _Schedule 3.11_ or as a result of any transfer of any
Employee from SUSA to New SUSA pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement or the
transactions contemplated thereby.



 

-38- (b) Seller and SUSA will be responsible, in accordance with the terms of the
applicable welfare plans as in effect immediately prior to the Closing, for
all medical and dental claims incurred prior to the Closing Date by Employees
and former employees and their dependents; for the avoidance of doubt, a claim
shall be "incurred" on the date of the provision of the underlying service or
product.



(c) With respect to each New SUSA Plan, effective immediately prior to
Closing, SUSA will take all actions necessary to transfer the roles of plan
sponsor and plan administrator from SUSA to New SUSA.



(d) Notwithstanding anything here in to the contrary, no provision of this 
_Section 5.8_ will create any third party beneficiary or other rights in any
employee or former employee, including any dependent, survivor or beneficiary
thereof, of Seller or its Affiliates in respect of continued employment (or
resumed employment) with either Investor A or its Affiliates and no provision
of this _Section 5.8_ shall create any other rights in any such persons,
including in respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly or
indirectly, under any employee benefit plan or arrangement which may be
established or made available by Investor A or its Affiliates to the Employees



5.9 _Transitional Services_.



(a) _Transitional Services Agreement_. Purchaser and Seller shall reasonably
cooperate and negotiate in good faith to reach agreement on the terms and
conditions of a transitional services agreement (the " _Transitional Services
Agreement_ ") pursuant to which services relating to the operation and conduct
of the Self Storage Business following the Closing Date which are
currently provided to SUSA by Seller (or an Affiliate of Seller) or by a
third party under a master or other agreement with Seller (or an Affiliate of
Seller) will be provided to Purchaser and the Subsidiaries for a transitional
period following the Closing Date. Subject to such good faith negotiations,
the transition services will include (i) software (e.g., Solomon and Oracle)
and other information technology services used by the Self Storage Business on
an interim basis, (ii) payroll (ADP will be transferable under current terms
and conditions for a three year period), (iii) benefits (Seller will assist
Purchaser in establishing mirror plans with current providers prior to
Closing), (iv) insurance (see (b) and (c) below), and (v)
sourcing (transferring assignable vendor contracts and facilitating
discussions with other vendors who provide equipment, supplies or services).
As described in Schedules 3.19(b) and 3.20, Sellers ability to provide
transition services may be limited by law, third party contract or internal
company privacy and security issues (e.g., IT firewall considerations);
however, Seller will use its good faith, commercially reasonable efforts to
provide, arrange for or facilitate the continuation of services requested by
Purchaser during the term of the Transitional Services Agreement. With respect
to services provided by third party vendors, Seller will work cooperatively
with Purchaser and, as requested by Purchaser, contact such parties with or
on behalf of Purchaser concerning the extension of services to Purchaser. The
period for the provision of services shall be as agreed upon between the
parties in negotiating the Transitional Services Agreement (but shall not be
less than 90 days nor longer than six (6) months after the Closing Date for
any service). Such services shall be provided to Purchaser and the
Subsidiaries at a price equal to the actual cost to Seller and its Affiliates
of providing such services (which includes the allocation of salary and
direct overhead to personnel involved in providing such services, adjusted for
the portion of such personnels time actually spent providing such services to
Purchaser and the Subsidiaries) or procuring such equipment or supplies.



 

-39- (b) _Assistance with Procurement of Insurance._ As described in _Schedule
3.20_ , certain insurance policies that currently provide the SUSA Group
coverage for various matters are not transferable and will be cancelled by
their terms at Closing. To assist Purchaser and Investor A in arranging for
the continuation of insurance coverage for the Self Storage Business and the
Properties following the Closing Date, Seller will use good faith,
commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate discussions between Sellers
existing insurers and the Purchaser and Investor A with respect to the
continuation of insurance following the Closing and/or the issuance of new or
replacement policies. Such assistance shall consist of: (i)(x) permitting
Purchaser and Investor A to participate in the process of renewing all
insurance policies of Seller and SUSA related to the Self Storage Business
and the Properties that are scheduled to expire on June 15, 2005, (y) using
commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be included in such renewal
policies (I) a provision that permits a change of control of New SUSA and the
Self Storage Business to Purchaser and Investor A without causing the
termination of such insurance policies and (II) a premium schedule that
provides Investor A with the option of adding its existing self storage
properties to such policies and (z) negotiating a shortened policy period or
an extended policy period, as the case may be, such that the terms of such
renewal policies coincide with the existing policy periods of Investor As
current insurance policies for its self storage properties; or (ii) if
Purchaser and Investor A are unable to obtain the necessary insurance coverage
pursuant to clause (i) above, the provision to Purchaser and Investor A by
Seller of loss histories and other information reasonably necessary for
Purchaser and Investor A to obtain insurance coverage for the Self Storage
Business and the Properties following the Closing Date.



(c) _Assistance with Tenant Insurance Program_. As disclosed to Purchaser,
certain insurance policies that currently provide self storage tenants with
month-to-month insurance coverage for various matters are issued to the
tenants pursuant to a program that is not transferable. To assist Purchaser
and Investor A in arranging for the continuation of the tenants existing
insurance coverage following the Closing Date, Seller will use good faith,
commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate discussions between the existing
tenant insurers and the Purchaser and Investor A with respect to
the continuation of the existing insurance policies and policy renewal
program following the Closing. Such assistance shall include the provision to
Purchaser and Investor A by Seller and its current and former third party
administrators of the tenant insurance programs of copies of the master
policies, loss histories and premiums, historical policy sales, current
insurance certificate holders and detail on administrative costs, and other
information reasonably necessary and required for Purchaser and Investor A to
obtain a substitute master policy and program for tenant insurance coverage
following the Closing Date.



5.10 _Transition of Litigation; Litigation Support_.



(a) Except for the California Litigation and any action, suit, proceeding,
hearing, investigation, charge, complaint, Claim or demand arising as set
forth in _Section 10.2(f)_ for which Seller has an indemnity obligation
hereunder, Investor A shall manage any action, suit, proceeding, hearing,
investigation, charge, complaint, Claim or demand in connection with any fact,
situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan,
occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act or transaction related to
the Self Storage Business and existing or brought against Seller or  



 

-40-  Seller Indemnitee. Seller shall provide reasonable assistance to Investor A
in transitioning the defense and administration of all actions,
suits, proceedings, hearings, investigations, charges, complaints, claims or
demands relating to events occurring prior to the Closing involving any Person
(other than Seller under this Agreement), as Investor A may reasonably
request. Seller shall also provide reasonable assistance to Investor A as
Investor A may reasonably request in transferring, assigning or providing, or
causing to be transferred, assigned or provided, to Investor A (or its
designees), (i) insurance coverage relating to Claims, acts, omissions,
events or conditions occurring or existing prior to the Closing under all
insurance policies and the proceeds thereof related to all such actions,
suits, proceedings, hearings, investigations, charges, complaints, claims
or demands, and (ii) all claims, causes of action and counterclaims of any
kind against any Person (other than the Purchaser Parties or Investor B)
arising out of or related to the Self Storage Business.



(b) In the event and for so long as Seller actively is contesting
or defending against any action, suit, proceeding, hearing, investigation,
charge, complaint, Claim or demand involving any Person (other than a
Purchaser Party or Investor B under this Agreement) in connection with any
fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan,
occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act or transaction related to
the Self Storage Business or the Transactions for the up to and including the
Closing, the Purchaser Parties will reasonably cooperate with Seller and its
counsel in the contest or defense, make available on reasonable prior notice
the Purchaser Parties personnel (including Employees), and provide such
testimony and access to the Purchaser Parties books and records as shall be
reasonably necessary in connection with the contest or defense. Seller will
reimburse the Purchaser Parties for their direct out-of-pocket expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred in complying with this 
_Section 5.10_. In the event and for so long as the Purchaser Parties actively
are contesting or defending against any action, suit, proceeding, hearing,
investigation, charge, complaint, claim or demand involving any Person (other
than Seller under this Agreement) in connection with any fact, situation,
circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event,
incident, action, failure to act or transaction related to the Self Storage
Business, Seller will cooperate with the Purchaser Parties and their
respective counsel in the contest or defense, make available Sellers
personnel, and provide such testimony and access to Sellers books and records
as shall be reasonably necessary in connection with the contest or defense.
The Purchaser Parties will reimburse Seller for its direct out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in complying with this _Section 5.10_. The Purchaser Parties
and Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to agree upon and enter
into joint defense agreements relating to any such litigation or proceeding as
may be necessary to protect their respective attorney-client privileges.



(c) The benefits under the insurance policies set forth on _Schedule 3.20_
will inure to the benefit of the Purchaser Parties following the Closing with
respect to covered losses arising prior to the Closing, and any other
insurance policies of any of Seller, SUSA, Storage USA Franchise Corp., SUSA
Management, Inc. and SUSA Finance Corp. with respect to any periods prior to
the Closing Date will inure to the benefit of the Purchaser Parties following
the Closing with respect to occurrences during such periods. With respect to
pre-Closing occurrences covered by insurance maintained by Seller, SUSA,
Storage USA Franchise Corp., SUSA Management, Inc. and SUSA Finance Corp. or
as to which they are additional insureds (" _Prior Period Insured Claims_ "),
Seller agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Purchaser Parties
from and against Prior Period Insured Claims to the extent, and only to the
extent, of the coverage afforded  



 

-41-  by, and subject to the terms and conditions of, such policies. Investor A
shall manage all Prior Period Insured Claims in accordance with
_Section 5.10(a)_. From and after the Closing Date, if Seller recovers
insurance proceeds in respect of Prior Period Insured Claims, Seller shall
promptly remit such proceeds to the applicable Purchaser Party.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.10_ to the contrary, from and
after the Closing Date, Investor A shall be responsible for and shall pay the
deductible or self retention amount for any Prior Period Insured Claims.



5.11 _Tax Matters_.



(a) _Closing of the Books_. The parties intend that New SUSA is, and will
treat New SUSA as, a continuation of SUSA for federal and applicable
state income tax purposes. The Purchaser Parties and Seller will treat the
sale of the Purchased Interests by Seller to Purchaser as resulting in a
termination for federal income tax purposes under Section 708(b) of the Code
(and any analogous provisions of state of local law) of New SUSA and any
Majority Subsidiary that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes as of the time of Closing, with income and loss (and items thereof)
to be allocated as of the time of Closing as a result thereof. Seller shall
be responsible for preparing and filing all federal, state and local Tax
Returns for New SUSA and its Subsidiaries for periods ending on or before the
Closing Date, including periods ending by reason of a deemed termination
of New SUSA under Section 708(b) of the Code (and any analogous provisions of
state of local law), and Purchaser shall be responsible for preparing and
filing all federal, state and local Tax Returns for New SUSA and its
Subsidiaries for periods commencing on or after the Closing Date (a " _Post-
Closing Tax Period")_. For any Core Subsidiary that is a corporation for
federal income Tax purposes, and for any Core Subsidiary that is a partnership
or disregarded entity for federal income Tax purposes, but which is subject
to state or local Tax in a jurisdiction that taxes such Core Subsidiary as an
entity, the responsibility for Tax Returns and Taxes shall be as set forth in
_Section 5.11(b)_ below.

 



(b) _Filing Tax Returns; Liability for Taxes_.



(i) _Straddle Periods_. With respect to Taxes for which a Core Subsidiary is
liable (" _Entity Level Tax_ "), if the Transfer does not end the taxable
period with respect to that Entity Level Tax, then that taxable period shall
constitute a " _Straddle Period_." With respect to each Straddle Period, each
Purchaser will prepare all returns relating to Entity Level Tax for the
Straddle Period in a manner consistent with past practices of the Core
Subsidiary and will submit a copy of the returns to Seller no later than
thirty (30) calendar days prior to filing for Sellers approval, which
approval will not be unreasonably withheld, together with a proposed
allocation of any Entity Level Taxes between the applicable Purchaser and
Seller, computed assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two separate
taxable periods, the first such period ending on the Closing Date, which
period shall be the responsibility of Seller, and the second such period
commencing immediately after the Closing Date and ending with the end of the
taxable year of such Core Subsidiary, which period shall be the responsibility
of the applicable Purchaser. If Seller has no objections to such returns or
the resulting allocation of responsibility for Entity Level Taxes, or
if Purchaser agrees to the changes proposed by Seller, such returns and the
resulting allocation of responsibility for Entity Level Taxes (as so modified)
shall be binding upon Seller. If Purchaser and Seller cannot resolve any
disagreements with respect to the proposed returns and the resulting
allocation of responsibility for Entity Level Taxes within fifteen (15)
calendar days after Seller delivers to Purchaser any objections thereto,
Purchaser and Seller jointly shall select an  



 

-42-  independent tax expert to resolve such differences, with the fees and costs
of such tax expert to be shared equally between Purchaser and Seller, and
with the decision of such tax expert as to any matters in dispute between
Purchaser and Seller to be binding and conclusive on both Purchaser and
Seller. Seller will pay to Purchaser at least five (5) Business Days prior to
the date on which Entity Level Taxes are paid with respect to such periods
(or if later, upon a resolution by the independent tax expert of any
disagreement between Seller and Purchaser with respect thereto) an amount
equal to the portion of the Entity Level Taxes required to be paid by Seller
pursuant to this Agreement which properly relate to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (as agreed to between Seller and
Purchaser as set forth above, or in the absence of such agreement, as
determined by the independent tax expert as set forth above). Any refunds of
Taxes received that properly relate to the portion of the Straddle Period for
which Seller is responsible for Taxes as provided in this _Section 5.11(b)_
will be promptly paid to Seller, provided that no amounts shall be paid to
Seller with respect to such portion of the Straddle Period if such amounts
have been taken into account in calculating the amount of Closing Net Assets
or any Price Adjustment made pursuant to this Agreement.



(ii) _Tax Periods Ending on or Before Closing Date_. For any Core
Subsidiaries that are subject to an Entity Level Tax and have taxable periods
relating to Entity Level Taxes that end on or before the Closing Date (a "
_Pre-Closing Tax Period_ "), but for which returns of Entity Level Taxes have
not been prepared as of the Closing Date and are not due until after the
Closing Date, Seller will prepare and timely file such Tax returns in a manner
consistent with past practices of such Core Subsidiary. Seller will submit
a copy of such returns to Purchaser no later than fifteen (15) calendar days
prior to filing for Purchasers approval which will not be unreasonably
withheld. Seller shall be responsible for the payment of all Entity Level
Taxes attributable to all Pre-Closing Tax Periods, including through the
Closing Date, whether or not the returns with respect thereto are filed before
or after the Closing Date, provided that no amounts shall be paid by Seller
with respect to such periods if such amounts have been taken into account in
calculating the amount of Closing Net Assets or any Price Adjustment made
pursuant to this Agreement. Any refunds of Taxes received that properly relate
to periods to which Seller is responsible for Taxes as provided in this
_Section 5.11_ will be promptly paid to Seller or its designee, provided that
no amounts shall be paid to Seller with respect to such periods if such
amounts have been taken into account in calculating the amount of Closing
Net Assets or any Price Adjustment made pursuant to this Agreement. In the
event of a disagreement between Seller and Purchaser with respect to such
returns or the resulting Entity Level Taxes, dispute resolution procedures
that are the same as those set forth in _Section 5.11(b)(i)_ shall apply.



(c)  _Cooperation_. Each of the Purchaser Parties and Seller agrees to fully
cooperate as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes, including making available employees and
such information and records which are reasonably relevant to any such filing,
audit, litigation or other proceeding. In connection therewith, Purchaser
shall provide to Seller reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records, and if requested by
Seller, shall transfer any such books and records to the Seller.



(d) _Absence of Changes_. Without the prior written consent of Purchaser,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (and shall be
deemed to be given unless within 10 days after the request therefor, Purchaser
declines in writing to give such consent), Seller  



 

-43-  shall not make or change any Tax election, change any annual Tax accounting
period, adopt or change any method of Tax accounting, file any amended
Tax Return, enter into any closing agreement, settle any contested Tax claim
or assessment, surrender any right to claim a Tax refund, offset or other
reduction in Tax liability, consent to any extension or waiver of the
limitations period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment or take or omit
to take any other action, if any such action or omission would have the effect
of increasing the Tax liability of Purchaser attributable to a Post-Closing
Tax Period or reducing any Post-Closing Tax Period asset of any Subsidiary or
Purchaser by more than $100,000 for any individual item or $500,000 in the
aggregate.



(e) _Tax Sharing_. Any and all Tax Sharing Agreements to which any of the Core
Subsidiaries are a party shall be terminated as of the Closing Date. After
the Closing Date, none of the Core Subsidiaries shall have any further rights
or liabilities thereunder.



5.12 _HSR Act Filings_.



(a) As soon as practicable after the date hereof, Purchaser and Seller agree
to make such filings, if any, and use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain such requisite approvals as may be required by the HSR Act, with
respect to the consummation of the Transactions, and shall thereafter file or
cause to be filed as promptly as practicable with the United States Federal
Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice any supplemental
information which may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and/or to secure
the expiration or early termination of applicable waiting periods under the
HSR Act. Each of Purchaser and Seller will cause any filings referred to in
this _Section 5.12(a)_ to comply in all material respects with the
requirements of the respective laws pursuant to which they are made.



(b) Without limiting the generality or effect of _Section 5.12(a)_ , if such
an HSR Act filing is required, each of Purchaser and Seller shall (i) use its
commercially reasonable efforts to comply as expeditiously as possible with
all lawful requests of Governmental Entities for additional information and
documents pursuant to the HSR Act, (ii) not extend any waiting period under
the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with any Governmental Entity not to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with the
prior consent of the other party, (iii) reasonably cooperate with each
other and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the lifting or removal
of any temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction or other judicial
or administrative order which may be entered into in connection with the
Transactions (provided that neither Purchaser nor Seller shall be required to
divest itself of any assets or properties) and, prior to or after the Closing,
pursue the underlying litigation or administrative proceeding diligently and
in good faith, (iv) give each other advance notice prior to having any
substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental Entities; (v)
coordinate with each other in advance of giving any written or oral
presentation to any Governmental Entity and request of such Governmental
Entity that both parties be present at any such presentation, and (vi)
debrief each other after any meetings/conversations with any Governmental
Entity in which only one party participated. Seller and Purchaser shall each
be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of the filing costs in connection with
making such HSR Act filings.



5.13 _Distributions_. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit,
and Seller and all Subsidiaries shall be permitted to, declare, set aside
and/or pay any dividend or distribution in respect of capital stock,
partnership interests, limited liability company or membership interests or
other securities or equity interests, whether or not in the ordinary course of
business.



 

-44- 5.14 _Post-Closing Access_.



(a) After the Closing, the Purchaser Parties will from time to time, upon
reasonable prior notice and during normal business hours, afford Seller
reasonable access to all books and records of the Self Storage Business that
relate to the period of Sellers ownership, including, without limitation, all
accounting records and employment and compensation data relating
to employees, for tax, accounting or other legal purposes. Investor A will
afford Seller, upon prior notice, reasonable access to Employees and other
Persons to assist in its reasonable review of those records. the Purchaser
Parties will maintain all records relating to the Self Storage Business for
the maximum time period required to comply with all applicable federal and
state audit periods.



(b) After the Closing, Seller will from time to time, upon reasonable notice
and during normal business hours, afford the Purchaser Parties
reasonable access to all books and records of the Self Storage Business
retained by Seller that relate to the period of Sellers ownership and to
reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser Parties to assist Investor A in
Investor As preparation of financial statements for the Self Storage
Business and in Investor As compliance with the requirements of the
Securities Act and the rules promulgated thereunder relating to the use of
such financial statements in a registration statement or in filing periodic
reports under the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. Seller
acknowledges that such financial statements to be prepared by Investor A will
include, among other items, (i) audited combined balance sheets as
of December 31, 2003 and 2004 and the related audited combined income
statements for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31,
2004 and (ii) unaudited combined balance sheets as of each quarter end during
2005 prior to the Closing and the comparative periods for 2004 and unaudited
income statements for each of the quarterly periods ending prior to the
Closing and comparative periods for 2004.



5.15 _Release of Seller_. Each of Purchaser Party and Investor B, for itself
and any of its successors and assigns and their Affiliates, hereby
irrevocably and absolutely waives its right to recover from, and forever
releases and discharges, and covenants not to file or otherwise pursue any
legal action against, any Seller Person with respect to any and all
suits, actions, proceedings, investigations, demands, claims, liabilities,
fines, penalties, liens, judgments, losses, injuries, damages, settlement
expenses or costs of whatever kind or nature, whether direct or indirect,
known or unknown, contingent or otherwise (including any action or proceeding
brought or threatened or ordered by any Governmental Entity), including
attorneys and experts fees and expenses, and investigation and remediation
costs (collectively, " _Claims_ ") that may arise on account of or in any way
be connected with the Self Storage Business, any Purchased Interests or any

physical, environmental and structural condition of any Property or any Law
applicable thereto, or any other matter arising under Environmental Laws or
relating to the use, presence, discharge or release of or exposure to
Hazardous Materials, whether before or after the date hereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , the foregoing release shall not apply with respect to any Claim by
the Purchaser Party or Investor B against Seller for fraud or for
indemnification by Seller under _Section 10.2_ , subject to the limitations
and conditions provided in _Sections 9.2_ , _10.1_ , _10.4_ and _10.6_ , as
applicable. Each of Purchaser Party and Investor B expressly waives the
benefits of any provision or principle of federal or state law or regulation

acknowledge and agree that except for the representations and warranties
expressly set forth herein or in any other documents executed or delivered in
connection with the Transaction, the Purchaser Parties and Investor B are not

Persons as to any matter concerning the Purchased Interests, the Properties or
the Self Storage Business or any other matter or thing whatsoever.



5.17 _Real Estate Taxes_. If, at any time during the thirteen (13) month
period following the Closing Date, the real estate taxes payable with respect
to any Property for any period ending on or before the Closing Date are
reduced or increased because of a change in the assessed valuation of such
Property or the tax rate or any other reason, then Purchaser shall deliver to
Seller a copy of any notice of such increase or decrease promptly after
receipt of same and (a) Seller shall pay to the applicable Purchaser an
amount equal to any additional amount owing by any Subsidiary on account
thereof for such period or (b) Purchaser shall pay to Seller the amount of any
refund received by any Subsidiary on account thereof for such period promptly

percentage ownership interests of any third parties in such Property.

VI. DROPPED PROPERTIES



6.1 _Effect of Dropping a Property_.



(a) If, in connection with the Ground Leases, any of the consents,
approvals or waivers set forth on _Schedule 6.1(a)_ have not been obtained by
the Closing Date, then upon request of the Purchaser Parties, Seller shall
drop any Property as to which such consent, approval or waiver relates and
thereafter, shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such
consent, approval or waiver.



(b) If Seller elects to drop a Property or not to sell a Property to Purchaser
under _Sections 2.3_ or _5.20_ , or if Purchaser requests Seller to drop a
Property under _Section 6.1(a)_ , then upon Sellers notice to Purchaser of
its election under _Section 2.3_ this Agreement will be deemed amended,
without any further action on the part of any party, with respect to each
affected Property (each, a " _Dropped Property_ "), as follows:



(i) the definition of Properties will not include that Property, except to
the extent that any provision that is stated to survive the termination of
this Agreement would be applicable to a Property, as applicable, and with
respect to this _Article VI_ to the extent necessary to implement this
_Article VI_ ;



(ii) Seller will not have any obligations with respect to the affected
Property, nor will any covenant, representation or warranty be deemed made
with respect to the affected Property except to the extent that any such
covenant, representation or warranty was made as of the date of this
Agreement or is stated to survive the termination of this Agreement, and the
Purchaser Parties will not have any rights or obligations under this Agreement
with respect to the affected Property except to the extent that such
obligation is stated to survive the termination of this Agreement;



(iii) the Estimated Purchase Price will be reduced by the Adjustment Amount of
the affected Property;



(iv) if the Property is the only Property owned by a Majority Subsidiary,
then, the Interests in such Majority Subsidiary shall be conveyed by the
owner thereof to Seller or its designee;



(v) if the Property is not the only Property owned by a Majority Subsidiary,
then immediately prior to the Closing Seller shall cause such Majority
Subsidiary to convey to Seller or its designee such Property and all other
personal property, contracts, leases and other assets relating to the
ownership, operation or maintenance of such Property by such deed and other
customary instruments of conveyance as shall be customary in real estate
conveyance transactions in the jurisdiction where the Property is located; 



 

-47- (vi) except with respect to the Property that is the subject of _Exhibit I_ if
it becomes a Dropped Property, at the option of Seller, the owner of such
Property and the management Affiliate of Purchaser will enter into a
management agreement providing for the management of such Property for a
management fee in the amount of six percent (6%) of gross revenues and
containing such other terms as are customary in the management agreements
pursuant to which Seller currently manages properties for third parties; and



(vii) if within ninety (90) calendar days following the Closing Seller shall
(i) cure the Material Title Exception(s) that caused Seller to drop such
Property or agree to give Purchaser a credit in the amount that would have
enabled Seller to include such Property or its owner in the initial Closing or
(ii) obtain such third party consent to transfer such Property or interests
in its owner to Purchaser as would have enabled Seller to include such
Property or interests in the initial Closing, and, in each case, provided that
(x) the provisions of _Section 2.3_ shall apply with respect to all Material
Title Objections applicable to such Property, except that Purchaser shall
have until the tenth (10th) Business Day following receipt of Sellers notice
to object to any additional Material Title Objections and/or Mandatory Removal
Exceptions not previously objected to or waived by Purchaser, and (y) all
other closing conditions with respect to such Property remain satisfied, then
Seller will have the right to elect by written notice to Purchaser or its
designee to sell such Property (or the interests in its owner) to Purchaser or
its designee for such Propertys Adjustment Amount. In such event, Purchaser
shall be obligated to purchase such Property (or the Interests in its owner)
at a closing to be held on the tenth (10th) Business Day after Sellers
election or such other date as shall be agreed upon. At such closing the
parties shall execute such instruments of conveyance and other documents and
agreements as shall, to the maximum extent possible, accord both Seller and
Purchaser with substantially the same rights and obligations in respect of
such Property (or owner) as would have been applicable had such Property (or
owner) not been dropped from the initial Closing. The parties shall cooperate
in good faith to agree on the form and substance of such closing documents.



VII. CASUALTY AND CONDEMNATION



7.1 _In General_. If, prior to the Closing Date, a Property is destroyed or
damaged by fire or other casualty or a Core Subsidiary receives notice or
Seller obtains Knowledge of condemnation or sale in lieu of condemnation of
a Property, Seller shall notify Purchaser of that event and provide Purchaser
with details of the extent of the damage or condemnation. Subject to _Section
9.1(d)_ , Purchaser shall be bound to purchase the Purchased Interests and
Properties for the full Estimated Purchase Price as required by the terms
hereof without regard to the occurrence or effect of any damage to Properties
or destruction of Improvements thereon or condemnation of any portion of a
Property.



7.2 _Insurance and Condemnation Proceeds_. With respect to any casualty or
condemnation affecting a Core Property after the date of this Agreement and
with respect to the casualty affecting Property #260 (Port Charlotte, FL),
which casualty occurred prior to the date of this Agreement, Purchaser shall
control negotiations regarding the settlement of any such claim for insurance
and condemnation proceeds. Purchaser shall not settle or compromise any claims
related to the damage, destruction or condemnation under the relevant
insurance policies or against a Governmental Entity effecting the
condemnation without Sellers consent, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. Purchaser will provide to Seller copies of



 

-48-  any material correspondence relating to any such claims and will advise
Seller of all material developments concerning such claims. Purchaser shall
receive a credit against the Estimated Purchase Price through an adjustment
to the Target Amount equal to the sum of (a) (i) all insurance and
condemnation proceeds received by Seller between the date hereof and the
Closing _less_ (ii) any amount reasonably expended by any Core Subsidiary to
Restore any Property to which such proceeds relate, _plus_ (b) with respect to
any casualty, if such Core Property has not been fully Restored prior to the
Closing Date, the product of (x) the direct or indirect percentage interest
of Seller in such Property multiplied by (y) the difference between (i) the
amount required to be expended to Restore such Property and (ii) any insurance
proceeds paid or payable in connection with such casualty. To the extent
applicable, Seller will give the applicable Core Subsidiary an assignment of
Sellers right to receive insurance or condemnation proceeds if any portion of
the insurance or condemnation proceeds are not collected before the Closing.
To the extent that Seller cannot assign its right to receive insurance or
condemnation proceeds to the applicable Subsidiary, Seller shall forward such
proceeds to such Subsidiary promptly following receipt thereof. Seller
will cooperate with Purchaser to effect the assignment of the right to
receive insurance or condemnation proceeds to Purchaser and will execute and
deliver all such instruments as are reasonably necessary to complete that
assignment. This obligation will survive the Closing. The proceeds of any
rent interruption insurance paid in respect of any casualty will be
apportioned between Seller and Purchaser as if the same were rent. Any
disputes arising in connection with the determination of the remaining cost
to Restore any Property shall be resolved by binding arbitration following the
Closing in accordance with _Section 11.15_ , and at the Closing Purchaser
shall receive a credit based upon the remaining cost to Restore such
Property as estimated by Seller. Upon the final resolution of such
arbitration, the appropriate party shall pay to the other party the difference
between the credit given at the Closing and the credit that should have been
given as so determined.

 



7.3 _Restoration Plans_. Seller will obtain Purchasers approval, which will
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, concerning any
restoration, repair or re-construction plans for any Core Property affected by
a casualty or condemnation between the date hereof and the Closing, the cost
of which (as reasonably estimated by Seller) will exceed $250,000. Seller
shall conduct all such restoration, repair and reconstruction substantially in
accordance with such restoration, repair and reconstruction plans approved by
Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller will be permitted to incur
or enter into an agreement to incur any amount reasonably necessary to effect
emergency or necessary repairs related to preservation of the Core Property or
health and safety matters or which are required by the terms of any lease,
loan document or other agreement to which any Core Subsidiary is a party.



VIII. CLOSING



8.1 _Closing_. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions
to closing contained in _Sections 8.2_ , _8.3_ , and  _8.4_ , the closing of
the Transactions (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at a date and time to be
specified by Seller and the Purchaser Parties (the " _Closing Date_ "), which
will be no earlier than (i) July 5, 2005, or (ii) the fifth (5th) Business
Day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
_Sections 8.2_ , _8.3_ , and _8.4_ (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or
waiver of those conditions), at the New York City office of Goodwin Procter
LLP or Clifford Chance US LLP, unless another time, date or place is agreed
by Seller and the Purchaser Parties. The Purchaser



 

-49-  Parties shall have the right to extend the Closing Date for up to twenty
(20) additional days upon written notice to Seller. In the event that the
Closing shall not have occurred as of the Outside Date (as may be adjourned
or extended as permitted by this Agreement) and the only conditions to the
obligations of the parties to close the Transactions that have not been
satisfied as of such date are the conditions set forth in _Section 8.2(c)_ ,
then either Seller or the Purchaser Parties shall be entitled, by notice to
the other party given no later than 11:59 p.m. on the Outside Date, to extend
the Outside Date by an additional thirty (30) days. The Outside Date may be
extended pursuant to the preceding sentence up to two times in the aggregate
for not more than a total of sixty (60) additional days.



8.2 _Conditions To Each Party s Obligation To Effect the Transfer_. The
respective obligations of each party to effect the Transactions will be
subject to the satisfaction or waiver by the Purchaser Parties, Investor B and
Seller, on or prior to the Closing Date, of the following conditions:



(a) _Governmental and Regulatory Approvals_. All consents, approvals and
actions of, filings with, and notices to, any Governmental Entity required by
Purchaser or Seller with regard to the Transactions, shall have been obtained
or made and remain in full force and effect.



(b) _HSR Act_. Any waiting period applicable to the consummation of the
Transactions under the HSR Act shall have expired or been terminated, and
no action shall have been instituted by the United States Department of
Justice or the United States Federal Trade Commission challenging or seeking
to enjoin the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which
action shall not have been withdrawn or terminated.



(c) _No Injunction or Restraint_. No preliminary or permanent injunction,
judgment, order, decree or Law entered, enacted, promulgated, enforced or
issued by any court or other Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction or
other legal restraint or prohibition (collectively, " _Restraints_ ") shall
be in effect prohibiting or materially restricting the consummation of the
Transactions; provided, however, that this condition shall be deemed satisfied
if the subject matter of such Restraint relates solely to the terms,
conditions or consummation of the LP Offer.



8.3 _Conditions To Obligations of Seller_. The obligations of Seller to effect
the Transactions will be further subject to satisfaction on or prior to the
Closing Date of each of the following conditions precedent, any of which may
be waived exclusively by Seller:



(a) _Representations and Warranties of the Purchaser Parties and Investor B_.
Each of the representations and warranties of the Purchaser Parties and
Investor B set forth in this Agreement shall be true and correct in all
respects as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing Date
(except to the extent that such representations and warranties are expressly
limited by their terms to another date, in which case such representations and
warranties shall be true and correct in all respects as of such other date),
except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be true and
correct would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, determined for purposes of this
_Section 8.3(a)_ without regard to any qualifications and exceptions contained
in such representations and warranties relating to materiality or Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect. As  



 

-50-  used in this Agreement, a " _Purchaser Material Adverse Effect_ " means any
circumstance, event, occurrence, change or effect that would reasonably be
expected to materially adversely affect the ability of the Purchaser Parties
or Investor B to timely perform their obligations under this Agreement or to
consummate the Transactions.



(b) _Performance of Covenants of the Purchaser Parties and Investor B_. The
Purchaser Parties and Investor B shall have performed in all material respects
all covenants (without regard, for purposes of this _Section 8.3(b)_ , to any
materiality qualifications contained in such covenants) required to be
performed by them under this Agreement on or prior to the Closing Date.



(c)  _Limited Partner Offer_. The purchase or exchange of any interests in
New SUSA validly tendered by Outside Partners of SUSA pursuant to the LP
Offer, as the case may be, shall have been consummated concurrently with the
Closing; provided, however, that this condition shall be deemed to be
satisfied if the consummation of the Exchange Offer has not occurred as
provided in _Section 1.3(j)_ or the consummation of the LP Offer has not
occurred solely because of the pendency of a Restraint prohibiting the
consummation of the LP Offer as described in _Section 8.2(c)_.



(d) _Closing Deliveries_. The Purchaser Parties and Investor B shall have made
the deliveries required to be made by them under _Section 8.5(a)_.



8.4 _Conditions To Obligations of the Purchaser Parties and Investor B_. The
obligations of the Purchaser Parties and Investor B to effect the
Transactions will be further subject to satisfaction on or prior to the
Closing Date of each of the following conditions precedent, any of which may
be waived exclusively by the Purchaser Parties or Investor B:

 



(a) _Representations and Warranties of Seller_. Each of the representations
and warranties of Seller set forth in this Agreement shall be true and correct
in all respects as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing
Date (except to the extent that such representations and warranties
are expressly limited by their terms to another date, in which case such
representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all respects as of
such other date), except where the failure of such representations and
warranties to be true and correct would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect,
determined for purposes of this _Section 8.4(a)_ without regard to any
qualifications and exceptions contained in such representations and
warranties relating to materiality or a Seller Material Adverse Effect (other
than the representation in clause (ii) of _Section 3.7(b)_ ).



(b) _Performance of Covenants of Seller_. Seller shall have performed in all
material respects all covenants (without regard, for purposes of this
_Section 8.4(b)_ , to any materiality qualifications contained in such
covenants) required to be performed by it under this Agreement on or prior to
the Closing Date.



(c) _Absence of Seller Material Adverse Effect_. Since the date of
this Agreement, no event, circumstance or change shall have occurred, that
individually or in the aggregate with one or more other events, circumstances
or changes, has had or would be reasonably expected to have, a Seller Material
Adverse Effect. As used in this Agreement, a " _Seller Material Adverse
Effect_ " means any circumstance, event, occurrence, change or effect that is
materially adverse to (x) the  



 

-51-  ability of Seller to timely perform its obligations under this Agreement or
to consummate the Transactions or (y) the business, properties,
liabilities, assets (tangible or intangible), condition (financial or
otherwise) or results of operations of the Seller Group, taken as a whole,
_provided_ , _however_ , that solely for the purposes of _Sections 8.4(a) and
(c)_ and clause (ii) of  _Section 3.7(b)_ , no circumstances, event,
occurrence, change, or effect proximately caused by any of the following shall
be deemed in itself, to constitute, and none of the following shall be taken
into account in determining whether there has been or will be, a Seller
Material Adverse Effect: (i) the execution or pendency of any of the
Transactions; (ii) conditions affecting the self-storage or real estate
industries generally that do not affect the Seller Group, taken as a whole, in
a materially disproportionate manner relative to other participants in the
self-storage or real estate industries, the United States or global economy or

the consummation of the LP Offer has not occurred (x) solely because of the
pendency of a Restraint prohibiting the consummation of the LP Offer as

-53- IX. TERMINATION; DEFAULT AND REMEDIES



9.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing Date:



(a) by mutual written consent of all the parties hereto at any time prior
to Closing;



(b) by the Purchaser Parties and Investor B or Seller, if any Restraint
having the effects set forth in _Section 8.2(c)_ shall be in effect and shall
have become final and nonappealable, provided that the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(b)_ shall have used
its reasonable best efforts to prevent entry of and to remove such Restraint;
and provided further that a material failure by the party seeking to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(b)_ to fulfill any
obligation under this Agreement shall not have been the principal cause of,
or resulted in, the imposition of such Restraint;



(c) by the Purchaser Parties and Investor B or Seller, if the Transfer is not
consummated by July 29, 2005, such later date as extended under
_Section 2.3(d)_ or the last three sentences of _Section 8.1_ or such other
date as to which the parties may agree in their respective sole discretion (as
so extended, the " _Outside Date_ "); provided, in the case of
termination pursuant to this _Section 9.1(c)_ , the terminating party shall
not have breached in any material respect its obligations under this Agreement
in any manner that shall have proximately contributed to the occurrence of the
failure referred to in this Section;



(d) by the Purchaser Parties and Investor B or Seller, if Properties with an
aggregate Adjustment Amount in excess of $300,000,000 shall have become
Dropped Properties;



(e) by Seller 



     | (i) | in the event the Purchaser Parties fail to pay the Estimated
Purchase Price at the Closing or perform their other obligations required to
be performed on the Closing Date (including the closing under the LP Offer),
upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Sections 8.2_ and _8.4_ ; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | upon a failure to perform any other material covenant of
the Purchaser Parties and Investor B set forth in this Agreement in any
material respect, which failure has remained uncured for more than fifteen
(15) Business Days following notice thereof to the Purchaser Parties and makes
any of the conditions contained in _Sections 8.2_ or _8.3(c)_ incapable of
being satisfied as of the Outside Date; or  
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | in the event that any representation or warranty of the
Purchaser Parties or Investor B contained in this Agreement is or shall have
become untrue and such untruth remains uncured for more than fifteen (15)
Business Days following the notice thereof to the Purchaser Parties and makes
any of the conditions contained in _Section 8.3(a)_ incapable of being
satisfied as of the Outside Date; 
---|---|--- 


 

-54- _provided_ _that_ notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in
the event that the Closing occurs following a breach of a covenant or
representation that does not give Seller the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 9.1(e)_ but with respect to which Seller has given
the Purchaser Parties and Investor B not less that fifteen (15) Business Days
notice following which such breach remains uncured, Seller shall be entitled
to seek actual (but not consequential, punitive or other special) damages from
the Purchaser Parties and Investor B that Seller may have incurred by reason
of such breaches.



(f) by the Purchaser Parties and Investor B, (i) upon a failure to perform in
any material respect any material covenant of Seller set forth in this
Agreement, or (ii) in the event that any representation or warranty of Seller
contained in this Agreement is or shall have become untrue, in the case of
either clause (i) or (ii), (x) such that the conditions set forth in _Sections
8.2_ or _8.4(a)_ or _Section 8.4(b)_ , as the case may be, would be incapable
of being satisfied by the Outside Date (as it may be extended) and (y) if
such breach cannot be or has not been cured within fifteen (15) Business Days
after the giving of written notice to Seller of such breach.



The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1_
shall give written notice of such termination to the other parties.



9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either Seller or the Purchaser Parties and Investor B as provided in _Section
9.1_ , this Agreement will forthwith become void and have no further effect,
without any liability or obligation on the part of the Purchaser Parties and
Investor B or Seller (other than _Sections 2.2_ and _9.3_ , this _Section 9.2_
and _Article XI_ , which provisions shall survive such termination along with
any other provisions which by their terms survive such termination).



9.3 _Defaults and Remedies_. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, if the Closing does not occur by reason of any
default of the Seller, the Purchaser Parties and Investor B as their sole
remedy may elect any one of the following:



(i) terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.1_ , with the
effects specified in _Section 9.2_ ; or



(ii) sue for specific performance of Sellers obligations under this
Agreement.



Except as provided in this _Section 9.3_ and _Section 10.2_ , the Purchaser
Parties and Investor B will have no other remedy or right to seek any other
damages at law or remedy in equity with respect to such default, absent
fraud. It is understood and agreed that the Purchaser Parties and Investor B
shall have the right of injunctive relief under _Section 11.10_ to enforce
Sellers obligations hereunder.



(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
(except to the extent otherwise provided in the last proviso in _Section
9.1(e)_ ), if any event or condition described in _Section 9.1(e)_ shall have
occurred, Sellers sole and exclusive remedy with respect thereto will be to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.1(e)_ and to receive,
as liquidated damages, payment from the Purchaser Parties and Investor B
(whose liability for the amount payable to Seller under this  _Section
9.3(b)_ shall be joint and several) in immediately  



 

-55-  available funds of $70,000,000, at which time this Agreement will be null
and void and no party hereto shall have any rights or obligations under
this Agreement, except for such provisions that are expressly stated to
survive the termination of this Agreement. Seller, Investor B and the
Purchaser Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) such liquidated amount is a
reasonable estimate of and bears a reasonable relationship to the damages
that would be suffered and costs incurred by Seller as a result of having
withdrawn the Self Storage Business and Purchased Interests from sale and the
failure of the Closing to occur due to a default of the Purchaser Parties and
Investor B (or any of them) under this Agreement; (ii) the actual damages
suffered and costs incurred by Seller as a result of such withdrawal and
failure to close due to a default of the Purchaser Parties and Investor B
(or any of them) under this Agreement would be extremely difficult and
impractical to determine; (iii) the Purchaser Parties and Investor B seek to
limit their liability under this Agreement to such liquidated amount in the
event this Agreement is terminated and the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement does not close due to a default of the Purchaser Parties and
Investor B (or any of them) under this Agreement; and (iv) such liquidated
amount shall be and constitutes valid liquidated damages.



X. SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION



10.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The representations and
warranties of the parties to this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date for
a period of thirteen (13) months following the Closing Date, except for (x)

similar provision of state, local or foreign law), or (B) as a transferee or
successor; and 



(j) any liability, obligation, Tax, fine or penalty under, in connection
with, or relating to a Plan maintained or contributed to by a Seller Group
Entity (other than a New SUSA Plan) or any entity deemed to be a single
employer within the meaning of Section 414(b), (c), (m), (n) or (o) of the

representation in a Title Affidavit (other than a breach by Seller of Section
7 thereof), provided that the indemnification by Purchaser Parties and
Investor B under this _Section 10.3(a)(iv)_ shall not prevent or prohibit the
Purchaser Indemnitees from otherwise seeking indemnification from Seller
pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_ , _(b)_ or _(c)_ hereof, as and to the extent
applicable, notwithstanding that such claim for indemnification may arise from
the same or similar facts or circumstances giving rise to the Title Companys
Claim against the Seller in connection with the Title Affidavit.



(b) From and after the Closing Date (and from and after the date of this
Agreement with respect to _Section 10.3(b)(ii)_ ), Purchaser A and Investor
A shall, jointly and severally, subject to the provisions of this _Article X_
, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller Indemnitees from and against

any such suit, action, Claim, arbitration, proceeding or investigation that

any and all Losses that may be suffered or incurred by any Seller Indemnitee
arising out of, resulting from or relating to the failure to obtain any such

10.4 _Character of Indemnity Payments_. The parties agree that
any indemnification payments made with respect to this Agreement shall be
treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase
Price, unless otherwise required by law (including by a determination of a Tax
authority that, under applicable law, is not subject to further review or
appeal).



10.5 _Notice and Resolution of Claims_.



(a)  _Notice_. Each Person entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section
10.2_ or _10.3_ (an " _Indemnitee_ ") shall give written notice to the
indemnifying party or parties from whom indemnity is sought (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") promptly after obtaining knowledge of any claim that
it may have under _Section 10.2_ or _10.3_ , as applicable. The notice shall
set forth in reasonable detail the claim and the basis for indemnification.
Failure to give the notice in a timely manner shall not release the
Indemnifying Party from its obligations under _Section 10.2_ or _10.3_ , as
applicable, except to the extent that the failure materially prejudices
the ability of the Indemnifying Party to contest that claim.



(b)  _Defense of Third Party Claims_. If a claim for indemnification pursuant
to _Section 10.2_ or _10.3_ shall arise from any action made or brought by a
third party that would reasonably be expected to result in indemnifiable
Losses (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnifying Party may assume the
defense of the Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of the Third Party Claim, the defense shall be conducted by counsel
chosen by the Indemnifying Party, who shall be reasonably acceptable to
Indemnitee, provided that the Indemnitee shall retain the right to employ its
own counsel and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim at its own
expense (which shall not be recoverable from the Indemnifying Party under
this _Article X_ unless (i) the Indemnitee is advised by counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party that use of counsel of the Indemnifying
Partys choice would be expected to  



 

-59-  give rise to a conflict of interest, (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not
have employed counsel to represent the Indemnitee within a reasonable time
after notice of the assertion of any such claim or institution of any such
action or proceeding, or (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall authorize the
Indemnitee in writing to employ separate counsel at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party, in each of which cases the reasonable expenses of counsel
to the Indemnitee shall be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party). In no event
shall the Indemnifying Party be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more
than one counsel (other than local counsel) for all Indemnitees with respect
to any claim indemnified under this _Article X_ ; _provided_ , that an
Indemnitee shall be entitled to employ separate counsel at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party if the Indemnitee is advised by counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party that use of such other counsel would
give rise to a conflict of interest, in which case the reasonable expenses of
counsel to such Indemnitee shall be reimbursed by the Indemnifying
Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 10.5(b)_ ,
(i) no Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to settle any Third Party Claim
for which indemnification is sought under _Section 10.2_ or _10.3_ without
the Indemnitees prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless it has assumed the defense of such
Third Party Claim and as part of the settlement the Indemnitee is released
from all liability with respect to the Third Party Claim and the settlement
does not impose any equitable remedy on the Indemnitee or require the
Indemnitee to admit any fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf
of the Indemnitee, and (ii) no Indemnitee shall be entitled to settle any
Third Party Claim for which indemnification is sought under _Section 10.2_ or
_10.3_ without the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless the Third Party
claim is for money damages only and such settlement does not include a
statement as to, or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by
or on behalf of the Indemnifying Party and as part of such settlement
the Indemnifying Party is released from all liability (for indemnification
pursuant to this _Article X_ and otherwise) with respect to such Third Party
Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnitee within twenty
(20) Business Days after receipt of the Indemnitees notice of a Third Party
Claim of indemnity hereunder that it elects to assume the control of the
defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall have the right to
contest the Third Party Claim but shall not thereby waive any right to
indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement and the costs of such actions by
the Indemnitee shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party.



(c) _Litigation_. Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section_ _10.5(b)_ ,
except with respect to the California Litigation and any action, suit,
proceeding, hearing, investigation, charge, complaint, Claim or demand arising
as set forth in _Section 10.2(f)_ for which Seller has an indemnity obligation
hereunder, Investor A shall manage any action, suit, proceeding, hearing,
investigation, charge, complaint, Claim or demand in connection with any fact,
situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan,
occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act or transaction related to
the Self Storage Business and brought against Seller or Seller Indemnitee, as
more specifically set forth in _Section 5.10(a)_.



10.6 _Limitations on Liability_.



(a) _Exclusion of Certain De Minimis Matters_. No Indemnifying Party shall
have any obligation or liability to any Indemnitee pursuant to
_Section 10.2(a)_ or _(b)_ or _Section 10.3(a)(i)_ or _(ii)_ with respect to
any single event or condition, or series of related events, conditions or
items arising out of substantially the same facts, with respect to which the
Losses incurred or suffered by the Indemnitee shall not have exceeded
$100,000 (any such event or condition or series of related events, conditions
or items being hereinafter referred to as a " _De Minimis Matter_ ").



 

-60- (b) _Deductible_.



(i) Seller shall not have any obligation or liability to any Purchaser
Indemnitee under _Section 10.2(a)_ , _(b)_ or _(c)_ unless and until the
aggregate amount of Losses incurred or suffered by the Purchaser Indemnitees
arising out of the matters referred to in _Section 10.2(a)_ , _(b)_ and _(c)_
, exclusive of any and all Losses arising out of De Minimis Matters, shall
have exceeded $3,000,000, in which case Seller shall be obligated and liable
under _Section 10.2(a)_ , _(b)_ and _(c)_ only with respect to such excess.



(ii) The Purchaser Parties and Investor B shall not have any obligation or
liability to any Seller Indemnitee under _Section 10.3(a)(i)_ or _(ii)_ unless
and until the aggregate amount of Losses suffered by the Seller Indemnitees
arising out of the matters referred to in _Section 10.3(a)(i)_  and _(ii)_ ,
exclusive of any and all Losses arising out of De Minimis Matters, shall have
exceeded $3,000,000, in which case each Purchaser Party and Investor B shall
be severally obligated and liable under _Section 10.3(a)(i)_ and  _(ii)_ only
with respect to such excess.



(c) _Limit of Liability_. The aggregate liability of Seller, on the one hand,
or the Purchaser Parties, as applicable, and Investor B, on the other hand,

Representations and Warranties of the Purchaser Parties), _Section
10.3(a)(ii)_ (Inaccuracy of Special Purchaser Representation), and _Section
10.3(a)(iii)_ (Breach of Covenants by the Purchaser Parties), collectively,
shall not exceed the Estimated Purchase Price as adjusted pursuant to
_Section 1.7_ ; and



(iv) under _Section 10.2(e)_ (Indenture Indebtedness), _Section 10.2(f)_
(Claims by Outside Partners), _Section 10.2(g)_ (Payments under Tax Protection
Agreements), _Section 10.2(h)_ (California Litigation), _Section 10.2(j)_

10.3(b)_ (Conduct of Self Storage Business; Liability for Offer Documents; and
Litigation) and _Section10.3(c)_ (Failure to Obtain Certain Consents),
respectively, shall not be subject to any limits.



(d) _Limit on Time for Assertion of Claims_. Neither Seller nor the Purchaser
Parties and Investor B shall have any obligation or liability pursuant to
_Section 10.2_ or _Section 10.3_ , respectively, for any breach of any
representation or warranty unless notice of a claim asserting  



 

-61-  such breach shall have been given in accordance with _Section 10.5_ prior to
the termination of the survival period applicable to such representation

at law or in equity.

Agreement, Seller, Investor B and the Purchaser Parties shall comply with the

Person to file or commence) any action or proceeding against the other

matter of the Litigation Notice prior to the expiration of such ninety (90)
day period.



11.11  _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision will be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

costs and inspection fees, including the costs of environmental and
engineering reviews and audits, appraisals, accounting and other financial

responsible for any reasonable fees, costs and expenses paid to lenders and
their counsel in obtaining consents for any debt assumptions, modifications
or waiver related to the Existing Loans and any required ratings
confirmations. The Purchaser Parties and Investor B (with respect to Purchaser
B, Purchaser C, Purchaser D, Purchaser E and Purchaser F only) will be
responsible for prepayment penalties, bank fees and other associated costs to
prepay Existing Loans if Purchaser elects to require any entity in the SUSA
Group to prepay any Existing Loans. The Purchaser Parties and Investor B (with
respect to Purchaser B, Purchaser C, Purchaser D, Purchaser E and Purchaser F
only) will be responsible for any premiums and other charges and fees
including, if applicable, any cancellation fees, for the Title Commitments,
any title policies, any UCC or other searches, any surveys and for
any lenders policy of title insurance. Seller, on the one hand, and the
Purchaser Parties and Investor B, on the other hand, will each be responsible
for one-half of any transfer taxes and recording fees incurred in connection
with the Transactions. Seller will have no responsibility for obtaining or
paying for any Surveys or Title Commitments.

11.13(b)_ , Investor B shall have no liability under this Agreement of any
nature whatsoever.



11.14 _Further Assurances_. The parties hereto agree that, from time to time,
whether before, at or after the Closing Date, each of them will execute and
deliver such further instruments of conveyance (including conveyance of all of
parcels of land associated with each of the Properties to the extent not
otherwise directly or indirectly conveyed in connection with the Closing) and
transfer and take such other actions as may be necessary to carry out the
purposes and intents of this Agreement.



11.15 _Arbitration_.



(a) Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to
this Agreement that specifically requires arbitration hereunder or as to
which all of the parties involved agree should be referred to an arbitration
for resolution (each a " _Dispute_ "), shall be finally settled under the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA (or any similar successor rules
thereto) as are in force on the date when a notice of arbitration is received.



(b) The party seeking to initiate an arbitration proceeding shall deliver to
the other parties a notice (the " _Pre-Arbitration Notice_ ") which states
the matter(s) in Dispute. The parties shall attempt to negotiate a resolution
of such Dispute in good faith for a period of thirty (30) days following the
receipt of the Pre-Arbitration Notice by all other parties (but the Closing
Date shall not be extended for such purpose). If the parties are unable to
negotiate a resolution by the end of the thirty (30) day period, any of the
parties shall submit the Dispute for binding arbitration in the manner set out
in this _Section 11.15_.



(c) The AAA shall propose arbitrator(s) that are, to the extent reasonably
possible, experts in the subject matter of the Dispute. The number of
arbitrators shall be three (3) unless all parties to the arbitration agree to
one (1). The AAA shall provide, upon a partys request a list of ten (10)
proposed arbitrators, and each party to the arbitration shall be permitted to
strike up to four (4) names of proposed arbitrators from such list. If
following such strikes there are not at least three (3) names (or not at least
(1) name, if the parties have agreed that the arbitral tribunal shall consist
of one (1) arbitrator) remaining on the list to attempt to seat an arbitration
panel, then the AAA shall provide an additional list of (10) proposed
arbitrators, and each party to the arbitration shall once again be permitted
to strike up to four (4) names of proposed arbitrators from such additional
list. The foregoing process shall be repeated until the list or lists contain
at least three (3) names (or at least one (1) name, as applicable) of
proposed arbitrator(s) from which to seat the required arbitration panel (or
the single arbitrator, as applicable). Promptly thereafter, the parties to the
arbitration shall negotiate in good faith for up to ten (10) days to mutually
select the  



 

-68-  arbitration panel and the chairperson of such panel. If at the end of such
10-day period such parties have been unable to agree on the arbitration panel
or on the chairperson of such panel (or the single arbitrator, as
applicable), then the AAA shall, in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration
Rules, select same from such remaining names on such proposed list or lists.
The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in New York, New York.



(d) The decision of the arbitral tribunal shall be final and binding upon the
parties, and such decision shall be enforceable through any courts having
jurisdiction. The arbitral tribunal shall be bound by the provisions of this
Agreement and shall have no authority to add to, subtract from or otherwise
modify such provisions. The arbitral tribunal may, however, interpret the
provisions of this Agreement provided that such interpretation is made in a
manner consistent with this _Section 11.15_. The arbitral tribunal shall have
the right to award or include in their award any relief they deem proper in
the circumstances except for any such relief that is specifically excluded or
limited by the other provisions of this Agreement. The costs and expenses of
arbitration shall be allocated and paid by the parties as determined by the
arbitral tribunal.



(e) The arbitral tribunal shall have the authority to make such orders
granting interim or provisional relief during the pendency of the arbitration
as it deems just and equitable. Any such order shall be without prejudice to
the final determination of the controversy.
