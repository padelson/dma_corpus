iv AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (" _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into
as of October 21, 2016, by and among: Ziff Davis, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (" _Parent_ "); Project Echo Acquisition Corp., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Purchaser_ "); solely
with respect to Section 9.11, j2 Global, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "
_Guarantor_ "); and Everyday Health, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "
_Company_ "). Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in
Exhibit A .

 

RECITALS

 

A. The Boards of Directors of each of the Company, Parent and Purchaser
have approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

B. In furtherance of such acquisition, Parent has agreed to cause
Purchaser to commence a cash tender offer (as it may be amended from time to
time as permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to acquire all of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Shares_ ") for $10.50 per
share (such amount, or any higher amount per share paid pursuant to the Offer,
being the " _Offer Price_ "), net to the seller of such Company Common Stock
in cash, without interest, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement.

C. Following the consummation of the Offer, Purchaser will be merged with
and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company continuing as the
surviving corporation in the merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby,
except as expressly provided in Section 2.5, (i) each issued and outstanding
Share that is not (x) a Company Owned Share or (y) a Dissenting Share shall be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration and (ii) the
Company shall become a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent as a result of the
Merger.

 

D. The Company Board has (i) determined that this Agreement and the
Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, are fair and advisable to,
and in the best interest of, the Company and its stockholders, (ii) agreed
that the Merger Agreement shall be subject to Section 251(h) of the DGCL,
(iii) approved the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, including the Offer and
the Merger and (iv) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the Company
tender their shares to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer (the " _Company Board
Recommendation_ ").

E. The Board of Directors of each of Parent and Purchaser have approved
this Agreement and declared it advisable for Parent and Purchaser,
respectively, to enter into this Agreement.

 

F. Parent, Purchaser and the Company acknowledge and agree that the Merger
shall be effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL and shall, subject
to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, be consummated
immediately following the Offer Acceptance Time. G. Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
as a condition and inducement to Parents and Purchasers willingness to
enter into this Agreement, certain holders of the Company Common Stock are
entering into a Tender Agreement with Purchaser in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit 1_ (collectively, the " _Tender Agreements_ ").

AGREEMENT

 

The Parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

 



   SECTION 1. | THE OFFER 
---|--- 



     | 1.1 | The Offer. 
---|---|--- 

(a) Commencement of the Offer. Provided that this Agreement shall not have
been terminated in accordance with Section 8, as promptly as practicable after
the date of this Agreement but in no event more than seven (7) Business Days
after the date of this Agreement, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange
Act) the Offer.

 

(b) Terms and Conditions of the Offer. The obligations of Purchaser to, and
of Parent to cause Purchaser to, accept for payment, and pay for, any Shares
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer are subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the prior
satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction or waiver of the
other conditions set forth in Annex I (collectively, the " _Offer Conditions_
"). The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") that contains the terms set forth in this Agreement, the Minimum
Condition and the other Offer Conditions. Purchaser expressly reserves the
right (in its sole discretion) to (i) increase the Offer Price, (ii) waive, in
whole or in part, any Offer Condition and (iii) make any other changes in the
terms and conditions of the Offer not inconsistent with the terms of this
Agreement; _provided, however,_ that unless otherwise provided by this
Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Company, Purchaser shall
not (A) decrease the Offer Price, (B) change the form of consideration payable
in the Offer, (C) decrease the maximum number of Shares sought to be purchased
in the Offer, (D) impose conditions or requirements to the Offer in addition
to the Offer Conditions, (E) amend or modify any of the Offer Conditions in a
manner that adversely affects, or would reasonably be likely to adversely
affect, any holder of Shares, (F) change or waive the Minimum Condition or
any of the Specified Offer Conditions, (G) extend or otherwise change the
Expiration Date in a manner other than as required or permitted by this
Agreement, or (H) provide any "subsequent offering period" within the meaning
of Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Offer may not be
withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date (or any rescheduled Expiration Date) of
the Offer, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8\.

 



2 (c) Expiration and Extension of the Offer. The Offer shall initially be
scheduled to expire at one minute following 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time (the "
_Offer Expiration Time_ "), on the date that is twenty (20) Business Days
following the Offer Commencement Date, determined as set forth in Rule
14d-1(g)(3) and pursuant to Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act (unless
otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company) (the " _Initial
Expiration Date,_ " such date or such subsequent date to which the expiration
of the Offer is extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the "
_Expiration Date_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, but subject to the Parties respective termination rights
under Section 8: (i) if, as of the scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer
Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived, Purchaser may, in its
discretion (and without the consent of the Company or any other
Person), extend the Offer on one or more occasions, for an additional period
of up to ten (10) Business Days per extension (the length of such period to be
determined by Purchaser), to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied; (ii)
Purchaser shall extend the Offer from time to time for: (A) any period
required by any Legal Requirement, any interpretation or position of the SEC,
the staff thereof or the New York Stock Exchange applicable to the Offer
(including in order to comply with Rule 14e-1(b) promulgated under the
Exchange Act in respect of any change in the Offer Price); and (B) periods of
up to ten (10) Business Days per extension, until any waiting period (and any
extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Offer under the HSR
Act or any foreign Antitrust Law in a jurisdiction identified in Part 6.2(c)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall have expired or been terminated; and
(iii) if, as of the scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not
satisfied and has not been waived, at the request of the Company, Purchaser
shall extend the Offer on one or more occasions for an additional period of up
to ten (10) Business Days per extension (the length of such period to be
determined by Purchaser), to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied;
_provided, however,_ that in no event shall Purchaser: (1) be required to
extend the Offer beyond the earliest to occur of (the " _Extension Deadline_
") (x) the valid termination of this Agreement in compliance with Section 8
and (y) the first Business Day immediately following the End Date; or (2) be
permitted to extend the Offer beyond the Extension Deadline without the prior
written consent of the Company. Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior
to any scheduled Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the
Company except in the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 8\.

(d) Termination of Offer. Except in connection with a valid termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8, Purchaser shall not terminate or
withdraw the Offer without the prior written consent of the Company. In the
event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8, Purchaser shall
(and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) promptly (and, in any event, within
twenty-four (24) hours of such termination (or the next Business Day if
terminated on a non-Business Day)), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate
the Offer and shall not acquire any Shares pursuant to the Offer. If the
Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Purchaser, Purchaser shall promptly
return, and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Purchaser to
return, in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements, all tendered Shares
to the registered holders thereof.

 



3 (e) Offer Documents . On the Offer Commencement Date, Parent and Purchaser
shall (x) file with the SEC a tender offer statement on Schedule TO with
respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements thereto and
including exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") that will contain or
incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase and form of the related letter
of transmittal, summary advertisement, notice of guaranteed delivery and other
ancillary offer documents pursuant to which the Offer will be made (such
Schedule TO and documents, together with any supplements or amendments
thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and (y) cause the Offer Documents to be
disseminated to holders of Shares as and to the extent required by applicable
federal securities laws and the rules of the SEC thereunder. Parent and
Purchaser agree that they shall cause the Offer Documents filed by either
Parent or Purchaser with the SEC to comply in all material respects with the
Exchange Act and other applicable Legal Requirements. Each of Parent,
Purchaser and the Company agrees to promptly correct any information provided
by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect,
and Parent further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer
Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to
holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
federal securities laws and the rules of the SEC thereunder. The Company
shall promptly furnish in writing or otherwise make available to Parent and
Purchaser or Parents legal counsel all information concerning the Company and
the Companys stockholders that may be required in connection with any action
contemplated by this Section 1.1(e) or reasonably requested for inclusion in
the Offer Documents. Parent and Purchaser shall: (i) provide the Company and
its counsel reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer
Documents and any amendments and supplements thereto prior to the filing
thereof with the SEC; (ii) give reasonable and good faith consideration to any
comments made by the Company and its counsel; (iii) provide in writing to the
Company and its counsel any written comments Parent, Purchaser or their
counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents promptly after receipt of such comments (and shall give the Company
prompt telephonic notice of any material discussions with the SEC staff); (iv)
respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Offer Documents or the Offer; and (v) provide the Company and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the formulation of any response to
any such comments of the SEC or its staff and a reasonable opportunity to
participate in any discussions with the SEC or its staff concerning
such comments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Purchaser shall not
be required to provide the Company the opportunity to review or comment on (or
include comments proposed by the Company in) or permit the Company to
participate in any discussions regarding the Offer Documents, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, or any comments thereon, to the extent
relating to any action that may be taken by Parent or Purchaser in connection
with any Acquisition Proposal, Change in Circumstance or Company Adverse
Change Recommendation, or the reasons for any such actions by Parent or
Purchaser. Each document required to be filed by the Parent or Purchaser with
the SEC in connection with the Offer (the " _Parent Disclosure Documents_ ")
(including the Schedule TO), and any amendments or supplements thereto, when
filed, distributed or disseminated, as applicable, will comply as to form in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act.
The Parent Disclosure Documents, at the time of the filing of such Parent
Disclosure Documents or any supplement or amendment thereto with the SEC and
at the time such Parent Disclosure Documents or any supplements or
amendments thereto are first distributed or disseminated to the Companys
stockholders, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. None of the information with respect to Parent or Purchaser that
Parent or Purchaser furnishes to the Company in writing specifically for use
in the Schedule 14D-9 will, at the time such document is filed with the SEC,
at any time such document is amended or supplemented or at the time such
document is first published, sent or given to the Companys stockholders,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Parent nor the Purchaser makes any representation
with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Parent Disclosure Documents.

 



4 (f) Funds. Without limiting the generality of Section 9.10, Parent shall
cause to be provided to Purchaser all of the funds necessary to purchase any
Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer, and
shall cause Purchaser to perform, on a timely basis, all of
Purchasers obligations under this Agreement. Parent and Purchaser shall, and
each of Parent and Purchaser shall ensure that all of their respective
Affiliates shall, tender any Shares held by them into the Offer.

 

(g) Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Offer
Acceptance Time, the outstanding Shares are changed into a different number
or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of
shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the
Offer Price, the Merger Consideration and, if applicable, any other amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement, shall be appropriately and proportionately
adjusted; _provided_ that nothing in this Section 1.1(g) shall be
construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its
securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.



     | 1.2 | Company Actions. 
---|---|--- 

(a) Schedule 14D-9 . On the day that the Schedule TO is first filed with
the SEC, the Company shall file with the SEC and disseminate to holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws and the rules of the SEC thereunder, a Tender Offer
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") that,
subject to Section 6.1(b), shall reflect the Company Board Recommendation and
include a copy of the fairness opinion described in Section 3.23, and a notice
of appraisal rights in accordance with and as required by Section 262 of the
DGCL. The Company agrees that it shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply in
all material respects with the Exchange Act and other applicable Legal
Requirements. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to respond
promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff and to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent
that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause
the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required
by applicable federal securities laws and the rules of the SEC thereunder.
Parent and Purchaser shall promptly furnish in writing or otherwise make
available to the Company or the Companys legal counsel all information
concerning Parent and Purchaser and their stockholders that may be required in
connection with any action contemplated by this Section 1.2(a) or that is
reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. The
Company shall: (i) provide Parent and its counsel reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendment or supplement
thereto prior to the filing thereof with the SEC; (ii) give reasonable and
good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent and its counsel, (iii)
provide in writing to Parent and its counsel any written comments the Company
or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments (and shall give Parent
prompt telephonic notice of any material discussions with the SEC staff); (iv)
respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9; and (v) provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the formulation of any response to any such
comments of the SEC or its staff and a reasonable opportunity to participate
in any discussions with the SEC or its staff concerning such comments.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the obligations of the
Company in the immediately preceding sentence shall not apply if the
Company Board effects a Company Adverse Change Recommendation or has formally
determined to do so in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Each
document required to be filed by the Company with the SEC in connection with
the Offer (the " _Company Disclosure Documents_ ") (including the Schedule
14D-9), and any amendments or supplements thereto, when filed, distributed or
disseminated, as applicable, will comply as to form in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act. The Company Disclosure
Documents, at the time of the filing of such Company Disclosure Documents or
any supplement or amendment thereto with the SEC and at the time such Company
Disclosure Documents or any supplements or amendments thereto are first
distributed or disseminated to the Companys stockholders, will not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The information with
respect to the Company that the Company furnishes to Parent or Purchaser in
writing specifically for use in the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents, at
the time of any such document is filed with the SEC, at any time any such
document is amended or supplemented or at the time any such document is first
published, sent or given to the Companys stockholders, will not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company makes no representation with respect to statements
made or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by or
on behalf of Parent or Purchaser for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Company Disclosure Documents.

 



5 (b) Stockholder Lists. The Company shall cause its transfer agent to
promptly (and in no event more than five (5) Business Days after the date of
this Agreement) furnish Parent with a list of its stockholders, mailing labels
and any available listings or computer files containing the names and
addresses of all record and, to the extent available, beneficial holders of
Shares and lists of securities positions of Shares held in stock depositories,
in each case, accurate and complete as of the most recent practicable date,
and shall provide to Parent such additional information (including updated
lists of stockholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and
such other assistance as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the
Offer. Subject to any Legal Requirements, Parent and Purchaser and their
agents shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels,
listings and files, shall use such information only in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon
written request by the Company, deliver, and shall use their reasonable

without the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company.
The Merger shall be effected under Section 251(h) of the DGCL. The Merger

2.5 Conversion of Shares.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or any other Person:

(i) any Shares that are (A) then held by the Company as treasury
stock, (B) held by the Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Performance Warrant Shares), or
(C) owned by Parent, Purchaser or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Company
Owned Shares_ ") shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor, and each holder of
a Certificate representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto;

(ii) subject to Section 2.5(b), each Share then outstanding (other than
any Company Owned Shares or Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the
right to receive the Offer Price in cash, without interest (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "), subject to any withholding of Taxes required by
applicable Legal Requirements in accordance with Section 2.6(f) upon surrender
of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share representing such Share in accordance
with Section 2.6(b); and

(iii) each share of the common stock, without par value, of Purchaser
then outstanding shall be converted into one fully paid, non-assessable share
of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or class of shares by
reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend,
reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Merger
Consideration shall be appropriately and proportionately adjusted; _provided_
that nothing in this Section 2.5(b) shall be construed to permit the Company
to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the
terms of this Agreement.

2.6 Surrender of Certificates; Stock Transfer Books.

 

(a) Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent shall designate and enter
into a customary exchange agreement with a bank or trust company, selected by
Parent with the Companys prior approval, to act as agent (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock to receive the
funds to which holders of such shares shall become entitled pursuant to
Section 2.5. The Paying Agent agreement pursuant to which Parent shall appoint
the Paying Agent shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Company. At or prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent or Purchaser shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash sufficient
to make payment of the cash consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.5
(together, the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund shall not be used for
any other purpose. To the extent the amount of the Payment Fund is below the
level required to make prompt payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration
for any reason (including in the event any Dissenting Shares cease to be
Dissenting Shares), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall promptly
replace or restore the lost portion of such fund so as to ensure that it is,
at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments. Any
investment of the Payment Fund shall in all events be limited to direct
short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated A-1
or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that
are then publicly available). No such investment or loss thereon shall affect
the amounts payable to any former holder of Shares pursuant to this Section
2\.

 



8 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will cooperate
to establish procedures with the Paying Agent and the Depository Trust
Company (" _DTC_ ") with the objective that (i) if the Closing occurs at or
prior to 11:30 a.m., Eastern time, on the Closing Date, then the Paying
Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees on the Closing Date an amount in
cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal to (A) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Company Owned Shares and
Dissenting Shares) held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to
the Effective Time; multiplied by (B) the Merger Consideration (such amount,
the " _DTC Payment_ "); and (ii) if the Closing occurs after 11:30 a.m.,
Eastern time, on the Closing Date, then the Paying Agent will transmit the
DTC Payment to DTC or its nominees on the first Business Day after the Closing
Date.

 

(c) Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than three (3)
Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to
each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of the shares
of Company Common Stock entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant
to Section 2.5 (including in connection with an exercise or deemed exercise
of a Company Warrant pursuant to Section 2.8) a form of letter of transmittal
(which shall be in customary form reasonably acceptable to the Company and
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the certificates evidencing such shares (the " _Certificates_ ") shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss
in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to such letter
of transmittal. Each holder of Shares (including in connection with an
exercise or deemed exercise of a Company Warrant pursuant to Section
2.8) that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration shall promptly upon (i) in the case of Shares represented by a
Certificate, surrender to the Paying Agent of Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions or reasonably be requested by the Paying Agent, or (ii) in the
case of Book-Entry Shares, adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter
of transmittal and receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent (or
such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably
request), be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration
for each such share of Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares shall then be canceled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on
the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares for the benefit of the holder thereof. If the payment of any
Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the surrendered Certificates formerly evidencing the shares of Company
Common Stock is registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it
shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or
shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. Payment of
the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall
only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are
registered.

 



9 (d) At any time following six (6) months after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver
to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and not
disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (including all
interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all
funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled
to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat
and other similar Legal Requirements) only as general creditors thereof with
respect to the Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by them. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be
liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the Merger
Consideration delivered in respect of such share to a public official pursuant
to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar Legal Requirements.
Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Body
shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the
property of the Surviving Corporation or its designee, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(e) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company with respect to the shares of Company Common
Stock shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of the shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise provided
herein or by applicable Legal Requirements.

 

(f) Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Purchaser shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and
withhold) from the Merger Consideration payable to any holder of the Shares or
any other consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as it is required by any Legal Requirement to deduct and withhold
with respect to Taxes. Each such payor shall take all action that may be
necessary to ensure that any such amounts so withheld are promptly and
properly remitted to the appropriate Governmental Body. If any withholding
obligation may be avoided by a payee providing information or documentation
to the applicable payor, such payor shall request such information from such
payee and use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid such withholding
obligation. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and remitted, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock or other
recipient of consideration hereunder in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

 



10 (g) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving
Corporation, an indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate (which shall not exceed the Merger Consideration
payable with respect to such Certificate), the Paying Agent will pay (less any
amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant to Section 2.6(f)), in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this
Section 2\.

 

2.7 Dissenters Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that are held by holders who (i) are entitled to
appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, (ii) have properly exercised
and perfected their respective demands for appraisal of such shares in the
time and manner provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and (iii) as of the
Effective Time, have neither effectively withdrawn nor lost their rights to
such appraisal and payment under the DGCL with respect to such shares (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the right to receive
Merger Consideration, but shall, by virtue of the Merger, be entitled to only
such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL; _provided, that_ if any such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses
such holders right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, such holders
shares of Company Common Stock shall immediately cease to be Dissenting
Shares and shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (less any amounts entitled
to be deducted or withheld pursuant to Section 2.6(f)) in accordance with
Section 2.5 without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate
formerly representing such Shares. Within ten (10) days after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall provide each of the holders of Company
Common Stock who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded
appraisal with a second notice notifying each of the holders of Company Common
Stock of the Effective Time as contemplated by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL.
The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments
served pursuant to applicable law that are received by the Company prior to
the Effective Time relating to stockholders rights of appraisal and (B) the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demand
for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve
any withdrawal of any such demands.

 



11 2.8 Treatment of Company Options and Company RSUs; Company Warrants.

(a) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
further action on the part of the holders thereof, Parent, Purchaser, the
Company or any other Person, each Company Option that is then outstanding,
vested and unexercised and is not a Terminated Option (each such Company
Option or portion thereof, a " _Cashed Out Option_ ") shall be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive (without interest) cash in an amount equal
to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Cashed Out Option, multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of
(x) the Merger Consideration over (y) the exercise price payable per Share
under such Cashed Out Option (such amounts payable hereunder being referred to
as the " _Cashed Out Option Payments_ "), which amount shall be paid in
accordance with Section 2.8(e). For the avoidance of doubt, any Company Option
that has an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock that is greater
than or equal to the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled at the Effective
Time for no consideration or payment. From and after the Effective Time, any
such Cashed Out Option shall no longer be exercisable by the former holder
thereof or subject to settlement in shares, but shall entitle such holder
only to the payment of the Cashed Out Option Payment payable with respect to
such Cashed Out Option, if any.

 

(b) Notwithstanding Section 2.8(a), the unvested portion of each Company
Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each such
unvested portion of a Company Option, a " _Terminated Option_ ") shall,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, be cancelled and extinguished for no
consideration.

 

(c) As of Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of the holders thereof, Parent, Purchaser, the Company or
any other Person, each Company RSU that is outstanding and vested immediately
prior to the Effective Time and is not a Terminated RSU (each such Company RSU
or portion thereof, a " _Cashed Out RSU_ ") shall, in lieu of any issuance of
shares of Company Common Stock in settlement of such Company RSU, be cancelled
and converted into the right to receive (without interest) cash in an amount
equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock issuable in settlement of such Cashed Out RSU, multiplied by (ii) the
Merger Consideration (such amounts payable hereunder being referred to as the
" _Cashed Out RSU Payments_ "), which amount shall be paid in accordance with
Section 2.8(e). From and after the Effective Time, any such Cashed Out RSU
shall no longer be subject to settlement in shares, but shall entitle such
holder only to the payment of the Cashed Out RSU Payment payable with respect
to such Cashed Out RSU.

(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.8(c), the unvested portion of each Company
RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each such
unvested portion of a Company RSU, a " _Terminated RSU_ ") shall, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, be cancelled and extinguished for no
consideration.

 



12 (e) Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than
three (3) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall mail to each Person who
was, at the Effective Time, a holder of Company Options or Company RSUs
entitled to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.8(a) or Section
2.8(c), respectively, a form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in
customary form reasonably acceptable to the Company). As soon as reasonably
practicable following surrender of such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions (but no later
than the earlier of (i) the first payroll date following such surrender and
(ii) thirty (30) days after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation
shall pay the aggregate Merger Consideration, net of any applicable
withholding Taxes, payable with respect to Cashed Out Options and Cashed Out
RSUs through, to the extent applicable, the Surviving Corporations payroll
(subject to any required tax withholdings) to the holders of Cashed Out
Options and Cashed Out RSUs; _provided, however,_ that to the extent the
holder of a Company Option or a Company RSU is not, and was not at any time
during the vesting period of the Company Option or Company RSU, as applicable,
a Company Associate, the consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.8(a) or
Section 2.8(c), as applicable, with respect to such Company Options or
Company RSUs shall be paid in the manner described in Section 2.6. To the
extent that any Cashed Out RSU constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation
subject to Section 409A of the Code and may not be paid in accordance with
this Section 2.8(e) without triggering a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of
the Code, then any such cash amount otherwise payable to the holder of such
cancelled Cashed Out RSU will be distributed in accordance with Section 409A
of the Code and the applicable Treasury Regulations thereunder.

(f) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall satisfy all notification
requirements under the terms of any Company Warrants. As of the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of
the holders thereof, Parent, Purchaser or the Company, each Company Warrant
that is then outstanding and unexercised shall be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive (without interest) cash in an amount equal to the
product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by
(ii) the excess, if any, of (x) the Merger Consideration over (y) the exercise
price payable per Share under such Company Warrant, which amount shall be paid
in accordance with Section 2.6. For the avoidance of doubt, no holder of a
Company Warrant that has an exercise price per Share that is equal to or
greater than the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to any payment with
respect to such cancelled Company Warrant before or after the Effective Time.

(g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt any resolutions
and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this
Section 2.8. The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that from
and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will not have
any obligation to deliver shares of Company Common Stock or other capital
stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of any Company
Options or Company RSUs after the Effective Time. As promptly as possible
after the Effective Time, Parent shall provide to the Surviving Corporation
all funds necessary to fulfill the obligations under this Section 2.8.

 

2.9 No Further Dividends or Distributions. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with
a record date on or after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 

2.10 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation
with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of
Purchaser and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Purchaser, in
the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

 



13 ---|--- 

The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Purchaser as follows

basis all registration statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms,
statements and other documents (including exhibits and all other information
incorporated therein) required to be filed or furnished by the Company with
the SEC (the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). From the time of the initial
filing of the Companys registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC
through the date of this Agreement, the Company has been and is an "emerging
growth company," as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act. As of
their respective filing dates, the Company SEC Documents complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (to the extent that such provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act are applicable to an emerging growth company), as the case
may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder
applicable to such Company SEC Documents and, except to the extent
that information contained in such Company SEC Document has been revised,
amended, modified or superseded (prior to the date of this Agreement) by a
later filed Company SEC Document, none of the Company SEC Documents when filed
or furnished (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of
this Agreement, on the date of such amended or superseded filing) contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. None of the Companys Subsidiaries is required to file or furnish
any forms, reports or other documents with the SEC.

 

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including any related notes and
schedules) contained or incorporated by reference in the Company SEC
Documents: (i) complied as to form in all material respects with the published
rules and regulations of the SEC applicable thereto; (ii) were prepared in
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("
_GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods covered (except
as may be indicated in the notes to such financial statements or as permitted
by Regulation S-X, or, in the case of unaudited financial statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q, Form 8-K or any successor form under the Exchange
Act); and (iii) fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the respective
dates thereof and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for the periods covered thereby (except as may be
indicated in the notes to such financial statements or, in the case of
the unaudited financial statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC, and
except that unaudited financial statements may not contain footnotes and are
subject to normal year-end adjustments as permitted by GAAP and the applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC). No financial statements of any Person
other than the Subsidiaries of the Company are required by GAAP to be included
in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

 



17 (c) The Company maintains, and at all times since January 1, 2015
has maintained, a system of internal controls over financial reporting (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) which is
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures
that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only
in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company;
and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets
of the Company that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
The Companys management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of
the Companys system of internal controls over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, and such assessment concluded that
such controls were effective. To the knowledge of the Company, except as set
forth in the Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement,
since January 1, 2015, neither the Company nor the Companys independent
registered accountant has identified or been made aware of: (1) material
weakness in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting utilized by the Company; (2) any illegal act or fraud, whether or
not material, that involves the management or other employees of the Company;
or (3) any claim or allegation regarding any of the foregoing. Except as set
forth on Part 3.4(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, since January 1,
2015, neither the Company nor, to the knowledge of the Company, the Companys
independent registered accountant has identified or been made aware of any
significant deficiency in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting utilized by the Company.

 

(d) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by
Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that
all material information required to be disclosed in the Companys reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC and that all such information is accumulated and communicated
to the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to enable each of the principal executive officer
of the Company and the principal financial officer of the Company to make the
certifications required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

 

(e) The Company is not a party to nor has any obligation or other
commitment to become a party to any securitization transaction, off-balance
sheet partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract relating to
any transaction or relationship between or among the Company, on the one hand,
and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance, special
purpose or limited purpose Entity, on the other hand, or any "off-balance
sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the
Exchange Act)) where the result, purpose or intended effect of such
Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, the Company in the Companys published financial
statements or other Company SEC Documents.

 



18 (f) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding
or unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC with respect
to the Company SEC Documents. To the knowledge of the Company, none of the
Company SEC Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review and there are no
inquiries or investigations by the SEC or any internal investigations pending
or threatened, in each case regarding any accounting practices of the Company.
The last audited balance sheet of the Company dated as of December 31, 2015
contained in the Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof is
hereinafter referred to as the " _Company Balance Sheet_ ".

 

(g) Each of the principal executive officer and the principal financial
officer of the Company (or each former principal executive officer and each
former principal financial officer of the Company, as applicable) has made all
certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to the Company
SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications are true
and accurate in all material respects. For purposes of this Agreement,
"principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have
the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. No Acquired Entity
has outstanding (nor has arranged or modified since the enactment of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act) any "extensions of credit" (within the meaning of Section
402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) to directors or executive officers (as defined
in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) of the Acquired Entities. Without
limiting Section 3.4(a), the Company is otherwise in compliance with all
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act applicable to the Company and the
applicable listing and corporate governance rules of the New York Stock
Exchange, except for any non-compliance that would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

3.5 Absence of Changes. Except as expressly contemplated by this

have operated in all material respects in the Ordinary Course and (b) there

that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would be reasonably
expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement, since December 31, 2015 through the date of
this Agreement, the Acquired Entities have not taken any actions which, had
such actions been taken after the date of this Agreement, would have required
the written consent of Parent pursuant to Section 5.2 (other than Section

and effect except to the extent they have previously expired or terminated in
accordance with their terms, and (y) no Acquired Entity nor, to the knowledge
of the Company, any third party, has violated any provision of, or committed
or failed to perform any act which, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default under the provisions of any Company Lease.
Except as set forth in Part 3.7(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no
Acquired Entity has assigned, pledged, mortgaged, hypothecated or otherwise
transferred any Company Lease nor has any Acquired Entity entered into with
any other Person (other than another wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company)
any sublease, license or other agreement that is material to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and that relates to the use or occupancy
of all or any portion of the Leased Real Property. The Company has delivered
or otherwise made available to Parent, true and complete copies of
all Company Leases (including, without limitation, all material
modifications, amendments, supplements, waivers and side letters thereto)

Standards Act and cognate state laws) and (ii) any reduction in force,
including notice, information and consultation requirements, except where the
failure to be in compliance with such Legal Requirements has not had and would

(c) Part 3.16(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of
the Employee Plans as of the date of this Agreement (other than any
employment, termination or severance agreement for non-officer employees of
any Acquired Entity entered into in the Ordinary Course, and equity grant

Company under the Code or ERISA has ever maintained, contributed to, been
required to contribute to, or incurred any liability under, a plan subject to
Title IV of ERISA or Code Section 412, including any "single employer"
defined benefit plan or any "multiemployer plan" each as defined in Section
4001 of ERISA.

 

(e) Each of the Employee Plans that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has obtained a favorable determination letter (or
opinion letter, if applicable) as to its qualified status under the Code, and,
to the knowledge of the Company, there are no existing circumstances or any
events that have occurred that would reasonably be expected to materially and
adversely affect the qualified status of any such Employee Plan. Each of the
Employee Plans is now and has been established, operated and administered in
compliance in all material respects with its terms and all applicable
Legal Requirements, including but not limited to ERISA and the Code. There
are no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened claims (other
than routine claims for benefits) or proceedings by a Governmental Body by, on
behalf of or against any Employee Plan or any trust related thereto which
could reasonably be expected to result in any material liability to an
Acquired Entity. No Acquired Entity has engaged in a transaction in connection
with which an Acquired Entity could reasonably be expected to be subject to
either a material civil penalty assessed pursuant to Section 409 or 502(i) of
ERISA or a material tax imposed pursuant to Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code.

 



30 (f) Except to the extent required under Section 601 et seq. of ERISA or
4980B of the Code (or any other similar state or local Legal Requirement),

to, or with respect to, any present or former employee, officer or director
of an Acquired Entity pursuant to any retiree medical benefit plan or other
retiree welfare plan.

severance pay or any other cash payment (other than unemployment compensation
in the event of termination of employment); (ii) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting, or increase the amount of, or directly or indirectly cause
the Company to fund, compensation or benefits due to any such Company
Associate, other than, in either case, with respect to the Company Stock
Awards in accordance with this Agreement, or (iii) otherwise give rise to any
material liability under any Employee Plan.

 

(h) The Acquired Entities do not have an obligation to gross up, indemnify
or otherwise reimburse any current or former service provider to an Acquired
Entity for any tax incurred by such service provider pursuant to Sections
409A, 280G or 4999 of the Code.

 

(i) Except as would not, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result
in any material liability to the Acquired Entities, there is no agreement,
plan, arrangement or other Contract covering any employee or independent
contractor or former employee or independent contractor of an Acquired Entity
that, considered individually or considered collectively with any other such
Contracts, will give rise to the payment of any amount in connection with the
Merger that would not be deductible pursuant to Section 280G of the Code. For
purposes of the preceding sentence (i) the impact of any payments or benefits
that may be paid or payable to an employee (or other applicable service
provider of an Acquired Entity) under any agreement or arrangement with Parent
(or its Affiliates) that is not in effect, that has not been entered into or
that has not otherwise been disclosed to the Company in writing, in each
case, as of the date of this Agreement shall be disregarded and (ii) the
employment or service of each such employee (or other applicable service
provider of an Acquired Entity) shall be deemed to continue following the
Closing Date or otherwise not be terminated in a manner that would cause any
applicable severance payments or benefits to be deemed to be contingent upon
the Merger. The Acquired Entities are not a party to any Contract that would
require, nor do the Acquired Entities have any obligation (current or
contingent), to compensate any individual for excise taxes paid pursuant to
Section 4999 of the Code.

 

(j) No Company Stock Awards were granted in excess of the shares authorized
by the stockholders of the Company for the Company Equity Plans.

was a Company Associate at the time of such grant, and (ii) was granted in
compliance in all material respects with all of the terms and conditions of
the Company Equity Plan pursuant to which such outstanding Company Stock Award
was issued. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and
the consummation of the Merger will not constitute an event with respect to
any outstanding Company Stock Award that will result in any payment of
deferred compensation which will not be in compliance in all material
respects with Section 409A of the Code.

3.17 Environmental Matters. Except for those matters that would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company

of an Acquired Entity and (2) there are and have been no Hazardous Materials

would reasonably be expected to result in any claim against or liability of an

aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, all such insurance policies are
in full force and effect (except for any expiration thereof in accordance with
the terms thereof), no written notice of cancellation or modification has

permitted by clause (B) of the foregoing sentence, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enforce the confidentiality and standstill
provisions of any such agreement. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and Representatives to cease immediately and cause to be

44 (c) If at any time on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Offer Acceptance Time any Acquired Entity or any of their Representatives
receives an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal from any
Third Party, which Acquisition Proposal was made or renewed on or after the
date of this Agreement and did not result from any breach of this Section
5.3, (i) the Company and its Representatives may contact such Third Party
and/or its Representatives to clarify the terms and conditions thereof and
(ii) if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Offer and
that the failure to take any of the following actions would result in breach
of the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Legal Requirements, then
the Company and its Representatives may (x) enter into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement with the Third Party and furnish, pursuant to (but
only pursuant to) an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information
(including non-public information) with respect to the Acquired Entities to
the Third Party who has made such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that the

effect of withdrawing or adversely modifying the Company Board Recommendation
in any material respect, such disclosure shall be deemed to be a Company
Adverse Change Recommendation if the Company fails to publicly reaffirm its
recommendation of this Agreement within five (5) Business Days after Parent so
requests in writing and Parent shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement as set forth in Section 8.1(d); _provided further_ that, in the
case of clauses (i) and (ii), the Company determines, after consultation with
outside counsel, that such disclosures or communications are required by
applicable Legal Requirements. In addition, it is understood and agreed that,
for purposes of this Agreement, a factually accurate public statement by the
Company or the Company Board (or a committee thereof) that describes the
Companys receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the Person

proposal by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to withhold, withdraw,
amend or modify, the Company Board Recommendation; (B) an adoption, approval
or recommendation with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; or (C) a Company

disclosed, Parent may only make such request once every thirty (30) days
unless such request arises due to the occurrence of an event described in
Section 5.3(e); (iii) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose to
approve, recommend or declare advisable, or allow the Company to execute or
enter into any Contract with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or enter
into any other Contract or agreement in principle requiring, or reasonably
expected to cause, the Company to abandon, terminate, delay or fail to
consummate, or that would otherwise materially impede, interfere with or be
inconsistent with, the Transactions (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement, including any Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into
after the date hereof in accordance with Section 5.3(c)) or (iv) take or fail
to take any formal action or make or fail to make any recommendation or public
statement in connection with a tender or exchange offer by a Third Party,
other than a recommendation against such offer or a "stop, look and listen"
communication by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to the
stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication) (it being understood
that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may refrain from taking a
position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal until the close of business
on the tenth (10 th) Business Day after the commencement of a tender or
exchange offer in connection with such Acquisition Proposal without such
action being considered a violation of this Section 6.1).

 



46 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, at any time prior to accepting, for the first time, for payment
and paying for such number of Shares validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as satisfies the Minimum Condition (the "
_Offer Acceptance Time_ "):

(i) if the Company has received a _bona fide_ written Acquisition
Proposal (which Acquisition Proposal did not arise out of a breach of Section
5.3) from any Person that has not been withdrawn and after consultation with
outside legal counsel and its financial advisors, the Company Board shall have
determined (A) that failure to take the following actions, in light of the
Acquisition Proposal and the terms of this Agreement, would result in breach
of the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Legal Requirements and (B)
that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer, (x) the Company Board may
make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation, or (y) the Company may terminate
this Agreement to enter into a definitive acquisition agreement providing for
the consummation of such Superior Offer (a " _Specified Agreement_ ")
pursuant to Section 8.1(f), if and only if, (i) the Company promptly provides
Parent written notice (a " _Determination Notice_ ") (which notice shall not
constitute a Company Adverse Change Recommendation or termination), at least
four (4) Business Days before making a Company Adverse Change Recommendation
or entering into (or causing a Subsidiary to enter into) a Specified
Agreement, that the Company has received an Acquisition Proposal that the
Company Board intends to declare a Superior Offer and that the Company Board
intends to make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation and/or the Company
intends to enter into a Specified Agreement; (ii) the Company provides to
Parent, and updates on a prompt basis, the material terms and conditions of
the Acquisition Proposal in accordance with Section 5.3(d); (iii) the Company
provides Parent a period of at least four (4) Business Days after delivering
the Determination Notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") to propose revisions to the
terms of this Agreement or make another proposal so that such Acquisition
Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Offer, and negotiates and uses
its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries Representatives
to negotiate, during the Notice Period, with Parent in good faith to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Offer, if Parent, in its
discretion, proposes to make such adjustments (it being agreed that in the
event that, after commencement of the Notice Period, there is any material
revision to the terms of a Superior Offer, including, any revision in price,
the Notice Period shall be extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least
two (2) Business Days remains in the Notice Period subsequent to the time the
Company notifies Parent of any such material revision (it being understood
that there may be multiple extensions)); and (iv) the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel and its financial
advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior
Offer after taking into account any adjustments proposed by Parent during the
Notice Period in the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

 



47 (ii) other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, the Company
Board may make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation in response to a Change
in Circumstance, if and only if: (A) the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that
the failure to do so would result in breach of the directors fiduciary
duties under applicable Legal Requirements; (B) the Company shall have given
Parent a Determination Notice at least four (4) Business Days prior to making
any such Company Adverse Change Recommendation; and (C) (1) the Company shall
have specified the Change in Circumstance in reasonable detail, (2) the
Company shall have given Parent the four (4) Business Days after the
Determination Notice to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or
make another proposal so that such Change in Circumstance would no longer
necessitate a Company Adverse Change Recommendation, and negotiates and use
its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries
Representatives to negotiate, during the Notice Period, with Parent in good
faith with respect to such proposed revisions or other proposal, if any, and
(3) after considering the results of such negotiations and giving effect to
the proposals made by Parent, if any, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, that the
failure to make the Company Adverse Change Recommendation in response to
such Change in Circumstance would result in breach of the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Legal Requirements. For the avoidance of
doubt, the provisions of this Section 6.1(b)(ii) shall also apply to any
material change to the facts and circumstances relating to such Change in
Circumstance and require a new Determination Notice, except that the
references to four (4) Business Days shall be deemed to be two (2) Business
Days.

 

6.2 Filings, Consents and Approvals.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each
of the Parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, to file, or cause to be filed, all documents
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
Parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Antitrust Laws to consummate and make effective the Transactions as soon as
reasonably practicable, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions
or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, decisions,
declarations, approvals and, expirations or terminations of waiting periods
from Governmental Bodies (the " _Governmental Consents_ ") and the making of
all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be
necessary to obtain any such Governmental Consents by or from, or to avoid an
action or proceeding by, any Governmental Body in connection with any
Antitrust Law; (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, authorizations,
approvals or waivers from Third Parties; and (iii) the execution and delivery
of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions.
Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 6.2(b), the Parties shall
defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any
party under Antitrust Laws in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or
terminated, any decree, order or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) that could restrain, delay, or prevent the Closing by the End
Date.

 



48 (b) The Parties agree to use reasonable best efforts and cause
their controlled Affiliates to use reasonable best efforts to take all steps
necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment and obtain all
Governmental Authorizations under any Antitrust Laws that may be required by
any foreign or U.S. federal, state or local Governmental Body for which
consents, permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances, approvals and
expirations or terminations of waiting periods are sought with respect to the
Transactions prior to the End Date, in each case with competent jurisdiction,
so as to enable the parties to close the Transactions as promptly as
practicable provided, however, that in no event shall Parent, Purchaser or any
of their respective Affiliates be obligated to (i) divest or hold separate
any business or assets in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions, (ii) agree to any condition, restriction or limitation with
respect to the businesses, product lines or assets of Parent, Purchaser, the
Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates or (iii) pay
any money to any Person or offer or grant financial or other accommodations to
any person in connection with their obligations under this Section 6.2; and
provided that the Acquired Entities shall only be required to take or commit
to take any such action, or agree to any such condition or restriction, if
such action, commitment, agreement, condition or restriction is binding on the
Acquired Entities only in the event the Closing occurs. Each of Parent,
Purchaser and the Company shall respond as promptly as practicable to any
inquiries received from any Governmental Body under any Antitrust Laws for
additional information or documentation and to all inquiries and requests
received from any Governmental Body. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall,
without the written consent of Parent, offer or agree to divest, license, hold
separate (including by trust or otherwise) or otherwise commit any of the
Company, Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective Subsidiaries to take any
action that limits any freedom of action with respect to their ability to
retain or operate any of their businesses, services or assets.

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
Parties hereto shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates, if
applicable, to): (i) cooperate in all respects and consult with each other in
connection with any filing or submission in connection with any investigation
or other inquiry, including allowing the other Party to have a reasonable
opportunity to review in advance and comment on drafts of filings and
submissions; (ii) promptly, but in no event later than four (4) Business Days
after the date hereof, make an appropriate filing of all Notification and
Report forms as required by the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions;
(iii) promptly, but in no event later than seven (7) Business Days after the
date hereof, make all other filings, notifications or other consents as may
be required to be made or obtained by such Party under foreign Antitrust Laws
in those jurisdictions identified in Part 6.2(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, which contains the list of the only jurisdictions where filing,
notification, expiration of a waiting period or consent or approval is a
condition to Closing; and (iv) cooperate with each other in determining
whether, and promptly preparing and making, any other filings
or notifications are required to be made with, or Governmental Consents are
required to be obtained from, any other Governmental Bodies in connection with
the Transactions.

 



49 (d) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section
6.2, during the Pre-Closing Period, each Party hereto shall use its reasonable
best efforts to (i) give the other Parties prompt notice of the making or
commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or
Legal Proceeding brought by a Governmental Body or brought by a Third Party
before any Governmental Body, in each case, with respect to the Transactions,
(ii) keep the other Parties informed as to the status of any such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, (iii) promptly inform the
other Parties of any communication to or from the FTC, DOJ or any other
Governmental Body in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation,
action or Legal Proceeding, (iv) upon request, promptly furnish to the other
Party, subject to an appropriate confidentiality agreement to limit disclosure
to outside counsel and consultants retained by such counsel, with copies of
documents provided to or received from any Governmental Body in connection
with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding
(other than Item "4(c)" and "4(d)" documents as those terms are used in the
rules and regulations under the HSR Act), (v) subject to an appropriate
confidentiality agreement to limit disclosure to counsel and outside
consultants retained by such counsel, and to the extent reasonably
practicable, consult in advance and cooperate with the other Parties and
consider in good faith the views of the other Parties in connection with any
analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or
proposal to be made or submitted in connection with any such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, and (vi) except as may be
prohibited by any Governmental Body or by any Legal Requirement, in connection
with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding in
respect of the Transactions, each Party hereto shall provide advance notice
of and permit authorized Representatives of the other Party to be present at
each meeting or conference relating to such request, inquiry, investigation,
action or Legal Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in advance
in connection with any argument, opinion or proposal to be made or submitted
to any Governmental Body in connection with such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding. Each Party shall supply as
promptly as practicable such information, documentation, other material or
testimony that may be requested by any Governmental Body, including by
complying at the earliest reasonably practicable date with any reasonable
request for additional information, documents or other materials received by
any Party or any of their respective Subsidiaries from any Governmental Body
in connection with such applications or filings for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser shall pay all filing fees under the
HSR Act and for any filings required under foreign Antitrust Laws, but the
Company shall bear its own costs for the preparation of any such filings.
Neither Party shall commit to or agree with any Governmental Body to stay,
toll or extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, or pull and
refile under the HSR Act, or other applicable Antitrust Laws, without the
prior written consent of the other.

 

(e) Purchaser and Parent shall not, before the Closing, acquire or enter
into any agreement to acquire, or announce any acquisition of any company,
business or assets, that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
delay the Merger, without the prior written approval of the Company.

 

6.3 Company Stock Awards; ESPP.

 

(a) Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all actions
(including obtaining any necessary determinations and/or resolutions of the
Company Board or a committee thereof) that may be necessary (under the Company
Equity Plans and award agreements pursuant to which Company Stock Awards are
outstanding or otherwise) to (i) terminate each Company Equity Plan (except
as otherwise agreed by Parent and a holder thereof) effective as of and
contingent upon the Effective Time, and (ii) cause, as of the Effective Time,
each unexpired and unexercised Company Option and each unexpired Company RSU
then outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (and each plan,
if any, under which any Company Stock Award may be granted except, with
respect to any such plan, as otherwise agreed by Parent and a holder thereof)
to be cancelled, terminated and extinguished, subject, if applicable, to
payment pursuant to Section 2.8.

 



50 (b) The Company shall take all actions necessary or required under
the ESPP and Legal Requirements to, contingent on the Effective Time, (i)
ensure that, except for the 6-month offering period under the ESPP that
commenced on May 15, 2016, no offering period or purchase period shall be
authorized or commenced on or after the date of this Agreement, (ii) ensure
that no new participants may begin participation in the ESPP after the date of
this Agreement (unless the Company is prohibited from doing so under
applicable Legal Requirements or the explicit terms of the ESPP), and (iii)
if the Closing shall occur prior to the end of the offering period in
existence under the ESPP on the date of this Agreement, cause the rights of
participants in the ESPP with respect to any such offering period (and
purchase period thereunder) then underway under the ESPP to be determined by
treating the last Business Day prior to the Offer Acceptance Time as the last
day of such offering period (such date or the date such offering period
terminates by its terms, if earlier, the " _Final Purchase Date_ ") and
purchase period and by making such other pro-rata adjustments as may be
necessary to reflect the shortened offering period and purchase period but
otherwise treating such shortened offering period and purchase period as a
fully effective and completed offering period and purchase period for all
purposes under the ESPP. The Company shall cause the exercise (as of the Final
Purchase Date) of each outstanding purchase right under the ESPP and
terminate the ESPP in its entirety effective as of the Offer Acceptance Time,
contingent upon the Effective Time. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the
Company shall take all actions (including, if appropriate, amending the terms
of the ESPP) that are necessary to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Section 6.3(b) and to ensure that from and after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will not have any obligation to
deliver shares of Company Common Stock or other capital stock of the Company
to any Person pursuant to the ESPP.

 

6.4 Employee Benefits. For a period of not less than twelve (12) months
following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided,
to those employees of the Company who are employed by the Company as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and who continue to be actively
employed by the Surviving Corporation (or any Affiliate thereof) during such
twelve (12) month period (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") (a) base salary (or
base wages, as the case may be), short-term cash incentive compensation
opportunities and commission opportunities (excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, equity compensation or equity related benefits), in each case and on an
individual basis, no less favorable than those provided to such Continuing
Employees immediately prior to execution of this Agreement, (b) severance
benefits that are no less favorable than those that would have been provided
to such Continuing Employee under the applicable severance benefit plans,
programs, policies, agreements and arrangements as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and (c) other employee benefits that are
comparable in the aggregate to the benefits provided to such Continuing
Employees immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement. Without
limiting the foregoing:

 

(a) With respect to any accrued but unused personal, sick or vacation time
to which any Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to the personal, sick
or vacation policies applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to and instruct its Affiliates to, as applicable (and without duplication of
benefits), assume the liability for such accrued personal, sick or vacation
time and allow such Continuing Employee to use such accrued personal, sick or
vacation time in accordance with the practice and policies of the Company.

 



51 (b) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
and instruct its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to grant
all Continuing Employees credit for any service to the Company earned prior to
the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility, vesting and determination of
the level of benefits, vacation accrual and severance benefit determinations,
under any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement in
which a Continuing Employee participates that may be established or maintained
by Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates on or after
the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "); _provided_ , that such service
credit shall not be recognized for purposes of any defined benefit pension
plans, for purposes of qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits or
to the extent that it would result in a duplication of benefits or is not
permitted under any applicable New Plan or Legal Requirements. In addition,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to and instruct its
Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i) to be waived
all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements and
similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any New Plans to the extent waived or satisfied by a
Continuing Employee under any Acquired Entity benefit plan as of the Effective
Time and (ii) any deductible, co-insurance and covered out-of-pocket expenses
paid on or before the Effective Time by any Continuing Employee (or covered
dependent thereof) to be taken into account for purposes of satisfying the
corresponding deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions
after the Effective Time under any applicable New Plan in the same plan year
in which the Effective Time occurs. Nothing in this Section 6.4 or elsewhere
in this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any employee to
employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Affiliate of
the Surviving Corporation and the employment of each Continuing Employee shall
be "at will" employment.

 

(c) Prior to making any written communications to the directors, officers
or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pertaining to
compensation or benefit matters that are affected by the Transactions, the
Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication and
provide Parent with a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the
communication.

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.4 are solely for the benefit of the
Parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 6.4 is intended
to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to
any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise and no current or
former employee or any other individual associated therewith shall be
regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of the Agreement or have
the right to enforce the provisions hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, none
of Parent, Purchaser or any Acquired Entity shall be under any obligation to
retain any employee pursuant to this Agreement after Closing.

 



52 6.5 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

 

(a) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any person
who is or prior to the Effective Time becomes, or has been at any time prior
to the date of this Agreement, a director, officer, employee or agent
(including as a fiduciary with respect to an employee benefit plan) of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors (the
" _Indemnified Persons_ ") as provided by the Certificate of Incorporation,
bylaws or other organizational documents of any Acquired Entity (as in effect
as of the date of this Agreement) and as provided in any indemnification
agreement between the Company and said Indemnified Persons in effect as of the
date of this Agreement in the forms made available by the Company to Parent
or Parents Representatives prior to the date of this Agreement, shall survive
the Merger and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any
manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any such
Indemnified Person.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing sub-section (a), from and after the
Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation (together with their
successors and assigns, the " _Indemnifying Parties_ ") shall, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements, indemnify and hold
harmless each Indemnified Person in his or her capacity as an officer or
director of the Company against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
fees, expenses, judgments or fines incurred by such Indemnified Person as an
officer or director of the Company in connection with any pending or
threatened Legal Proceeding based on or arising out of, in whole or in part,
the fact that such Indemnified Person is or was a director or officer of the
Company at or prior to the Effective Time and pertaining to any and all
matters pending, existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
including any such matter arising under any claim with respect to the
transactions contemplated herein. Without limiting the foregoing, from and
after the Effective Time, the Indemnifying Parties shall also, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements, advance reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and
documented attorneys fees) incurred by the Indemnified Persons in connection
with matters for which such Indemnified Persons are eligible to be
indemnified pursuant to this Section 6.5(b) within fifteen (15) days after
receipt by Parent of a written request for such advance, subject to the
execution by such Indemnified Persons of appropriate undertakings in favor of
the Indemnifying Parties to repay such advanced costs and expenses if it is
ultimately determined in a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to be
indemnified under this Section 6.5(b).

 

(c) From the Effective Time until the sixth (6 th ) anniversary of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect, the
existing policy of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by
the Company as of the date of this Agreement (an accurate and complete copy of
which has been made available by the Company to Parent or Parents
Representatives prior to the date of this Agreement) for the benefit of the
Indemnified Persons who are currently covered by such existing policy with
respect to their acts and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time in
their capacities as directors and officers of the Company (as applicable), on
terms with respect to coverage, deductibles and amounts no less favorable than
the existing policy (or at or prior to the Effective Time Parent or the
Company, at the expense of Parent, may (through a nationally recognized
insurance broker approved by Parent (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned)) purchase a six-year "tail" policy for the
existing policy effective as of the Effective Time) and if such "tail policy"
has been obtained, it shall be deemed to satisfy all obligations to obtain
and/or maintain insurance pursuant to this Section 6.5(c); _provided,
however,_ that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to
expend in any one (1) year an amount in excess of 300% of the annual premium
currently payable by the Company with respect to such current policy, it
being understood that if the annual premiums payable for such insurance
coverage exceeds such amount, Parent shall be obligated to cause the Surviving
Corporation to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a
cost equal to such amount.

 



53 (d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
Entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Parent shall ensure that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be (or in the case of the Surviving Corporation,
at Parents option, Parent), shall assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.5.

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.5 shall survive the acceptance of
Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the Merger
and are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each of the Indemnified Persons and their successors, assigns and heirs and
(ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or
otherwise. Unless required by applicable Legal Requirement, this Section 6.5
may not be amended, altered or repealed after the Offer Acceptance Time in
such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Person or
any of their successors, assigns or heirs without the prior written
consent of the affected Indemnified Person.

6.6 Securityholder Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the right to
review and comment on all material filings or responses to be made by the
Company in connection with any litigation against the Company and/or its
directors relating to the Transactions, and the right to consult on the
settlement with respect to such litigation, and the Company shall in good
faith take such comments into account, and no such settlement shall be agreed
to without Parents prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) except to the extent the settlement is
fully covered by the Companys insurance policies (other than any applicable
deductible), but only if such settlement would not result in the imposition of
any restriction on the business or operations of the Acquired Entities. The
Company shall promptly notify Parent of any such litigation.

6.7 Additional Agreements. Without limitation or contravention of the
provisions of Section 6.2, and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to consummate the Offer and
the Merger and make effective the other Transactions. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each Party to this Agreement shall (i) make all filings (if any)
and give all notices (if any) required to be made and given by such Party in
connection with the Offer and the Merger and the other Transactions; (ii) use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain each Consent (if any) required to
be obtained pursuant to any applicable Legal Requirement or Material Contract
by such Party in connection with the Transactions; and (iii) use commercially
reasonable efforts to lift any restraint, injunction or other legal bar to
the Offer or the Merger brought by any Third Party against such Party. The
Company shall promptly deliver to Parent a copy of each such filing made, each
such notice given and each such Consent obtained by the Company during the
Pre-Closing Period.

 



54 6.8 Disclosure. The initial press release relating to this Agreement shall
be a joint press release issued by the Company and Parent and thereafter
Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any
further press release(s) or otherwise making any public statement or making
any announcement to Company Associates (to the extent not previously issued
or made in accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Offer, the
Merger, this Agreement or any of the other Transactions and shall not issue
any such press release, public statement or announcement to Company
Associates without the other Partys written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing:
(a) each Party may, without such consultation or consent, make any public
statement in response to questions from the press, analysts, investors or
those attending industry conferences, make internal announcements to employees
and make disclosures in Company SEC Documents, so long as such statements are
consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made jointly by the Parties (or individually, if approved by the
other Party), (b) a Party may, without the prior consent of the other
Party hereto but subject to giving advance notice to the other Party, issue
any such press release or make any such public announcement or statement as
may be required by Legal Requirement; and (c) the Company need not consult
with Parent in connection with such portion of any press release, public
statement or filing to be issued or made pursuant to Section 5.3(e) or with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal or Company Adverse Change Recommendation.

 

6.9 Takeover Laws. If any Takeover Law may become, or may purport to be,
applicable to the Transactions, each of Parent and the Company and the
members of their respective Boards of Directors shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms and conditions
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to lawfully eliminate the effect of any
Takeover Law on any of the Transactions.

 

6.10 Section 16 Matters. The Company, and the Company Board, shall, to the
extent necessary, take appropriate action, prior to or as of the Offer
Acceptance Time, to approve, for purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange
Act, the disposition and cancellation or deemed disposition and cancellation
of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Stock Awards and Company Warrants
in the Transactions by applicable individuals and to cause such dispositions
and/or cancellations to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

 

6.11 Rule 14d-10 Matters. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time and to the
extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the Compensation Committee
of the Company Board (comprised solely of "independent directors" in
accordance with Rule 14d-10(d)(2)), at a meeting duly called and held, shall
approve, as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit
arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act,
each agreement, arrangement or understanding between the Company or any of its
Affiliates and any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company
that are effective as of the date of this Agreement or are entered into after
the date of this Agreement and prior to the Offer Acceptance Time pursuant to
which compensation is paid to such officer, director or employee and shall
take all other action reasonably necessary to satisfy the requirements of the
non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange
Act.

 



55 6.12 Purchaser Stockholder Consent. Immediately following the execution of
this Agreement, Parent shall execute and deliver, in accordance with Section
228 of the DGCL and in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Purchaser, a
written consent adopting this Agreement.

 

6.13 Transfer Taxes. Parent and Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid,
all documentary, sales, use, real property transfer, registration, transfer,
stamp, recording and smilar Taxes, fees and costs together with any interest
thereon, penalties, fines, costs, fees, additions to tax or additional amounts
with respect thereto incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions, and shall file all Tax Returns related thereto that are required
to be filed by Parent or Purchaser.

 

6.14 Treatment of Certain Company Indebtedness.

 

(a) As requested by Parent and subject to the limitations set forth in this
Section 6.14, the Company will (i) provide reasonable assistance with
obtaining a waiver of any default relating to the Transactions under the
Credit Agreement and consent therefor from Silicon Valley Bank or (ii) provide
reasonable cooperation to Parent and Purchaser in arranging for, at the
Closing, the termination of the Credit Agreement, including providing
reasonable cooperation in obtaining a customary pay-off letter and lien
releases; provided that in no event shall this Section 6.14 require
the Company to cause any such Indebtedness to be terminated prior to the
Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, a "customary payoff letter" must
indicate the total amount required to be paid to satisfy fully all obligations
of the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of the Credit Agreement and
state that all Encumbrances and guarantees in connection therewith relating to
the assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be released upon the
payment of such amount on the Closing Date.

(b) Nothing in this Section 6.14 shall require any Acquired Entity to (i)
provide any assistance to the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the
ongoing business or operations of the Acquired Entities, (ii) execute or
deliver any certificate, document or agreement in connection with Parents
debt financing or (iii) prepare any financial statements or any other
financial information that the Company does not prepare in the Ordinary Course
or update any financial statements or other financial information other than
at such times as the Company would update such statements or information in
the Ordinary Course.

(c) Parent shall reimburse the Company, if the Closing does not occur, for
all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Acquired
Entities in connection with the cooperation and obligations of the Company and
the Acquired Entities set forth in Section 6.14(a). Parent and Purchaser
shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company,
its Affiliates and their respective Representatives from and against any and
all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by any of them in connection
with the arrangement of any debt financing arrangements contemplated by
Section 6.14(a).

 



56 6.15 No Control of the Other Partys Business. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that the restrictions set forth in this Agreement are not intended to
give Parent or Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the business
or operations of the other at any time prior to the Effective Time. Prior to
the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company will exercise, consistent
with the terms, conditions and restrictions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over its own business and operations.

6.16 Stock Exchange De-listing. The Company shall cooperate with Parent
and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable on its part under applicable Legal Requirements and rules and
policies of the New York Stock Exchange to cause the delisting of the Company
and of the Company Common Stock from the New York Stock Exchange as promptly
as practicable after the Effective Time and the deregistration of the Company
Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such
delisting.

---|--- 

The obligations of the Parties to effect the Merger are subject to the
satisfaction, at or prior to the Closing, of each of the following conditions:

7.1 No Restraints. No Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction shall
have (i) issued any temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent
injunction or other order preventing the consummation of the Merger which
remains in effect, or (ii) promulgated, entered, enforced, enacted, issued or
deemed applicable to the Merger any Legal Requirement which directly or
indirectly prohibits, or makes illegal the consummation of the Merger which
remains in effect (a " _Restraint_ "); provided, however, that no Party shall
be permitted to invoke this Section 7.1 unless it shall have complied in all
material respects with any obligations it has under this Agreement to have any
such Restraint lifted.

7.2 Consummation of Offer. Purchaser (or Parent on Purchasers behalf)
shall have consummated (within the meaning of Section 251(h) of the DGCL) the
Offer.



   SECTION 8. | TERMINATION 
---|--- 

8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the Offer and the
Merger may be abandoned (with respect to Section 8.1(b) through Section
8.1(i), by written notice by the terminating Party to the other Party) prior
to the Offer Acceptance Time:

 

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

 

(b) by either Parent or the Company, if the Offer (as it may have been
extended pursuant to this Agreement) shall have expired without the
acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer; _provided, however,_
that a Party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 8.1(b) if the failure of the acceptance for payment of Shares
pursuant to the Offer is attributable to a failure on the part of such Party
to perform in any material respect any covenant or obligation in this
Agreement required to be performed by such Party at or prior to the acceptance
for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer and such Party has not cured such
failure within ten (10) days after having received notice thereof;

 



57 (c) by either Parent or the Company, if a court of competent
jurisdiction or other Governmental Body shall have issued a Restraint which
has become final and nonappealable; _provided, however,_ that a Party shall
not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c)
if the issuance of such final and nonappealable Restraint was due to a
failure on the part of such Party to perform in any material respect any
covenant or obligation in this Agreement required to be performed by such
Party at or prior to the Effective Time;

 

(d) by Parent, at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, if, whether
or not permitted to do so, the Company Board (i) shall have failed to include
the Company Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 when mailed, (ii)
effects a Company Adverse Change Recommendation or (iii) fails to reaffirm the
Company Board Recommendation in breach of Section 6.1(a); _provided_ , that
no notice of the Companys intentions to effect a Company Adverse Change
Recommendation prior to effecting such Company Adverse Change Recommendation
shall result in Parent having any termination rights pursuant to this Section
8.1(d); provided, further, that any such termination must occur within ten
(10) Business Days of any such event;

 

(e) by either Parent or the Company, if the Offer Acceptance Time shall not
have occurred on or prior to the close of business on April 21, 2017 (such
date, the " _End Date_ ") or the Offer (as it may have been extended pursuant
to this Agreement) shall have expired without the acceptance for payment of
Shares pursuant to the Offer;  _provided, however,_ that a Party shall not be
permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(e) if the
failure of the Offer Acceptance Time to occur prior to the End Date is due to
the failure on the part of such Party to perform in any material respect any
covenant or obligation in this Agreement required to be performed by such
Party;

 

(f) by the Company, in order to accept a Superior Offer and enter into a
Specified Agreement, _provided_  that the Company has complied in all
respects with the requirements of Section 5.3 and Section 6.1(b);

 

(g) by Parent, if a breach of any representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement or failure to perform any covenant or obligation in this
Agreement on the part of the Company shall have occurred such that the
condition set forth in clause "(b)" or "(c)" of Annex I would not be satisfied
and cannot be cured by the Company by the End Date, or if capable of being
cured, shall not have commenced to have been cured within thirty (30) days of
the date Parent gives the Company notice of such breach or failure to perform;
_provided, however,_ that, Parent shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(g) if either Parent or Purchaser is
then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation hereunder;

 



58 (h) by the Company, if a breach of any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement or failure to perform any covenant or
obligation in this Agreement on the part of Parent or Purchaser shall have
occurred, in each case if such breach or failure has had or would reasonably
be expected to prevent Parent or Purchaser from consummating the Transactions
and such breach of failure cannot be satisfied and cannot be cured by Parent
or Purchaser, as applicable, by the End Date, or if capable of being cured,
shall not have commenced to have been cured within thirty (30) days of the
date the Company gives Parent notice of such breach or failure to perform;
_provided, however,_ that, the Company shall not have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(h) if the Company is then in
material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation
hereunder;

(i) by the Company, if Purchaser shall have (A) failed to commence (within
the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer within the period
specified in Section 1.1(a), (B) withdrawn, terminated or made any material
change to the Offer in violation of the terms of this Agreement or (C) failed
to purchase all Shares validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) as of the
expiration of the Offer (as may be extended); or

 

(j) by Parent, at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, if, the
condition set forth in clause "(i)" of Annex I would not be satisfied as of
such date; _provided, however,_ that, Parent shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(j) if either Parent or
Purchaser is then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation hereunder.

8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 8.1, written notice thereof shall be given to
the other Party or Parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which
such termination is made, and this Agreement shall be of no further force or
effect and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Purchaser or the
Company or their respective directors, officers and Affiliates following any
such termination; _provided, however,_ that (a) this Section 8.2, Section 8.3
and Section 9 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain
in full force and effect, (b) the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms; and (c) subject to Section 8.3, the termination of
this Agreement shall not relieve any Party from any liability for Fraud or
Intentional and Knowing Breach prior to the date of termination.
Nothing shall limit or prevent any Party from exercising any rights or
remedies it may have under Section 9.5(b) in lieu of terminating this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1.

 

8.3 Expenses; Termination Fee.

 

(a) Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the
Party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Offer and Merger are
consummated.

 

(b) In the event that:

 

(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(f);

 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d); or

 



59 (iii) (x) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or
Section 8.1(e), at a time when the condition set forth in Section 7.1 has been
satisfied, where the failure of the Offer Acceptance Time to occur prior to
the End Date is attributable to the failure of the Minimum Condition to have
been satisfied, (y) a Third Party shall have publicly disclosed a _bona fide_
Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof and prior to such termination
(unless publicly withdrawn or otherwise abandoned prior to such termination)
and (z) within twelve (12) months of such termination the Company shall have
(A) entered into a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal and the transaction contemplated by such Acquisition Proposal
is subsequently consummated, or (B) consummated an Acquisition Proposal
(provided that for purposes of this clause (z) the references to "15%" in the
definition of " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall be deemed to be references to
"50%");

then, in any such event under clause "(i)", "(ii)" or "(iii)" of this Section
8.3(b), the Company shall pay to Parent or its designee the Termination Fee
by wire transfer of same day funds (x) in the case of Section 8.3(b)(i), on
the date that the Specified Agreement is executed (or if the Specified
Agreement is executed on a day that is not a Business Day, the next Business
Day), (y) in the case of Section 8.3(b)(ii), within two (2) Business Days
after such termination or (z) in the case of Section 8.3(b)(iii), within two
(2) Business Days prior to and as a condition to the consummation of the
Acquisition Proposal referred to in subclause (iii)(z) above; it being
understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion. As used herein, " _Termination
Fee_ " means a cash amount equal to $15,180,000. In the event that Parent or
its designee shall receive full payment pursuant to this Section 8.3(b), the
receipt of the Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for
any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Purchaser, any
of their respective Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this
Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby
(and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such
termination, and none of Parent, Purchaser, any of their respective Affiliates
(collectively, " _Parent Related Parties_ ") or any other Person shall be
entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the
Company or any of its Affiliates arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement, any of the Transactions or any matters forming the basis for
such termination; _provided, however,_ that nothing in this Section 8.3(b)
shall limit the rights of Parent or Purchaser under Section 9.5(b).

 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.1(b), Section 8.1(e) or Section 8.1(j), in any such case, due to
the failure of the condition set forth in clauses "(a)" or "(i)" of Annex I ,
then the Company shall, promptly and no later than two (2) Business Days after
the date of such termination, pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent or its
designee, the Parent Expenses for which Parent has not theretofore been
reimbursed by the Company.

 

(d) Parents right to receive payment from the Company of the Termination
Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(b) and any payments pursuant to Section 8.3(c)
and Section 8.3(e) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent
Related Parties against the Company and any of their respective former,
current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, optionholders,
managers, members or Affiliates (collectively, " _Company Related Parties_ ")
for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Offer or the Merger to
be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise,
and upon payment of such amount(s), none of the Company Related Parties shall
have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Transactions.

 



60 (e) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section
8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay any amount due
pursuant to this Section 8.3, and, in order to obtain the payment, Parent
commences a Legal Proceeding which results in a judgment against the Company,
the Company shall pay Parent its reasonable and documented costs and expenses
(including reasonable and documented attorneys fees) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on such amount at the prime rate as published in
the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made through the date such payment was actually received.



   SECTION 9. | MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 
---|--- 

9.1 Amendment. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, subject to Section
6.5(e), this Agreement may be amended with the approval of the respective
Boards of Directors of the Company and Parent at any time. This Agreement may
not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of
the Parties.

9.2 Waiver. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of
any Party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy. No Party shall be deemed to have waived any
claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy
under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege
or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and
delivered on behalf of such Party; and any such waiver shall not be
applicable or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it is
given.

 

9.3 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. None of the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, the Company
Disclosure Schedule or in any certificate or schedule or other document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Merger.

 

9.4 Entire Agreement; Counterparts. This Agreement and the other agreements
and schedules referred to herein constitute the entire agreement and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among or between any of the Parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof; _provided, however,_ that the Confidentiality Agreement shall
not be superseded and shall remain in full force and effect; _provided,
further, that,_ if the Effective Time occurs, the Confidentiality Agreement
shall automatically terminate and be of no further force and effect. This
Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original and all of which shall constitute one and the same
instrument. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or
otherwise) by PDF shall be sufficient to bind the Parties to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

 



61 9.5 Applicable Legal Requirements; Jurisdiction; Specific
Performance; Remedies.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might
otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.
Subject to Section 9.5(c), in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement: (i) each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally consents
and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Chancery Court of
the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom or, if such
court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District Court
sitting in New Castle County in the State of Delaware, (it being agreed that
the consents to jurisdiction and venue set forth in this Section 9.5(a) shall
not constitute general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware
and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph
and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the Parties
hereto); and (ii) each of the Parties irrevocably consents to service of
process by first class certified mail, return receipt requested, postage
prepaid, to the address at which such Party is to receive notice in accordance
with Section 9.8. The Parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such
action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable Legal Requirements; _provided, however,_ that nothing in the
foregoing shall restrict any Partys rights to seek any post-judgment relief
regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial court judgment.

 

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event
that the Parties hereto do not perform their obligations under the provisions
of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach
such provisions. Subject to the following sentence, the Parties acknowledge
and agree that (i) the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in the courts described in Section 9.5(a) without proof of
damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled under this Agreement, (ii) the provisions set forth in Section
8.3 (A) are not intended to and do not adequately compensate for the harm
that would result from a breach of this Agreement and (B) shall not be
construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Partys right to
specific enforcement and (iii) the right of specific performance is an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without
that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this
Agreement. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that the other Parties hereto have an adequate remedy at law or an
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or equity. The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance
with this Section 9.5(b) shall not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with any such order or injunction.

 

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH
PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.5.

 



62 9.6 Assignability. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall be
enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the Parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns; _provided, however,_ that
neither this Agreement nor any of the rights hereunder may be assigned without
the prior written consent of the other Parties hereto, and any attempted
assignment of this Agreement or any of such rights without such consent shall
be void and of no effect; _provided, further, however,_ that Parent or
Purchaser may assign this Agreement to any of their Affiliates ( _provided_
that such assignment shall not impede or delay the consummation of the
Transactions or otherwise impede the rights of the stockholders of the Company
under this Agreement); _provided_ that no such assignment or pledge permitted
pursuant to this Section 9.6 shall relieve Parent of its obligations
hereunder.

 

9.7 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other than the
Parties hereto) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Agreement; except for: (i) the provisions set forth in
Section 6.5 of this Agreement; and (ii) the limitations on liability of the
Company Related Parties set forth in Section 8.3(c). For the avoidance of
doubt, this Section 9.7 shall not limit any rights of any stockholders of the
Company to enforce any right such stockholder has to receive the Offer Price
or Merger Consideration, as applicable, pursuant to the Offer or under any
Legal Requirement should the Offer Acceptance Time and Effective Time, as
applicable, occur.

 

9.8 Notices. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be

9.9 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision
in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this
Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties hereto agree that the court
making such determination shall have the power to limit such term
or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace such term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, and this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable as so
modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in
the prior sentence, the Parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or
provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term or provision.

 



64 9.10 Obligation of Parent. Parent shall ensure that each of
its Subsidiaries duly performs, satisfies and discharges on a timely basis
each of the covenants, obligations and liabilities applicable to its
Subsidiaries under this Agreement, and Parent, as applicable, shall be jointly
and severally liable with its Subsidiaries for the due and timely performance
and satisfaction of each of said covenants, obligations and liabilities.

 

9.11 Guarantee. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Guarantor hereby (i) absolutely guarantees to the Company, as the
primary obligor and not merely as surety, the due and punctual observance,
payment, performance and discharge of the obligations of Parent and Purchaser
pursuant to this Agreement including the due and punctual payment of all
amounts which are or may become due and payable by Parent or Purchaser
hereunder when and as the same shall become due and payable and (ii)
acknowledges and agrees to take all actions necessary to satisfy Parent and
the Surviving Corporations obligations with respect to Cashed Out Options and
Cashed Out RSUs pursuant to Section 2.8 (the " _Obligations_ "). In
furtherance of the foregoing, Guarantor acknowledges that the Company may, in
its sole discretion, bring and prosecute a separate action or actions against
the Guarantor for the full amount of the Obligations, regardless of whether
any action is brought against Parent. To the fullest extent permitted by
law, the Guarantor hereby expressly and unconditionally waives any and all
rights or defenses arising by reason of any law, promptness, diligence, notice
of the acceptance of this guarantee and of the Obligation, presentment, demand
for payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor and protest, notice
of the Obligation incurred and all other notices of any kind (other than
notices required by this Agreement and defenses that are available to Parent
and Purchaser). The Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive substantial
direct and indirect benefits from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that the waivers set forth in this Guarantee are knowingly made
in contemplation of such benefits. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Guarantor and the performance by the Guarantor of its
obligations contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Guarantor, and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Guarantor are necessary to authorize
this Agreement or to perform its obligations hereunder. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement (as it may be modified, amended or waived
from time to time in accordance with its terms), the liabilities and
obligations of Guarantor pursuant to this Agreement shall not be released,
discharged or otherwise affected by (x) any modification, amendment, waivers
or extensions under this Agreement (except to the extent of any such
modification, amendment, waivers or extensions that is entered into without
the prior consent of Guarantor) or (y) any change in the corporate existence,
structure or ownership of Parent or Purchaser. Guarantor hereby waives any
right, whether legal or equitable, statutory or non-statutory, to require any
person to proceed against or take any action against or pursue any remedy with
respect to Parent or Purchaser or any other person or make presentment or
demand for performance or give any notice of nonperformance before the
Company may enforce its rights hereunder against Guarantor. For the avoidance
of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this
Section 9.11 and the guarantee contemplated hereby shall terminate in
accordance with Section 8.2 upon a termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1.

Parent and Purchaser; provided, that, the foregoing conditions set forth in
clauses (a), (e), (g) and (h) (collectively, the " _Specified Offer
Conditions_ ") may only be waived with the prior written consent of the
Company. The failure by Parent or Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the

right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and
from time to time.
