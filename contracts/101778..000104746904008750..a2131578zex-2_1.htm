shall increase the MAP Partial Redemption Amount (as defined in Section
14.02) payable in the MAP Partial Redemption as directed by Marathon if

the requirements of any potentially applicable fraudulent transfer or
conveyance Law, that the aggregate amount of the MAP Partial Redemption
Amount (before giving effect to such increase) and the Capital Contribution
(as defined in Section 1.03(b)) is not reasonably equivalent to the aggregate
value immediately prior to the consummation of the Transactions, as
determined by Marathon in its sole discretion, of (i) Ashlands Membership
Interest, (ii) the Maleic Business and (iii) the VIOC Centers. In the event
that Marathon makes the determination contemplated by the immediately
preceding sentence, any resulting increase in the MAP Partial Redemption
Amount shall be payable in any combination of cash and accounts receivable of
MAP as determined by Marathon. If at any time Marathon determines that it is
reasonably likely to direct MAP to increase the MAP Partial Redemption Amount
pursuant to the second sentence of this Section 1.01, Marathon shall provide

estimate of any such increase.

Marathon Common Stock as contemplated by Section 5.01(e) are referred
to collectively as " _Acquisition Merger Consideration_ ". As of the
Acquisition Merger Effective Time, all such shares of HoldCo Common Stock
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate formerly
representing the right to receive any such shares of HoldCo Common Stock
pursuant to Section 2.04(b) shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive, upon surrender of such certificate in
accordance with Section 5.01, the Acquisition Merger Consideration, without
interest. " _Exchange Ratio_ " means $315,000,000 divided by the product of
(x) the Fair Market Value and (y) the total number of shares of Ashland
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Reorganization
Merger Effective Time. " _Fair Market Value_ " means an amount equal to the
average of the closing sale prices per share for the Marathon Common Stock on
the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ "), as reported in _The Wall Street
Journal_ , Northeastern edition, for each of the twenty consecutive trading
days ending with the third complete trading day prior to the Closing Date
(not counting the Closing Date) (the " _Averaging Period_ "). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the Board of Directors of Marathon (the " _Marathon_

  



  

16      
   



  

 _Board_ ") declares a dividend on the outstanding shares of Marathon Common
Stock having a record date before the Closing Date but an ex-dividend date
(based on "regular way" trading on the NYSE of shares of Marathon Common
Stock) (the " _Ex-Date_ ") that occurs after the first trading day of the
Averaging Period, then for purposes of computing the Fair Market Value, the
closing price on any trading day before the Ex-Date will be adjusted by
subtracting therefrom the amount of such dividend. For purposes of the
immediately preceding sentence, the amount of any noncash dividend will be
the fair market value thereof on the payment date for such dividend as
determined in good faith by mutual agreement of Ashland and Marathon.

  

### 

  

### (c) If, prior to the Acquisition Merger Effective Time, the outstanding
shares of Marathon Common Stock shall have been reclassified or changed into,
or exchanged for, securities other than Marathon Common Stock (including as
a result of a merger), then, notwithstanding Section 4.03(a)(i) but
subject to Section 5.01(e), each issued and outstanding share of HoldCo
Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive such other
securities with the exchange ratio determined in accordance with Section
4.03(b), subject to such appropriate adjustments as shall be determined in
good faith by mutual agreement of Ashland and Marathon.

  

### 

  

### (d) If, after the first trading day of the Averaging Period and prior to
the Acquisition Merger Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Marathon
Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged
for a different number of shares of Marathon Common Stock in any case as a
result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock
dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares
or other similar change in capitalization, then an appropriate and
proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Ratio.

## SECTION 4.04. _Limited Liability Company Agreement._ The limited
liability company agreement of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to
the Acquisition Merger Effective Time shall be the limited liability
company agreement of the business entity surviving the Acquisition Merger,
Merger Sub, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law.

## SECTION 4.05. _Tax Treatment._ The parties intend that (a) the
Acquisition Merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, (b) HoldCo and Marathon will each be a "party" to
such reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code and
(c) this Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" for

### (f) _Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund

New Ashland Inc., the execution of an indemnity

reasonably satisfactory to New Ashland Inc. (and, if required by New Ashland
Inc., the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as New
Ashland Inc. may direct, as indemnity) against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable Acquisition Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of
HoldCo Common Stock formerly represented thereby, and any dividends or other
distributions such holder has the right to receive in respect thereof,
pursuant to this Agreement.

  

###

Dissenters Shares such amounts as may be required to be deducted and
withheld by New Ashland Inc. or Marathon, as applicable, with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or under any provision of state, local
or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over
to the appropriate Tax Authority (as defined in Section 14.02), New Ashland
Inc. or Marathon, as applicable, will be treated as though it withheld an
appropriate amount of the type of consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of Certificates or Dissenters Shares, sold such
consideration for an amount of cash equal to the fair market value of such
consideration at the time of such deemed sale and paid such cash proceeds to
the appropriate Tax Authority. Such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
shares represented by the Certificates or Dissenters Shares, as the case may
be, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

New Ashland Inc. Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto), Marathon Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificate has not been surrendered prior to five years after the

## SECTION 9.03. _Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification._ (a) Upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the
parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with
the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable,
the Transactions, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers, consents, orders, authorizations and approvals from
Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations,
declarations and filings (including filings with Governmental Entities, if
any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an
approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any
Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals
or waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other
legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining
order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed
and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary
to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of the
Transaction Agreements. In connection with and without limiting the
foregoing, the Ashland Parties and the Marathon Parties shall (i) take all
action necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar statute
or regulation is or becomes applicable to any Transaction Agreement, any
Ancillary Agreement or any Transaction and (ii) if any state takeover statute
or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to any Transaction
Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or any Transaction, take all action
necessary to ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by the Transaction Agreements.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Ashland and its Representatives shall not be
prohibited under this Section 9.03(a) from taking any action permitted
by Section 8.02. Nothing in this Section 9.03(a) shall be deemed to require
Marathon to waive any rights or agree to any limitation on the operations of
Marathon or any of its subsidiaries or to dispose of any asset or collection
of assets of any Marathon Party or any of their respective subsidiaries or
affiliates, in each case that would have a

  

## 

  

## 59      
   

## 

  

material adverse effect on the business, condition (financial or other) or
results of operations of (i) MAP, the Maleic Business and the VIOC Centers,
taken as a whole, or (ii) Marathon and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

  

## 

  

### (b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Ashland shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
condition set forth in Section 10.02(c) (Specified Consents) to be satisfied.
The parties, together with their financial advisors, shall consult
periodically regarding the scope of "reasonable best efforts," which will not
require Ashland to incur commercially unreasonable costs to satisfy such
condition. With respect to the Ashland Public Debt (as defined in this
Section 9.03(b)), the parties acknowledge that Ashland may obtain consents
through a tender offer or consent solicitation (or combination thereof), to
be consummated on the Closing Date and to be commenced on a date mutually
agreed by Ashland and Marathon but in any event no later than five business
days after the satisfaction of the last to be satisfied of the conditions set
forth in Sections 10.01(a) (Ashland Shareholder Approval), 10.01(c)
(Antitrust) and 10.01(f) (Receipt of Private Letter Rulings; Tax Opinions) to
expressly permit the Transactions and eliminate indenture covenants, certain
events of default and other relevant provisions, all as reasonably deemed by
Ashland necessary to consummate the Transactions (or, in the case of a
combined tender offer and consent solicitation, otherwise desirable). "
_Ashland Public Debt_ " means securities outstanding as of the last day of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the tender offer and/or
consent solicitation is commenced (the " _Debt Consent Measurement Date_ "),
issued under the Indenture dated as of August 15, 1989, between Ashland and
Citibank, N.A. and the Amendment and Restatement thereof dated as of August
15, 1990 (the " _Indentures_ "), other than any such securities issued after
the date of this Agreement. For purposes of this Section 9.03(b) and Section
10.02(c), receipt of consents from the holders of not less than 66-2/3% in
principal amount of the Outstanding Securities (as defined in the Indentures)
of any series constitutes a consent with respect to the entire principal
amount as of the Debt Consent Measurement Date, of such series. For the
avoidance of doubt, receipt of consents from the holders of less than 66-2/3%
in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series shall
not constitute a consent with respect to any portion of such series.

Bring-Down AAA Opinions (as defined in Section 10.01(g)) and to cause HLHZ to
deliver to Ashland and Marathon the Bring-Down HLHZ Opinion (as defined
in Section 10.01(g)). It is understood that (A) the Ashland Board may rely

Board determines that such reliance is appropriate (subject to the
indemnification and expense reimbursement arrangements previously agreed
between Ashland and AAA) and (B) the Marathon Board may rely upon the Initial
HLHZ Opinion and the Bring-Down HLHZ Opinion if the Marathon Board determines
that such reliance is appropriate (subject to indemnification and expense
reimbursement arrangements agreed between Marathon and HLHZ).

Ashland and Marathon of any facts or circumstances that are expected to
result in it being unable to deliver its Bring-Down Opinion as of such date.
The Ashland Parties and the Marathon Parties shall be deemed to have jointly
requested AAA or HLHZ to comply with any such request as promptly as
practicable.

  

#### 

  

#### (v) In the event that AAA or HLHZ shall notify Ashland and Marathon of
any facts or circumstances that are expected to result in it being unable to
deliver its Bring-Down Opinion, Ashland or MAP, as applicable, shall have the
right for a period of three months, or such shorter period as Ashland or MAP,
as applicable, may elect, to meet and confer with, and provide additional
information to, AAA or HLHZ, as applicable, for purposes of resolving any
concerns relating to such facts and circumstances. The Ashland Parties and
the Marathon Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause AAA or
HLHZ, as applicable (based on such information and any efforts by Ashland or
MAP, as applicable, to cure or otherwise address such facts and
circumstances), to advise Ashland and Marathon as promptly as practicable
after the expiration of such period

Opinions, and any other Working Papers of AAA and HLHZ prepared pursuant to
this Section 9.03(d) or otherwise relating to the Transactions, shall be
made available to the Ashland Parties and the Marathon Parties upon request
at any time prior to or after the Closing. The Ashland Parties and the
Marathon Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause AAA and

#### (vii) At any time after August 1, 2004, or such earlier date as Ashland
and Marathon may agree, and prior to the Closing, either Ashland or Marathon
may request that AAA prepare a draft of the Bring-Down AAA Opinions or that
HLHZ prepare a draft of the Bring-Down HLHZ Opinion, in each case marked to
show any proposed changes from the applicable form included in Section
10.01(g) of the Marathon Disclosure Letter or in Section 10.01(g) of the
Ashland Disclosure Letter, respectively, based on events occurring or facts
disclosed to AAA or HLHZ after the date of this Agreement.  The Ashland
Parties and the Marathon Parties shall be deemed to have jointly requested
AAA or HLHZ to comply with any such request as promptly as practicable.
Ashland and Marathon may review and comment on any such proposed changes and
may meet and confer with AAA and HLHZ for purposes of resolving any such
comments prior to the Closing.

## SECTION 9.09. _St. Paul Park Judgment and Plea Agreement; Plains
Settlement._

  

(a) After the Closing, (i) MAP shall complete the St. Paul Park QQQ Project
(as defined in this Section 9.09(a))(if it has not been completed prior to
the Closing) and (ii) the Marathon Parties shall allow New Ashland Inc., the
United States Probation Office and their respective consultants and
advisors appropriate access to the St. Paul Park refinery to allow them to
monitor and ascertain completion of the St. Paul Park QQQ Project and
assure compliance of the "systems" (as defined in the St. Paul Park Judgment
and Plea Agreement (as defined in Section 14.02)) with the St. Paul
Park Judgment and Plea Agreement. The " _St. Paul Park QQQ Project_" means
the upgrade of all process sewers, junction boxes and drains at the St. Paul
Park refinery to comply with Subpart QQQ of the New Source Performance
Standards of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7413(c)(1), in accordance with
the St. Paul Park Judgment and Plea Agreement.

  

## 

  

### (b) Ashland or New Ashland Inc. shall bear the cost of the St. Paul Park
QQQ Project incurred after

  

### 

  

### 70      
   

### 

  

January 1, 2003 not to exceed $9,670,000 (if the Closing occurs on or before
December 31, 2004) or the amount of the Price Reduction (as defined in
Amendment No. 1 to the Put/Call Agreement) (if the Closing occurs after
December 31, 2004) (the " _St. Paul Park QQQ Project Payment Amount_ ").
The following amounts shall be credited against the St. Paul Park QQQ
Project Payment Amount: (i) 38% of (A) all out-of-pocket costs incurred
after January 1, 2003 by MAP and (B) internal engineering costs of MAP
incurred after January 1, 2003, in each case for which MAP has not been
reimbursed by Ashland, prior to the Closing, in each case arising out of or
relating to the St. Paul Park QQQ Project, (ii) all out-of-pocket costs
incurred after January 1, 2003 by MAP and internal engineering costs of
MAP incurred after January 1, 2003, for which MAP has been reimbursed
by Ashland, prior to the Closing, in each case arising out of or relating to
the St. Paul Park QQQ Project, and (iii) $1,569,400, which amount represents
38% of the $4,130,000 paid by MAP as part of the Plains Settlement (the sum
of the amount referred to in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) being the "
_Prior Payments_ "). MAP shall provide to Ashland, at least two business
days prior to the Closing Date, a written statement setting forth in
reasonable detail its calculation of the amounts referred to in clauses (i)
and (ii) of the preceding sentence. Promptly following the Closing, if the
St. Paul Park QQQ Project Payment Amount exceeds the Prior Payments, New
Ashland Inc. shall, and if the Prior Payments exceed the St. Paul Park QQQ
Project Payment Amount, MAP shall, make payment to the other party of the
amount of such excess, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a
bank account designated in writing by MAP or New Ashland Inc., as applicable,
at least two business days prior to the Closing Date.

  

### 

  

## SECTION 9.10. _Consequences of Inability To Transfer the Ashland
LOOP/LOCAP Interest on the Closing Date._ The parties acknowledge that,
pursuant to the MAP Governing Documents, Ashland is obligated to pay to MAP
an amount equal to any dividends or distributions that Ashland receives in
respect of the Ashland LOOP/LOCAP Interest net of certain Taxes imposed on
Ashland or withheld from such dividends or distributions, and accordingly,
the economic benefits of the foregoing have already been effectively
transferred to MAP. Accordingly, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, it shall not be a condition to the Closing or
the effectiveness of any of the

  

## 

  

## 71      
   

## 

  

Transactions that Ashland shall have contributed the Ashland
LOOP/LOCAP Interest to HoldCo in accordance with Section 1.02(b) and
the MAP/LOOP/LOCAP Contribution Agreements.  In the event that any consents
or approvals required for the transfer of the Ashland LOOP/LOCAP Interest are
not obtained prior to the Closing, and as a consequence Ashland is not able
to contribute the Ashland LOOP/LOCAP Interest to HoldCo on the Closing Date,
the provisions set forth in Sections 9.02(e), 13.03 and 13.04 of the Put/Call
Agreement shall apply; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, from and after the
Closing, any payments described in the first sentence of this Section 9.10
shall be made by New Ashland Inc. to Merger Sub for the benefit of MAP.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 9.11. _Consents Under Assigned Contracts._ Ashland and Marathon
shall use their reasonable best efforts (not including the payment of any
consideration) to obtain any Consents of third parties necessary to effect
the assignment to and assumption by HoldCo of, and the release of Ashland
from, the Assigned Contracts (as defined in each of the Maleic Agreement and
the VIOC Agreement), including in the case of the Marathon Parties by
providing such assurances regarding performance by Merger Sub (as successor
to HoldCo) after the Closing as may be reasonably required to obtain such
Consents.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 9.12. _Administrative Proceedings._ After the Closing, if the
Marathon Parties receive notice or become aware of any consent decree or
order, notice of violation, administrative enforcement action or similar
administrative action (each, an " _Administrative Proceeding_ ") relating to
MAP and naming Ashland as a responsible party, the Marathon Parties shall
promptly notify Ashland of such Administrative Proceeding.  Ashland may
take, and MAP shall provide Ashland with such cooperation as Ashland may
reasonably request in connection with, any reasonable action to
remove Ashlands name from such Administrative Proceeding, so long as such
removal is appropriate under the circumstances (taking into consideration the
applicable provisions of the Transaction Agreements, the Ancillary
Agreements, the MAP Governing Documents and applicable Law).  Nothing in
this Section 9.12 is intended to affect MAPs right to control its defense of
such Administrative Proceedings.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 9.13. _Replacement of Distributed Receivables._ To the extent
any Distributed Receivable is reduced or canceled (other than as a result
of a breach by

  

## 

  

## 72      
   

## 

  

the obligor thereof of its payment obligation), or to the extent Ashland
makes any payment in respect of proceeds of any Distributed Receivable to the
holder of any Lien referred to in clause (iv) below after the collection of
such Distributed Receivable in order to satisfy such Lien, including as a
result of (i) defective or rejected goods or services, any cash discount or
governmental or regulatory action, (ii) a setoff in respect of any claim by
the obligor thereof, (iii) an obligation of MAP to pay the obligor thereof
any rebate or refund or (iv) any Lien with respect to such Distributed
Receivable, other than any Lien arising from actions or inactions of any of
the Ashland Parties or their affiliates (and not any of the Marathon Parties
or their affiliates), then MAP shall promptly assign to Ashland accounts
receivable of MAP, selected in accordance with the protocol set forth in
Exhibit A, with a total Value equal to, in the case of a reduction, the Value
of such reduction, in the case of a payment, the amount of such payment, or,
in the case of a cancelation, the Value of such Distributed Receivable.
Ashland shall assign back to MAP any Distributed Receivables that have been
replaced pursuant to this Section 9.13.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 9.14. _Transition Services._ Within 120 days after the date of
this Agreement, Marathon shall provide written notice to Ashland
specifying which of the services currently being performed by Ashland for the
Maleic Business that Marathon requests New Ashland Inc. to continue to
perform during the transition period after the Closing specified in, and in
accordance with the terms of, the Transition Services Agreement (as defined
in the Maleic Agreement). Prior to the Closing, Ashland and Marathon shall
agree on the scope of such transition services and shall prepare appropriate
schedules to the Transition Services Agreement to reflect such transition
services.  Unless otherwise agreed by Ashland and Marathon, the fees for
such transition services shall be as specified in Section 2.1 (without
regard to clause (i) of the first sentence thereof) of the form of Transition
Services Agreement attached as an exhibit to the Maleic Agreement. Such
transition services shall be provided during the term specified in Section
2.2 of such form of Transition Services Agreement, subject to the termination
and notice provisions specified therein.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 9.15. _MAP Partial Redemption Amount._

  

(a) Ashland shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause

  

## 

  

## 73      
   

## 

  

Deloitte and Touche LLP (" _D andT_") to provide Ashland and Marathon, on or
prior to August 15, 2004, (i) a preliminary report prepared by DandT setting
forth DandTs good faith estimate as to the respective amounts of accounts
receivable and cash to be distributed by MAP in the MAP Partial Redemption
and (ii) any supporting schedules and other information prepared by DandT in
connection with such report as Marathon may reasonably request. Ashland shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause DandT to provide Ashland and Marathon
any updates to such report, schedules and other information from time to time
as Marathon may reasonably request.

  

## 

  

### (b) The Marathon Parties shall cause MAP to have available for
distribution at Closing in the MAP Partial Redemption cash in an amount, and
accounts receivable with a Value, which in the aggregate equal the Estimated
MAP Partial Redemption Amount. The Ashland Parties and the Marathon Parties
shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause MAP to have available for
distribution at Closing in the MAP Partial Redemption cash in an amount equal
to the Cash Amount and accounts receivable with a total Value equal to the AR
Amount. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.01(c) or any provision of
the MAP LLC Agreement (as amended by the MAP LLC Agreement Amendment or
otherwise amended hereafter), and without requiring a vote pursuant to
Section 8.07(b) of the MAP LLC Agreement (as amended by the MAP LLC Agreement
Amendment or otherwise amended hereafter), in the event Marathon reasonably
expects that MAP will not have sufficient cash and accounts receivable
available for distribution to Ashland to fund the payment of the Estimated
MAP Partial Redemption Amount (after taking into account MAPs reasonably
anticipated working capital requirements) on the expected Closing Date, MAP
shall be permitted to sell or otherwise dispose of assets, or enter into
sale/leaseback arrangements, in each case in arms-length transactions with
unaffiliated third parties, that are treated for Federal income Tax purposes
as dispositions, not borrowings, in order to raise funds to satisfy such
funding requirement.

  

### 

  

### (c) If the Closing occurs, all Tax Items (as defined in the Tax Matters
Agreement) from any sale, disposition or sale/leaseback arrangement effected
pursuant to Section 9.15(b) that is not effected in the ordinary course of
MAPs business and is not reflected in MAPs "Business/Tactical Plan and Budget
2004-2006" dated

  

### 

  

### 74      
   

### 

  

December 16, 2003 shall be allocated to Marathon Company. The Marathon
Parties shall (i) promptly notify Ashland of any written proposal made or
received by any of the Marathon Parties relating to such a sale, disposition
or sale/leaseback arrangement, and in any event shall notify Ashland of any
such proposed sale, disposition or sale/leaseback arrangement not less than
five days prior to entering into an agreement to effect any such sale,
disposition or sale/leaseback arrangement; (ii) in connection with any such
proposal, advise Ashland in writing of the assets to be transferred, the
identity of the proposed transferee and the material terms and conditions of
the proposed sale, disposition or sale/leaseback arrangement; (iii) keep
Ashland reasonably informed on a timely basis of the status and details of
such proposed sale, disposition or sale/leaseback arrangement, prior to and
after entering into an agreement to effect any such sale, disposition or
sale/leaseback arrangement, including any details that may affect the timing
of the Transactions, and provide Ashland with copies of all material
documents related to such proposed sale, disposition or sale/leaseback
arrangement; and (iv) use its reasonable best efforts to effect the closing
of any such sale, disposition or sale/leaseback arrangement substantially
concurrently with the Closing.

  

### 

  

### (d) Ashland shall provide Marathon not less than 90 days notice if
Ashland intends to waive the condition set forth in Section 10.02(f), in
which case the Marathon Parties shall cause MAP to have available for
distribution at Closing in the MAP Partial Redemption such additional cash as
may be required to comply with the first sentence of Section 9.15(b).

  

### 

  

## SECTION 9.16. _Ashland Debt Obligation Amount._ No later than August 1,
2004, Ashland shall provide to Marathon a schedule setting forth estimates,
prepared in good faith by Ashland in light of any communications with the
Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ "), written or otherwise, of the
Ashland Debt Obligation Amounts based on assumed Closing Dates occurring
on the last day of each month from August of 2004 through June of 2005.
Ashland shall update such schedule promptly following any communication with
the IRS, written or otherwise, that would materially affect the Ashland Debt
Obligation Amount for any assumed Closing Date. Within five business days of

  

## 

  

## 75      
   

## 

  

Ashlands receipt of the Private Letter Rulings, Ashland shall provide to
Marathon a schedule setting forth the Ashland Debt Obligation Amount for each
such assumed Closing Date after the date of such schedule. Ashland shall not,
without the prior written consent of Marathon, effect any repurchase,
repayment or defeasance prior to the Closing Date of any debt outstanding as
of the date of this Agreement (and any refinancings of such debt by Ashland
or any of its affiliates) that would reduce the Ashland Debt Obligation
Amount (taking into consideration any refinancing of such debt by Ashland or
any of its affiliates), except to the extent required by the terms of such
debt (including, with respect to obligations other than (i) the Ashland
Public Debt, (ii) any other debt issued after the date of this Agreement to
refinance any portion of the Ashland Debt Obligation Amount and (iii)
Ashlands industrial revenue bonds, as a result of any notice of Ashlands
intent to repurchase, repay or defease such obligations on an expected
Closing Date; _provided_ , that such notice is delivered by Ashland after the
satisfaction of the last to be satisfied of the conditions set forth in
Sections 10.01(a) (Ashland Shareholder Approval), 10.01(c) (Antitrust) and

notice from Ashland ( _provided_ that the Ashland Parties are not then in
breach of their representations, warranties or covenants contained in the
Transaction Agreements, which breaches would give rise to the failure of
a condition set forth in Section 10.03(a) or 10.03(b)); _provided_ ,

be deemed not to have breached or failed to perform their covenant to cause
the HoldCo Borrowing to be advanced to HoldCo in accordance with Section
1.03(a) for up to three months following the day on which the Closing Date
would otherwise occur but for the failure of the Marathon Parties to cause

with all terms, conditions, restrictions and limitations contained in Section
9.8 of the Asset Transfer and Contribution Agreement among Marathon Company,
Ashland and MAP dated as of December 12, 1997, as amended (the " _ATCA_ "),
MAP shall direct and control all Remediation Activities (as defined in the
ATCA) undertaken in connection with any Ashland Environmental Loss associated
with the Ashland Transferred Assets (as such terms are defined in the ATCA).
The Ashland Parties and the Marathon Parties shall cooperate in transferring
the direction and control of such Remediation Activities to MAP. In addition,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the ATCA, if the
Closing occurs, New Ashland Inc. shall not have any liabilities or
obligations:

  

## 

  

#### (i) in excess of $50,000,000 in the aggregate for Ashland Environmental
Losses under Section 9.2(c) of the ATCA incurred on or after January 1,
2004, except as otherwise provided in the last sentence of this Section
12.01(a);

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) arising out of the St. Paul Park QQQ Project to the extent incurred
on or after January 1, 2003 other than the amounts to be paid pursuant
to Section 9.09(b);

  

#### 

  

#### 86      
   

#### 

  

#### (iii) arising out of the Plains Settlement (as defined in Section 14.02)
regardless of when incurred; or

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) under Section 9.8(f) of the ATCA.

  

#### 

  

From and after the Closing, MAP shall continue to treat and process any and
all impacted groundwater associated with Remediation Activities undertaken in
connection with any Ashland Environmental Loss (as defined in the ATCA)
relating to the Catlettsburg, Canton and St. Paul Park refineries.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 12.01(a),
such treatment and processing shall be at MAPs sole cost and expense. MAP
shall have title to any and all hydrocarbons recovered during the treatment
and processing of such impacted groundwater. Ashland shall retain
all Ashland Excluded Liabilities (as defined in the ATCA) as well as
all liabilities and obligations associated with the Scharbauer and Holt
Ranch S-P project and the S-P projects described on Schedule 9.2(c) to the
Ashland Asset Transfer and Contribution Agreement Disclosure Letter
(as defined in the ATCA).

  



  

### (b) _Other Indemnification._ After the Closing, the Ashland Parties
shall not have any liabilities or obligations for breaches of representations
or warranties under Section 9.2(a) of the ATCA, including the Claims (as
defined in the ATCA) identified in Section 12.01(b) of the Ashland Disclosure
Letter, regardless of whether any Claim thereunder has been asserted on or
prior to the Closing Date.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Department of Defense Claim._ Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in the ATCA or the other MAP Governing Documents, (i) MAP
shall pursue the claims that MAP has asserted against the U.S. Department of
Defense (the " _DOD_ ") relating to alleged illegal price adjustments for jet
fuel and other aviation fuel sold to the DOD by Ashland Petroleum Company
from 1980 through 1990 (the " _DOD Claims_ ") and (ii) New Ashland Inc. shall
have the right to participate in the pursuit of the DOD Claims and to employ
counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by MAP, it
being understood that MAP shall control, in consultation with New Ashland
Inc., the pursuit of the DOD Claims. MAP shall use its reasonable best efforts
to prosecute the DOD Claims in accordance with this Section 12.01(c)
until the DOD Claims

  

### 

  

### 87      
   

### 

  

are finally determined pursuant to one or more final and
nonappealable orders, decrees or judgments by a court of competent
jurisdiction or by one or more settlement agreements approved by New Ashland
Inc. (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).  If MAP
shall receive any recovery under the DOD Claims, whether by judgment,
settlement or otherwise, Marathon or Merger Sub shall promptly pay to New
Ashland Inc. an amount equal to (A) 38% of such recovery minus (B) 38% of
MAPs reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses in pursuing the DOD Claims.
If and to the extent MAPs reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred in the pursuit of the DOD Claims exceeds the ultimate recovery under
the DOD Claims, New Ashland Inc. shall pay to Marathon an amount equal to 38%
of such excess.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Employee Benefit Matters._ (i) As of the Closing, except as
expressly modified herein, the terms and conditions of Article X of the ATCA
shall continue to apply with respect to all employees and former employees of
MAP and its subsidiaries who were Ashland Transferred Employees (as defined
in the ATCA) (the " _Transferred MAP Employees_ ").

  

### 

  

#### (ii) Without limiting the generality of Section 12.01(d)(i), from and
after the Closing, MAP and its successors shall be solely responsible for
all liabilities, obligations and commitments (including any costs and
expenses) in connection with the provision of retiree medical and retiree
life insurance benefits to the Transferred MAP Employees.  Such benefits
shall be determined taking into account the combined service of each
Transferred MAP Employee with Ashland and its subsidiaries and MAP and its
subsidiaries. For the avoidance of doubt, Ashland shall not have any
liability, obligation or commitment in respect of retiree medical or retiree
life insurance benefits for MAP employees, including Transferred MAP
Employees, from and after the Closing.

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) Ashland shall remain solely responsible for any benefits under the
Ashland and Affiliates Pension Plan (the " _Ashland Pension Plan_ ") and for
any benefits under the Ashland Leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the "
_Ashland LESOP_ ") accrued by each Transferred MAP Employee as of immediately
prior to such employees Employment

  

#### 

  

#### 88      
   

#### 

  

#### Transfer Date (as defined in the ATCA). Solely for purposes of qualifying
for distributions and early retirement benefits pursuant to the Ashland
Pension Plan and the Ashland LESOP, Ashland will continue to treat the
Transferred MAP Employees as employed by an affiliated employer for so long
as they remain actively employed by MAP or its successors or their
affiliates.

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) In accordance with the terms of the Ashland Employee Savings Plan,
as of the Closing, Ashland agrees to facilitate the ability of each
Transferred MAP Employee who is currently employed by MAP and its
subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing to effect a "direct rollover"
(within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) of his or her account
balances under the Ashland Employee Savings Plan if such rollover is elected
in accordance with applicable Law by such Transferred MAP Employee. Marathon
agrees to cause the Marathon Thrift Plan to accept a "direct rollover" to the
Marathon Thrift Plan of such Transferred MAP Employees account balances
(including promissory notes evidencing all outstanding loans) under the
Ashland Employee Savings Plan.

  

#### 

  

#### (v) Except as provided in this Section 12.01(d), Ashland shall remain
solely responsible for any individual contractual obligations with any
Transferred MAP Employees (including any obligations to such employees
pursuant to the Ashland Stock Plans, the Ashland Salary Continuation Plan and
any other severance, change in control or incentive compensation plan or
arrangement) to the extent that Ashland was liable for such obligations
immediately prior to the Closing.

  

#### 

  

#### (vi) Subject to applicable Law, Ashland shall reasonably cooperate in
providing MAP with complete data for any Transferred MAP Employees.

  

#### 

  

#### (vii) The parties agree that, in the event that MAP and its subsidiaries
make any contributions to, or payments in respect of, any pension plans,
post-retirement health and life

  

#### 

  

#### 89      
   

#### 

  

#### insurance plans or any other post-employment benefit arrangements, other
than the Permitted Payments (as defined below), then MAP shall make a special
non-pro rata distribution to Ashland in an amount equal to 38% of the amount
by which any such contributions or payments exceed the Permitted Payments.
Any such distribution to Ashland pursuant to this Section 12.01(d)(vii) shall
be effected through an increase in the MAP Partial Redemption Amount or
through such other means as Ashland and MAP may mutually agree. For purposes
of this Section 12.01(d)(vii), " _Permitted Payments_ " means:

  

#### 

  

#### (A) any benefit payments made in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice to beneficiaries of such pension plans, post-
retirement health and life insurance plans or post-employment benefit
arrangements;

  

#### 

  

#### (B) contributions to the MAP Retirement Plan (the " _MAP Qualified
Pension Plan_ ") in an amount not in excess of the minimum amount necessary
to avoid the required filing of information with the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation (" _PBGC"_ ) pursuant to Section 4010 of ERISA with respect to
the 2003 information year, which filing would otherwise be due on April 15,
2004 (which amounts shall be contributed at the latest possible time to avoid
such required filing);

  

#### 

  

#### (C) in the case of the MAP Qualified Pension Plan (1) if the pension
funding relief (including relief related to the determination of the PBGC
variable-rate premium (within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. 4006.3)) contemplated
by H.R. 3108 (or any substantially similar legislation) (the "
_Pension Funding Relief_ ") is enacted into law on or prior to September
15, 2004, contributions in calendar year 2004 in an amount not in excess of
the minimum amount necessary to avoid payment of the variable-rate premium
for such plan for the 2004 plan year (taking into account any amounts

  

#### 

  

#### 90      
   

#### 

  

#### previously contributed to the MAP Qualified Pension Plan,
including pursuant to the immediately preceding clause (B) and clause (C)(3)
below), provided that such contributions shall not be made before the latest
possible time that such contributions may be made and still be taken into
account in determining whether any variable-rate premium is due for the 2004
plan year, using the method that produces the lowest variable-rate premium
and reflects any exemptions and special rules under 29 C.F.R. 4006.5 and the
highest discount rate permitted for the calculation of such variable-rate
premium and such other actuarial assumptions as set forth in 29 C.F.R. 4006
or otherwise required under PBGC regulations and (2) if the Pension Funding
Relief is enacted into law on or prior to September 15, 2005, contributions
in calendar year 2005 in an amount not in excess of the minimum amount
necessary to avoid payment of the variable-rate premium for such plan for the
2005 plan year (taking into account any amounts previously contributed to the
MAP Qualified Pension Plan, including pursuant to the immediately preceding
clauses (B) and (C)(1) and clause (C)(3) below), provided that such
contributions shall not be made before the latest possible time that such
contributions may be made and still be taken into account in determining
whether any variable-rate premium is due for the 2005 plan year, using the
method that produces the lowest variable-rate premium and reflects any
exemptions and special rules under 29 C.F.R. 4006.5 and the highest discount
rate permitted for the calculation of such variable-rate premium and such
other actuarial assumptions as set forth in 29 C.F.R. 4006 or otherwise
required under PBGC regulations and (3) until the Pension Funding Relief is
enacted into law, contributions (made in amounts and at such times consistent
with past practice) not in

  

#### 

  

#### 91      
   

#### 

  

#### excess of $120,000,000 in each of calendar year 2004 and 2005; and

  

#### 

  

#### (D) in the case of the MAP Qualified Pension Plan, contributions not in
excess of the minimum additional amounts required (which amounts shall be
contributed at the latest possible time) for such plan to satisfy the minimum
funding requirements of Section 412 of the Code;

  

#### 

  

#### it being understood that any amounts previously contributed to the
MAP Qualified Pension Plan (including under the immediately preceding clause
(B), (C) (1)-(3) or (D)) shall be taken into account in determining any
subsequent amounts permitted to be contributed under the immediately
preceding clause (B), (C)(1)-(3) or (D) so as to avoid duplication of
contributions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event may Permitted
Payments under the immediately preceding clauses (B), (C)(1)-(3) and (D) in
the aggregate exceed, for each of calendar years 2004 and 2005, an amount
(the " _Maximum Annual Permitted Payment_ ") equal to the greater of (x) the
minimum contributions required to be paid in such year to satisfy the minimum
funding requirements of Section 412 of the Code (based on the required due
dates for such contributions) and (y) $120,000,000. With respect to the 2005
calendar year, the Maximum Annual Permitted Payment shall be pro-rated by
multiplying the Maximum Annual Permitted Payment by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of months elapsed in such year through and including
the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is 12. At least 30 days in
advance of any Permitted Payment described under clauses (B), (C)(1)-(3) or
(D) of the definition thereof to be contributed by MAP or its subsidiaries to
the MAP Qualified Pension Plan, MAP and/or its actuary shall provide Ashland
with a good-faith estimate of such Permitted Payment, and with all
information reasonably requested by Ashland (and any actuary designated
by Ashland) to review and independently verify such Permitted Payment.

  

#### 

  

#### 92      
   

#### 

  

### (e) _Other Provisions._ After the Closing, the Ashland Parties and their
affiliates shall not have any liabilities or obligations under Section 7.2(h)
(Guarantees) or 7.2(l) (Marine Preservation Association) of the ATCA.  For
the avoidance of doubt, the other liabilities and obligations of the Ashland
Parties and their affiliates, and the liabilities and obligations of Marathon
Company, MAP and MAPs subsidiaries, under the ATCA, including those under
Article IX thereof, shall continue in full force and effect after the
Closing, except as provided in the Transaction Agreements. After the Closing,
Ashland shall not have any liabilities or obligations under the Parent
Company Guarantee dated May 28, 2003 relating to a Crude Oil Sales Agreement
with Saudi Arabian Oil Company effective June 1, 2003, as amended; _provided_
,  _however_ , that nothing in the Transaction Agreements or the
Ancillary Agreements shall prohibit Marathon from continuing to be a
guarantor thereunder.

## SECTION 12.02. _Designated Subleases._ (a)  With respect to the Goldman
Sachs Master Sublease Agreement dated as of January 1, 1998, between Ashland
Oil, Inc. and Speedway SuperAmerica LLC and the Pitney Bowes Credit
Corporation Master Subcharter Agreement, dated as of January 1, 1998, between
Ashland and MAP (each, a " _Designated Sublease_ "), Ashland shall use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) purchase or otherwise acquire the property
then leased under the Original Lease (as defined in the MAP LLC Agreement)
and subleased to MAP pursuant to each Designated Sublease (the " _Leased
Property_ ") on or prior to the Closing and (ii) upon such purchase or other
acquisition, contribute its interest in such Leased Property to MAP or one of
its subsidiaries at no cost to MAP or such subsidiary on or prior to the
Closing; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (A) with respect to any such Original
Lease, Ashland shall not be obligated to pay more than a reasonable amount as
consideration to, or make more than a reasonable financial accommodation in
favor of, or commence litigation against, any person (including in order to
obtain any agreement, consent or cooperation of or from such person) in order
to purchase or otherwise acquire the related Leased Property as contemplated
by, and in accordance with, this Section 12.02(a) and (B) any additional
cost associated with exercising an option under any such Original Lease to
purchase the related Leased Property as described above shall be deemed not
to

  

## 

  

## 93      
   

## 

  

constitute an obligation to pay more than a reasonable amount.

  

## 

  

### (b) In the event that Ashland is unable to purchase or otherwise acquire
the Leased Property related to a Designated Sublease in accordance
with Section 12.02(a), then the Ashland Parties and the Marathon Parties
shall use their reasonable best efforts (including entering into customary
documentation reasonably acceptable in form and substance to the Ashland
Parties and the Marathon Parties) to cause (i) all Ashlands existing rights
under such Original Lease and, as applicable, either the SuperAmerica
Transaction Documents (as defined below) or Pitney Bowes Transaction
Documents (as defined below), to be assigned to MAP, effective as of the
Closing Date, (ii) MAP to assume, effective as of the Closing Date, all
liabilities and obligations required to be performed or discharged after the
Closing under such Original Lease (including the obligation to pay rent and
any additional cost associated with exercising an option under such Original
Lease to purchase the related Leased Property) and, as applicable, either the
SuperAmerica Transaction Documents or Pitney Bowes Transaction Documents and
(iii) the Ashland Parties and their affiliates to be released, effective as
of the Closing Date, from all liabilities and obligations required to be
performed or discharged after the Closing under such Original Lease and, as
applicable, either the SuperAmerica Transaction Documents or Pitney Bowes
Transaction Documents. If the Ashland Parties and the Marathon Parties are
able to effect the assignment, assumption and release in accordance with this
Section 12.02(b) in connection with an Original Lease related to a Designated
Sublease, on the Closing Date, New Ashland Inc. shall pay to MAP cash, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to a MAP bank account designated
in writing by MAP at least two business days prior to the Closing Date, in an
amount equal to the present value, discounted at a rate equal to the yield to
average life of Marathon public debt having an average life similar to the
remaining average life of such Original Lease, and based on such other
assumptions as the parties shall reasonably agree upon, of the lowest cost
alternative of (x) the payment of all rent required to be paid thereafter
under such Original Lease (including for all renewal periods available under
the terms of such Original Lease) or (y) the payment of all rent required to
be paid thereafter under such Original Lease until the date of any

  

### 

  

### 94      
   

### 

  

available option under such Original Lease to purchase the related Leased
Property and the cost associated with exercising any such option. Ashland
shall reimburse Marathon for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by Marathon relating to such assignment, assumption and release; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, with respect to any Original Lease, Ashland shall not be
obligated to pay more than a reasonable amount as consideration to, or make
more than a reasonable financial accommodation in favor of, or commence
litigation against, any person (including in order to obtain any agreement,
consent or cooperation of or from such person) in order to effect the
assignment, assumption, and release contemplated by, and in accordance with,
this Section 12.02(b) with respect to such Original Lease and, as applicable,
either the SuperAmerica Transaction Documents or Pitney Bowes Transaction
Documents. If the Ashland Parties and the Marathon Parties are able to effect
the assignment, assumption and release in accordance with this Section
12.02(b) with respect to any Original Lease related to a Designated Sublease,
such Designated Sublease shall thereupon terminate and none of the Ashland
Parties or the Marathon Parties shall have any liabilities or obligations
thereunder other than liabilities and obligations required to be performed or
discharged before the Closing.

  

### 

  

### (c) In the event that, on or prior to the Closing, (x) Ashland is unable
to purchase and contribute the Leased Property related to a Designated
Sublease as contemplated by, and in accordance with, Section 12.02(a),
and (y) the Ashland Parties and the Marathon Parties are unable to effect
the assignment, assumption and release as contemplated by, and in accordance
with, Section 12.02(b) with respect to such Original Lease and, as
applicable, either the SuperAmerica Transaction Documents or Pitney Bowes
Transaction Documents, then (i) MAP shall be entitled to continue to sublease
the Leased Property pursuant to such Designated Sublease until the term of
such Original Lease expires, (ii) Ashland shall use its reasonable best
efforts to purchase or otherwise acquire the related Leased Property under
such Original Lease and convey title to such Leased Property to MAP or one of
its subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) with respect to any such
Original Lease, Ashland shall not be obligated to pay more than a reasonable
amount as consideration therefor to, or make more than a reasonable financial
accommodation in favor of, or commence litigation against, any person

(including in order to obtain any agreement, consent or cooperation of or
from such person) in order to purchase or otherwise acquire the
related Leased Property and (B) any additional cost associated with
exercising an option under any Original Lease to purchase related Leased
Property shall be deemed not to constitute an obligation to pay more than a
reasonable amount and (iii) if Ashland subsequently acquires such Leased
Property, Ashland shall convey title to such Leased Property to MAP or one of
its subsidiaries at no cost (including transfer Tax expense) to MAP or such
subsidiary at such time.

fraud) they may have against the Marathon Parties arising under or based upon
the Transaction Agreements, the Ancillary Agreements and the Transactions
(except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Section
13.02). The Ashland Parties shall take reasonable actions to mitigate Losses
for which indemnification may be sought under this Section 13.02, as and to
the extent a party is required to mitigate damages for breach of contract
under the Laws of the State of New York.

  

### 

  

## SECTION 13.03. _Calculation of Losses._ (a)  The amount of any Loss for
which indemnification is provided in clause (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v)(A)
of Section 13.01(a) of this Agreement or clause (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or
(v)(A) of Section 13.02(a) of this Agreement shall be net of any amounts
actually recovered by the indemnified party under the True Insurance Policies
(as such term is defined in the ATCA) with respect to such Loss; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the indemnified party shall not have any obligation to seek
any such recovery under any

  

## 

  

## 110      
   

## 

  

True Insurance Policy. The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is
provided pursuant to Section 13.01(a) or Section 13.02(a) of this Agreement
shall be (i) increased to take account of any net Tax cost incurred by
the indemnified party arising from the receipt or accrual of indemnity
payments hereunder (grossed up for such increase) and (ii) reduced to take
account of any net Tax Benefit (as defined in the ATCA) realized by the
indemnified party arising from the deductibility of any such Loss. In
computing the amount of any such Tax cost or Tax Benefit, the indemnified
party shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss,
deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising from the receipt or
accrual of any indemnity payment hereunder or the deductibility of any
indemnified Loss.  Any indemnification payment hereunder shall initially be
made without regard to clauses (i) and (ii) in the second sentence of
this Section 13.03, and shall be increased or reduced to reflect any such
net Tax cost (including gross-up) or net Tax Benefit only after the
indemnified party has actually realized such cost or benefit. For purposes of
this Agreement, an indemnified party shall be deemed to have "actually
realized" a net Tax cost or a net Tax Benefit to the extent that, and at such
time as, the amount of Taxes payable by such indemnified party is increased
above or reduced below, as the case may be, the amount of Taxes, that such
indemnified party would be required to pay but for the receipt or accrual of
the indemnity payment or the deductibility of such Loss, as the case may be.
The amount of any increase or reduction hereunder shall be adjusted to
reflect any final determination (which shall include the execution of Form
870 AD or successor form) with respect to the indemnified partys liability
for Taxes, and payments between the indemnified party and the indemnifying
party to reflect such adjustment shall be made if necessary.

  

## 

  

### (b) No indemnified party shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant
to Section 13.01(a) with respect to any Loss that has been taken account
of in any adjustment pursuant to Section 1.05 of the Maleic Agreement. If the
amount of any Loss, at any time subsequent to the making of any payment for
indemnification pursuant to Section 13.01(a) or 13.02(a), is reduced by
recovery, settlement or otherwise under or pursuant to any claim, recovery,
settlement or payment by or against any other person that is not an affiliate
of the indemnified party, the amount of such reduction, less any costs,

  

### 

  

### 111      
   

### 

  

expenses, premiums or other offsets incurred in connection therewith, shall
promptly be repaid by the indemnified party to the indemnifying party. Upon
making any payment for indemnification pursuant to Section 13.01(a) or
13.02(a), the indemnifying party shall, to the extent of such payment, be
subrogated to all rights of the indemnified party (other than any rights of
such indemnified party under any insurance policies) against any third party
that is not an affiliate of the indemnified party in respect of the
indemnifiable Loss to which such payment relates. Each such indemnified
party shall duly execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary
to evidence and perfect the above described subrogation rights.

  

### 

  

## SECTION 13.04. _Procedures._ (a) _Notice of Third Party Claims._ If any
claim is asserted by any person not a party, or an affiliate or a
Representative of a party, to this Agreement against an indemnified party
under this Agreement (any such claim being a " _Third Party Claim_ ") and
such indemnified party intends to seek indemnification hereunder from a party
to this Agreement, then, such indemnified party shall give notice of the
Third Party Claim to the indemnifying party as soon as practicable after the
indemnified party has reason to believe that the indemnifying party will have
an indemnification obligation with respect to such Third Party Claim,
accompanied by copies of all papers that have been served on the indemnified
party with respect to such Third Party Claim. Such notice shall describe in
reasonable detail the nature of the Third Party Claim, an estimate of the
amount of damages attributable to the Third Party Claim (if
reasonably attainable) and the basis of the indemnified partys request
for indemnification under this Agreement.  The failure of the indemnified
party to so notify the indemnifying party of the Third Party Claim shall not
relieve the indemnifying party from any duty to indemnify hereunder unless
and only to the extent that the indemnifying party demonstrates that the
failure of the indemnified party to promptly notify it of such Third Party
Claim prejudiced its ability to defend such Third Party Claim; _provided_ ,
that the failure of the indemnified party to notify the indemnifying party
shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have
to the indemnified party otherwise than under this Agreement. Thereafter, the
indemnified party shall deliver to the indemnifying party, within five
business days after the

  

## 

  

## 112      
   

## 

  

indemnified partys receipt thereof, copies of all written notices
and documents (including court papers but excluding any materials that are
subject to any applicable privilege or that constitute attorney work product)
received by the indemnified party relating to the Third Party Claim.

  

## 

  

### (b) _Right of Indemnifying Party to Control Defense of Third Party
Claims._ The indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, or
assume control of, the defense of the Third Party Claim at its own expense
using counsel of its choice reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party,
by giving prompt written notice to the indemnified party. If it elects to
assume control of the defense of such Third Party Claim, the indemnifying
party shall defend such Third Party Claim by promptly and vigorously
prosecuting all appropriate proceedings to a final conclusion or settlement.
After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its
election to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, the indemnified
party shall have the right to participate in the defense of the Third Party
Claim using counsel of its choice, but the indemnifying party shall not be
liable to the indemnified party hereunder for any legal or other expenses
subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with
its participation in the defense thereof unless (i) the employment thereof
has been specifically authorized in writing by the indemnifying party, (ii)
the indemnifying party fails to assume the defense in accordance with the
first sentence of this Section 13.04(b) or diligently prosecute the defense
of the Third Party Claim or (iii) there shall exist or develop a conflict
that would ethically prohibit counsel to the indemnifying party
from representing the indemnified party. The indemnified party agrees to
provide such reasonable cooperation to the indemnifying party and its counsel
as the indemnifying party may reasonably request in contesting any Third
Party Claim that the indemnifying party elects to contest, including the
making of any related counterclaim against the Third Party asserting the
Third Party Claim or any cross-complaint against any person who is not an
affiliate or Representative of the indemnified party, in each case only if
and to the extent that any such counterclaim or cross-complaint arises from
the same actions or facts giving rise to the Third Party Claim. The
indemnifying party shall have the right, acting in good faith and with due
regard to the interests of the indemnified party, to control all decisions
regarding the handling of the defense

  

### 

  

### 113      
   

### 

  

without the consent of the indemnified party, but shall not have the right to
admit liability with respect to, or compromise, settle or discharge any Third
Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to such
Third Party Claim without the consent of the indemnified party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, unless such settlement, compromise or
consent includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from
all liability and obligations arising out of such Third Party Claim and would
not otherwise adversely affect the indemnified party.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Control of Third Party Claim by the Indemnified Party._ If the
indemnifying party fails to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim within
thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice of the Third Party Claim in
accordance with the provisions of Section 13.04(b), then the indemnified
party shall have the right to defend the Third Party Claim by promptly and
vigorously prosecuting all appropriate proceedings to a final conclusion or
settlement. The indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in the
defense of the Third Party Claim using counsel of its choice, but the
indemnified party shall not be liable to the indemnifying party hereunder for
any legal or other expenses incurred by the indemnifying party in connection
with its participation in the defense thereof. If requested by the
indemnified party, the indemnifying party agrees to provide such
reasonable cooperation to the indemnified party and its counsel as the
indemnified party may reasonably request in contesting any Third Party Claim
that the indemnified party elects to contest, including the making of any
related counterclaim against the third party asserting the Third Party Claim
or any cross-complaint against any person who is not an affiliate or
Representative of the indemnifying party, in each case only if and to the
extent that any such counterclaim or cross-complaint arises from the same
actions or facts giving rise to the Third Party Claim. The indemnified
party shall have the right, acting in good faith and with due regard to the
interests of the indemnifying party, to control all decisions regarding the
handling of the defense without the consent of the indemnifying party, but
shall not have the right to compromise or settle any Third Party Claim or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim
without the consent of the indemnifying party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, unless such

  

### 

  

### 114      
   

### 

  

settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of the
indemnifying party from all liability and obligations arising out of
such Third Party Claim.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Other Claims._ In the event any indemnified party should have a
claim against any indemnifying party under Section 13.01 or 13.02 that does
not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be
collected from such indemnified party, the indemnified party shall deliver
notice of such claim with reasonable promptness to the indemnifying party.
Subject to Sections 13.01(b) and 13.02(b), the failure by any indemnified
party so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying
party from any liability that it may have to such indemnified party under
Section 13.01 or 13.02, except to the extent that the indemnifying party
demonstrates that it has been prejudiced by such failure.  The indemnifying
party shall have 60 calendar days following its receipt of such notice to
dispute its liability to the indemnified party under Section 13.01 or 13.02.
The indemnified party shall reasonably cooperate with and assist the
indemnifying party in determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by
the indemnified party and in otherwise resolving such matters.  Such
cooperation and assistance shall include retention and (upon the indemnifying
partys request) the provision to the indemnifying party of records that are
reasonably relevant to such matters, making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder, and providing such reasonable cooperation and
assistance in the investigation and resolution of such matters as
the indemnifying party may reasonably request.  If the indemnifying party
does not notify the indemnified party within 60 days from its receipt of a
notice pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 13.04(d) that the
indemnifying party disputes the claim specified by the indemnified party in
such notice, that claim shall be deemed a liability of the indemnifying party
hereunder.  If the indemnifying party has timely disputed that claim, as
provided above, that dispute may be resolved by proceedings in an appropriate
court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with Section 14.10 if the
parties do not reach a settlement of that dispute within 30 days after notice
of that dispute is given. Payment of the amount set forth in a notice of a
claim pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 13.04(d) that has not
been disputed shall be made

  

### 

  

### 115      
   

### 

  

within 30 days after the expiration of the applicable 60 day notice period.
If the payment obligation has been disputed, payment shall be made 30 days
after the expiration of the period for appeal of a final adjudication of the
indemnifying partys liability under this Agreement to the indemnified party
with respect to such payment obligation.

  

### 

  

### (e) The foregoing provisions of this Article XIII shall not be applicable
to any Tax Matters, it being understood that the indemnification obligations
of New Ashland Inc. and Marathon with respect to all Tax Matters are set
forth in the Tax Matters Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (f) The foregoing provisions of this Article XIII shall not be applicable
to any Losses to the extent indemnification for such Losses is provided under
the Franchise Agreements (as defined in the VIOC Agreement).

intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights
or remedies. The Third Party Provisions may be enforced by the beneficiaries
thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the shareholders of Ashland in their
capacities as such shall not have any rights or remedies under this
Agreement, and shall not be entitled to enforce the Third Party Provisions or
make any Claims with respect thereto, unless and until the Closing shall have
occurred.  For avoidance of doubt, (i) the shareholders of Marathon in
their capacities as such shall not have any rights or remedies under this
Agreement, (ii) after the Closing, holders of Dissenters Shares shall have
the rights and remedies specified in Section 2.05 only and (iii) after the
Closing, the holders entitled to receive HoldCo Common Stock in the
Reorganization Merger shall have the rights and remedies specified in Article
V only. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
remain in effect in accordance with its terms and, except as expressly
amended hereby, the MAP Governing Documents are ratified and affirmed and
shall remain in full force and effect.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 14.07. _Exercise of Rights and Remedies._ Except as this Agreement
otherwise provides, no delay or omission in the exercise of, or failure to
assert, any right, power or remedy accruing to any party hereto as a result
of any breach or default hereunder by any other party hereto will impair any
such right, power or remedy, nor will it be construed, deemed or interpreted
as a waiver of or acquiescence in any such breach or default, or of any
similar breach or default occurring later; nor will any waiver of any single
breach or default be construed, deemed or interpreted as a waiver of any
other breach or default hereunder occurring before or after that waiver. The
failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under the
Transaction Agreements or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 14.08. _Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New
York, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable
principles of conflicts of Laws thereof, except to the extent the Laws of
Kentucky are mandatorily applicable to the Reorganization

  

## 

  

## 125      
   

## 

  

Merger and the Conversion Merger and to the extent the Laws of Delaware are
mandatorily applicable to the Acquisition Merger.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 14.09. _Assignment._ Neither the Transaction Agreements nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations under the Transaction Agreements shall
be assigned, in whole or in part, by any of the parties without the prior
written consent of the other parties, except that the rights, interests and
obligations of any party under this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
Agreements may be assigned by operation of law pursuant to a merger,
consolidation or other business combination involving such party that would
not reasonably expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of
the Transactions; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any assignment pursuant to
the exception set forth in this sentence shall not operate to release any
party from its obligations under this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Agreements. Subject to the preceding sentences, the Transaction
Agreements will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 14.10. _Enforcement._ The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of the
Transaction Agreements were not performed in accordance with their specific
terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, subject to
Sections 13.01(c) and 13.02(c), the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the Transaction Agreements
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of the Transaction
Agreements in any New York state court or any Federal court located in the
Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York in the State of New York, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself
to the personal jurisdiction of any New York state court or any Federal
court located in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York in the State
of New York in the event any dispute arises out of the Transaction
Agreements or any Transaction, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court, (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to
any Transaction Agreement or any Transaction in

  

## 

  

## 126      
   

## 

  

any court other than any New York state court or any Federal court sitting in
the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York in the State of New York (
_provided_ , _however_ , that this clause (c) shall not limit the ability of
any party hereto to (i) file a proof of claim or bring any action in any
court in which a bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding involving another
party hereto is pending, (ii) file a counter-claim or cross-claim against
another party hereto in any court in which a proceeding involving both such
parties is pending or (iii) implead another party hereto in respect of a
Third Party Claim in any court in which a proceeding relating to such Third
Party Claim is then pending) and (d) waives any right to trial by jury with
respect to any action related to or arising out of any Transaction Agreement
or any Transaction.

EXHIBIT D

  



  

 ** _Tax Ruling/Opinion Closing Conditions_**

  



  

# _Structure_

  



  

## 1. The IRS issues a private letter ruling (a " _Ruling_ ") holding that
the Maleic/VIOC Contribution described in Section 1.02(a), the
MAP/LOOP/LOCAP Contribution described in Section 1.02(b) and the
Reorganization Merger described in Section 1.02(c), taken together, qualify
as a reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Code.

  

## 

  

## 2. The IRS issues a Ruling holding that the Capital Contribution described
in Section 1.03(b) and the Conversion Merger described in Section 1.03(c),
taken together with the Acquisition Merger described in Section 1.04(a) or
the distribution by HoldCo of shares of New Ashland Inc. Common Stock
described in Section 1.04(b), as the case may be, qualify as a reorganization
under Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code.

  

## 

  

## 3. The IRS issues a Ruling holding that the Acquisition Merger described
in Section 1.04(a) or the distribution by HoldCo of shares of New
Ashland Inc. Common Stock described in Section 1.04(b), as the case may
be, qualifies as a distribution described in Section 355(a) of the Code
and, accordingly, no gain or loss will be recognized by (and no amount
will otherwise be included in the income of) the shareholders of HoldCo upon
the receipt of such New Ashland Inc. Common Stock.

  

## 

  

## 4. Either:

  

## 

  

### (a) The IRS issues a Ruling holding that the Acquisition Merger described
in Section 1.04(a) will qualify as a reorganization under Section
368(a)(1)(A) of the Code; or

  

### 

  

### (b) If the IRS refuses to issue the Ruling described in paragraph 4(a)
above, Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP delivers a written opinion to Ashland, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Ashland Board, concluding
that the Acquisition Merger described in Section 1.04(a) will qualify as
a reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code; and Miller
and Chevalier Chartered delivers a written opinion to Marathon, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Marathon Board,

  

###      
   

### 

  

that such Acquisition Merger qualifies as a reorganization under Section
368(a)(1)(A) of the Code.

  

### 

  

## 5. The IRS issues a Ruling holding that the shares of New Ashland Inc.
Common Stock distributed to shareholders of HoldCo in the Acquisition Merger
described in Section 1.04(a) or the distribution described in Section
1.04(b), as the case may be, will not be treated as "other property", within
the meaning of Section 356(a) of the Code, received in exchange for HoldCo
stock in the Acquisition Merger.

  

## 

  

# _Section 357_

  



  

## 6. The IRS issues a Ruling holding that the assumption by Marathon and/or
Merger Sub of liabilities of HoldCo in the Acquisition Merger will not be
treated as money or other property under Section 357 of the Code.

  

## 

  

# _Contingent Liabilities_

  



  

## 7. Either:

  

## 

  

### (a) The IRS issues a Ruling holding that New Ashland Inc. is entitled to
deduct the Specified Liability Deductions (as defined in the Tax Matters
Agreement); or

  

### 

  

### (b) The IRS issues a Ruling holding that (i) HoldCo, and Marathon or an
affiliate of Marathon that is the "acquiring corporation" of HoldCo in the
Acquisition Merger within the meaning of Section 381(a) of the Code, is
entitled to deduct the Specified Liability Deductions, (ii) such deduction
will not be limited under Section 382 or Section 384 of the Code or
Treasury Regulation section 1.1502-15; (iii) such deduction is determined on
the Net Deduction Method (as defined in the Tax Matters Agreement); (iv)
the accrual or receipt of insurance reimbursements in respect of
Specified Liability Deductions will not result in recognition of income or
gain to any member of the New Ashland Group (as defined in the Tax Matters
Agreement) (other than recognition of such income or gain by a member of the
New Ashland Group in respect of Specified Liability Deductions claimed before
the Closing Date by a member of the Ashland Group (as defined in the Tax
Matters Agreement) or the New Ashland Group); and (v) any payment of
Specified Liability Deductions by any member of the New Ashland Group will
not result in recognition of income or gain to any

  

### 

  

### 2      
   

### 

  

member of the Marathon Group (as defined in the Tax Matters Agreement).

  

### 

  

## 8. Either:

  

## 

  

### (a) The IRS issues a Ruling holding that the effect of the assumption by
New Ashland, Inc. of the Ashland Residual Operations Liabilities (as defined
in the Tax Matters Agreement) on the basis of the New Ashland Inc. Common
Stock in the hands of HoldCo will be determined under Section 358(h)(1) of
the Code, or will be excluded from such application solely by reason
of Section 358(h)(2) of the Code; or

  

### 

  

### (b) (i) The IRS issues a Ruling holding that the effect of such
assumption on such basis will be determined under Section 358(d)(1) of the
Code; (ii) such Ruling sets forth with specificity a method of determining
the amount of the resulting reduction to basis under Section 358(d)(1) of the
Code; and (iii) based on such method, on representations as to the basis of
the New Ashland Inc. Common Stock before such reduction, and on
representations as to the value of the New Ashland Inc. Common Stock to be
distributed by HoldCo as of the date of such distribution (and on any other
date that might be relevant), Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP delivers a written
opinion to Ashland, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Ashland Board, that the distribution of the New Ashland Inc. Common Stock by
HoldCo will not result in the recognition of gain by HoldCo under Section
355(e) of the Code in an amount greater than would be so recognized if the
effect on such basis had been determined under Section 358(h)(1) of the Code
rather than Section 358(d)(1) of the Code; and Miller and Chevalier
Chartered delivers a written opinion to Marathon, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Marathon Board, concluding that the
distribution of the New Ashland Inc. Common Stock by HoldCo does not result
in the recognition of gain by HoldCo under Section 355(e) of the Code in an
amount greater than would be so recognized if the effect on such basis had
been determined under Section 358(h)(1) of the Code rather than Section
358(d)(1) of the Code.

  

### 

  

### 3      
   

### 

  

# _Partnership_

  



  

## 9. Either:

  

## 

  

### (a) The IRS issues a Ruling that the MAP Partial Redemption does not
constitute a disguised sale of a partnership interest under Section
707(a)(2)(B) of the Code; or

  

### 

  

### (b) If the IRS refuses to issue the Ruling described in paragraph 9(a)
above, Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP delivers a written opinion to Ashland, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Ashland Board, concluding
that the MAP Partial Redemption will not constitute a disguised sale of a
partnership interest under Section 707(a)(2)(B) of the Code; and Miller
and Chevalier Chartered delivers a written opinion to Marathon, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Marathon Board, concluding that
the MAP Partial Redemption does not constitute a disguised sale of a
partnership interest under Section 707(a)(2)(B) of the Code.

  

### 

  

## 10. Either:

  

## 

  

### (a) The IRS issues a Ruling that the MAP Partial Redemption will not be
treated as a sale or exchange of property between Ashland and MAP under
Section 751(b) of the Code; or

  

### 

  

### (b) If the IRS refuses to issue the Ruling described in paragraph 10(a)
above, Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP delivers a written opinion to Ashland, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Ashland Board, concluding
that the MAP Partial Redemption will not constitute a sale or exchange of
property between Ashland and MAP under Section 751(b) of the Code; and Miller
and Chevalier Chartered delivers a written opinion to Marathon, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Marathon Board, concluding that
the MAP Partial Redemption does not constitute a sale or exchange of
property between Ashland and MAP under Section 751(b) of the Code.
