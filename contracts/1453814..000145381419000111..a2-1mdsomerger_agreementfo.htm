This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is made and entered into

Systemes Americas Corp., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), 3DS Acquisition 6
Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger
Sub"), and Medidata Solutions, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").
All capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the meanings ascribed
to such terms in Annex A or as otherwise defined elsewhere in this Agreement,
unless the context clearly provides otherwise. Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub

collectively, as the "Parties."

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, Parent desires to acquire the Company on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, it is proposed that the Parties wish to effect the acquisition of the
Company by Parent through the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company,
with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent (the "Merger") in accordance with the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL") and each share of Company Common
Stock that is then outstanding (other than Cancelled Company Shares and
Dissenting Company Shares) will thereupon be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive $92.25 in cash, without interest (the "Merger
Consideration"), all upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein;

WHEREAS, the Company Board has unanimously (i) determined and declared that
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Transactions"),
including the Merger, are advisable, (ii) determined that the terms of this
Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger and Merger Consideration,
are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and the Company
Stockholders, (iii) approved and declared advisable the execution and delivery
by the Company of this Agreement, the performance by the Company of its
covenants and agreements contained herein and the consummation of the
Transactions, including the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions contained herein, (iv) directed that the adoption of this Agreement
be submitted to the Company Stockholders for their adoption at the Company
Stockholders Meeting and (v) resolved to recommend that the Company
Stockholders adopt this Agreement in accordance with the applicable provisions
of Law;

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub

agreements contained herein and the consummation of the Transactions,
including the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained
herein;

WHEREAS, the sole stockholder of Merger Sub will promptly approve and adopt
this Agreement by written consent following its execution;

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
certain executives of the Company have entered into employment agreements (the
"Employment Agreements") with Parent or one of its Affiliates, which letter
agreements shall become effective at the Closing and shall be null and void if
this Agreement is terminated;

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to Parent's and Merger Sub's willingness to enter
into this Agreement, certain executives of the Company are entering into
voting agreements (the "Voting Agreements") with Parent, pursuant to which,
among other things, such Persons have agreed to vote the shares of Company
Common Stock beneficially owned by each of them in favor of adoption of this
Agreement; and

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions to prescribe certain terms and conditions with respect to the

incorporation.

(b) Bylaws. At the Effective Time, subject to the provisions of Section
6.9(a),the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the

1.5 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation.

(a) Directors. Subject to applicable Law, at the Effective Time, the directors
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become the initial
directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal.

(b) Officers. Except as otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective
Time, the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, from and after the Effective Time, become the initial officers of the
Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their
respective successors are duly appointed or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal. 

1.6 Effect on Capital Stock and Equity Awards.

(a) Capital Stock. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the Parties, or the holders of any securities of the
Company or Merger Sub, the following shall occur:

(i) Company Common Stock. Subject to Section 1.6(f), each share of Company
Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than any Cancelled Company Shares and any Dissenting Company
Shares) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, payable without interest thereon in cash, net of applicable
withholding of Taxes, upon the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, as applicable, in the manner provided in Section 2.4 (or in the case
of a lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit in
the manner provided in Section 2.6).

(ii) Excluded Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock owned
by Parent or the Company, or by any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary
of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, in each case immediately prior to the
Effective Time ("Cancelled Company Shares"), shall be automatically cancelled
and cease to exist without any conversion thereof or consideration paid
therefor.

(iii) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) newly and
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the
shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each certificate evidencing
ownership of such shares of common stock of Merger Sub shall thereafter
evidence ownership of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into
which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence.

(b) Adjustment to the Merger Consideration. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock
occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

(c) Statutory Rights of Appraisal.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
shares of Company Common Stock (other than Cancelled Company Shares) that are 

issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by
Company Stockholders of record who shall neither have voted in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have
properly and validly demanded appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock
in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and not validly withdrawn such
demand (collectively, "Dissenting Company Shares") shall not be converted
into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 1.6(a), but shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by
Section 262 of the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Company Shares. At the
Effective Time, the Dissenting Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be cancelled and cease to exist, and each Company
Stockholder who holds Dissenting Company Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive payment of the appraised
value of such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that all Dissenting Company Shares
held by Company Stockholders who shall have failed to timely perfect or who
shall have otherwise waived, withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of
such Dissenting Company Shares under such Section 262 of the DGCL shall no
longer be considered to be Dissenting Company Shares and shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of
the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration without
interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate or Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares that formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock in
the manner provided in Section 2.4.

(ii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt written notice of any demands
for appraisal (or written threats thereof) received by the Company,
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to
Delaware Law and received by the Company in respect of Dissenting Company
Shares and (B) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under Delaware Law in
respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands
for appraisal, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise any
such demands for payment, in respect of Dissenting Company Shares.

(d) Company Options. At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not vested)
shall automatically be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive a cash
payment, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock then covered by such Company Option multiplied
by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise
price per share under such Company Option (the "Option Consideration"). If the
exercise price per share under a Company Option is equal to or greater than
the Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall be cancelled immediately
prior to the Effective Time for no consideration. The Surviving 

Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay
through the payroll of the Surviving Corporation (to the extent applicable) to
each holder of a Company Option the Option Consideration (if any), less any
required withholding Taxes, within two (2) Business Days following the
Effective Time.

(e) Company PSUs.

(i) At the Effective Time, each Company PSU that is held by an Employee and
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and except as set
forth on Section 1.6(e)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter (each, an
"Employee PSU") shall be assumed and converted into a restricted stock unit
(each, an "Adjusted Employee PSU") with the same terms and conditions
(including with respect to the remaining term and vesting schedule) as were
applicable to such Employee PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time
(except that the performance-based vesting conditions applicable to such
Employee PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time shall not apply from and
after the Effective Time), and relating to a number of Guarantor Ordinary
Shares equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Employee PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time
based on the attainment of the applicable performance metrics (x) for those
Employee PSUs that vest based on performance metrics related to total
stockholder return, at the actual level of performance through the Effective
Time, as determined in good faith and consistent with past practice by the
Company Board or a committee thereof, (y) for those Employee PSUs that vest
based on performance metrics related to data science, at the greater of the
actual level of performance through the Effective Time (if calculable), as
determined in good faith and consistent with past practice by the Company
Board or a committee thereof, or the target level of performance, and (z) for
each other Employee PSU, at the target level of performance, multiplied by
(ii) the Equity Award Conversion Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded to
the nearest whole number of shares.

(ii) At the Effective Time, each Company PSU that is not an Employee PSU and
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "Non-
Employee PSU") shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Non-Employee PSU immediately
prior to the Effective Time based on the attainment of the applicable
performance metrics (x) for those Non-Employee PSUs that vest based on
performance metrics related to total stockholder return, at the actual level
of performance through the Effective Time, as determined in good faith and
consistent with past practice by the Company Board or a committee thereof, (y)
for those Non-Employee PSUs that vest based on performance metrics related to
data science, at the greater of the actual level of performance through the
Effective Time (if calculable), as determined in good faith and consistent
with past practice by the Company Board or a committee thereof, or the target 

level of performance, and (z) for each other Non-Employee PSU, at the target
level of performance, multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration (the "Non-
Employee PSU Consideration"). The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay through the payroll of the
Surviving Corporation (to the extent applicable) to each holder of a Non-
Employee PSU the Non-Employee PSU Consideration, less any required withholding
Taxes, within two (2) Business Days following the Effective Time; provided,
that to the extent payment within such time or on such date would trigger a
Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such payments shall be made on
the earliest date that payment would not trigger such Tax or penalty.

(f) Company RSAs.

(i) At the Effective Time, each Company RSA that is held by an Employee and
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and except as set
forth on Section 1.6(f)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter (each, an
"Employee RSA") shall be assumed by Guarantor and converted into a restricted
stock unit (each, an "Adjusted Employee RSA") relating to a number of
Guarantor Ordinary Shares equal to the product of (i) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Employee RSA immediately prior
to the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award Conversion Ratio,
with any fractional shares rounded to the nearest whole number of shares. Any
accrued but unpaid dividends with respect to any Employee RSA will be assumed
and become an obligation with respect to the applicable Adjusted Employee RSA.
The Adjusted Employee RSAs shall include the right to accrue dividend
equivalents, and the other terms and conditions of such Adjusted Employee RSAs
shall be substantially the same as the terms and conditions (including with
respect to the remaining term and vesting schedule) applicable to the Employee
RSAs immediately prior to the Effective Time except to the extent necessary to
reflect the fact that the Adjusted Employee RSAs are not issued and
outstanding Guarantor Ordinary Shares.

(ii) At the Effective Time, each Company RSA that is not an Employee RSA and
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "Non-
Employee RSA") shall automatically become fully vested and shall be cancelled
and converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the Merger
Consideration (the "Non-Employee RSA Consideration") in accordance with
Section 1.6(a)(i), less any required withholding taxes.

(g) Company RSUs.

(i) At the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is held by an Employee and
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time except as set
forth 

on Section 1.6(g)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter (each, an "Employee
RSU") shall be assumed by Guarantor and converted into a restricted stock unit
(each, an "Adjusted Employee RSU") with the same terms and conditions
(including with respect to the remaining term and vesting schedule) as were
applicable to such Employee RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
relating to a number of Guarantor Ordinary Shares equal to the product of (i)
the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Employee
RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the Equity
Award Conversion Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded to the nearest
whole number of shares.

(ii) At the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is not an Employee RSU and
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "Non-
Employee RSU") shall automatically become fully vested and shall be cancelled
and converted into the right to receive a cash payment, without interest,
equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (ii) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU (the
"Non-Employee RSU Consideration"). The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay through the payroll of the
Surviving Corporation (to the extent applicable) to each holder of a Non-
Employee RSU the Non-Employee RSU Consideration, less any required withholding
Taxes, within two (2) Business Days following the Effective Time; provided,
that to the extent payment within such time or on such date would trigger a
Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such payments shall be made on
the earliest date that payment would not trigger such Tax or penalty.

(h) Employee Stock Purchase Plan. As soon as practicable following the date of
this Agreement, the Company Board or the appropriate committee of the Company
Board shall take all reasonable actions, including the adoption of any
necessary resolutions, to (i) ensure that no employees (who are not currently
participants) will become participants in the Company ESPP after the date of
this Agreement; (ii) cause the Purchase Period (as defined in the Company
ESPP) in effect as of the date of this Agreement to be the final Purchase
Period (the "Final Purchase Period") and provide that no new Purchase Periods
commence after the date of this Agreement; and (iii) prohibit current
participants in the Company ESPP from altering their payroll deduction
elections (other than to discontinue their participation in and withdraw their
accumulated contributions from the Company ESPP) after the date of this
Agreement or to make separate non-payroll contributions to the Company ESPP.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action that may be
necessary to, effective upon the consummation of the Merger, (A) cause the
Final Purchase Period, to the extent that it would otherwise be outstanding at
the Effective Time, to be terminated no later than ten (10) Business Days
prior to the date on which the Effective Time occurs; (B) make any pro rata
adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the Final Purchase Period, but
otherwise treat the Final Purchase Period as a fully effective and completed
Purchase Period for all purposes 

pursuant to the Company ESPP; and (C) cause the exercise (as of no later than
ten (10) Business Days prior to the date on which the Effective Time occurs)
of each outstanding purchase right pursuant to the Company ESPP. On such
exercise date, the Company shall apply the funds credited as of such date
pursuant to the Company ESPP within each participant's payroll withholding
account to the purchase of whole shares of Company Common Stock in accordance
with the terms of the Company ESPP, and such shares shall be entitled to the
Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 1.6(a)(i). Immediately prior
to and effective as of the Effective Time (but subject to the consummation of
the Merger), the Company shall terminate the Company ESPP.

(i) Implementation; Cooperation.

(i) Company Board Approval. The Company Board or a duly authorized committee
thereof shall adopt such resolutions as shall be necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this Section 1.6 with respect to the Company Stock Plans and
Company Options, Company PSUs, Company RSAs and Company RSUs granted
thereunder, and the Company ESPP. Subject, and in addition, to the foregoing,
as of the date of this Agreement, the Company Board or a committee thereof
shall have adopted resolutions (A) approving the treatment of the Company
Equity Awards and the treatment of the Company ESPP in accordance with this
Section 1.6; (B) determining that the Adjusted Employee PSUs, Adjusted
Employee RSAs, and Adjusted Employee RSUs are "economically equivalent"
(within the meaning of the Stock Plans and the applicable award agreements
thereunder) to the applicable Employee PSUs, Employee RSAs and Employee RSUs;
and (C) assuming Guarantor takes such actions as may be necessary or required
under the first sentence of Section 1.6(i)(ii), determining that the Guarantor
Ordinary Shares underlying the Adjusted PSUs are "freely tradable" (within the
meaning of the Stock Plans and applicable award agreements thereunder). With
respect to the Company PSUs, the Company shall make the determination of
performance no later than twenty (20) days prior to Closing. Such
determination of performance shall be made on the basis of the most recently
completed month, or if not practical, the immediately preceding month. The
Company shall have provided Guarantor and Parent with drafts of, and a
reasonable opportunity to comment upon, all such resolutions prior to adoption
by the Company Board or a committee thereof. No later than five (5) Business
Days prior to the date that the Company provides its calculations as to the
achievement of the performance metrics applicable to the Employee PSUs and
Non-Employee PSUs to the Company Board or a committee thereof, the Company
shall provide such calculations to Guarantor and Parent. The Company shall
consider in good faith any reasonable comments or adjustments to such
calculations by Guarantor and/or Parent prior to providing such calculations
to the Company Board or a committee thereof. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, with respect to the Company Equity Awards held by individuals
subject to Taxes imposed by the Laws of a country other than the United 

States, the Parties and Guarantor shall cooperate in good faith prior to the
Effective Time to minimize the Tax impact of the provisions set forth in
Sections 1.6(d)-(h).

(ii) Guarantor Actions. Guarantor shall take any and all actions necessary or
required, including under the rules and regulations of the Securities Act, the
French financial markets authority (Autorite des marches financiers) and
Euronext Paris, prior to such time as Guarantor Ordinary Shares are
issued/attributed in respect of the vesting and/or exercise of any Adjusted
Award to (A) (x) register the Adjusted Employee PSUs, the Adjusted Employee
RSAs, and the Adjusted Employee RSUs (the "Adjusted Awards") and the Guarantor
Ordinary Shares underlying the Adjusted Awards under the Securities Act and
any other applicable securities Laws or (y) cause the issuance of the Adjusted
Awards and the Guarantor Ordinary Shares underlying the Adjusted Awards to
qualify under an exemption from registration under the Securities Act and any
other applicable securities Laws, and shall take any and all actions necessary
so that any Guarantor Ordinary Shares issuable on the vesting and/or exercise
of the Adjusted Awards are listed on the Euronext Paris (and on such other
securities exchange upon which the Guarantor Ordinary Shares may at the time
be traded), (B) maintain the effective registration or ensure the continuing
applicability of the relevant registration exemption of the Adjusted Awards
and the Guarantor Ordinary Shares underlying the Adjusted Awards, as the case
may be, under the Securities Act and any other applicable securities laws such
that the same are freely saleable upon issuance without restriction pursuant
to Rule 904 of Regulation S, or such other exemption from registration under
the Securities Act as may be applicable, on the Euronext Paris, and (C)
validly reserve that number of Guarantor Ordinary Shares issuable/attributable
upon the vesting and/or exercise of the Adjusted Awards. As soon as
administratively practicable following the Effective Time, Guarantor shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to enter into an agreement with Guarantor
whereby (i) the Surviving Corporation shall assume all economic liabilities
associated with the Adjusted Awards; (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall
notify Guarantor of (x) the vesting of the applicable Adjusted Awards, (y) the
corresponding number of Guarantor Ordinary Shares to be delivered in respect
of such Adjusted Awards, and (z) the employee portion of the applicable
withholding Taxes attributable to the settlement of the Adjusted Awards; (iii)
following the notification contemplated by clause (ii), Guarantor shall
deliver to the holder of the applicable Adjusted Awards the net number of
Guarantor Ordinary Shares acquired by Guarantor; and (iv) concurrent with the
action in clause (iii), the Surviving Corporation shall deliver through its
payroll system to the holder of the applicable Adjusted Awards (x) an amount
in cash equal to any fractional shares and (y) an amount in cash equal to any
accrued but unpaid dividends in respect of the Adjusted Employee RSAs. To the
extent that Adjusted Awards cannot be issued in compliance with any applicable
securities Laws to the holders of the Employee PSUs, Employee RSAs and
Employee RSUs in certain jurisdictions as 

contemplated by the provisions of Section 1.6, Guarantor shall, or shall cause
Parent to, pay an amount of cash or issue or grant an award in compliance with
any applicable securities Laws to such holders of economically equivalent
value and, if applicable, the same vesting schedule, as such employee would
have received in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.6.

(iii) Payment. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, to the extent
such payments cannot be satisfied with cash resources held by the Company and
its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time, deposit (or cause to be deposited)
with the Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount
equal to the sum of (A) the Option Consideration, (B) the Non-Employee PSU
Consideration, (C) the Non-Employee RSA Consideration and (D) the Non-Employee
RSU Consideration.

accordance with the terms of this Agreement (the "Payment Agent"). The Payment
Agent shall also act as the agent for the Company Stockholders for the purpose
of receiving and holding their Certificates and Book-Entry Shares and shall
obtain no rights or interests in the shares represented thereby. Parent shall
pay, or cause to be paid, the fees and expenses of the Payment Agent.

(b) Exchange Fund. On the Closing Date, Guarantor or Parent shall deposit (or
cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, for payment to the Company
Stockholders pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, an amount of cash
sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration to which Company
Stockholders become entitled to at the Effective Time under Article I. Until
disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such
funds shall be invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, in (i) obligations of or guaranteed by the United
States of America or obligations of an agency of the United States of America
which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America
or (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation (such cash amount
being referred to herein as the "Exchange Fund"). Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. To the extent
that there are any losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange
Fund, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required
for the Payment Agent to promptly pay the aggregate Merger Consideration,
Guarantor or Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that
the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the
Payment Agent to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration. Any portion of the
Merger Consideration made available to the Payment Agent pursuant to this
Section 2.4(b) to pay for shares of Company Common Stock for which appraisal
rights have been properly perfected and not waived, withdrawn or lost shall be
returned to Parent, upon demand. 

(c) Payment Procedures.

(i) Company Common Stock Certificates. Promptly following the Effective Time
(and in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time),
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to
each Person that was immediately prior to the Effective Time a holder of
record of Company Common Stock represented by a certificate or certificates
(the "Certificates") which shares of Company Common Stock were converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.6, (A) a
letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by
Parent or Payment Agent, an indemnity bond) to the Payment Agent, which shall
be in such form as the Company, Parent and the Payment Agent shall reasonably
agree, and (B) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or an affidavit
of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by Parent or Payment Agent, an
indemnity bond) for cancellation to the Payment Agent or to such other agent
or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required, the holders
of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an
amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate that
were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 1.6, by (y) the Merger Consideration (less any applicable withholding
taxes payable in respect thereof), and the Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. The Payment Agent shall accept such Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by Parent, an indemnity
bond) upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment
Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with
normal exchange practices. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that
(x) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be
otherwise in proper form for transfer and (y) the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to
the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not
required to be paid.

(ii) Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, no holder of non-certificated Company Common Stock represented
by book entry ("Book-Entry Shares") shall be required to deliver a Certificate 

or, in the case of holders of Book-Entry Shares held through the Depository
Trust Company, an executed letter of transmittal to the Payment Agent to
receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. In lieu thereof, each holder of
record of one or more Book-Entry Shares held through the Depository Trust
Company whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.6 shall, upon receipt
of an "agent's message" by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any,
of transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably request), be entitled to
receive in respect of each such Book-Entry Shares, an amount in cash equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of Book-Entry
Shares that were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 1.6, by (y) the Merger Consideration (less any applicable
withholding taxes payable in respect thereof), and such Book-Entry Shares of
such holder shall forthwith be cancelled. As reasonably promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time (and in no event later than five (5)
Business Days after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall cause
the Payment Agent to deliver to each Person that was, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, a holder of record of Book-Entry Shares not held through the
Depository Trust Company: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in such
form as the Company, Parent and the Payment Agent shall reasonably agree)
which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon receipt of an "agent's
message" regarding the book-entry transfer of the Book-Entry Shares by the
Payment Agent; and (ii) instructions for the surrender of such Book-Entry
Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Upon receipt of an "agent's message"
by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Payment Agent may reasonably request), the holder of such Book-Entry Shares
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of Book-Entry
Shares that were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 1.6, by (y) the Merger Consideration (less any applicable
withholding taxes payable in respect thereof), and such Book-Entry Shares of
such holder shall forthwith be cancelled. Payment of the Merger Consideration
with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose
name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.

(iii) No Interest. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration
payable upon the surrender of such Certificates or in respect of any Book-
Entry Shares pursuant to this Section 2.4.

(d) Required Withholding. Each of the Company, Payment Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as are
required to be deducted or withheld 

therefrom under applicable Tax Laws. To the extent that such amounts are so
deducted, withheld and remitted to the applicable Governmental Authority or
other Person in accordance with applicable Law, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to
whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent, as the case may be, shall timely
remit to the appropriate Governmental Authority any and all amounts so
deducted or withheld.

(e) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation nor any other Party shall be liable to any Person for
any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(f) Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares on the date that is twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall
be delivered by the Payment Agent to Parent upon demand, and any holders of
shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Merger who have not theretofore surrendered their Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock for
exchange pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.4 shall thereafter look
for payment of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
solely to Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as general creditors thereof,
for any claim to the applicable Merger Consideration to which such holders may
be entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article I.

2.5 Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. From
and after the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled, retired and cease
to exist, and each holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares theretofore
representing any shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable
Law. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms hereof shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of the Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records
of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided herein, subject, in the case of the Dissenting Company Shares, to
applicable Law.

2.6 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or 

destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant
to Section 2.4; provided that Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its
discretion and as condition to the payment of such Merger Consideration,
require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a
bond in such customary amount and upon such customary terms as it may direct
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

2.7 Necessary Further Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub, the directors and officers of the Surviving
Corporation are fully authorized in the name and on behalf of the Company to
take all such lawful and necessary action.

Section 5.2 by the Company.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 5.2 or
elsewhere in this Agreement, prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder
Approval, if any Person makes a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that was not solicited in violation of
Section 5.2(a) and that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) either
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal,
the Company Board may, directly or indirectly through the Company's
Representatives, (i) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with
such Person and/or (ii) furnish to such Person any non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and/or afford such Person

release any Person (other than Parent and Merger Sub) from, any "standstill"
or other similar agreement between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on
the one hand, and such Person, on the other, unless the Company Board and/or
any authorized committee 

thereof determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties.

(d) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Section 5.2(a),
the Company shall promptly (but, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours)
notify Parent if it or any director, officer or other Representative of the
Company receives (i) any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to, or
which could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii)

negotiations and (2) provide Parent (or its outside legal counsel) with
unredacted copies of all writings or media containing any terms or conditions
of any proposals or proposed transaction agreements relating to any
Acquisition Proposal as promptly as practicable (and in any event, within

agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into
any confidentiality agreement subsequent to the date hereof that prohibits the
Company from providing to Parent such material terms and conditions and other
information.

or supplemented, the "Proxy Statement") relating to the Company Stockholder
Meeting. Subject to Section 6.1(c), the Company must include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement.

(ii) If the Company determines that it is required to file or furnish any
document other than the Proxy Statement with the SEC in connection with the
Merger

file such Other Required Company Filing with the SEC. The Company shall cause
the Proxy Statement and any Other Required Company Filing to comply in all

Company agrees that all information relating to Parent, its Affiliates and
their respective Representatives included in the Proxy Statement, any Other
Required Company Filing or any other documents and communications related to
the Company Stockholders Meeting shall be in form and content satisfactory to
Parent, acting reasonably. On the date of filing, the date of mailing to the
Company Stockholders (if applicable) and at the time of the Company
Stockholder Meeting, neither the Proxy Statement nor any Other Required
Company Filing will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not false or misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
assumes no responsibility for any information supplied by Guarantor, Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing. The
information supplied by the Company or its Affiliates for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in any Other Required Parent Filings will not, at
the time that such Other Required Parent Filing is filed or furnished with the
SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading.

(iii) If Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates
is/are required to file or furnish any document with the SEC in connection
with the Merger or the Company Stockholder Meeting pursuant to applicable Law
(an "Other Required Parent Filing"), then Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, promptly prepare and
file such Other Required Parent Filing with the SEC. Guarantor, Parent and
Merger Sub shall cause, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to cause,
any Other Required Parent Filing to comply in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC. Neither
Guarantor, Parent or Merger Sub nor any of their respective Affiliates may
file any Other Required Parent Filing (or any amendment thereto) with the SEC
without providing the Company and its counsel, 

to the extent practicable, a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
thereon, which comments shall be considered by Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub
or their respective Affiliates in good faith. On the date of filing, the date
of mailing to the Company Stockholders (if applicable) and at the time of the
Company Stockholder Meeting, no Other Required Parent Filing will knowingly
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not false or misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent or Merger Sub
assume no responsibility for any information supplied by the Company or its
Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in any Other Required
Parent Filing. The information supplied by Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub and
their respective Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing will not, at the time
that the Proxy Statement or such Other Required Company Filing is filed or
furnished with the SEC, knowingly contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

(iv) Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Guarantor, Parent and Merger
Sub, on the other hand, shall furnish all information concerning it and its
Affiliates, if applicable, as the other party may reasonably request in
connection with the preparation and filing with the SEC of the Proxy Statement
and any Other Required Company Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing. If
at any time prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting any information relating
to the Company, Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates should be discovered by the Company, on the one hand, or Guarantor,
Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company
Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing, as the case may be, so that such
filing would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, then the party that discovers such information will promptly
notify the other, and an appropriate amendment or supplement to such filing
describing such information will be promptly prepared and filed with the SEC
by the appropriate party (with the assistance of the other parties) and, to
the extent required by applicable law or the SEC or its staff, disseminated to
the Company Stockholders.

(v) The Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub
and their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, may not communicate in
writing with the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement, any
Other Required Company Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing, as the case
may be, without providing the other, to the extent practicable, a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such written 

communication, which comments shall be considered by the filing party in good
faith. Except in connection with a Company Board Recommendation Change, no
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company
without the prior approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(vi) The Company, on the one hand, and Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub, on
the other hand, will advise the other, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of (A) any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for any
amendment or revisions to the Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company
Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing, as the case may be, (B) any
receipt of comments from the SEC or its staff on the Proxy Statement, any
Other Required Company Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing, as the case
may be, or (C) any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for additional
information in connection therewith. Each of the Company, Guarantor and Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly provide responses to the SEC
upon the receipt of any request or comment set forth in clauses (A), (B) and
(C) of the preceding sentence from the SEC or its staff.

(vii) Subject to applicable Law, the Company will use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to the Company
Stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable following the filing
thereof with the SEC and confirmation from the SEC that it will not review, or
that it has completed its review of, the Proxy Statement (which confirmation
will be deemed to occur if the SEC has not affirmatively notified the Company
prior to the end of the tenth (10th) calendar day after filing the preliminary
Proxy Statement that the SEC will or will not be reviewing the Proxy
Statement) (the "SEC Clearance Date").

(b) Stockholder Meeting.

(i) The Company shall establish a record date for, call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of the Company Stockholders as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement for the purpose of
voting upon the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law
(the "Company Stockholder Meeting"); provided that, without the prior written
consent of Parent and subject to the exceptions set forth in the last sentence
of this Section 6.1(b)(i), (x) the Company Stockholder Meeting shall not be
scheduled for any day later than thirty-five (35) calendar days after the SEC
Clearance Date and (y) the Company may not adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholder Meeting. Once established, the Company shall not change the record
date for the Company Stockholder Meeting without the prior written consent of
Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing will
prevent the Company from postponing or adjourning the 

Company Stockholder Meeting if (A) there are holders of an insufficient number
of shares of Company Common Stock present or represented by proxy at the
Company Stockholder Meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholder
Meeting, (B) the Company Board (or any committee thereof) has determined in
good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that such
postponement or adjournment is required by an order or a request from the SEC
or its staff, (C) the Company Board (or any committee thereof) has determined
in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that such
postponement or adjournment is required by applicable Law to allow reasonable
additional time for the filing or mailing of any supplemental or amended
disclosure that the Company has determined in good faith (after consultation
with outside legal counsel) is reasonably likely to be required under
applicable Law and to give the Company Stockholders sufficient time to
evaluate such supplemental or amended disclosure or (D) Parent consents to
such postponement or adjournment; provided, however that in no event shall the
Company Stockholder Meeting be postponed or adjourned (1) with respect to
Section 6.1(b)(i)(A), by more than twenty (20) days after the date on which
the Company Stockholder Meeting was (or was required to be) originally
scheduled, without the prior written consent of Parent or (2) with respect to
Section 6.1(b)(i)(B) and Section 6.1(b)(i)(C), by more than ten (10) days, or
such other amount of time reasonably agreed by the Company and Parent to be
necessary to comply with applicable Law.

(ii) The Company shall, at the instruction of Parent, postpone or adjourn the
Company Stockholders Meeting if there are not sufficient votes in person or by
proxy to secure the Requisite Stockholder Approval to allow reasonable time
for the solicitation of proxies for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite
Stockholder Approval (which instruction Parent may only issue once, except
that Parent may issue an additional instruction after any material change in
the terms of the Transaction).

(iii) The Company shall solicit from Company Stockholders proxies in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law, and unless the
Company Board has effected a Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to secure the Requisite Stockholder
Approval at the Company Stockholder Meeting. Unless this Agreement is earlier
terminated pursuant to Article VII, the Company shall establish a record date
for, call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting
for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement in accordance
with Delaware Law, whether or not the Company Board at any time subsequent to
the date hereof shall have effected a Company Board Recommendation Change or
otherwise shall determine that this Agreement is no longer advisable or
recommends that the Company Stockholders reject it.

(c) Company Board Recommendation. 

(i) Subject to the provisions of this Section 6.1(c), (A) the Company Board
shall (x) recommend that the Company Stockholders adopt this Agreement in
accordance with the applicable provisions of Delaware Law ("Company Board
Recommendation") and (y) include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement, and (B) neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall
(1) withhold, withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, or
publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, (2) approve, endorse or recommend,
or propose publicly to approve, endorse or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal
or proposal reasonably expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or approve
or recommend, or publicly declare advisable or publicly propose to enter into,
or enter into, any Alternative Acquisition Agreement, (3) following the date
any Acquisition Proposal or any material modification thereto is first made
public or sent or given to stockholders of the Company, fail to issue a press
release publicly reaffirming the Company Board Recommendation and recommending
rejection of such Acquisition Proposal within ten (10) Business Days (or, if
earlier, prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting) following Parent's written
request to do so (which request may only be made once with respect to any such
Acquisition Proposal, except that Parent may make an additional request after
any material change in the terms of such Acquisition Proposal), (4) fail to
include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, or (5) agree,
authorize or commit to do any of the foregoing (each of clauses (1) through
(5), a "Company Board Recommendation Change"); provided, however, that any
communication contemplated by Section 6.1(c)(iv) shall not be deemed to be a
Company Board Recommendation Change provided that any such communication shall
include an affirmative statement to the effect that the Company Board
Recommendation is affirmed or remains unchanged.

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder
Approval, the Company Board may, in response to a Superior Proposal that did
not result from a breach of Section 5.2(a), effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change if the Company Board and/or any authorized committee
thereof shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel) that the failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation
Change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties and only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

(A) (i) the Company Board and/or any authorized committee thereof shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that
the failure to enter into a definitive agreement relating to such Superior
Proposal would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties; (ii) the Company shall have first delivered notice to Parent at least
four (4) Business Days in advance to the effect 

that the Company Board is prepared to effect a Company Board Recommendation
Change, which notice shall attach in full the most current version of any
written agreement relating to the transaction that constitutes such Superior
Proposal (a "Superior Proposal Notice") (it being agreed that the Superior
Proposal Notice and any amendment or update to such notice and the
determination to so deliver such notice, or update or amend public disclosures
with respect thereto shall not constitute a Company Board Recommendation
Change for purposes of this Agreement); (iii) if requested by Parent, the
Company and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent's
Representatives regarding any bona fide proposed modifications to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement during the period beginning at 5:00 p.m.
Eastern Time on the day of delivery by the Company to Parent of such Superior
Proposal Notice and ending at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the fourth (4th)
Business Day following the day of such delivery so that the Acquisition
Proposal that is the subject of the foregoing notice is no longer a Superior
Proposal (it being understood and agreed that with respect to any material
amendment to any Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of a previously
delivered Superior Proposal Notice, the Company shall have given Parent
another notice based on such Acquisition Proposal, as so amended (a "Proposal
Amendment Notice"), and if requested by Parent, the Company and its
Representatives shall discuss and negotiate with Parent's Representatives any
bona fide proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
during the period beginning at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the day of delivery
by the Company to Parent of such Proposal Amendment Notice and ending at 5:00
p.m. Eastern Time on the third (3rd) Business Day following the day of such
delivery); and

(B) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after considering
the results of such negotiations and giving effect to any proposals,
amendments and modifications made in writing by Guarantor and Parent that
would be binding on Guarantor and Parent if executed by the Company, and after
consultation with the Company's financial advisors and legal advisors, that
the Superior Proposal giving rise to such Superior Proposal Notice (or
Proposal Amendment Notice) continues to be a Superior Proposal.

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder
Approval, the Company Board may, in response to an Intervening Event, effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change only if all of the following conditions
are satisfied:

(A) (i) the Company Board and/or any authorized committee thereof shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that
the failure to make a Company Board Recommendation Change in light of such
Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties; (ii) the Company shall have first delivered a notice to
Parent at least four (4) Business Days 

in advance to the effect that the Company Board is prepared to effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change, which notice shall include a description
of such Intervening Event in reasonable detail (an "Intervening Event Notice")
(it being agreed that the Intervening Event Notice and any amendment or update
to such notice and the determination to so deliver such notice, or update or
amend public disclosures with respect thereto shall not constitute a Company
Board Recommendation Change for purposes of this Agreement); and (iii) if
requested by Parent, the Company and its Representatives shall discuss and
negotiate in good faith with Parent's Representatives regarding any bona fide
proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement during
the period beginning at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the day of delivery by the
Company to Parent of such Intervening Event Notice and ending at 5:00 p.m.
Eastern Time on the fourth (4th) Business Day following the day of such
delivery so that the Intervening Event that is the subject of the foregoing
notice is no longer an Intervening Event (it being understood and agreed that
in the event of any material change in any event, occurrence or facts relating
to such Intervening Event, the Company shall provide a new notice (an "Amended
Intervening Event Notice"), and if requested by Parent, the Company and its
Representatives shall discuss and negotiate with Parent's Representatives any
bona fide proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
during the period beginning at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the day of delivery
by the Company to Parent of the Amended Intervening Event Notice and ending at
5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the third (3rd) Business Day following the day of
such delivery); and

(B) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after considering
the results of such negotiations and giving effect to any proposals,
amendments and modifications made in writing by Guarantor and Parent that
would be binding on Guarantor and Parent if executed by the Company, and after
consultation with the Company's financial advisors and legal advisors, that
the failure to make a Company Board Recommendation Change in light of such
Intervening Event would still reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties.

(iv) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board and/or any
authorized committee thereof from (a) taking and disclosing to the Company
Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act
or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act, and (b) making any disclosure to the Company Stockholders that the
Company Board and/or any authorized committee thereof determines in good faith
(after the consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to
make such disclosure would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties; provided that, in either such case, any such statement(s) or
disclosures made by the Company Board and/or any authorized committee thereof
will be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the
provisions of Article 

VII; provided, further, that in no event shall the Company or the Company
Board take, agree or resolve to take any action prohibited by Section
6.1(c)(i), subject to the introductory proviso thereto.

6.2 Efforts to Close.

(a) Reasonable Best Efforts. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, including the limitations contained in Sections 6.3
and 6.4, each of Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
respective Representatives to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to
do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other Party or
Parties in doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective, as promptly as
practicable, the Merger and the other Transactions, including using reasonable
best efforts to: (i) cause the conditions to the Merger set forth in Section
2.2 to be satisfied or fulfilled as promptly as practicable after the date of
this Agreement; (ii) obtain, as promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, and maintain all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers,
consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from any Governmental
Authorities and make all necessary registrations, declarations and filings
with any Governmental Authorities that are necessary to consummate the Merger;
and (iii) obtain all necessary or appropriate consents, waivers and approvals
under any Contracts or Leases to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions so as to maintain and preserve the benefits under such Contracts
or Leases following the consummation of the Transactions.

(b) Forbearance. In addition to the foregoing, neither Guarantor, Parent or
Merger Sub, on the one hand, nor (subject to the Company's rights under
Section 6.3) the Company, on the other hand, shall acquire or undertake to
acquire any business, branch of activity or the control of any entity, if such
acquisition would reasonably be expected to materially prevent, impair or
delay beyond the Termination Date the obtaining of, the consent, approval,
order or authorization of any Governmental Authority under an applicable
Antitrust Laws in any of the Relevant Antitrust Jurisdictions.

(c) No Consent Fee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
Company shall not be required prior to the Effective Time to pay any consent
or other similar fee, "profit sharing" or other similar payment or other
consideration (including increased rent or other similar payments or any
amendments, supplements or other modifications to (or waivers of) the existing
terms of any Contract), or the provision of additional security (including a
guaranty) to obtain the consent, waiver or approval of any Person under any
Contract required as a result of the signing of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Transactions unless Parent or its Affiliates agree to
compensate any such Person on the Company's behalf or to promptly reimburse
the 

Company for any payments made or liabilities to such Person, in each case, in
connection with obtaining such consent.

6.3 Regulatory Approvals.

(a) Each of Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company (and their
respective Affiliates, if applicable) shall with respect to the Transactions
(x) file with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and
Report Form relating to this Agreement and the Transactions as required by the
HSR Act as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement but in no
event later than ten (10) Business Days following the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, and (y) file comparable pre-merger or post-merger
notification filings, forms and submissions with any foreign Governmental
Authority that are required in the Relevant Antitrust Jurisdictions as soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement but in no event later than
fifteen (15) Business Days following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement. Guarantor, Parent and the Company shall each request early
termination of the waiting period provided for in the HSR Act. Each of
Guarantor, Parent and the Company shall (i) cooperate and coordinate with the
other in the making of such filings (including, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, providing copies, or portions thereof, of all such documents
to the non-filing Parties prior to filing and considering all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith) and in
connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry of any
Governmental Authority under any applicable Laws or Orders with respect to any
such filing, (ii) supply outside counsel for the other Party with any
information that may be required in order to make such filings, (iii) supply
any additional information that may be required or requested by the FTC, the
DOJ or any other Governmental Authorities, including of any other applicable
jurisdiction in which any such filing is made, under any other applicable
Laws, and (iv) use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other Parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
or other applicable Antitrust Laws in the Relevant Antitrust Jurisdictions as
promptly as practicable, to obtain any required consents under any other Laws
applicable to the Merger as promptly as practicable, and to avoid any
impediment to the consummation of the Merger under any applicable Laws or
Orders.

(b) Each of Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company (and their
respective Affiliates, if applicable) shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain CFIUS Clearance as promptly as practicable, including, considering in
good faith any request by CFIUS that Guarantor, Parent or Merger Sub enter
into any form of mitigation agreement; provided, however that Guarantor and
Parent and their respective Affiliates shall not be required to accept any
condition, restriction or other action required by CFIUS that reasonably in
good faith could be considered by the Guarantor as burdening or negatively
affecting Guarantor's or its Affiliates' ability to retain or operate
Guarantor's, the Company's or their respective Affiliates' businesses,
operations, product lines or 

assets from and after the Closing. Each of Guarantor, Parent and the Company
shall promptly furnish to the other copies of any notices or communications
received by it or any of its Affiliates from CFIUS or any of its constituent
agencies with respect to the Transactions, unless otherwise prohibited by any
Governmental Authority or Law, and each of Guarantor, Parent and the Company
shall permit the other's counsel to have an opportunity to review in advance,
and Guarantor or such Party shall consider in good faith the views of such
other Party's counsel in connection with, any proposed communications by such
Party or its Affiliates to CFIUS concerning the Transactions (except for
personal identifier information or other confidential information concerning
Guarantor, Parent or its Affiliates provided to CFIUS). Should any Party wish
to have any material communication with CFIUS, then it should provide prompt
notice to the other Party and a description of the envisaged communication
beforehand. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, as promptly
as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, Guarantor, Parent and
the Company shall prepare, prefile and then, as soon as reasonably practicable
thereafter, file with CFIUS a joint voluntary notice pursuant to DPA with
respect to the Transactions. Guarantor, Parent and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to provide CFIUS with any additional or supplemental
information requested by CFIUS during their respective reviews as promptly as
practicable, and in all cases within the amount of time allowed by CFIUS, as
applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, in the event that CFIUS notifies Guarantor,
Parent and the Company that CFIUS (i) has completed its review or
investigation and determined that it has unresolved national security concerns
and (ii) intends to send a report to the President of the United States
requesting the President's decision because it either (A) recommends that the
President act to suspend or prohibit the Merger, (B) is unable to reach a
decision on whether to recommend that the President suspend or prohibit the
Merger or (C) requests that the President make a determination with respect to
the Merger (a "CFIUS Turndown"), Parent may request a withdrawal of the notice
filed with CFIUS in connection with the CFIUS Clearance and neither Guarantor,
Parent, Merger Sub nor the Company shall have any further obligation to seek
CFIUS Clearance.

(c) Each of Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates,
if applicable), on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall
promptly inform the other of any material communication from any Governmental
Authority regarding any of the Transactions in connection with any filings or
investigations with, by or before any Governmental Authority relating to this
Agreement or the Transactions, including any proceedings initiated by a
private party. If any Party or Affiliate thereof shall receive a request for
additional information or documentary material from any Governmental Authority
with respect to the Transactions pursuant to the HSR Act or any other
applicable Laws with respect to which any such filings have been made, then
such Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made,
as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other Party,
an appropriate response in compliance with such request. In connection with
and without limiting the foregoing, to the extent reasonably 

practicable and unless prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable
Governmental Authority, Guarantor and the Parties agree to (i) give each other
reasonable advanced notice of all meetings with any Governmental Authority
relating to the Transactions, (ii) give each other an opportunity to
participate in each of such meetings if permitted by the relevant Governmental
Authority, (iii) keep the other Party reasonably apprised with respect to any
material oral communications with any Governmental Authority regarding the
Transactions, (iv) cooperate in the filing of any analyses, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions or other written communications
explaining or defending the Transactions, articulating any regulatory or
competitive argument and/or responding to requests or objections made by any
Governmental Authority, (v) provide outside legal counsel for the other Party
with a reasonable advance opportunity to review and comment upon, and consider
in good faith the views of the other Party with respect to, all written
communications (including any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments and opinions) with a Governmental Authority regarding the
Transactions, (vi) provide each other (or outside counsel of each Party, as
appropriate) with copies of all written communications to or from any
Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions, and (vii) cooperate and
provide each other (or outside counsel of each Party, as appropriate) with a
reasonable opportunity to participate in, and consider in good faith the views
of the other Party with respect to, all material deliberations with respect to
all efforts to satisfy the conditions set forth in Sections 2.2(a)(ii) and
2.2(a)(iii). Any such disclosures, rights to participate or provisions of
information by one Party to the other Party may be made on a counsel-only
basis to the extent required under applicable Law or as appropriate to protect
confidential business information. The Parties and Guarantor shall take
reasonable best efforts to share information protected from disclosure under
the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege
or any other privilege pursuant to this Section 6.3 in a manner so as to
preserve the applicable privilege.

(d) The Parties shall jointly develop, consult and cooperate with one another
regarding, the strategy for obtaining any necessary approval of, or responding
to any request from, inquiry by, or investigation by (including directing the
timing, nature and substance of all such responses), any Governmental
Authority in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including determining the timing and content of any registrations,
filings, agreements, forms, notices, petitions, statements, submissions of
information, applications and other documents, communications and
correspondence contemplated by, made in accordance with, or subject to this
Section 6.3; provided, however, if the Parties cannot agree on a jointly
developed strategy or appropriate course of action or content of any
submission, notwithstanding their respective good faith attempts to do so,
Guarantor shall have the right to make the final determination with respect to
such matter; provided, further, and without limiting the foregoing, that
Guarantor will consult with the Company and consider in good faith the views
of the Company in advance of making any final decisions with respect to such
matter. 

(e) With respect to obtaining the Consents required under, and compliance with
any other applicable requirements of the HSR Act and any applicable foreign
Antitrust Laws, and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the "reasonable best efforts" of Parent and Guarantor shall include
(i) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree,
hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, disposition, license
or other disposition of any Subsidiaries of the Company, operations,
divisions, businesses, product lines, Contracts, customers or assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) taking or committing to take such
other actions that may limit or impact Guarantor's or any of its Subsidiaries'
(including the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries') freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to retain, any of Guarantor's or any of its
Subsidiaries' (including the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries')
operations, divisions, businesses, products lines, Contracts, customers or
assets, (iii) entering into any Orders, settlements, undertakings, Contracts,
consent decrees, stipulations or other agreements to effectuate any of the
foregoing or in order to vacate, lift, reverse, overturn, settle or otherwise
resolve any Order that prevents, prohibits, restricts or delays the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, in
any case, that may be issued by any court or other Governmental Authority, and
(iv) creating, terminating or divesting relationships, Contractual rights or
obligations of the Company, Guarantor or their respective Subsidiaries, in
each of the foregoing clauses (i) - (iv), in connection with obtaining all, or
eliminating any requirement to obtain any, waiting period expirations or
terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, exemptions, licenses, orders,
registrations, approvals, permits, and authorizations for the Transactions
under the HSR Act, any other Antitrust Law or from any Governmental Authority,
so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable following the
date of this Agreement and, in any event, no later than the Termination Date
(the actions and limitations described in clauses (i) - (iv), the "Regulatory
Actions"). For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not, unless requested
to do so by Guarantor, commit to or effect any action contemplated in clause
(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of the immediately preceding sentence.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, none of
Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub or the other Subsidiaries of Guarantor shall be
required to, and none of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall, without the
prior written consent of Guarantor, (A) take or commit to take such other
actions that would result in the disclosure of, or the grant of any license or
any other right in, the Source Code Materials of any Software (including any
Software embedding any of the Source Code Materials) of Guarantor, the Company
and/or their respect respective Affiliates, (B) take or commit to take such
other actions that would result in the sale, divestiture, disposition, license
or other disposition of the divisions, businesses, product lines, Contracts,
customers or assets of the Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries (excluding the
Company's or any of its Subsidiaries') or (C) take any action, or commit to
take any action, or agree to any condition or limitation contemplated in this
Section 6.3 that (i) is not conditioned on the consummation of the Merger or
(ii) that would result in, or would be reasonably likely to result in,
individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on (x) the
Guarantor and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (y) the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (z) the Guarantor and 

its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, together with the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (collectively, the "Combined Company");
provided, however, that (I) for purposes of each of the foregoing clauses (x)
and (z), the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and the
Combined Company, respectively, shall be deemed to be of the size, scope and
scale, and with the business, assets, liabilities, financial condition and
results of operations, of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole
and (II) in determining whether any Regulatory Action, individually or in the
aggregate with all other Regulatory Actions, would or would reasonably be
expected to result in such a material adverse effect under each of the
foregoing clauses (x), (y) or (z), any adverse impact on the synergies
reasonably expected to be realized from the Merger shall (without duplication)
be taken into account (any of the foregoing, clauses (A), (B) and (C), a
"Burdensome Condition").

(f) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained in this Section 6.3, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding by a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction is instituted
challenging the Transactions, each of Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub (and
their respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand, and the Company,
on the other hand, shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) oppose fully
and vigorously, including by defending through litigation, any such action or
proceeding, (ii) pursue vigorously all available avenues of administrative and
judicial appeal and (iii) seek to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned
any Order that is in effect that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation
of the Transactions; provided that none of Guarantor, Parent or a Subsidiary
of Guarantor shall be required to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
not, without the prior written consent of Guarantor, take any action under
this Section 6.3(f) that would result in, or would be reasonably likely to
result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Burdensome Condition. To assist
Guarantor in complying with its obligations set forth in this Section 6.3, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, provide to Guarantor such
cooperation as may be reasonably requested by Guarantor.

6.4 Financing.

(a) No Amendments to Facilities Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, each of Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub will not permit,
without the prior written consent of the Company (which consent shall not be
unreasonably, withheld, conditioned or delayed), any amendment or modification
(including an amendment or modification effected by way of a side letter) (it
being agreed that any Alternate Debt Financing shall not be deemed to be an
amendment, modification or waiver) to be made to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy pursuant to, the Facilities Agreement if such amendment,
modification or waiver would, or could reasonably be expected to, (i) reduce
the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing to an amount that, together with
Guarantor's, Parent's and Merger Sub's cash on hand, would be less than an
amount reasonably required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) adversely impact the ability of any of Guarantor, Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, to enforce its rights against the
other parties to the Facilities Agreement, (iii) impose new or additional 

conditions to the Debt Financing, or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of
the conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing in a manner that would, or
could reasonably be expected to, prevent, impede or materially delay the
consummation of the Debt Financing when required pursuant to the terms hereof
or (iv) prevent, impede or materially delay the consummation of the Debt
Financing when required pursuant to the terms hereof. In addition to the
foregoing, Guarantor shall not release or consent to the termination of the
Facilities Agreement or release any individual lender under the Facilities
Agreement, except for (x) assignments and replacements of an individual lender
under the terms of, and only in connection with, the syndication of the Debt
Financing under the Facilities Agreement, or (y) replacements of the
Facilities Agreement, or all or any portion of the Debt Financing thereunder,
with alternative financing commitments pursuant to Section 6.4(b).

(b) Debt Financing and Alternate Debt Financing. Guarantor shall use (or cause
Parent or Merger Sub to use) its reasonable best efforts to arrange the Debt
Financing and obtain the financing contemplated thereby as promptly as
reasonably practicable on the terms and conditions set forth in the Facilities
Agreement, which shall consist of, without limitation, (i) maintaining in full
force and effect the Facilities Agreement in accordance with the terms and
subject to the conditions thereof (except as otherwise permitted hereunder),
(ii) complying with its obligations under the Facilities Agreement, (iii)
satisfying on a timely basis (or obtaining a waiver to) all conditions to
funding and covenants that are applicable to Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub
in the Facilities Agreement, (iv) enforcing its rights pursuant to the
Facilities Agreement, and (v) if all conditions in the Facilities Agreement
are satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied on Closing) and the conditions in Section 2.2(a) and Section 2.2(b)
of this Agreement have been satisfied, consummating the Debt Financing at or
prior to the Closing. Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub will fully pay, or
cause to be fully paid, all commitment or other fees arising pursuant to the
Facilities Agreement as and when they become due. In the event that any
portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
set forth in the Facilities Agreement, and such portion is reasonably required
to consummate the Transactions, then Guarantor shall use its reasonable best
efforts to, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event,
(i) obtain alternative financing from alternative sources on terms, conditions
and costs not materially less favorable in the aggregate to Guarantor, Parent,
Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation (in the reasonable judgment of
Guarantor) than those set forth in the Facilities Agreement (provided that
such terms, conditions and costs would not have any of the effects specified
in Section 6.4(a)) and in an amount at least equal to the Debt Financing or
such unavailable and required portion thereof, as the case may be (the
"Alternate Debt Financing"), and (ii) obtain one or more new financing
commitment letters or facilities agreements with respect to such Alternate
Debt Financing (the "New Debt Facilities Agreement"), which New Debt
Facilities Agreement will replace the existing Facilities Agreement in whole
or in part. Guarantor shall promptly provide the Company with a copy of any
New Debt Facilities Agreement; provided that any New Debt Facilities Agreement
may be redacted to remove all economic terms that could not adversely affect
the 

conditionality, enforceability, termination or aggregate principal amount of
the Debt Financing. Furthermore, Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub may, in its
discretion, substitute any portion of the Debt Financing under the Facilities
Agreement with alternative financing, whether from the same or alternative
financing sources, so long as (i) the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing
(including such alternative financing) would be in an amount that, together
with Guarantor's, Parent's and Merger Sub's cash on hand, would not be less
than an amount reasonably required to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) such alternative financing would not, and could not
reasonably be expected to, impose new or additional conditions to the Debt
Financing, or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the
receipt of the Debt Financing, in a manner that would, or could reasonably be
expected to, prevent, impede or materially delay the consummation of the Debt
Financing when required pursuant to the terms hereof or (iii) such
substitution would not, and could not reasonably be expected to, prevent,
impede or materially delay the consummation of the Debt Financing when
required pursuant to the terms hereof (it being agreed that such alternative
financing shall constitute Alternate Debt Financing for all purposes hereof,
and the definitive agreements providing for such alternate financing shall
constitute New Debt Facilities Agreements for all purposes hereof). In the
event that any New Debt Facilities Agreements are obtained, (A) any reference
in this Agreement to the "Facilities Agreement" will be deemed to include the
Facilities Agreement to the extent not superseded by one or more New Debt
Facilities Agreements at the time in question and any New Debt Facilities
Agreements to the extent then in effect, and (B) any reference in this
Agreement to the "Debt Financing" means the Debt Financing contemplated by the
Facilities Agreement as modified pursuant to the foregoing and any Alternate
Debt Financing.

(c) Information. Upon written request by the Company, Guarantor shall provide
the Company with copies of all executed amendments, modifications or
replacements of the Facilities Agreement in redacted form removing all
economic terms that could not adversely affect the conditionality,
enforceability, termination or aggregate principal amount of the Debt
Financing (it being understood that any amendments, modifications or
replacements shall only be as permitted herein). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Guarantor shall promptly notify the Company (A)
of any breach, default, termination or cancellation by any party to the
Facilities Agreement, of which Guarantor becomes aware; (B) of the receipt by
Guarantor of any written notice or communication from any Debt Financing
Source with respect to (1) any breach, default, termination or cancellation of
the Facilities Agreement or (2) material dispute or disagreement between or
among any parties to the Facilities Agreement; (C) if any Debt Financing
Source notifies Guarantor that such source no longer intends to provide
financing to Guarantor on the terms, in the manner or from the sources
contemplated by the Facilities Agreement; and (D) if for any reason Guarantor
no longer believes that it will be able to obtain all of the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Facilities Agreement on the terms, in the manner or from
the sources contemplated by the Facilities Agreement. Guarantor shall provide
any information reasonably requested by the 

Company relating to any of the circumstances referred to in the previous
sentence as soon as reasonably practical after the date that the Company
delivers a written request therefor to Guarantor.

(d) No Financing Condition. Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and
agrees that obtaining the Debt Financing is not a condition to the Closing. In
the event that the Debt Financing has not been obtained, Guarantor, Parent and
Merger Sub will each continue to be obligated, subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 2.2, to consummate the Merger.

(e) Company Support.

(i) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will use its reasonable best
efforts, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to use its respective
reasonable best efforts, to provide Guarantor and the Debt Financing Sources,
at Guarantor's sole expense, with all customary cooperation reasonably
requested by Guarantor to assist it in causing the conditions in the
Facilities Agreement to be satisfied or as is otherwise reasonably requested
by Guarantor in connection with the Debt Financing, including:

(A) delivering notices of prepayment within the time periods required by the
relevant agreements governing indebtedness and obtaining customary payoff
letters, lien terminations and instruments of discharge to be delivered at the
Closing, and giving any other necessary notices, to allow for the payoff,
discharge and termination in full at the Closing of all indebtedness required
by the Facilities Agreement to be paid, discharged or terminated;

(B) promptly, and no later than three (3) Business Days prior to Closing,
furnishing Guarantor and the Debt Financing Sources with all documentation and
other information related solely to the Company and its Subsidiaries required
by regulatory authorities pursuant to applicable "know your customer" and
anti-money laundering rules and regulations; provided, that the request for
such information has been made at least ten (10) Business Days prior to
Closing; and

(C) providing customary authorization letters to the Debt Financing Sources
authorizing the distribution of information to prospective lenders or
investors and containing customary representations to the Debt Financing
Sources under the Facilities Agreement, including with respect to the presence
or absence of material non-public information and the accuracy of the written
information contained in the disclosure and marketing materials related to the
Debt Financing.

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.4(e)(i) or any other
provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement will require the
Company or any of 

its Subsidiaries to (A) waive or amend any terms of this Agreement or agree to
pay any fees or reimburse any expenses prior to the Effective Time for which
it is not otherwise indemnifiable or reimbursable by or on behalf of Guarantor
or Parent, (B) enter into any definitive agreement which is not contingent
upon the Closing (other than customary representation letters and
authorization letters (including with respect to the presence or absence of
material non-public information and the accuracy of the information contained
in the disclosure and marketing materials related to the Debt Financing)), (C)
give any indemnities that are effective prior to the Effective Time, (D) take
any action that, in the good faith determination of the Company, would
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or create an unreasonable risk of damage or destruction of any
property or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (E) provide any
information the disclosure of which is prohibited or restricted under
applicable Law or is legally privileged, or (F) take any action that will
conflict with or violate its organizational documents or any applicable Laws
or would result in a violation or breach of, or default under, any agreement
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement will require
(A) any officer or Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
(x) execute or deliver any definitive agreement, certificate or opinion in
connection with the Debt Financing, or (y) take any other action pursuant to
Section 6.4(e)(i) or any other provision of this Agreement that could
reasonably be expected to result in personal liability to such officer or
Representative, or (B) the members of the Company Board as of the date hereof
to approve the Debt Financing or any alternative financing or Contracts
related thereto. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, (A)
any breach by the Company of its obligations under this Section 6.4(e) shall
not constitute a breach of this Agreement or a breach for purposes of Article
VII or a breach of the condition precedent set forth in Section 2.2(b)(i)
hereof, and (B) any information furnished by the Company under this Section
6.4(e) shall not be deemed to be disclosed for purposes of determining whether
the Company has failed to satisfy any of the conditions set forth in Section
2.2(a) and Section 2.2(b) at the Effective Time or to expand, or otherwise
modify or effect, any representations, warranties or covenants of the Company
in this Agreement; provided that clauses (A) and (B) in this sentence shall
not apply in the event of any Willful Breach by the Company of this Section
6.4(e).

(f) Confidentiality. All non-public or other confidential information provided
by the Company or its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives
pursuant to this Agreement will be kept confidential to the extent and in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, except that
Guarantor and its Affiliates will be permitted to disclose such information to
any financing sources or prospective financing sources and other financial
institutions and investors that are or may become parties to the Debt
Financing and to any underwriters, initial 

purchasers or placement agents in connection with the Debt Financing (and, in
each case, to their respective counsel and auditors) so long as such Persons
(i) agree to be bound by the Confidentiality Agreement as if parties thereto,
or (ii) are subject to other customary confidentiality undertakings. Parent
shall be responsible for all breaches of the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement by any Person provided non-public or confidential information by
Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to the preceding sentence.

(g) Company Reimbursement and Indemnification.

(i) Upon request by the Company, Guarantor or Parent shall promptly (and in
any event within thirty (30) calendar days of invoice) reimburse (or cause to
be reimbursed) the Company and its Subsidiaries for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees
and expenses) incurred by the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective Representatives in connection with providing the support and
cooperation contemplated by Section 6.4(e).

(ii) Guarantor shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and each of their respective directors, officers, employees and
other Representatives, from and against any and all losses, damages, claims,
interest, costs or expenses (including legal fees and expenses), awards,
judgments, penalties and amounts paid in settlement suffered or incurred by
any of them in connection with the Debt Financing, including providing the
support and cooperation contemplated by Section 6.4(e) and any information
utilized in connection therewith; provided, that, the Parent shall not be
obligated to provide such indemnity to the extent arising from information
furnished in writing by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or with respect to any such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses, interest, awards, judgments, penalties or amounts arising from or
related to any breach of any representation made by the Company hereunder or
in the case of fraud.

(h) Use of Logos. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the Debt Financing so long as such
logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or likely to harm or
disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(i) No Exclusive Arrangements. Except as set forth in Section 6.4(i) of the
Parent Disclosure Letter, in no event will Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective Affiliates enter into or enforce any Contract
prohibiting or seeking to prohibit any bank, investment bank or other
potential provider of debt or equity financing for the Merger or any other
transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from providing or
seeking to provide debt or 

equity financing to any Person in connection with the Merger or any other
transaction relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

6.5 Public Statements and Disclosure. Neither the Company, on the one hand,
nor Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall issue or cause
the publication of any public release or otherwise make any public
announcement concerning this Agreement or the Transactions without the prior
written consent of the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such release or announcement may
be required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable
national securities exchange (including Euronext Paris), national securities
or interdealer quotation system or regulatory or Governmental Authority to
which the relevant Party is subject or submits, wherever situated, in which
case the Party required to make the release or announcement shall use its
reasonable good faith efforts to allow the other Party or Parties, as the case
may be, reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance
of such issuance (it being understood that the final form and content of any
such release or announcement, as well as the timing of any such release or
announcement, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing Party);
provided, however, that the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.5 shall
not apply to any release or announcement (a) substantially similar in tone and
substance with previous public releases or announcements jointly made by the
Company and Guarantor or (b) made or proposed to be made by (i) the Company
pursuant to Section 6.1(c)(i) or with respect to a Company Board
Recommendation Change or (ii) Parent in connection with a response to the
issuance by the Company of any release, announcement, statement, disclosure or
communication of the type referred to in clause (i). Parent and the Company
agree that the press release announcing the execution of this Agreement shall
be a joint release of Parent and the Company.

6.6 Anti-Takeover Laws. In the event that any state anti-takeover or other
similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement and otherwise minimize the effect of such Law on this
Agreement and the Transactions.

6.7 Access. At all times during the period commencing with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII and the Effective Time,
the Company shall (a) afford Parent and its financial advisors, business
consultants, legal counsel, accountants and other agents and representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the
properties, books and records, Contracts, and personnel (including employees
and agents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (promptly following the
execution of a consent in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such
auditors or independent accountants) accounts and work papers of the Company's 

and its Subsidiaries' independent accountants and auditors and (b) furnish to
Parent all other information and documents concerning or regarding its
businesses, properties and assets (including Intellectual Property Rights but
excluding Trade Secrets) and personnel as may be reasonably requested by
Parent; provided, however, that the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit
access to any documents or information to the extent that the Company
determines (upon the advice of outside legal counsel) that (i) any applicable
Law requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such
documents or information, (ii) access to such documents would be in violation
of the HSR Act, Sherman Act, or any applicable non-U.S. antitrust or
competition laws, (iii) access to such documents or information would result
in the waiver any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other
applicable privilege applicable to such documents or information, or (iv)
access to a Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or otherwise bound would violate or cause a default under, or give a
third party the right to terminate or accelerate the rights under, such
Contract or otherwise; and provided further, however, that no information or
knowledge obtained by Parent in any investigation conducted pursuant to the
access contemplated by this Section 6.7 shall affect or be deemed to affect,
modify or waive any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in
this Agreement or otherwise impair the rights and remedies available to Parent
and Merger Sub hereunder. In the event that the Company does not provide
access or information in reliance on the preceding sentence, it shall use its
reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure or to
communicate the applicable information to Parent in a way that would not
violate the applicable Law, Contract or obligation or to waive such a
privilege. Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by
this Section 6.7 shall be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries
or create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Any access to the properties of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be subject to the terms and
conditions of any applicable Lease and the Company's reasonable security
measures and insurance requirements and shall not include the right to perform
Phase 1 or Phase 2 environmental assessments or other invasive testing. The
terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any
information obtained by Parent or any of its financial advisors, business
consultants, legal counsel, accountants and other agents and representatives
in connection with any investigation conducted pursuant to the access
contemplated by this Section 6.7. Nothing in this Section 6.7 or elsewhere in
this Agreement shall be construed to require the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any Representatives of any of the foregoing to prepare any
reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or other information.

6.8 Section 16(b) Exemption. The Company shall, prior to the Effective Time,
take all actions reasonably necessary to cause the Transactions and any other
dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including deemed
dispositions or cancellations and of any derivative securities) in connection
with the Transactions by each individual who is a director or officer of the
Company 

subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to
be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

6.9 Directors' and Officers' Exculpation, Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) Existing Agreements and Protections. The Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the
Company under, and with respect to acts and omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, any and all (i) indemnification agreements between the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or
former directors and officers and any person who becomes a director or officer
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, in each
case, when acting in such capacity (the "Indemnified Persons") and (ii)
indemnification, expense advancement and exculpation provisions in any
certificate of incorporation or bylaws and any comparable Organizational
Document of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each of the foregoing
clauses (i) and (ii), as in effect on the date of this Agreement. In addition,
during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and any
other similar Organizational Documents) of the Surviving Corporation to
contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the
advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable (in the aggregate) to
the Indemnified Persons with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses
provisions contained in the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and any
other similar Organizational Documents) of the Company as of the date hereof,
and during such six-year period, such provisions shall not, be repealed,
amended or otherwise modified in any manner except as set forth in Section
6.9(e) or required by applicable Law.

(b) Indemnification. Without limiting the generality of the provisions of
Section 6.9(a), during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending
on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to) indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person from and against any
costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, to the extent such claim, proceeding, investigation or
inquiry arises out of or pertains to (i) any action or omission or alleged
action or omission at or prior to the Effective Time in such Indemnified
Person's capacity as a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (regardless of whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after
the Effective Time), or (ii) any of the Transactions; provided, however, that
if, at any time prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, 

any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a claim
for indemnification under this Section 6.9(b), then the claim asserted in such
notice shall survive the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time until
such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. In addition, during the
period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) advance,
prior to the final disposition of any claim, proceeding, investigation or
inquiry for which indemnification may be sought under this Agreement, promptly
following request by an Indemnified Person therefor, all reasonable,
documented out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and investigation expenses) incurred by such Indemnified
Person in connection with any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry
upon receipt of an undertaking by such Indemnified Person to repay such
advances if it is ultimately decided in a final, non-appealable judgment by a
court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Person is not entitled
to indemnification. In the event any Legal Proceeding is brought against any
Indemnified Person and in which indemnification could be sought by such
Indemnified Person under this Section 6.9, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall
have the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time and the
Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to any Indemnified Person for any
legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses incurred by such
Indemnified Persons in connection with the defense thereof, except that if the
Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the
Indemnified Persons advises that there are issues which give rise to conflicts
of interest between the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Persons,
each Indemnified Person shall be entitled to retain his or her own counsel and
the Surviving Corporation shall pay (or cause to be paid) all reasonable fees
and expenses of any counsel retained by an Indemnified Person, promptly after
statements therefor are received; provided that the Surviving Corporation
shall be obligated pursuant to this clause (i) to pay for only one counsel for
all Indemnified Persons in any jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel for
such Indemnified Persons would present such counsel with a conflict of
interest, in which case, the fewest number of counsels necessary to avoid
conflicts of interest will be used, (ii) the Indemnified Persons will
cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (iii) the Surviving
Corporation shall not (A) be liable for any settlement or compromise effected
without their prior written consent and (B) have any obligation hereunder to
any Indemnified Person, if and when a court of competent jurisdiction shall
ultimately determine, and such determination shall become final, that the
indemnification of such Indemnified Person in the manner contemplated hereby
is prohibited by applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Section 6.9(b) or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Parent,
the Surviving Corporation nor any of their respective Affiliates (including
Guarantor) shall settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any Legal Proceeding
for which indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Person under this
Section 6.9 unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination
includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from all
liability 

arising out of such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry or such
Indemnified Person otherwise consents (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(c) Insurance. Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company shall (following reasonable
consultation with Parent) purchase a six-year "tail" directors' and officers'
liability insurance (the "DandO Insurance") for each person covered by the
Company's current directors' and officers' liability policy in respect of acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, on terms with
respect to the coverage and amounts that are equivalent (in the aggregate) to
those of the Company's current directors' and officers' liability insurance;
provided, however that in satisfying its obligations under this Section
6.9(c), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay in
excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the amount paid by the Company for
coverage for its most recent policy year (which premiums the Company
represents and warrants to be set forth in Section 6.9(c) of the Company
Disclosure Letter). The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail" policy in full force and
effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder for so
long as such "tail" policy shall be maintained in full force and effect.

(d) Successors and Assigns. If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of
its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 6.9.

(e) No Impairment; Third Party Beneficiaries. The obligations set forth in
this Section 6.9 shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any
manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person without the prior written
consent of such affected Indemnified Person. Each of the Indemnified Persons
are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.9, with full
rights of enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified
Persons under this Section 6.9 shall be in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have under the
Organizational Documents, any and all indemnification agreements of or entered
into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at
law or in equity).

(f) Preservation of Other Rights. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to,
shall be construed to or shall release, waiver or impair any rights to
directors' and officers' insurance claims under any policy that is or has been
in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of
their respective directors or officers, it being understood and agreed that
the 

indemnification provided for in this Section 6.9 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

6.10 Treatment of Certain Existing Indebtedness. Prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall, as reasonably requested by Parent, (i) deliver or cause to
be delivered notices of the payoff, discharge and termination of any
outstanding indebtedness or obligations of the Company under that certain
Credit Agreement, dated December 21, 2017, between the Company and HSBC Bank
USA, National Association, as administrative agent, and the other agents,
lenders and arrangers party thereto (the "Credit Agreement") and obligations
or agreements that are secured pursuant thereto (including interest rate
swaps) (the "Credit Agreement Payoff Amount"), (ii) take all other actions
required to facilitate the repayment of the Credit Agreement Payoff Amount
with respect to the termination of the commitments under the Credit Agreement
and the release of any encumbrances and termination of all guarantees granted
under the Credit Agreement and (iii) obtain customary payoff letters or other
similar evidence with respect to the Credit Agreement at least five (5)
Business Days prior to Closing (but shall be subject to customary conditions).
Parent shall (A) irrevocably pay off or cause to be paid off at or prior to
the Effective Time the Credit Agreement Payoff Amount and (B) use its
commercially reasonable efforts to provide all customary cooperation as may be
reasonably requested by the Company to assist the Company in connection with
its obligation under this Section 6.10.

6.11 Employee Matters.

(a) 401(k) Plan. Parent may request the Company to terminate its 401(k) Plan
(the "Company 401(k) Plan"), effective immediately prior to the Effective
Time, provided that any such request must be in writing and must be received
by the Company at least ten (10) Business Days before the Closing Date. If
such written request is timely made, the Company Board and/or the Company
shall adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as may be necessary
in order to effectuate the termination of the Company 401(k) Plan. Subject to
applicable Law, if the Company 401(k) Plan is terminated, Parent shall cause a
new or existing 401(k) plan of Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including
the Surviving Corporation) (such plan or plans, the "Parent 401(k) Plan") to
permit each Continuing Employee to make rollover contributions of "eligible
rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code)
in an amount equal to the eligible rollover distribution portion of the
account balance distributable to such Continuing Employee from such Company
401(k) Plan to the corresponding Parent 401(k) Plan; provided, however, that
the Parent 401(k) Plan will not be required to accept rollovers of Roth
contributions that were made to a Company 401(k) Plan pursuant to Section 402A
of the Code.

(b) Existing Agreements. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor
all Employee Plans in accordance with their terms; provided, however, that
nothing in this sentence shall prohibit the 

Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries from amending or terminating, or
from causing the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries to amend or
terminate, any such Employee Plans in accordance with their terms or if
otherwise required by applicable Law.

(c) Compensation and Benefits Continuation. For a period of at least one (1)
year following the Effective Time (the "Continuation Period") (or, if shorter,
during the relevant period of employment), Parent shall provide or cause to be
provided (i) to each Continuing Employee an annual base salary or wage rate
that is no less than the annual base salary or wage rate provided to such
Continuing Employee by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) to the Continuing Employees generally, the target
annual cash incentive opportunities, defined contribution, health and welfare,
and severance benefits in each case as set forth in Section 6.11(c) of the
Company Disclosure Letter.

(d) Service Credit; Etc. For purposes of participation of those Continuing
Employees employed in the United States ("US Continuing Employees") in a
benefit plan of Parent or its Affiliates in the United States (including the
Surviving Corporation) (each such plan, a "Parent Benefit Plan"), when the
Parent permits the participation of US Continuing Employees in such Parent
Benefit Plan, Parent shall cause (i) such US Continuing Employee to be
credited with all years of service for which such US Continuing Employees was
credited before the Closing Date under any analogous Employee Plans (other
than (x) to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits with respect to the same period of service or (y) for purposes of the
defined benefit pension accrual); (ii) the waiver of any (x) waiting period
for such US Continuing Employee in the transition between any existing
analogous employee benefit plans and eligibility for participation in the
Parent Benefit Plans and (y) pre-existing condition exclusions and
insurability and actively at work requirements of such Parent Benefit Plan;
(iii) subject to the availability of applicable data, any eligible expenses
incurred by such US Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents
under an Employee Plan which is a welfare plan during the portion of the plan
year of the Employee Plan ending on the date such US Continuing Employee's
participation in the corresponding Parent Benefit Plan begins to be taken into
account under such Parent Benefit Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such US Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for such year as
if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such Parent Benefit Plan; and
(iv) credit the accounts of each US Continuing Employee under any Parent
Benefit Plan that is a flexible spending arrangement with any unused balance
in the account of such US Continuing Employee under the analogous Employee
Plan. In transitioning the participation of any US Continuing Employee to a
Parent Benefit Plan from the analogous Employee Plan, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that there is no gap in coverage for
or the provision of benefits to such US Continuing Employee. 

(e) No Third Party Beneficiary Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, no provision of this Agreement shall be
deemed to (i) guarantee employment or service for any period of time for, or
preclude the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their
Subsidiaries to terminate, any Continuing Employee or other service provider
of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries for any reason, (ii)
require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries to
continue any particular Employee Plan or prevent the amendment, modification
or termination thereof after the Effective Time, or (iii) confer upon any
current or former director, officer, employee or natural person service
provider of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or legal representative or
beneficiary thereof, or any other Person, any rights or remedies, including
any right to compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever, under
this Agreement or any rights or remedies under any Employee Plan that such
employee, representative, beneficiary or other Person would not otherwise have
under the terms of that Employee Plan. No provision of this Agreement shall
create any third party beneficiary rights in any employee of the Company, any
Subsidiary of the Company or any beneficiary or dependents thereof, or any
other person who is not a Party to this Agreement.

6.12 Obligations of Merger Sub. Parent shall take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. Parent and
Merger Sub will be jointly and severally liable for the failure by either of
them to perform and discharge any of their respective covenants, agreements
and obligations pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement.

6.13 Notification of Certain Matters.

(a) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII and the Effective Time, the Company
shall give prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub upon becoming aware that any
representation or warranty made by it in this Agreement has become untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect, or of any failure of the Company to comply
with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement
to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in any such case
if and only to the extent that such untruth or inaccuracy, or such failure,
would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions to the obligations
of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions set forth in Section
2.2(b)(i) and Section 2.2(b)(ii) to fail to be satisfied; provided that no
such notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement or the conditions to the
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions or the
remedies available to the Parties hereunder; and provided further that the
terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any
information provided to Parent pursuant to this Section 6.13(a). Except as
otherwise provided in any notice pursuant to this Section 6.13(a), the 

delivery of any such notice shall not be deemed an admission or an
acknowledgement that such notice is required and shall not limit or otherwise
affect the remedies available hereunder to the Party receiving such notice.

(b) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII and the Effective Time, Parent shall
give prompt notice to the Company upon becoming aware that any representation
or warranty made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement has become untrue
or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any failure of it to comply with
or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in any such case if and
only to the extent that such untruth or inaccuracy, or such failure, would
reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions to the obligations of
the Company to consummate the Transactions (including the Merger) set forth in
Section 2.2(c)(i) and Section 2.2(c)(ii) to fail to be satisfied; provided,
however, that no such notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement
or the conditions to the obligations of the Company to consummate the
Transactions or the remedies available to the Parties hereunder; and provided
further that the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall
apply to any information provided to the Company pursuant to this Section
6.13(b). Except as otherwise provided in any notice pursuant to this Section
6.13(b), the delivery of any such notice shall not be deemed an admission or
an acknowledgement that such notice is required and shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the Party receiving such
notice.

6.14 Certain Litigation. The Company shall promptly advise and notify Parent
of any litigation commenced or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened,
after the date hereof against the Company or any of its directors (in their
capacity as such) by any Company Stockholders (on their own behalf or on
behalf of the Company) relating to this Agreement or the Transactions. The
Company shall (i) give Parent the opportunity to consult with the Company
regarding the defense or settlement of any such stockholder litigation, (ii)
give Parent the opportunity to participate in the Company's defense or
settlement of any such stockholder litigation, (iii) consider in good faith
Parent's views with respect to such stockholder litigation and (iv) not agree
to settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise any such stockholder
litigation without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed).

6.15 Parent Vote. Immediately following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Parent shall cause the sole stockholder of Merger Sub to execute
and deliver to Merger Sub and the Company a written consent approving the
Merger in accordance with the DGCL.

6.16 Delisting. Each of the Parties agrees to cooperate with each other in
taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to delist the Company
Common Stock from NASDAQ 

Stock Market and terminate registration under the Exchange Act, provided that
such delisting and termination shall not be effective until or after the
Effective Time.

ARTICLE VII 

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

7.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Effective Time (with any termination by Parent also being an effective
termination by Merger Sub), whether before or after receipt of the Requisite
Stockholder Approval (except as provided herein), only as follows:

(a) by mutual written agreement of Parent and the Company; or

(b) by either Parent or the Company, if the Effective Time shall not have
occurred on or before January 11, 2020 (the "Termination Date"); provided,
however, that if the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 2.2(a)(ii),
Section 2.2(a)(iii), Section 2.2(a)(iv) have not been satisfied or waived on
or prior to such date but all other conditions to Closing set forth in ARTICLE
II have been satisfied or waived (except for those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing), the Termination Date may be
extended by either Party to a date not beyond April 11, 2020, and such date,
as so extended, shall be the "Termination Date" provided, further, that the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b) shall not be
available to any Party whose action or failure to fulfill any obligation under
this Agreement has been the principal cause of or directly resulted in the
failure of the Effective Time to have occurred on or before the Termination
Date and such action or failure to act constitutes a material breach of this
Agreement; or

(c) by either Parent or the Company, if the Requisite Stockholder Approval
shall not have been obtained at the Company Stockholder Meeting or at any
adjournment or postponement thereof; or

(d) by either Parent or the Company, if any Legal Restraint having the effect
set forth in Section 2.2(a)(iii) shall be in effect and shall have permanently
restrained, enjoined or otherwise prohibited consummation of the Merger or
shall have become final and non-appealable; provided that the Party seeking to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(d) did not breach in any
material respect any provision of this Agreement which breach was the
principal cause of, or directly resulted in, the issuance of such Legal
Restraint; or

(e) by the Company in the event (i) of a breach of any covenant or agreement
on the part of Guarantor, Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement,
(ii) that any of the representations and warranties of Guarantor, Parent and
Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement 

shall have been inaccurate when made or shall have become inaccurate, in
either case of clause (i) and (ii) such that the conditions set forth in
Section 2.2(c)(i) or Section 2.2(c)(ii) would not be satisfied as of the time
of such breach or as of the time such representation or warranty shall have
become inaccurate; provided, however, notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that such breach by Guarantor, Parent or Merger Sub or such inaccuracies
in the representations and warranties of Guarantor, Parent or Merger Sub are
curable by Guarantor, Parent or Merger Sub, then the Company shall not be
permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(e) until
the earlier to occur of (A) thirty (30) calendar days after delivery of
written notice from the Company to Guarantor and Parent of such breach or
inaccuracy, as applicable and (B) three (3) Business Days prior to the
Termination Date (it being understood that the Company may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(e) if such breach or inaccuracy by
Guarantor, Parent or Merger Sub is cured within such period); provided,
further, the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant this Section
7.1(e) if it is then in material breach of any covenant contained in this
Agreement or if at the time of such termination, any representation or
warranty of the Company shall have become inaccurate such that the conditions
set forth in Section 2.2(b)(i) or Section 2.2(b)(ii) would not be satisfied as
of such time; or

(f) by the Company at any time prior to the time the Requisite Stockholder
Approval is obtained, in the event that (i) the Company shall have received a
Superior Proposal; (ii) the Company Board and/or any authorized committee
thereof shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel) that the failure to enter into a definitive agreement relating
to such Superior Proposal would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties; (iii) the Company shall have delivered a Superior
Proposal Notice (it being agreed that the Superior Proposal Notice and any
amendment or update to such notice and the determination to so deliver such
notice, or update or amend public disclosures with respect thereto shall not
constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change for purposes of this
Agreement); (iv) if requested by Parent, the Company and its Representatives
shall discuss and negotiate in good faith with Parent's Representatives
regarding any bona fide proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement during the period beginning at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the
day of delivery by the Company to Parent of such Superior Proposal Notice and
ending at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the fourth (4th) Business Day following
the day of such delivery so that the Acquisition Proposal that is the subject
of the foregoing notice is no longer a Superior Proposal (it being understood
and agreed that with respect to any material amendment to any Acquisition
Proposal that is the subject of a previously delivered Superior Proposal
Notice, the Company shall have given Parent another notice based on such
Acquisition Proposal, as so amended (a "Proposal Amendment Notice"), and if
requested by Parent, the Company and its Representatives shall discuss and
negotiate with Parent's Representatives any bona fide proposed modifications
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement during the period beginning at
5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the day of delivery by the Company to Parent of such
Proposal Amendment Notice and ending at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the third
(3rd) 

Business Day following the day of such delivery); (v) the Company Board shall
have determined in good faith, after considering the results of such
negotiations and giving effect to any proposals, amendments and modifications
made in writing by Guarantor and Parent that would be binding on Guarantor and
Parent if executed by the Company, and after consultation with the Company's
financial advisors and legal advisors, that the Superior Proposal giving rise
to such Superior Proposal Notice (or Proposal Amendment Notice) continues to
be a Superior Proposal; and (vi) concurrently with the termination of this
Agreement, the Company pays Parent the Company Termination Fee payable to
Parent pursuant to Section 7.3(b)(ii); or

(g) by Parent in the event (i) of a breach of any covenant or agreement on the
part of the Company set forth in this Agreement or (ii) that any of the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement
shall have been inaccurate when made or shall have become inaccurate, in
either case such that the conditions set forth in Section 2.2(b)(i), Section
2.2(b)(ii) or Section 2.2(b)(iii) would not be satisfied as of the time of
such breach or as of the time such representation or warranty shall have
become inaccurate; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event that such breach by the Company or such inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the Company are curable by the Company, then
Parent shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 7.1(g) until the earlier to occur of (A) thirty (30) calendar days
after delivery of written notice from Parent to the Company of such breach or
inaccuracy, as applicable and (B) three (3) Business Days prior to the

Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(g) if such breach or inaccuracy by the
Company is cured within such period); provided, further, Parent may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(g) if it is then in
material breach of any covenant contained in this Agreement or if at the time
of such termination, any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub
shall have become inaccurate such that the conditions set forth in Section
2.2(c)(i) or Section 2.2(c)(ii) would not be satisfied as of such time; or

(h) by Parent, in the event that the Company Board or any authorized committee
thereof shall have effected a Company Board Recommendation Change; provided,
however, that Parent's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 7.1(h) in respect of a Company Board Recommendation Change shall
expire twenty (20) Business Days after the first date upon which the Company
makes such Company Board Recommendation Change; or

(i) by either Parent or the Company, if there shall have been a CFIUS
Turndown; provided, however that each Party's right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(i) shall not be available to such Party
until thirty (30) days after the occurrence of a CFIUS Turndown; provided,
further that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
7.1(i) shall not be available to any Party whose action or failure to fulfill
any obligation under this Agreement has been the principal cause of or
directly resulted in the CFIUS Turndown and such action or failure to act
constitutes a material breach of this Agreement. 

7.2 Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination. Any proper and valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1 (other than Section
7.1(a)) shall be effective immediately upon the delivery of written notice of
the terminating Party to the other Party or Parties, as applicable. In the
event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, this
Agreement shall be of no further force or effect without liability of any
Party or Parties, as applicable (or any director, officer, employee,
affiliate, agent or other representative of such Party or Parties) to the
other Party or Parties, as applicable, except (a) for the terms of Section
6.4(g), Section 6.5, this Section 7.2, Section 7.3 and Article VIII, each of
which shall survive the termination of this Agreement and (b) subject to
Section 7.3(d), nothing herein shall relieve any Party or Parties, as
applicable, from any liability or damages (which the Parties acknowledge and
agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of out-of-pocket fees, costs or
expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions) resulting from fraud or
Willful Breach of this Agreement prior to such termination, in which case the
aggrieved Party shall be entitled to all remedies available at law or in
equity (taking into account any Company Termination Fee previously paid by the
Company). In addition to the foregoing, no termination of this Agreement shall
affect the obligations of the Parties set forth in the Confidentiality
Agreement, all of which obligations shall survive termination of this
Agreement in accordance with their terms and remain fully enforceable in
accordance with their respective terms.

7.3 Fees and Expenses.

(a) General. Subject to Section 6.4(g) and except as set forth in this Section
7.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions shall be paid by the Party or Parties, as applicable, incurring
such expenses whether or not the Merger is consummated. For the avoidance of
doubt, Parent shall pay (or caused to be paid) all of the filing fees payable
pursuant to the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws and filings to obtain
CFIUS Clearance, and the Company shall not be required to pay any fees or
other payments to any Governmental Authority in connection with any filings
under the HSR Act or such other filings as may be required under applicable
Antitrust Laws, foreign investment, national security or similar Laws in
connection with the Transactions.

(b) Payments.

(i) The Company shall pay to Parent (or its designee) a fee equal to
$207,000,000.00 (the "Company Termination Fee"), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by
Parent, within two (2) Business Days, in the event that: (A) this Agreement is
validly terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or
Section 7.1(c); (B) following the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
prior to the time at which a vote is taken on the adoption of this Agreement
at the Company Stockholder Meeting (or an adjournment or postponement
thereof), a Competing Acquisition Transaction shall have been publicly
announced or shall 

have become publicly disclosed and, in either case, shall not have been
withdrawn or otherwise abandoned; and (C) within twelve (12) months following
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or Section
7.1(c), a Competing Acquisition Transaction referenced in the preceding clause
(B) is consummated or a binding definitive agreement for such Competing
Acquisition Transaction shall be entered into by the Company within such
12-month period and such Competing Acquisition Transaction shall subsequently
be consummated. For purposes of the foregoing, a "Competing Acquisition
Transaction" shall have the same meaning as an "Acquisition Transaction"
except that all references therein to "more than twenty percent (20%)" shall
be deemed to be references to "a majority."

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated by the Company
pursuant to Section 7.1(f), then as a condition to such termination of this
Agreement, the Company shall pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Parent.

(iii) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent
pursuant to Section 7.1(h), the Company shall pay to Parent the Company
Termination Fee, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
or accounts designated in writing by Parent, within two (2) Business Days
after demand by Parent.

(c) Single Payment Only. The Parties acknowledge and hereby agree that in no
event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more
than one occasion.

(d) Liquidated Damages. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledges and agrees that (i) the agreements contained in this Section 7.3
are an integral part of the Transactions, (ii) damages resulting from
termination of this Agreement under circumstances where a Company Termination
Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and
therefore, the Company Termination is not a penalty, but the Company
Termination Fee constitutes liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that
will compensate Parent in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for
the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, (iii) in the event that
Parent shall receive the Company Termination Fee, none of Parent, Merger Sub,
any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to
bring or maintain any other claim, action or proceeding against the Company or
any of its Affiliates arising out of this Agreement, any of the Transactions
or any matters forming the basis of the termination of this Agreement
triggering the payment of such Termination Fee, except for claims for any
liability or damages to the extent proven, resulting from or arising out of
any fraud or any pre-termination 

Willful Breach pursuant to Section 7.2 and (iv) without these agreements,
neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement;
accordingly, if Company fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this
Section 7.3 and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a Legal
Proceeding that results in a judgment against the Company for the payment of
any amount set forth in this Section 7.3 or any portion thereof, the Company
shall pay Parent its out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and costs) in connection with such Legal Proceeding, together
with interest on such amount or portion thereof at the annual rate of five
percent (5%) plus the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the date that
such payment or portion thereof was required to be made through the date that
such payment or portion thereof was actually received, or a lesser rate that
is the maximum permitted by applicable Law.

7.4 Amendment. Subject to applicable Law and subject to the other provisions
of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented by
the Parties at any time prior to the Effective Time by execution of an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company; provided, however, that in the event that this Agreement has been
approved by Company Stockholders in accordance with Delaware Law, no amendment
shall be made to this Agreement that requires the approval of such
stockholders of the Company without such approval.

7.5 Extension; Waiver. At any time and from time to time prior to the
Effective Time, either the Company, on the one hand, or Guarantor, Parent and
Merger Sub, on the other hand, may, to the extent permitted by Law and except
as otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of the other Party or Parties, as applicable,
(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made by the
other Party or Parties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for
their respective benefit contained herein. No extension of waiver by the
Company shall require the approval of the Company Stockholders unless such
approval is required by Law. Any agreement on the part of Parent, Merger Sub
or the Company to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of Parent or the Company,
as applicable. No failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in
exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement or applicable
Law shall operate as a waiver of such rights nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right,
power or privilege hereunder (except as otherwise specifically set forth
herein).

statute) and to any section of any statute or regulation include any successor
to such section, except that, for purposes of any representations or
warranties in this Agreement that are made as of a specific date, references
to any such statute or regulation (and, in the case of any statute, include
any rules and regulations promulgated under such statute) will be deemed to
refer to such statute or regulation (and, in the case of any statute, include

8.5 Assignment. Except as may be required to satisfy the obligations

of its rights or interests or obligations hereunder, in whole or part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, without the prior written approval of the other
Parties and any attempted or purported assignment or delegation in violation
of this Section 8.5 shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

8.6 Confidentiality. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby acknowledge
that Guarantor and the Company have previously executed a Confidentiality
Agreement, made as of March 11, 2019 (as the same may have been amended, the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), which will continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms.

8.7 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and
other agreements among the Parties as contemplated by or referred to herein,
including the Company Disclosure Letter, the Annexes hereto, and the
Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire agreement among the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior and
contemporaneous agreements, negotiations, representations, warranties and
understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof; provided, however, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
not be superseded, shall survive any termination of this Agreement and shall
continue in full force and effect until the earlier to occur of (a) the
Effective Time and (b) the date on which the Confidentiality Agreement expires
in accordance with its terms or is validly terminated by the parties thereto. 

8.8 No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is not intended to, and shall
not, expressly or impliedly, confer upon any Person (other than the Parties)
any rights or remedies hereunder, except (a) as set forth in or contemplated
by the terms and provisions of Section 6.9, which are intended for the benefit
of the Indemnified Persons referred to therein, and may be enforced by any
such Indemnified Persons and (b) from and after the Effective Time, the rights
of holders of shares of the Company Common Stock and other Company Securities
to receive the Merger Consideration, as set forth in Article I.

8.9 Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable
and the illegality, invalidity or unenforceability of any provisions shall not
affect the legality, validity or enforceability of the other provisions of
this Agreement. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (i) the remainder of
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect, (ii) the application of
such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such
illegality, invalidity or unenforceability and (iii) the Parties will
negotiate reasonably and in good faith agree to replace such illegal, invalid
or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a suitable and equitable
provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other intent and purposes of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision.

8.10 Remedies.Generally. Subject to Sections 7.3(b) through (d), and except as
otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred
upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other
remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise
by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy.

(a) Specific Performance.

(i) The Parties hereby agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or were otherwise breached (and, more specifically, that
immediate and irreparable harm would likewise occur if any of the
Transactions, including the Merger, were not consummated and the Company
Stockholders did not receive the aggregate consideration payable to them in
accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement), and that money damages or other legal remedies would not be an
adequate remedy for any such damages (notwithstanding the termination fees
contemplated hereby). Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and hereby agree
that in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Company, on the
one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, of any of their
respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company,
on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall be
entitled 

to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement by the other (as applicable), and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of the other under this Agreement and to thereafter cause the
Merger and the other Transactions to be consummated.

(ii) The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other
hand hereby agree not to raise any objections to the availability of the
equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement by such Party (or Parties), and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of such Party (or Parties) under this Agreement. Any
Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such injunction or enforcement, and each Party irrevocably
waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or
posting of any such bond or other security. The Parties further agree that (x)
by seeking the remedies provided for in this Section 8.10(b), a Party shall
not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may
be available to a Party under this Agreement (including monetary damages) in
the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the
remedies provided for in this Section 8.10(b) are not available or otherwise
are not granted and (y) nothing set forth in this Section 8.10(b) shall
require any Party to institute any proceeding for (or limit any Party's right
to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this Section
8.10(b) prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under
Article VII (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the
commencement of any Legal Proceeding pursuant to this Section 8.10(b) or
anything set forth in this Section 8.10(b) restrict or limit any Party's right
to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article VII or
pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or
thereafter.

8.11 Governing Law. This Agreement, and all Legal Proceedings arising out of
or relating to this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of
this Agreement or the Transactions, shall be deemed to be made in and in all
respects shall be governed by and interpreted and construed in accordance with
the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law thereof (or any other
jurisdiction) to the extent that such Laws would direct a matter to another
jurisdiction.

8.12 Consent to Jurisdiction. Each of the Parties (a) irrevocably consents to
service and any other process in any Legal Proceeding based upon, arising out
of or relating to this Agreement, the Transactions, or for recognition and
enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof, for and on 

behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance with
Section 8.4; provided that nothing in this Section 8.12 shall affect the right
of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by
applicable Law; (b) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits
itself and its properties and assets in any Legal Proceeding to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if the
Court of Chancery finds that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the
Legal Proceeding, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware (Complex
Commercial Division), or, if subject matter jurisdiction over the matter that
is the subject of the Legal Proceeding is vested exclusively in the federal
courts of the United States of America, the United States District Court for
the District of Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof (the
"Selected Courts"), in connection with any matter based upon, arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, or for recognition and
enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof; (c) agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court; (d) agrees that any Legal Proceeding
based upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions,
or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof, shall
be brought, tried and determined only in the Selected Courts;; and (e) agrees
that it will not bring any Legal Proceeding based upon, arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, or for recognition and
enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof, in any court other than the
Selected Courts. Each Party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and
agrees not to asset, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or
otherwise, in any Legal Proceeding based upon, arising out of or relating to
this this Agreement, the Transactions, or for recognition and enforcement of
any judgment in respect thereof, (i) any claim that is it not personally
subject to the jurisdiction of the Selected Courts for any reason; (ii) that
it or its property is exempt or immune from the jurisdiction of any Selected
Court or from any Legal Proceeding commenced in the Selected Courts (whether
through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment otherwise); and (iii) to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, that (x) the Legal Proceeding in
any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (y) the venue of such
Legal Proceeding is improper or (z) this Agreement, or the subject matter
hereof of thereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts and further
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the benefit of any
defense that would hinder, fetter or delay the levy, execution or collection
of any amount to which the Party is entitled pursuant to the final judgment of
any court having jurisdiction. Each of Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company hereby agrees that (i) service of any process, summons, notice or
document by notice as provided herein shall constitute sufficient service of
process for any Legal Proceeding in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions and the Parties further waive any argument that such service is
insufficient and (ii) a final judgment in any action or proceeding in such
courts as provided above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable Law and subject to such other jurisdiction applicable Law on
exequatur and recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments. Each Party
expressly acknowledges that the foregoing waiver is intended to be irrevocably
under 

the Laws of the State of Delaware and of the United States of America;
provided, however that each such Party's consent to jurisdiction and service
contained in this Section 8.12 is solely for the purpose referred to in this
Section 8.12 and shall not be deemed to be a general submission to said courts
or in the State of Delaware other than for such purposes.

8.13 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF GUARANTOR, PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW ANY AND ALL RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE),
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, CONNECTED WITH, ARISING OUT OF OR OTHERWISE RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY INSTRUMENT OR OTHER DOCUMENT DELIVERED PURSUANT TO THIS
AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY (INCLUDING THE DEBT FINANCING
AND THE FACILITIES AGREEMENT) OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, MERGER SUB OR THE
COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF
(INCLUDING THE DEBT FINANCING AND THE FACILITIES AGREEMENT).

8.14 Disclosure Letter Matters.

(a) The information contained in this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter
and the Parent Disclosure Letter is disclosed solely for purposes of this
Agreement, and no information contained herein or therein will be deemed to be
an admission by any Party to any third Person of any matter whatsoever,
including (i) any violation of Law or breach of Contract, or (ii) that such
information is material or that such information is required to be referred to
or disclosed under this Agreement.

(b) The Parties agree that the disclosure of any item set forth in any
particular section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter or the
Parent Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be an exception to (or, as
applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (i) the representations and
warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the applicable Party that are set
forth in the corresponding Section or subsection of this Agreement, and (ii)
any other representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the
applicable Party that are set forth in this Agreement, but, in the case of
this clause (ii), only if the relevance of that disclosure as an exception to
(or a disclosure for purposes of) such other representations and warranties
(or covenants, as applicable) is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure.

8.15 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
Parties and delivered to each of the other Parties, 

including by email, it being understood that all Parties need not sign the
same counterpart, and unless and until such delivery, this Agreement shall
have no effect and no Party shall have any right or obligation hereunder
(whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other
communication). A signed copy of this Agreement delivered by email or other
means of electronic transmission shall be deemed to have the same legal effect
as delivery of any original signed copy of this Agreement.

Agreement, hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably and as a primary
obligation (and not as surety only) guarantees (the "Guarantor Guaranty") each
and every covenant, agreement and other obligation of Parent and Merger Sub,

covenants, agreements and other obligations hereunder. If Parent or Merger Sub
fails or refuses to pay or perform any such obligations, Guarantor shall

applicable. The Guarantor Guaranty shall terminate and be of no further force
and effect immediately following the Effective Time.

(b) Guarantor represents and warrants to the Company that (i) Guarantor is a

conflict with, or result in the breach of or constitute a default (or an event
which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or
result in the termination of, or accelerate the performance required by, 

or result in a right of termination (or the loss of any benefit) or
acceleration under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, license, contract, agreement or other
instrument or obligation to which Guarantor is a party or by which Guarantor
or any of its properties or assets may be bound, (c) violate or conflict with
any Law or Order applicable to Guarantor or by which any of its properties,
assets, businesses or operations are bound or (d) result in the creation of
any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of the properties or assets of
Guarantor, except in the case of each of clauses (b), (c) and (d) above, as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay the

ANNEX A 

CERTAIN DEFINED TERMS

"Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" means an agreement that is either (i)
in effect as of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or (ii) executed,
delivered and effective after the execution, delivery and effectiveness of
this Agreement, in either case, containing provisions that require any
counterparty thereto (and any of its Representatives described therein) that
receive material non-public information of or with respect to the Company to
keep such information confidential; provided that such confidentiality
provisions are, taken as a whole, no less restrictive to such counterparty
(and any of its Representatives described therein) than the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement are on Guarantor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an
"Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" shall not (x) be required to contain
