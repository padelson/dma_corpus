ARTICLE III  CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES   Section
3.1 Merger Consideration; Conversion and Cancellation of Securities. As of
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder of any shares of Company Stock or capital stock of
Newco:   (a) Capital Stock of Newco. Each issued and outstanding  share of
the capital stock of Newco shall be converted into and become  one fully paid
and nonassessable share of Common Stock, no par value,  of the Surviving
Corporation.   (b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Purchaser-Owned 
Stock. Any shares of Company Stock that are owned by Company as  treasury
stock and any shares that are owned by Purchaser, Newco or any  other wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Purchaser shall be cancelled and  retired and shall cease
to exist and no stock of Purchaser or other  consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor. All shares of  Purchaser Common Stock owned by Company
shall remain unaffected by the  Merger.   (c) Exchange Ratios for Company
Stock. Subject to  Sections 3.3 and 3.4, and other than shares, if any, to be
cancelled in  accordance with Section 3.1(b), each issued and outstanding
share of  Company Stock shall be converted into the right to receive the
number  of validly issued, fully-paid and nonassessable shares of Purchaser 
Common Stock determined as follows:   (i) each issued and outstanding share
of Company  Series A Preferred Stock shall be converted into the right to 
receive the sum of (A) the Series A Preference Number and any  and all
Accumulated Dividends with respect to the Company  Series A Preferred Stock,
plus (B) the Second Tier  Distribution;   (ii) each issued and outstanding
share of Company  Series B Preferred Stock shall be converted into the right
to  receive the sum of (A) the Series B Preference Number and any  and all
Accumulated Dividends with respect to the Company  Series B Preferred Stock,
plus (B) the Second Tier  Distribution, plus (C) the Third Tier Distribution;
and   (iii) each issued and outstanding share of Company  Common Stock
shall be converted into the right to receive the  sum of (A) the Second
Tier    -10-  16   Distribution, plus (B) the Third Tier Distribution,
plus (C)  the Residual Distribution.  The number of shares of Purchaser
Common Stock into which each share of Company Series A Preferred Stock,
Company Series B Preferred Stock and Company Common Stock shall be converted,
as specified above, shall be referred to as the "Series A Exchange Ratio,"
the "Series B Exchange Ratio," and the "Common Stock Exchange Ratio,"
respectively, and collectively, the "Exchange Ratios." The Exchange Ratios
shall be adjusted for any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction
effected between the date hereof and the Effective Time.   Section 3.2
Exchange of Certificates.   (a) Surrender; Delivery. Upon the surrender by a
Company  Shareholder of the certificate or certificates representing the
total  amount of Company Stock owned by such Company Shareholder or the 
delivery of an affidavit of lost certificate pursuant to Section  3.2(d),
together with a duly executed letter of transmittal in a form  as the
Purchaser\'s exchange agent shall reasonably specify, the  Purchaser shall
deliver to such Company Shareholder as soon as  practicable (i) a certificate
representing the number of shares of  Purchaser Common Stock to which such
Company Shareholder is entitled  pursuant to Section 3.1(c), less any
fractional share, and (ii) cash in  lieu of fractional shares in accordance
with Section 3.2(b). The  certificates surrendered to the Purchaser\'s
exchange agent pursuant to  this Section 3.2(a) shall be immediately
cancelled. Until surrendered  as contemplated by this Section 3.2(a), each
such certificate shall be  deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right  to receive upon such surrender, shares of the
Purchaser Common Stock  and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of
Purchaser Common Stock, as  contemplated by this Section 3.2(a).   (b) No
Fractional Shares. No certificates representing  fractional shares of
Purchaser Common Stock shall be issued upon the  surrender for exchange of
certificates formerly representing shares of  Company Stock pursuant to this
Article III; no dividend, stock split or  other change in the capital
structure of Purchaser shall relate to any  fractional security; and such
fractional interests shall not entitle  the owner thereof to vote or to any
rights of a security holder. In  lieu of any such fractional shares, each
holder of Company Stock who  would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a
share of Purchaser  Common Stock upon the surrender of such holder\'s stock
certificates for  exchange will be paid cash upon such surrender calculated
based upon  the Purchaser Share Price. For this purpose, shares of Company
Stock  represented by two or more certificates shall be aggregated, and in
no  event shall any holder be paid a cash amount in respect of one or more 
than one share of Purchaser Common Stock.   (c) Withholding of Tax.
Purchaser will be entitled to  deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant  to Section 3.1(c) and 3.2(b) of this Agreement to
any former holder of  Company Stock such amounts as Purchaser (or any
Affiliate thereof) is  required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such  payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax  law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Purchaser,
such  withheld amounts will be treated for all    -11-  17   purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of  Company Stock
in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was  made by Purchaser.  
(d) Lost Certificates. If any certificate evidencing  Company Stock shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the  making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such  certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by  Purchaser, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable  amount as Purchaser may direct, as indemnity against claims that
may be  made against it with respect to such certificate, Purchaser will
issue  in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate of
Company  Stock a certificate representing the number of shares of Purchaser 
Common Stock to which the holder may be entitled and cash to which the 
holder thereof may be entitled pursuant to Article III.   (e) Closing of
Company Transfer Books. At the Effective  Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and no  transfer of shares of Company Stock shall
thereafter be made. If, after  the Effective Time, certificates representing
shares of Company Stock  are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they
shall be canceled and  exchanged for certificates representing shares of
Purchaser Common  Stock in accordance with this Article III.   Section 3.3
Dissenting Shares.   (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to  the contrary, any shares of Company Stock held by a holder who has 
demanded and perfected appraisal rights for such shares in accordance  with
California Law and who, as of the Effective Time, has not  effectively
withdrawn or lost such appraisal rights ("Dissenting  Shares"), shall not be
converted into or represent a right to receive  Purchaser Common Stock
pursuant to this Section 3.3, but the holder  thereof shall only be entitled
to such rights as are granted by  California Law.   (b) Notwithstanding the
provisions of subsection (a), if  any holder of shares of Company Stock who
demands appraisal of such  shares under California Law shall effectively
withdraw or lose (through  failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to
appraisal, then, as of  the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of
such event, such  holder\'s shares shall automatically be converted into and
represent  only the right to receive Purchaser Common Stock as provided in
Section  3.1 (and subject to the provisions of Section 9.7 hereof), without 
interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate representing such  shares
of the Company Stock.   (c) The Company shall give the Purchaser (i)
prompt  notice of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of
Company  Stock, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments
served  pursuant to California Law and received by the Company and (ii) the 
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with  respect
to demands for appraisal under California Law. The Company  shall not, except
with the prior written consent of the Purchaser,  voluntarily make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal  of Company Stock or offer
to settle or settle any such demands. All  Purchaser Common Stock to be
issued to any Company Shareholders    -12-  18   exercising appraisal
rights (including the escrowed shares) shall be  sold and used for the
payment of the amounts owing to such Company  Shareholders.   Section 3.4
Escrow. On the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall deposit in the escrow
account created by the Escrow Agreement (the "Escrow Account") a number of
shares of Purchaser Common Stock equal to twenty percent (20%) of the number
of shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued to the Sellers in connection
with the Merger (the "Escrow Shares"). The Escrow Shares shall be allocated
among the Sellers, and shall be held for the account of the Sellers, as
specified in Schedule 3.4. Upon surrender by a Seller to the Company of
the certificate or certificates representing the shares of Company Stock
owned by such Sellers in accordance with Section 3.2(a) or delivery of an
affidavit of lost certificate pursuant to Section 3.2(d), Purchaser shall
deliver to such Sellers pursuant to Section 3.2(a) the number of shares of
Purchaser Common Stock to which such Seller is entitled under Section 3.2(a),
less the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be held in the Escrow
Account for the account of such Seller specified in Schedule 3.4, which
deducted shares shall be issued in the name of such Sellers and held in the
Escrow Account as Escrow Shares for the account of such Sellers. The Escrow
Shares shall be held in the Escrow Account and released to the Sellers or
Purchaser in accordance with Section 9.7. Until the Escrow Shares are
released from the Escrow Account in accordance with Section 9.7, (i) the
Escrow Shares may not be transferred, sold, assigned or pledged and (ii)
certificates evidencing the Escrow Shares shall bear a legend indicating that
they are subject to restrictions on transfer pursuant to this Section 3.4.
Until the Escrow Shares held in the Escrow Account for Sellers are released
in accordance with Section 9.7, such Sellers shall be entitled to vote all
such Escrow Shares held in the Escrow Account in such Seller\'s name and to
receive all dividends and distributions in respect of such Escrow Shares.  
Section 3.5 Options. At the Effective Time, all Company Options shall be
assumed by the Purchaser in accordance with Section 6.13 hereof.   Section
3.6 Closing. The Closing will take place at the offices of King and Spalding,
191 Peachtree Street, Atlanta, Georgia, at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be

referred to therein), or on such other date, place or time as the Parties may
agree. At the conclusion of the Closing on the Closing Date, the Parties will

State of California.   ARTICLE IV  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF

being conducted and is duly qualified or registered as a foreign corporation
to transact business under the laws of each jurisdiction where the character

correct and complete copies of the charter documents of the Company as
currently in effect and the corporate record books of the Company with
respect to actions taken by its shareholders and directors. Schedule 4.1

connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(collectively, the "Company Ancillary Documents") and to perform its or his
obligations under this Agreement and such Company Ancillary Documents and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Company Ancillary Documents
by the Company and the performance by the Company of its obligations
hereunder and thereunder and the consummation of the transactions provided
for herein and therein have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
action on the part of the Company. This Agreement has been, and the Company
Ancillary Documents will be as of the Closing Date, duly executed and

constitute valid and binding agreements of the Company and the Sellers,
enforceable against them in accordance with their respective terms, subject
to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar laws affecting the
enforceability of creditors\' rights generally, general equitable principles
and the discretion of courts in granting equitable remedies. Each Seller
acting in a fiduciary, representative or corporate capacity has furnished to
the Purchaser a true and correct copy of each and every will, trust,
agreement or other document that establishes or relates to the right, power,
capacity or authority of such Seller to execute, deliver and perform this
Agreement and each Company Ancillary Document to which it is a party and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.   Section 4.3
Capital Stock. Schedule 4.3 hereto accurately and completely sets forth the
capital structure of the Company by listing thereon the number of shares of
capital stock of the Company which are authorized and which are issued and
outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the

Schedule 4.3, (i) there are no outstanding options, warrants, rights, calls,
commitments, conversion rights, rights of exchange, subscriptions, claims of

or been declared but are unpaid on the capital stock of the Company; and (iv)
there are no outstanding or authorized stock appreciation, phantom stock,
stock plans or similar rights with respect to the Company.   Section 4.4
Subsidiaries. The Company has never owned, and does not currently own,
directly or indirectly, any capital stock or other equities, securities or
interests in any other corporation or in any limited liability company,
partnership, joint venture or other association. Each of the
Company\'s Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of
incorporation and is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation
or foreign business entity in each jurisdiction in which its ownership or
lease of property or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification necessary, except for such jurisdictions in which the failure
to be so qualified has not had and will not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Each of the Company\'s Subsidiaries has the requisite corporate power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to
carry on its businesses as they are now being conducted. All outstanding
shares of capital stock of each of the Company\'s Subsidiaries are owned by

subject to preemptive rights and are owned free and clear of all Liens. There
are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, rights, convertible
securities or any other agreements or commitments of any character relating

of the Company obligating any such Subsidiary to issue, deliver or sell, or
cause to be issued, delivered or sold additional shares of its capital stock
or obligating any such Subsidiary to grant, extend or enter into any
subscription, option, warrant, right, convertible security or other similar
agreement or commitment.   Section 4.5 Absence of Restrictions and
Conflicts. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
Company Ancillary Documents, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Company Ancillary Documents and the
fulfillment of and compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the Company Ancillary Documents by the Company and the Sellers do not or
will not (as the case may be), with the passing of time or the giving of
notice or both, violate or conflict with, constitute a breach of or default
under, result in the loss of any material benefit under, permit the
acceleration of any obligation under or create in any party the right to
terminate, modify or cancel, (a) any term or provision of the charter
documents of the Company, (b) except as set forth on Schedule 4.5,
the Company Contracts (as hereinafter defined) or any other contract,
agreement, permit, franchise or license applicable to the Company or the
business of the Company as a going concern (the "Business") or applicable to
the Sellers, (c) any Order of any Court or Governmental Entity to which the
Company or any of the Sellers is a party or by which the Company or any of
the Sellers or any of their respective properties is bound or (d) any Law
applicable to the Company, the Sellers or the Business. No Order or other
authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any Court or
Governmental Entity is required with respect to the Company or any of the
Sellers in connection with the execution, delivery or performance   
-15-  21  of this Agreement or the Company Ancillary Documents or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby except (i) as required
by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the
"HSR Act") and (ii) the filing of an Agreement of Merger with the Secretary

parcels of real property leased by the Company (together with all  fixtures
and improvements thereon, the "Real Property"). The Company  has a valid
leasehold interest in its Real Property, free and clear of  any Liens. All
leases of the Real Property are valid, binding, and in  full force and
effect. The execution, delivery and performance of this  Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby  will not adversely
affect the Real Property. The Company has taken all  necessary action to
maintain the Real Property, except where the  failure to so act is not likely
to have a Company Material Adverse  Effect. No loss or expiration of the Real
Property is pending, or to  the Knowledge of the Company and the Sellers,
threatened (other than by  expiration upon the end of any term).   (c) To
the Knowledge of the Company and the Sellers, no  portion of the Real
Property, or any of the buildings and improvements  located thereon, violates
any Law or Order of any Court or Governmental  Entity, including without
limitation any Environmental Law.   (d) The improvements on the Real
Property are in good  operating condition and in a state of good maintenance
and repair,  ordinary wear and tear excepted, are adequate and suitable for
the  purposes for which they are presently being used. There are no 
condemnation or appropriation or similar proceedings pending or, to the 
Knowledge of the Company and the Sellers, threatened against any of the  Real
Property or the improvements thereon.   Section 4.7 Title to Personal
Property; Related Matters. The Company has good and marketable title to, or a
valid and binding leasehold or license interest in, all of the tangible
personal property and assets of the Company, free and clear of all Liens. All

Company are in good operating condition and in a state of good maintenance
and repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted, are usable in the regular and
ordinary course of business and conform to all Laws applicable thereto, and,

defects or problems with any of such equipment, tangible property or assets.
No Person other than the Company owns any equipment or other tangible
personal property or assets situated on the premises of the Company (other
than leased property) that are necessary to the operation of the Business.
Since March 31, 2001, the Company has not sold, transferred or disposed of
any tangible personal property or assets, other than sales of inventory in
the ordinary course of business. Schedule 4.7 sets forth a true, correct and
complete list and general description of each item of personal property of
the Company having a book value of more than $10,000.    -16-  22

subject to returns in excess of those historically experienced by the
Company.   Section 4.9 Financial Statements. The Company has delivered to
the Purchaser the unaudited balance sheet of the Company at December 31, 2000
and the unaudited statements of income and cash flows of the Company
for twelve-month period then ended, and the unaudited balance sheet of the

Statements, which do not contain footnotes and are subject to normal year-end
adjustments which are not expected to be material in amount) consistently
applied throughout the periods indicated, and such books and records have
been maintained on a basis consistent with the past practice of the Company.
Each of the balance sheets included in such Financial Statements (including
the related notes and schedules) fairly presents the financial position of
the Company as of the date of such balance sheet, and each of the statements
of income and cash flows included in such Financial Statements (including any
related notes and schedules) fairly presents the results of operations and
changes in cash flows, as the case may be, of the Company for the periods set
forth therein, in each case in accordance with GAAP (except as expressly

normal year-end adjustments which are not expected to be material in amount)
consistently applied during the periods involved. Since December 31, 2001,

obligations (whether absolute, contingent or otherwise), which are not
adequately reflected or provided for in the unaudited balance sheet of the
Company at March 31, 2001, except liabilities and obligations that are

operations of the Company, (ii) any damage, destruction, loss or casualty to
property or assets of the Company with a value in excess of $25,000, whether

claims, arbitration, proceedings or investigations pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company and the Sellers, threatened against, relating to or
involving the Company, the Business or the assets or properties of the
Company before any Court or Governmental Entity or other Person. None of such
suits, actions, claims, proceedings or investigations, if finally determined
adversely, are reasonably likely individually or in the aggregate to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company is not subject to any Order of
any Court.   Section 4.13 Compliance with Law. The Company is (and has been
at all times since its inception) in compliance with all applicable Laws,

local, foreign or provincial governments or any administrative or regulatory

Plan or ERISA Affiliate  Plan a "multiemployer pension plan", as defined in

interest of  any of them has or has had an obligation to reimburse another 
employer, either directly or indirectly, including through  indemnification
or otherwise, for making contributions to a  plan that is or was subject to
Title IV of ERISA.   (iii) Each Company Benefit Plan has been  established,
operated and administered in all material  respects in accordance with its
terms and in compliance with  ERISA, the Code and all other applicable laws,
regulations,  orders or other legislative, administrative or judicial

applicable Treasury regulations or IRS  pronouncements in which to apply for
such a letter and make  any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable
determination  as to the qualified status of each such Company Employee
Plan.   (v) No Company Benefit Plan provides medical,  surgical,
hospitalization, death or similar benefits (whether  or not insured) for
current or former employees, directors,  officers, consultants, independent
contractors, contingent  workers or leased employees (or any of their
dependents,  spouses or beneficiaries) of the Company, or any predecessor 
in interest of the Company for periods extending beyond their  retirement or
other termination of service, other than  continuation coverage mandated by
Applicable Employee Benefit  Law and only to the extent required under such
law.   (vi) All contributions or premiums required to be  made by any
Company under the terms of each Company Benefit  Plan or by Applicable

Applicable Benefit Laws and the  terms of the Company Benefit Plan.
Contributions or premiums  will be paid by the Company for the period up to
the Closing  even though not otherwise required to be made until a later 
date.   (vii) No insurance policy or any other contract or  agreement
affecting any Company Benefit Plan requires or  permits a retroactive
increase in premiums or payments due  thereunder. The level of insurance
reserves under each insured  Company Benefit Plan is reasonable and
sufficient to provide  for all incurred but unreported claims.   (viii)

from any Company Benefit  Plan or the trusts or other funding    -23- 
29   media relating thereto, and neither the Company nor any of its  agents

administration of any Company Benefit Plan or  the trusts or other funding
media relating thereto.   (ix) The Company has the right under the terms
of  each Company Benefit Plan and under Applicable Employee  Benefit Law to
amend, revise, merge or terminate such plan (or  its participation in such
plan) or transfer the assets of such  plan to another arrangement, plan or
fund at any time  exclusively by action of the Company, and no additional 
contributions would be required to properly effect such  termination.   (x)
The execution, delivery and performance of,  and consummation of the
transactions contemplated by, this  Agreement will not (1) entitle any
current or former employee,  director, officer, consultant, independent
contractors,  contingent worker or leased employee (or any of their 
dependents, spouses or beneficiaries) of the Company to  severance pay,
unemployment compensation or any other payment,  or (2) accelerate the time
of payment or vesting, or increase  the amount of compensation due any such
employee or officer.  To the extent any payment (or increased payment) is
made by  the Company or vesting is accelerated as a result of the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Section 280G of  the Code will
not operate to deny the Company a deduction for  such payment in its
entirety.   (xi) There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of  the Company
and the Sellers, threatened claims,  investigations, examinations, audits or
other proceedings or  actions by or on behalf of any Company Benefit Plan, by

possesses all of the Licenses that are necessary to enable it to carry on the
Business as presently conducted. All Licenses are valid, binding, and in full
force and effect. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not
adversely affect any License. The Company has taken all necessary action to
maintain each License, except where the failure to so act has not had, and is
not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. No loss or expiration of any License is pending or,
to the Knowledge of the Company and the Sellers, threatened (other than
expiration upon the end of any term).    -31-  37   Section 4.27

kickback or illegal or improper payment to assist the Company in obtaining or
retaining business for, or with, or directing business to, any Person. The
business and operations of the Company have been conducted in compliance with
all applicable Laws, except where the failure to comply has not had, and is
not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.   Section 4.28 Brokers, Finders and Investment
Bankers. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.28, neither the Company, nor any
officers, directors or employees of the Company nor any Affiliate of the
Company, has employed any broker, finder or investment banker or incurred any

facts required to be disclosed on any Schedule to  this Agreement, and notice
of their contents (other than by express  reference on a Schedule) will in no
way limit the obligations of the  Company or the Sellers or the rights of the
Purchaser under this  Agreement.    -32-  38   ARTICLE V

or in any of the Purchaser  Ancillary Documents; or   (c) any fraud,
willful misconduct or bad faith of the  Purchaser in connection with this
Agreement or the Purchaser Ancillary  Documents.  The claims, liabilities,
obligations, losses, costs, expenses, penalties, fines and damages of the
Sellers Indemnified Parties described in this Section 9.2 as to which the
Sellers Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification are hereinafter
collectively referred to as "Sellers Losses."   Section 9.3 Indemnification
Procedure.   (a) Promptly after receipt by a Purchaser Indemnified  Party
or a Sellers Indemnified Party (hereinafter collectively referred  to as an
"Indemnified Party") of notice by a third party (including any  Court or
Governmental Entity) of any complaint or the commencement of  any audit,
investigation, action or proceeding with respect to which  such Indemnified
Party may be entitled to receive payment from the  other Party for any
Purchaser Losses or any Sellers Losses (as the case  may be), such
Indemnified Party will notify the Purchaser or the  Sellers, as the case may
be (the "Indemnifying Party"), promptly  following the Indemnified Party\'s
receipt of such complaint or of    -51-  57   notice of the commencement
of such audit, investigation, action or  proceeding; provided, however, that
the failure to so notify the  Indemnifying Party will relieve the
Indemnifying Party from liability  under this Agreement with respect to such
claim only if, and only to  the extent that, such failure to notify the
Indemnifying Party results  in the forfeiture by the Indemnifying Party of
rights and defenses  otherwise available to the Indemnifying Party with
respect to such  claim. The Indemnifying Party will have the right, upon
written notice  delivered to the Indemnified Party within ten (10) days
thereafter  assuming full responsibility for any Purchaser Losses or Sellers
Losses  (as the case may be) resulting from such audit, investigation,
action  or proceeding, to assume the defense of such audit, investigation, 
action or proceeding, including the employment of counsel reasonably 
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the payment of the fees and 
disbursements of such counsel. In the event, however, that the  Indemnifying
Party declines or fails to assume the defense of the  audit, investigation,
action or proceeding on the terms provided above  or to employ counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party,  in either case within such
ten (10)-day period, then such Indemnified  Party may employ counsel to
represent or defend it in any such audit,  investigation, action or
proceeding and the Indemnifying Party will pay  the reasonable fees and
disbursements of such counsel as incurred;  provided, however, that the
Indemnifying Party will not be required to  pay the fees and disbursements of
more than one (1) counsel for all  Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction in
any single audit,  investigation, action or proceeding. In any audit,
investigation,  action or proceeding with respect to which indemnification is
being  sought hereunder, the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party, 
whichever is not assuming the defense of such action, will have the  right to
participate in such matter and to retain its own counsel at  such Party\'s
own expense. The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified  Party, as the case
may be, will at all times use reasonable efforts to  keep the Indemnifying
Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may  be, reasonably apprised of
the status of the defense of any matter the  defense of which they are
maintaining and to cooperate in good faith  with each other with respect to
the defense of any such matter.   (b) No Indemnified Party may settle or
compromise any  claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to
which  indemnification is being sought hereunder without the prior written 
consent of the Indemnifying Party, unless the Indemnifying Party fails  to
assume and maintain the defense of such claim pursuant to Section  9.3(a). An
Indemnifying Party may not, without the prior written  consent of the
Indemnified Party, settle or compromise any claim or  consent to the entry of
any judgment with respect to which  indemnification is being sought hereunder
unless such settlement,  compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional
release of the  Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such
claim, (ii)  does not contain any admission or statement suggesting any
wrongdoing  or liability on behalf of the Indemnified Party and (iii) does
not  contain any equitable order, judgment or term which in any manner 
affects, restrains or interferes with the business of the Indemnified  Party
or any of the Indemnified Party\'s Affiliates.   (c) In the event an
Indemnified Party claims a right to  payment pursuant to this Agreement, such
Indemnified Party will send  written notice of such claim to the appropriate
Indemnifying Party.  Such notice will specify the basis for such claim.
As    -52-  58   promptly as possible after the Indemnified Party has
given such notice,  such Indemnified Party and the appropriate Indemnifying
Party will  establish the merits and amount of such claim (by mutual
agreement,  litigation, arbitration or otherwise) and, within five (5)
Business  Days of the final determination of the merits and amount of such
claim,  the Indemnifying Party will pay to the Indemnified Party
immediately  available funds in an amount equal to such claim as determined 
hereunder.   Section 9.4 Claims Period. For purposes of this Agreement, a
"Claims Period" shall be the period during which a claim for indemnification
may be asserted under this Agreement by an Indemnified Party. The Claims
Periods under this Agreement with respect to the Purchaser Losses shall begin
on the date hereof and terminate as follows:   (a) with respect to
Purchaser Losses arising under  Section 9.1(a) with respect to any breach or
inaccuracy of any  representation or warranty in Section 4.3, 4.4, or 4.15 or
under  Section 9.1(b) or 9.1(c), the Claims Period shall terminate on the
date  that is two (2) years after the Closing Date; and   (b) with respect
to Purchaser Losses arising under  Section 9.1(a) with respect to any breach
or inaccuracy of any  representation or warranty in Article IV, other than
those specified in  paragraph (a) above, the Claims Period shall terminate on
the date that  is one (1) year after the Closing Date.   The Claims Period
under this Agreement with respect to Sellers  Losses shall begin on the date
hereof and terminate as follows:   (a) with respect to Sellers Losses
arising under Section  9.2(a) with respect to any breach or inaccuracy of any
representation  or warranty in Section 5.5, 5.6 or 5.9, the Claims Period
shall  terminate on the date that is two (2) years after the Closing Date;
and   (b) with respect to Sellers Losses arising under Section  9.2(a) with
respect to any breach or inaccuracy of any representation  or warranty in
Article V, other than those specified in paragraph (a)  above, the Claims
Period shall terminate on the date that is one (1)  year after the Closing
Date.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to the close of business
on the last day of the applicable Claims Period, an Indemnifying Party shall
have been properly notified of a claim for indemnity hereunder and such claim
shall not have been finally resolved or disposed of at such date, such claim
shall continue to survive and shall remain a basis for indemnity hereunder
until such claim is finally resolved or disposed of in accordance with the
terms hereof.   Section 9.5 Indemnity Basket. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth herein, the Indemnified Parties shall not make a claim
against the Indemnifying Parties for indemnification under this Article IX
for Purchaser Losses or Sellers Losses (as the case may be) (collectively,
"Losses") unless and until the aggregate amount of such Losses exceeds
$300,000 (the "Basket"), in which event the Indemnified Parties may claim
indemnification for all such Losses, including the initial $300,000; provided
that the Basket (i) shall not apply to any Losses of the Indemnified Parties
arising out of or relating to any fraud (including without limitation
noncompliance with the anti-fraud provisions under state or federal
securities laws), intentional    -53-  59  breach, willful misconduct or
bad faith of the Indemnified Parties and (ii) shall not apply to any
liability of the Company for a breach by the Company of its obligations under
Section 8.4.   Section 9.6 Investigations. The respective representations
and warranties of the Parties contained in this Agreement or in any
certificate or other document delivered by any Party prior to the Closing and
the rights to indemnification set forth in this Article IX will not be deemed
waived or otherwise affected by any investigation made by a Party to this
Agreement.   Section 9.7 Liability Limit; Exclusive Remedy.   (a) The
Escrow Shares held in the Escrow Account shall be held as security for, and
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy with respect to, the obligations of
the Sellers to indemnify Purchaser Parties for any Purchaser Losses pursuant
to this Article IX or otherwise. In the event that the Sellers as an
Indemnified Party shall have any liability for indemnification for Purchaser
Losses under this Article IX or otherwise, the sole satisfaction of such
liability shall be the Escrow Shares and the Sellers shall not have
any liability under this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
other than for indemnification pursuant to this Article IX and the Escrow
Agreement regardless of whether such liability arises under contract, tort or
otherwise. In no event shall any of the Sellers have any liability in excess
of the Purchaser Common Stock held for the account of such Seller in the
Escrow Account valued at the Purchaser Stock Price; provided, however, that
nothing in this Agreement shall limit the liability of Sellers for Purchaser
Losses arising from any fraud (including without limitation noncompliance
with the anti-fraud provisions under state or federal securities laws),
intentional breach, willful misconduct or bad faith of the Seller to the
extent such Seller knowingly participated in such fraud, intentional breach,
willful misconduct or bad faith. The Escrow Shares shall be held in the
Escrow Account and released to the Sellers or Purchaser in accordance with
the Escrow Agreement. Nothing in this Section 9.7(b) shall limit the
liability of the Company for a breach by the Company of its obligations under
Section 8.4.   (b) The sole and exclusive remedy of the Sellers
Indemnified Parties for any Sellers Losses shall be pursuant to this Article
IX, and the Purchaser and Newco shall not have any liability for Sellers
Losses or otherwise other than for indemnification pursuant to this Article
IX regardless of whether such liability arises under contract, tort or
otherwise. In no event shall the Purchaser and Newco have any liability for
Sellers Losses under this Article IX in excess of an aggregate amount equal
to the value, determined on the Closing Date, of the Purchaser Common Stock
in the Escrow Account valued at the Purchaser Stock Price; provided, however,
that nothing in this Agreement shall limit the liability of the Purchaser and
Newco for Sellers Losses arising from any fraud (including without limitation
noncompliance with the anti-fraud provisions under state or federal
securities laws), intentional breach, willful misconduct or bad faith of the
Purchaser or Newco to the extent the Purchaser or Newco knowingly
participated in such fraud, intentional breach, willful misconduct or bad
faith.   ARTICLE X  MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS   Section 10.1 Notices. All

Section 10.7 Consent to Jurisdiction, Etc. Each of the Parties
hereby irrevocably consents and agrees that any action, suit or proceeding
arising in connection with any disagreement, dispute, controversy or claim
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any related document (for
purposes of this Section, a "Legal Dispute") shall be brought only to
the    -56-  62  exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of the State of

or any other Legal Dispute, including, without limitation, any counterclaim,
cross-claim or interpleader, shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction

unenforceable in any respect.   Section 10.9 Counterparts. This Agreement

covenant, agreement, obligation, condition, representation or warranty will

performance of any act will not constitute a waiver of the performance of any
other act or an identical act required to be performed at a later time.
