AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, CONVERSION AND SHARE EXCHANGE

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, CONVERSION AND SHARE EXCHANGE, dated as of

LIMITED, a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (" _ARCH BVI_
"), and CAPITAL ALLY INVESTMENTS LIMITED, a company incorporated in the
British Virgin Islands (" _Capital Ally_ "). Each of Arch BVI and Capital Ally
are sometimes referred to herein as a " _Pypo Shareholder_ ," and
collectively as the " _Pypo Shareholders_." Each of Pypo PRC, Pypo HK, Pypo
Cayman, Arch BVI and Capital Ally is sometimes individually referred to herein
as a " _Pypo Party_ ," and collectively as the " _Pypo Parties_." Each of the
Parties to this Agreement is individually referred to herein as a " _Party_ "
and collectively as the " _Parties_." Capitalized terms used herein that
are not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in
_Annex A_ hereto.

BACKGROUND

Middle Kingdom has formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, MK Arizona, solely for
the purposes of (1) the merger of Middle Kingdom with and into MK Arizona
pursuant to Section 253 of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), in which MK Arizona will be the surviving
corporation (the " _Merger"_ ), (2) the subsequent conversion of MK Arizona
into a Cayman Islands company by a transfer of domicile pursuant to Section
10-226 of the Arizona Revised Statutes (the " _ARS_ "), (3) the registration
and continuation of MK Arizona as a Cayman Islands company pursuant to
Section 221 of the Cayman Companies Law (the " _Conversion_ ") and (4) the
Share Exchange (as defined below). The Cayman Islands company will be named
[Pypo China Holdings Limited] or such other name as approved by the Pypo
Parties (" _MK Cayman_ ," and together with Middle Kingdom and MK Arizona, the
" _Middle Kingdom Parties_ "). Certain beneficial owners of Capital Ally
(the " _Management Shareholders")_ are listed on _Schedule A_ of this
Agreement.

The boards of directors of each of Middle Kingdom and MK Arizona have
declared this Agreement advisable and approved the Transactions, and the board
of directors of Middle Kingdom has adopted resolutions approving the Merger
and providing that (i) each share of Common Stock and each share of Class B
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time (as
defined below) (together with the Common Stock, the " _Middle Kingdom Shares_
"), will be automatically converted at the Merger Effective Time into one
share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of MK Arizona (" _MK
Arizona Common Stock_ ") and one share of class B common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of MK Arizona (the " _MK Arizona Class B Common Stock_ ,"
and together with the MK Arizona Common Stock, the " _MK Arizona Shares_ "),
respectively; and (ii) all Class A Warrants, Class B Warrants, Underwriters
Purchase Option and other rights to purchase a Middle Kingdom Share (the "
_Middle Kingdom Stock Rights_ ," and together with the Middle Kingdom Shares,
the " _Middle Kingdom Securities_ ") will be exchanged at the
Merger Effective Time for substantially equivalent securities of MK Arizona
on an equivalent basis (the " _MK Arizona Stock Rights_ ," and together with
the MK Arizona Shares, the " _MK Arizona Securities_ "). 

The board of directors of MK Arizona has approved the Conversion, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby upon
the Conversion Effective Time, each outstanding MK Arizona Share will be
automatically converted into one ordinary share, par value $0.001 per share,
of MK Cayman (the " _MK Cayman Shares_ ") and each MK Arizona Stock Right
will be automatically converted into  



 

1 ##### Table of Contents

  

 equivalent securities of MK Cayman (the " _MK Cayman Stock Rights_ ," and
together with the MK Cayman Shares, the " _MK Cayman Securities_ ").

Pypo Cayman, through Pypo HK and Pypo PRC, owns and operates its business. The
Pypo Shareholders are the direct owners of all of the outstanding capital
stock of Pypo Cayman (all such shares of capital stock are referred to as the
" _Pypo Shares_ ").

The board of directors of MK Arizona has approved the acquisition of the Pypo
Shares from the Pypo Shareholders through a share exchange transaction (the "
_Share Exchange_ ") pursuant to which MK Cayman will issue to the Pypo
Shareholders up to 68,000,000 MK Cayman Shares and 3,400,000 MK Cayman Class B
Warrants in exchange for the Pypo Shares.

The Merger and the Conversion require the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the issued and outstanding shares of the Common Stock and Class B
Common Stock, voting as a group and the Share Exchange requires the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding
shares of Class B Common Stock cast at the meeting, _provided_ , that the
Share Exchange will only proceed if holders of shares of Class B Common Stock
representing no more than 20% of shares of the Class B Common Stock exercise
their conversion rights (it being understood that such stockholders or
shareholders, as applicable, will be the holders of a majority of the issued
and outstanding MK Arizona Shares that are entitled to vote immediately prior
to the Conversion and the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding
MK Cayman Shares that are entitled to vote immediately prior to the Share
Exchange since the Merger, Conversion and Share Exchange shall happen as close
to simultaneously as permitted by the applicable laws).

The Conversion and the Share Exchange, which will take place immediately after
the Conversion, are part of the same integrated transaction, such that neither
the Conversion nor the Share Exchange shall occur without the other.

AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

_The Merger _

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. At the Merger Effective Time (as defined in Section
1.2), Middle Kingdom will be merged with and into MK Arizona in accordance
with Section 253 of the DGCL and this Agreement, and the separate corporate

hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") will be the
surviving corporation in the Merger. The Merger will have the effects
specified in the DGCL and the ARS.

Section 1.2 _Filing of Certificate of Ownership and Merger; Merger Effective
Time_. As soon as practicable following the satisfaction or, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, waiver of the conditions to the Closing set forth
in Article XIII, if this Agreement shall not have been terminated prior
thereto as provided in Section 15.1, Middle Kingdom and MK Arizona shall cause
(a) a certificate of ownership and merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ")
meeting the requirements of Section 253 of the DGCL to be properly executed
and filed in accordance with the applicable requirements of the DGCL, and (b)
articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") meeting the requirements of
Section 10-1105 of the ARS to be properly executed and filed in accordance
with such section. The Merger shall become effective at the time designated in

the Parties shall have agreed upon and designated (the " _Merger Effective
Time_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties shall designate a time

shall thereupon continue its existence, without interruption, in the
organizational form of a Cayman Islands exempted company rather than an
Arizona corporation. The Conversion shall have the effects specified in the
relevant sections of the ARS and the Cayman Companies Law. The Conversion and
the Share Exchange are part of the same integrated transaction, such that
neither the Conversion nor the Share Exchange shall occur without the other.

Section 2.2 _Registration by Way of Continuation; Conversion Effective Time_.
As soon as practicable following the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, waiver of the conditions to the Closing set forth in
Article XIII, if this Agreement shall not have been terminated prior thereto
as provided in Section 15.1, MK Cayman shall register by way of continuation
as an exempted company under the Cayman Companies Law and file the relevant
documents with the Arizona Corporation Commission in accordance with the
relevant sections of the ARS. The Conversion shall become effective at the
later of (1) the time of issuance by the Cayman Islands of a certificate of
registration by way of continuation as an exempted company with respect to MK
Cayman, and (2) the time of issuance of a certificate recognizing the
Conversion by the Arizona Corporation Commission in accordance with the ARS
(the " _Conversion Effective Time_ ").

ARTICLE IV

_Conversion and Exchange of Securities_

Section 4.1 _Conversion of Stock in the Merger_. At the Merger Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder of any shares:

(a) _Conversion of Middle Kingdom Shares_. Each share of Common Stock and
Class B Common Stock of Middle Kingdom issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be automatically converted into one
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable MK Arizona Common Stock and MK
Arizona Class B Common Stock, respectively, to be delivered by MK Arizona in
accordance with Section 4.3 below.

(b) _Cancellation of MK Arizona Shares Owned by Middle Kingdom_. Each issued
and outstanding share of MK Arizona Common Stock and MK Arizona Class B Common

Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange
therefor.

(c) _Middle Kingdom Stock Rights Become MK Arizona Stock Rights_. All Middle
Kingdom Stock Rights then outstanding shall remain outstanding and shall be
assumed by MK Arizona and thereafter become MK Arizona Stock Rights. Each
Middle Kingdom Stock Right by virtue of becoming a MK Arizona Stock Right
shall be exercisable upon the same terms and conditions as in
effect immediately prior to the Merger, except that upon the exercise of such
MK Arizona Stock Rights, MK Arizona Shares shall be issuable in lieu of Middle

Section 8.8 _Internal Accounting Controls_. Middle Kingdom maintains a system
of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance
that (a) transactions are executed in accordance with managements general or
specific authorizations, (b) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles and to maintain asset accountability, (c) access to
assets is permitted only in accordance with managements general or specific
authorization, and (d) the recorded accountability for assets is compared
with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is
taken with respect to any differences. Middle Kingdoms officers have
established disclosure controls and procedures for Middle Kingdom and
designed such disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material
information relating to Middle Kingdom is made known to the officers by others
within those entities. Middle Kingdoms officers have evaluated
the effectiveness of Middle Kingdoms controls and procedures and there is no
material weakness, significant deficiency or control deficiency, in each case
as such term is defined in Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing
Std. No. 2\. Since March 31, 2008, there have been no significant changes in
Middle Kingdoms internal controls or, to Middle Kingdoms knowledge, in other

Kingdoms fair saleable value of its assets exceeds the amount that will be
required to be paid on or in respect of Middle Kingdoms existing debts and
other liabilities (including known contingent liabilities) as they mature,

carry on its business for the current fiscal year as now conducted and as
proposed to be conducted, including its capital needs taking into account the
particular capital requirements of the business conducted by Middle Kingdom
and projected capital requirements and capital availability thereof,
and (iii) the current cash flow of Middle Kingdom, together with the proceeds
Middle Kingdom would receive, were it to liquidate all of its assets, after
taking into account all anticipated uses of the cash, would be sufficient to
pay all amounts on or in respect of its debt when such amounts are required
to be paid. Middle Kingdom does not intend to incur debts beyond its ability
to pay such debts as they mature (taking into account the timing and amounts
of cash to be payable on or in respect of its debt).

Kingdom Party or any of its Representatives is requested or required to

throughout the periods involved (except as may be otherwise specified in the

_Indemnification_  

Section 14.1 _Survival_. All of the representations and warranties of the
Parties contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing for a period of
twelve (12) months and shall thereafter be of no further force and effect;
_provided, however_ , that (a) the representations and warranties contained in
the first two sentences of Section 7.1(a) and in Sections 7.2, 7.3, 8.1(a),
8.2, and 8.3 (the " _Basic Representations_ ") shall survive the Closing for a
period equal to any applicable statute of limitations, and (b) the
representations and warranties contained in Section 7.14 and 8.24 shall
survive the Closing for a period of three (3) years. All of the covenants and
obligations of the Parties contained in this Agreement shall survive the

during which any representation, warranty, or covenant survives hereunder is
referred to as the " _Survival Period_." Except as expressly provided in this

expiration of the Survival Period.

Section 14.2 _Indemnification by the Pypo Shareholders_.

(a) The Pypo Shareholders shall, subject to the terms hereof, severally (pro
rata in proportion to their pre-Closing percentage ownership of the Pypo
shares) indemnify, defend and hold harmless Middle Kingdom (which term, for
the purposes of this Article XIV shall include any of Middle Kingdoms
successors) and permitted assigns (the " _Middle Kingdom Indemnified Parties_
") from and against any liabilities, loss, claims, damages, fines, penalties,

 representation or warranty made by the Pypo Entities in Article VII hereof
or in any certificate delivered by the Pypo Entities pursuant to this

prior to the Closing; or (iii) any breach by any Pypo Shareholder of its
representations or warranties, covenants or obligations in this Agreement or
in any certificate delivered by the Pypo Shareholders pursuant to this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, the representations,
warranties, covenants and obligations contained in this Agreement that relate
specifically and solely to a particular Pypo Shareholder are the obligations
of that particular Pypo Shareholder only and the other Pypo Shareholder shall
not be responsible therefor.

(b) The amount of any and all Damages suffered by Middle Kingdom Indemnified
Parties shall be paid in cash, or, at the option of the Pypo Shareholders,
may be recovered by delivery of a specified number of MK Cayman Shares owned
by the Pypo Shareholders (the " _Returned Shares_ ") for repurchase by MK
Cayman on terms set forth in this Section 14.2(b). If Middle Kingdom suffers
Damages and Damages are paid by the Pypo Shareholders through the delivery of

Shareholders shall be equal to the aggregate amount of the indemnifiable
Damages agreed to be paid by the Pypo Shareholders, divided by $8.50.

indemnification is to be brought against the Pypo Shareholders on behalf of
or by right of Middle Kingdom, such claim shall be determined and approved by

hold harmless each of the Pypo Parties and their respective successors and

Damages arising from: (i) any breach of any representation or warranty made
by the Middle Kingdom Parties in Article VIII hereof or in any certificate
delivered by Middle Kingdom pursuant to this Agreement; or (ii) any breach by
any Middle Kingdom Party, of its covenants or obligations in this Agreement
to be performed or complied with by such Middle Kingdom Party at or prior to

the Middle Kingdom Indemnified Parties with respect to such matters under
Section 14.2 exceeds $1,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), and then only to the
extent such Damages exceed the Deductible; provided that the aggregate amount
of Damages payable by the Pypo Shareholders to the Middle Kingdom Indemnified
Parties hereunder shall not exceed $10,000,000 (the " _Cap_ ") unless the
Damages arise from or otherwise relate to the breach of any of the Basic
Representations made by the Pypo Parties.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Pypo Parties shall not be liable to, or indemnify the Middle Kingdom
Indemnified Parties for any Damages (i) resulting from any  



 

39 ##### Table of Contents

  

 nonfulfillment or breach of any such representations, warranties, covenants,
and obligations of which the Middle Kingdom Parties had knowledge on or prior
to the Closing Date; or (ii) that are punitive (except to the extent
constituting third party punitive claims), special, consequential, incidental,
exemplary or otherwise not actual damages or (iii) that are in the nature of
lost profits or any diminution in value of property or equity. The Middle
Kingdom Indemnified Parties shall not use "multiple of profits" or "multiple
of cash flow" or any similar valuation methodology in calculating the amount
of any Damages. This Article XIV constitutes the Middle Kingdom Parties sole
and exclusive remedy for any and all Damages or other claims relating to or
arising from this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, no
Pypo Party shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 14.3,
unless and until the aggregate amount of Damages with respect to such matters
under Section 14.3 exceeds the Deductible, and then only to the extent such
Damages exceed the Deductible; provided that the aggregate amount of Damages
payable by Middle Kingdom to the Pypo Party hereunder shall not exceed the Cap
unless the Damages arise from or otherwise relate to the breach of any of the
Basic Representations made by Middle Kingdom.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
Middle Kingdom shall not be liable to, or indemnify any Pypo Party for any
Damages (i) resulting from any nonfulfillment or breach of any such
representations, warranties, covenants, and obligations of which the Pypo
Parties had knowledge on or prior to the Closing Date; (ii) that are
punitive (except to the extent constituting third party punitive claims),
special, consequential, incidental, exemplary or otherwise not actual damages
or (iii) that are in the nature of lost profits or any diminution in value of
property or equity. The Pypo Parties shall not use "multiple of profits" or
"multiple of cash flow" or any similar valuation methodology in calculating
the amount of any Damages. This Article XIV constitutes the Pypo Parties sole
and exclusive remedy for any and all Damages or other claims relating to or
arising from this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 14.5 _Defense of Third Party Claims_. If the Independent Committee
determines to make a claim for indemnification under Section 14.2 or any Pypo
Party makes a claim for indemnification under Section 14.3 (each
as applicable an " _Indemnitee_ "), the Independent Committee or such Pypo
Party as applicable shall notify the indemnifying party (an " _Indemnitor_ ")
of the claim in writing promptly after receiving notice of any action,
lawsuit, proceeding, investigation, demand or other claim against the
Indemnitee (if by a third party), describing the claim, the amount thereof (if
known and quantifiable) and the basis thereof in reasonable detail (such
written notice, an " _Indemnification Notice_ "); provided that the failure
to so notify an Indemnitor shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations
hereunder except to the extent that (and only to the extent that) such failure
shall have caused the damages for which the Indemnitor is obligated to be
greater than such damages would have been had the Indemnitee given the
Indemnitor prompt notice hereunder. Any Indemnitor shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of such action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation
or other claim giving rise to an Indemnitees claim for indemnification at
such Indemnitors expense, and at its option shall be entitled to assume the
defense thereof by appointing a reputable counsel reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnitee to be the lead counsel in connection with such defense;
_provided_ , that the Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of such claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose; 
_provided, however_ , that the fees and expenses of such separate counsel
shall be borne by the Indemnitee and shall not be recoverable from such
Indemnitor under this Article XIV. If the Indemnitor shall control the defense
of any such claim, the Indemnitor shall be entitled to settle such claims;
_provided_ , that the Indemnitor shall obtain the prior written consent of the
Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) before entering into any settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend
such claim if, pursuant to or as a result of such settlement or cessation,
injunctive or other equitable relief will be imposed against the Indemnitee or
if such settlement does not expressly and unconditionally release the
Indemnitee from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such claim. If
the Indemnitor assumes such defense, the Indemnitor shall not be liable for
any amount required to be paid by the Indemnitee that exceeds, where the
Indemnitee has unreasonably withheld or delayed consent in connection with the
proposed compromise or settlement of a third party claim, the amount for which
that third party claim could have been settled pursuant to that
proposed compromise or settlement. In all cases, the Indemnitee shall provide
 



 

40 ##### Table of Contents

  

 its reasonable cooperation with the Indemnitor in defense of claims or
litigation, including by making employees, information and documentation
reasonably available. If the Indemnitor shall not assume the defense of any
such action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim, the Indemnitee
may defend against such matter as it deems appropriate; provided that the
Indemnitee may not settle any such matter without the written consent of the
Indemnitor (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) if the Indemnitee is seeking or will seek indemnification hereunder
with respect to such matter.

Section 14.6 _Determining Damages_. The amount of Damages subject to
indemnification under Section 14.2 or Section 14.3 shall be calculated net of
(i) any Tax Benefit inuring to the Indemnitee on account of such Damages, (ii)
any reserves set forth in any of the Pypo Financial Statements or the Pypo
Interim Financial Statements relating to such Damages and (iii) any insurance
proceeds or other amounts under indemnification agreements received or
receivable by the Indemnitee on account of such Damages. If the Indemnitee
receives a Tax Benefit on account of such Damages after an
indemnification payment is made to it, the Indemnitee shall promptly pay to
the Person or Persons that made such indemnification payment the amount of
such Tax Benefit at such time or times as and to the extent that such Tax
Benefit is realized by the Indemnitee. For purposes hereof, " _Tax Benefit_ "
shall mean any refund of Taxes to be paid or reduction in the amount of Taxes
which otherwise would be paid by the Indemnitee, in each case computed at the
highest marginal tax rates applicable to the recipient of such benefit. To
the extent Damages are recoverable by insurance, the Indemnitees shall take
all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain maximum recovery from such
insurance. In the event that an insurance or other recovery is made by any
Indemnitee with respect to Damages for which any such Person has been
indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the
recovery shall be made promptly to the Person or Persons that provided
such indemnity payments to such Indemnitee. The Indemnitors shall be
subrogated to all rights of the Indemnitees in respect of Damages indemnified
by the Indemnitors. The Indemnitees shall take all commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate all Damages upon and after becoming aware of any event
which could reasonably be expected to give rise to Damages. For Tax purposes,
the Parties agree to treat all payments made under this Article XIV as
adjustments to the consideration received for the Pypo Shares.

Section 14.7 _Right of Setoff_. To the extent that any Party is obligated to
indemnify any other Party after Closing under the provisions of this Article
XIV for Damages reduced to a monetary amount, such Party after Closing shall
have the right to decrease any amount due and owing or to be due and owing
under any agreement with the other Party, whether under this Agreement or any
other agreement between such Parties on the one hand, and any of the other
Party or any of their respective Affiliates, Subsidiaries or controlled
persons or entities on the other.

Section 14.8 _Limitation on Recourse; No Third Party Beneficiaries_.

(a) No claim shall be brought or maintained by any Party or its respective
successors or permitted assigns against any officer, director, partner,
member, agent, representative, Affiliate, equity holder, successor or
permitted assign of any Party which is not otherwise expressly identified as a
Party, and no recourse shall be brought or granted against any of them, by
virtue of or based upon any alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or
breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or obligations of
any Party set forth or contained in this Agreement or any exhibit or schedule
hereto or any certificate delivered hereunder.

(b) Except as set forth in Section 14.3, the provisions of this Article XIV
are for the sole benefit of the Parties and nothing in this Article XIV,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any
legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Article XIV (it being understood that only the Independent
Committee and not Middle Kingdom, any Person acting on its behalf or any other
Person, may exercise any indemnity rights under Section 14.2 or any other
provision of Article XIV).

be made against MK Cayman with respect to the certificates alleged to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed.

provision of state, local, provincial or foreign tax law. To the extent that
any amounts are so withheld all appropriate evidence of such deduction and
withholding, including any receipts or forms required in order for the person
with respect to whom such deduction and withholding occurred to establish the
deduction and withholding and payment to the appropriate authority as being
for its account with the appropriate authorities shall be delivered to the
Person with respect to whom such deduction and withholding has occurred, and
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes as having been
delivered and paid to the Person otherwise entitled to the MK Cayman
Securities in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Middle Kingdom Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Middle Kingdom
Parties, at their option, may require any such amounts required to be deducted
and withheld to be reimbursed in cash to the Middle Kingdom Parties prior to

Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation."

Section 16.8 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse
to any Party (it being understood that if any provision of Section 15.3
hereof is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public
policy, it will be deemed to be a change to the economic and legal substance
of the Transactions that is materially adverse to the Parties and will
entitle either the Pypo Parties or Middle Kingdom to terminate the Agreement
without penalty and none of the Parties and their respective shareholders and
Affiliates will have recourse against any other Parties). Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that Transactions are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

to the other Parties. Facsimile execution and delivery of this Agreement is
legal, valid and binding for all purposes.

Section 16.10 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,
taken together with all Exhibits, Annexes and Schedules hereto (a) constitute
the entire agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the Transactions and
(b) are not intended to confer upon any Person other than the Parties any
rights or remedies.

Section 16.11 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of laws thereof.

Section 16.12 _Dispute Resolution_.

(a) All disputes among the Parties arising out of or relating to this
Agreement will be resolved by mandatory, binding arbitration in accordance
with this Section 16.12.

(b) Before any arbitration is commenced pursuant to this Section 16.12, the
Parties must endeavor to reach an amicable settlement of the dispute through
friendly negotiations.

(c) If no mutually acceptable settlement of the dispute is made within the
sixty (60) days from the commencement of the settlement negotiation or if any
Party refuses to engage in any settlement negotiation, any Party may submit
the dispute for arbitration.

(d) Any arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 16.12 will be conducted
in Hong Kong under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on
International Trade Law by arbitrators appointed in accordance with such
rules. The arbitration and appointing authority will be the Hong Kong
International Arbitration Centre (" _HKIAC_ "). The arbitration will be
conducted by a panel of three arbitrators, one chosen by the Middle Kingdom
Representatives, one chosen by the Pypo Parties and the third chosen by
agreement of the two selected arbitrators; failing agreement within thirty
(30) days prior to commencement of the arbitration proceeding, the HKIAC will
appoint the third arbitrator. The proceedings will be confidential and
conducted in English. The arbitral tribunal will have the authority to grant
any equitable and legal remedies that would be available in any judicial
proceeding instituted to resolve a disputed matter, and its award will be
final and binding on the Parties. The arbitral tribunal will determine how the
Parties will bear the costs of the arbitration. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each Party will have the right at any time to immediately seek
injunctive relief, an award of specific performance or any other equitable
relief against the other Party in any court or other tribunal of
competent jurisdiction. During the pendency of any arbitration or other
proceeding relating to a dispute between the Parties, the Parties will
continue to exercise their remaining respective rights and fulfill their
remaining respective obligations under this Agreement, except with regard to
the matters under dispute.

Section 16.13 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in
whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the Parties
without the prior written consent of the other Parties. Any purported
assignment without such consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding
sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any covenants of Middle
Kingdom hereunder that are to be performed by Middle Kingdom following the
effective date of the Conversion are covenants that will be performed by MK
Cayman as the successor to Middle Kingdom.

Section 16.14 _Governing Language_. This Agreement shall be governed and
interpreted in accordance with the English language.
