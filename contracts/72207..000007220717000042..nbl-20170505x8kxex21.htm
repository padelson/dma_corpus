Agreement, the purchase price payable by Purchaser to Seller for the Acquired
Assets shall equal One Billion Two Hundred Twenty-Five Million Dollars
($1,225,000,000.00) (the "Purchase Price"). The Purchase Price shall consist
of the Fixed Purchase Price and the Earn-Out Payments.

(a) Fixed Purchase Price. The "Fixed Purchase Price" means an aggregate amount
equal to: (a) One Billion One Hundred Twenty-Five Million Dollars
($1,125,000,000.00) (the "Base Fixed Purchase Price"), plus or minus (b) the
net amount of the adjustments under Section 3.3 (as so adjusted, the "Final

preliminarily determined under Section 3.4 pursuant to the Preliminary

Section 3.5 pursuant to the Final Settlement Statement.

(b) Earn-Out Payments. As additional consideration to Seller hereunder, if and

receive from Purchaser additional cash payments in amounts equal to the Earn-
Out Payments, which Earn-Out Payments (each if and to the extent owing) shall
be paid strictly in accordance with this Section 3.1(b). If the average

FERC's Gas Market Report in its first of calendar month publication (a) during
the 2018 calendar year is equal to or exceeds an amount equal to $3.30 per

exceeds an amount equal to $3.30 per dth, then Seller shall be entitled to an
additional cash payment from Purchaser in an amount equal to Thirty-Three
Million Three Hundred Thirty-Three Thousand Three Hundred Thirty-Three and
33/100 Dollars ($33,333,333.33) (the "Earn-Out Payment 2"), and/or (c) the
2020 calendar year is equal to or exceeds an amount equal to $3.30 per dth,

payment from Purchaser in an amount equal to Thirty-Three Million Three
Hundred Thirty-Three Thousand Three Hundred Thirty-Three and 34/100 Dollars
($33,333,333.34) (the "Earn-Out Payment 3" and with Earn-Out Payment 1 and
Earn-Out Payment 2, collectively, the "Earn-Out Payments" and, individually,
each an "Earn-Out Payment"). Each Earn-Out Payment is a separate stand-alone
payment obligation and Seller's entitlement to any Earn-Out Payment is not
contingent upon any other Earn-Out Payment having accrued. Each Earn-Out
Payment owing to Seller hereunder shall be due and payable (i) with respect to
Earn-Out Payment 1, on December 28, 2018; (ii) with respect to Earn-Out
Payment 2, on December 27, 2019; (iii) with respect to Earn-Out Payment 3, on

specified herein, then Purchaser shall pay the costs and expenses (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by Seller in connection with any
Proceeding taken to collect payment of such amount, together with interest on
such unpaid amount at the Applicable Rate, calculated on a daily basis from
the date such amounts were required to be paid until the date of actual
payment. Any disputes between the Parties as to the amount, if any, of an
Earn-Out Payment owed to Seller under this Section 3.1(b) shall be exclusively
resolved through binding dispute resolution by the Accounting Referee in
accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set forth in Sections
3.5(d)-3.5(f), mutatis mutandis. The contingent right of Seller to receive
Earn-Out Payments is solely a contractual right and is not a security for
purposes of any federal or state securities laws.

3.2 Deposit.

(a) Deposit. Within one (1) Business Day following the execution by the
Parties of this Agreement, Purchaser shall pay to Seller by wire transfer in
same day funds an amount in cash equal to Fifty Million Dollars
($50,000,000.00) (the "Deposit") as an earnest money deposit. No interest
shall accrue on the Deposit. If the Closing occurs, then the Deposit shall be
applied towards the Closing Amount under Section 3.4(b). If the Closing does
not occur, then the Deposit shall be released as provided in Section 12.2.

(b) Hedging Deposit. In addition to Purchaser's obligation under Section
3.2(a), within one (1) Business Day following the execution by the Parties of
this Agreement, Purchaser shall pay to Seller by wire transfer in same day
funds an amount in cash equal to Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000.00) (the
"Hedging Deposit") as cash collateral to secure Purchaser's obligations under
Exhibit M. No interest shall accrue on the Hedging Deposit. The Hedging
Deposit shall be retained by Seller and/or returned to Purchaser as and to the
extent provided in the Hedging Solution.

3.3 Adjustments to Fixed Purchase Price. All adjustments to the Fixed Purchase
Price under this Section 3.3 shall be without duplication of other adjustments
under this Section 3.3:

(a) Upward Adjustments. The Base Fixed Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward
by the following:

(i) the amount of all Property Expenses (other than Overhead Costs which are
covered in Section 3.3(a)(iii) below) attributable to the Acquired Assets or
the operation or ownership thereof during the period from and after the

Affiliates on behalf of any Third Party co-owner of any property or asset, a
portion of which 

constitutes an Acquired Asset, provided that no upward adjustment made
pursuant to this Section 3.3(a)(i) shall affect Purchaser's liability with
respect to Assumed Liabilities;

(ii) the amount of all Completion Costs with respect to those Acquired Wells
listed on Schedule 3.3(a)(ii) that are paid by or on behalf of Seller or its
Affiliates (to the extent attributable to periods after October 1, 2016);

the Effective Time up to the Closing Date (pro-rated for partial months),
which represents overhead costs (net to Seller's interests in the Acquired
Assets) attributable to those Acquired Properties operated by Seller or its
Affiliates (the "Overhead Costs");

(iv) the amount of all Property and Production Taxes prorated to Purchaser
under Section 13.1 that are paid or to be paid or otherwise economically borne
by Seller or its Affiliates (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Property and Production Taxes that were withheld or deducted from the gross
amount paid or payable to Seller in connection with a transaction to which
Section 3.3(b)(iii) applies, and therefore were taken into account in
determining the "proceeds received" by Seller for purposes of applying Section
3.3(b)(iii) with respect to such transaction);

(v) the amount of all revenues and proceeds attributable to the Acquired
Assets during the period prior to the Effective Time that are received by
Purchaser or its Affiliates (net of any marketing fees and Royalties in
connection therewith), other than amounts held in suspense for the benefit of
a Third Party;

(vi) an amount equal to all Hydrocarbons attributable to the Acquired
Properties that, at the Effective Time, constitute linefill or that are in
storage tanks, or above the load level connection or within processing plants,
multiplied by the applicable price paid or, if not yet sold, the applicable
price for which the applicable production from the Acquired Properties was
sold most recently prior to the Effective Time; and

(vii) any other amount provided for elsewhere in this Agreement or otherwise
agreed upon by Seller and Purchaser.

(b) Downward Adjustments. The Base Fixed Purchase Price shall be adjusted
downward by the following:

(i) the amount of all pre-Effective Time Property Expenses attributable to the
Acquired Properties or the ownership or operation thereof during the period
prior to the Effective Time that are paid by, but have not been reimbursed to,
Purchaser or its Affiliates;

(ii) the amount of all Property and Production Taxes prorated to Seller under
Section 13.1 that are paid or to be paid or otherwise economically borne by
Purchaser or its Affiliates (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Property and Production Taxes that were withheld or deducted from the gross
amount paid or payable to Purchaser in connection with a transaction to which
Section 3.3(a)(v) applies, and therefore were taken into account in
determining the "proceeds received" by Purchaser for purposes of applying
Section 3.3(a)(v) with respect to such transaction);

(iii) the amount of all revenues and proceeds attributable to the Acquired
Properties during the period from and after the Effective Time that are
received by Seller or its Affiliates (net of any marketing fees and Royalties
in connection therewith), other than amounts held in suspense for the benefit
of a Third Party; 

(iv) any adjustments for Title Defects in accordance with Article V;

(v) any adjustments for Environmental Defects in accordance with Article VI;

(vi) any adjustments for Casualty Loss in accordance with to Section 9.7;

agreed upon by Seller and Purchaser.

(c) Imbalance Adjustments. The Base Fixed Purchase Price shall be further
adjusted upward or downward, as appropriate, by (i) the volume of wellhead
imbalances as of the Effective Time attributable to Seller's interest in the
Acquired Assets, multiplied by $2.30 per MMBtu (upward for underage and
downward for overage); and (ii) the volume of any pipeline or transportation
imbalances as of the Effective Time attributable to Seller's interest in the
Acquired Assets, multiplied by the then current monthly price applicable to
deliveries to the applicable pipeline (upward for over-deliveries and downward
for under-deliveries).

(d) Overpayment Adjustments. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event Seller
or its Affiliates receive an overpayment of proceeds for which Purchaser
receives an adjustment to the Base Fixed Purchase Price under Section 3.3(b)
and Seller is subsequently required to reimburse or otherwise account for such
overpayment to a Third Party, Seller shall be entitled to a reimbursement from
Purchaser of such overpayment amount, which if such amount is known prior to
the issuance of the Final Settlement Statement, shall be reflected as an
adjustment on the Final Settlement Statement.

3.4 Preliminary Settlement Statement; Closing Amount.

(a) Preliminary Settlement Statement. Not less than five (5) Business Days
prior to Closing, Seller shall prepare, in good faith and in accordance with
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and submit to Purchaser
a draft settlement statement (the "Preliminary Settlement Statement") that
shall set forth (i) the Base Fixed Purchase Price, (ii) estimates of the
adjustments under Section 3.3, and (iii) the resulting Closing Amount and
Closing Payment. Within three (3) Business Days of receipt of the Preliminary
Settlement Statement, Purchaser will deliver to Seller a written report
containing all changes with the explanation therefor that Purchaser proposes
to be made to the Preliminary Settlement Statement. The Preliminary Settlement
Statement, as agreed upon by the Parties, will be used to adjust the Base
Fixed Purchase Price at Closing; provided, however, if the Parties do not
agree upon an adjustment set forth in the Preliminary Settlement Statement,
then, absent manifest error, the amount of such adjustment used to adjust the
Base Fixed Purchase Price at Closing shall be that amount set forth by Seller
in the draft Preliminary Settlement Statement delivered by Seller to Purchaser
pursuant to this Section 3.4(a).

(b) Closing Amount. The Base Fixed Purchase Price as increased or decreased
(but not below zero) by the net amount of the estimated upward and downward
adjustments under Section 3.3, as set forth in the Preliminary Settlement
Statement, is referred to herein as the "Closing Amount". At the Closing, an
amount equal to (A) the Closing Amount, minus (B) subject to the terms of
Exhibit M, the sum of the Deposit and the Hedging Deposit, shall be paid by
Purchaser to Seller by federal funds wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Seller to Purchaser
(the "Closing Payment"). 

3.5 Final Settlement Statement; Final Fixed Purchase Price.

(a) Final Settlement Statement. Seller, with the assistance and cooperation of
Purchaser and Purchaser's Entity Representatives (including by means of access
to such Acquired Records and other Purchaser information and records as Seller
reasonably deems necessary or appropriate), shall prepare, in good faith and
in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and
deliver to Purchaser a final settlement statement (the "Final Settlement
Statement") not later than 5:00 p.m., Houston, Texas time on the date that is
one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date (the date on which such
Final Settlement Statement is delivered by Seller, the "Final Settlement
Date"). The Final Settlement Statement will (A) except as otherwise provided
below in this Section 3.5(a) or in Article V, Article VI or Section 13.1(c)
take into account all final adjustments to the Fixed Purchase Price provided
in this Agreement, including each adjustment under Section 3.3 not finally
determined or that was estimated or incorrectly determined at the Closing
pursuant to the Preliminary Settlement Statement, (B) include the final Title
Defect adjustments, if any, and final Interest Addition adjustments, if any,
if such final adjustments have been finally agreed upon by the Parties and/or
determined by the Title Expert on or prior to the Final Settlement Date, (C)
include the final Environmental Defect Adjustment, if any, if such final
adjustment has been finally agreed upon by the Parties or determined by the
Environmental Expert on or prior to the Final Settlement Date, and (D) set
forth a reconciliation of the Closing Amount to the Final Fixed Purchase Price
(less any final adjustments to be determined under Article V, Article VI
and/or Section 13.1(c) after the Final Settlement Date).

(b) Objection Report. As soon as practicable after receipt of Seller's
proposed Final Settlement Statement, but in any case not later than 5:00 p.m.,
Houston, Texas time on the date that is thirty (30) days after receipt of
Seller's proposed Final Settlement Statement (the "Objection Date"), Purchaser
may deliver to Seller a detailed written report (an "Objection Report")
containing: (i) those particular items or amounts in Seller's proposed Final
Settlement Statement as to which Purchaser objects; (ii) the reasons, in
reasonable detail, for each such objection, together with any supporting
documentation available to Purchaser; and (iii) Purchaser's calculation of the
Final Fixed Purchase Price (less any final adjustments to be determined under
Article V, Article VI and/or Section 13.1(c) after the Final Settlement Date).
Any particular amounts or items contained or omitted in Seller's proposed
Final Settlement Statement that are not specifically objected to by Purchaser
in a proper and timely delivered Objection Report shall be deemed accepted by
Purchaser and shall be final, binding, and conclusive on both Parties not
subject to dispute. If Purchaser does not deliver a proper Objection Report by
the Objection Date, then Seller's proposed Final Settlement Statement and
calculation of the Final Fixed Purchase Price (less any final adjustments to
be determined under Article V, Article VI and/or Section 13.1(c) after the
Final Settlement Date) shall be deemed final, binding, and conclusive on both
Parties and not subject to dispute.

(c) Negotiation Period. If an Objection Report is properly and timely
delivered by Purchaser, then Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in good
faith during the twenty (20) Business Day period after such delivery (the
"Negotiation Period") to reach an agreement on the disputed items or amounts
to determine the Final Fixed Purchase Price (less any final adjustments to be
determined under Article V, Article VI and/or Section 13.1(c) after the Final
Settlement Date). If Seller and Purchaser agree as to such Final Fixed
Purchase Price or any particular amount or item thereof that is specifically
objected to in the Objection Report, then Purchaser and Seller shall execute a
written acknowledgement of such agreement, and such Final Fixed Purchase Price
or any amounts or items thereof that are the subject of such agreement, as
applicable, shall be deemed final, binding, and conclusive on both Parties and
not subject to dispute.

(d) Submission to Accounting Referee. If Purchaser and Seller are unable to
agree on the Final Fixed Purchase Price (less any final adjustments to be
determined under Article V, Article VI and/or Section 13.1(c) after the Final
Settlement Date) and all such items or amounts by the expiration of 

the Negotiation Period, then any remaining dispute, controversy, or matters of
difference relating to the Final Settlement Statement or the determination of
the Final Fixed Purchase Price (less any final adjustments to be determined
under Article V, Article VI and/or Section 13.1(c) after the Final Settlement
Date) (collectively, "Final Settlement Disputes") shall be resolved by Grant
Thornton, LLP, or if such firm declines to act in such capacity, by another
nationally recognized firm of independent accountants that does not have a
material relationship with either Party and that is reasonably acceptable to
Seller and Purchaser (the "Accounting Referee"). To the extent necessary,
Seller and Purchaser shall act in good faith to promptly agree on the
Accounting Referee and to execute such engagement letters and other documents
as shall be necessary to engage the Accounting Referee within ten (10)
Business Days after the expiration of the Negotiation Period. The fees and
expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by Seller
and fifty percent (50%) by Purchaser.

(e) Materials to Accounting Referee. Seller and Purchaser shall each present
to the Accounting Referee, with a simultaneous copy to the other Party, a
single written statement of its position on each Final Settlement Dispute,
together with a copy of this Agreement, the Preliminary Closing Statement,
Seller's draft Final Settlement Statement, Purchaser's Objection Report, and
any supporting material that such Party desires to furnish, not later than
fifteen (15) Business Days after appointment of the Accounting Referee. Each
of Seller and Purchaser shall in no event attempt to communicate with the
Accounting Referee with respect to each Final Settlement Dispute without
providing the other Party the opportunity to jointly discuss or confer with
the Accounting Referee with respect to each such Final Settlement Dispute.

(f) Decisions of Accounting Referee. The Accounting Referee shall make its
determination and provide to the Parties written findings within twenty (20)
Business Days after it has received the materials under Section 3.5(e). In
making a determination, the Accounting Referee shall be bound by the terms of
this Agreement and, without any additional or supplemental submittals by
either Party (except as may be specifically requested by the Accounting
Referee), may consider such other accounting and financial standards matters
as in its opinion are necessary or appropriate to make a proper determination.
The decision of the Accounting Referee shall be final, conclusive, binding,
non-appealable and shall be enforceable against any of the Parties in any
court of competent jurisdiction, provided that the Accounting Referee (i)
shall be limited to determining the specific Final Settlement Disputes
submitted to it, (ii) shall set forth a calculation of the Final Fixed
Purchase Price (less any final adjustments to be determined under Article V,
Article VI and/or Section 13.1(c) after the Final Settlement Date) and any
item or component thereof that was not finally determined during or before the
Negotiation Period and a line-item comparison (showing increases and
decreases) to the calculations contained in the Final Settlement Statement and
the Objection Report, together with explanations of each variance, (iii) may
not determine a Final Fixed Purchase Price (less any final adjustments to be
determined under Article V, Article VI and/or Section 13.1(c) after the Final
Settlement Date) that is more than the applicable amount in Seller's draft
Final Settlement Statement or that is less than the applicable amount in
Purchaser's Objection Report, (iv) shall incorporate the final Title Defect
adjustments, if any, and final Interest Addition adjustments, if any, if such
final adjustments have been finally agreed upon by the Parties and/or
determined by the Title Expert on or prior to the Final Settlement Date, and
(v) shall incorporate the final Environmental Defect adjustments, if any, if
such final adjustment has been finally agreed upon by the Parties or
determined by the Environmental Expert on or prior to the Final Settlement
Date. THE ACCOUNTING REFEREE SHALL ACT AS AN EXPERT FOR THE LIMITED PURPOSE OF
DETERMINING THE SPECIFIC FINAL SETTLEMENT STATEMENT MATTERS PRESENTED TO IT,
SHALL NOT HAVE THE POWERS OF AN ARBITRATOR, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE PROCEDURES
SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION, MAY NOT HEAR OR DECIDE ANY MATTERS EXCEPT THE
SPECIFIC FINAL SETTLEMENT STATEMENT MATTERS PRESENTED TO IT AND MAY NOT AWARD
DAMAGES, INTEREST, COSTS, ATTORNEY'S FEES, EXPENSES, OR PENALTIES TO EITHER
PARTY. 

(g) Final Determination Date. The final Fixed Purchase Price, as finally
determined under this Section 3.5, and including any final adjustments thereto
determined under Article V, Article VI and/or Section 13.1(c) after the Final
Settlement Date, shall be deemed final, binding, and conclusive on both
Parties and not subject to dispute (the "Final Fixed Purchase Price"). The
date on which the Final Fixed Purchase Price (less any final adjustments to be
determined thereafter under Article V, Article VI and/or Section 13.1(c))
shall be deemed to have been determined (the "Final Determination Date") shall
be the earliest of: (i) the Objection Date, if Purchaser has not delivered an
Objection Report by the Objection Date; (ii) the date during the Negotiation
Period that Purchaser and Seller have resolved all disputed amounts with
respect to the Final Fixed Purchase Price (less any final adjustments to be
determined under Article V, Article VI and/or Section 13.1(c) after the Final
Settlement Date), if all such disputed amounts are resolved during the
Negotiation Period; and (iii) the date on which the Accounting Referee
delivers its report as to the final determination pursuant to Section 3.5(f),
if submitted to the Accounting Referee.

(h) Cooperation. Seller and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective
Entity Representatives and independent accountants to, cooperate and assist as
requested by the Parties and the Accounting Referee in the preparation of the
Final Settlement Statement and the calculation of the Final Fixed Purchase
Price and in providing access and conducting reviews referred to in this
Section 3.5, including making available to the extent necessary their
respective books, records, work papers, and appropriate personnel.

(i) Payment of Final Fixed Purchase Price. If the Final Fixed Purchase Price
as finally determined under this Section 3.5 (less any final adjustments still
to be determined under Article V, Article VI and/or Section 13.1(c)) is more
than the Closing Amount, then Purchaser shall pay to Seller, within ten (10)
Business Days after the Final Determination Date, the amount of such
difference by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated by Seller. If the Final Fixed Purchase Price as finally
determined under this Section 3.5 (less any final adjustments still to be
determined under Article V, Article VI and/or Section 13.1(c)) is less than
the Closing Amount, then Seller shall pay to Purchaser, within ten (10)
Business Days after the Final Determination Date, the amount of such
difference by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated by Purchaser. For clarity, except as otherwise provided in
Article V, Article VI, or Section 13.1(c) and except for Earn-Out Payments
determined and required to be paid pursuant to Section 3.1(b), thereafter
there shall be no further adjustments to the Purchase Price between the
Parties under this Agreement, including for any Property Expenses.

3.6 Allocation of Fixed Purchase Price. Purchaser and Seller agree that the
Base Fixed Purchase Price shall be allocated among the Acquired Assets as set
forth on Exhibit B. Each Acquired Asset or portion thereof to which a value is
separately allocated on Exhibit B is referred to herein as an "Asset" and such
separate value is referred to herein as the "Allocated Value" of such Asset.
The Parties agree that the Allocated Values set forth on Exhibit B represent
reasonable estimates of the fair market values of the Assets described
therein. Such Allocated Values shall be used in calculating adjustments to the
Fixed Purchase Price as provided herein.

4.1 Due Diligence.

(a) Seller shall provide Purchaser and its Entity Representatives with access
in accordance with this Article IV to the Acquired Assets, including the
Acquired Records and the Acquired Properties of Seller, as well as reasonable
access to Seller's and its Affiliates' employees, to permit Purchaser to

Review"); 

provided, however, such Due Diligence Review and all such access shall be: (A)
subject to the terms and conditions of this Article IV; (B) conducted at
Purchaser's sole risk, cost, and expense; and (C) conducted during Seller's

the contrary, any obligation of Seller under this Agreement to make any such
Acquired Assets, including Acquired Records and Acquired Properties available
to Purchaser shall be: (i) only to the extent that doing so does not violate
any Law or any confidentiality or other obligation under any contract or
agreement of Seller or any of its Affiliates to any Third Party (provided that
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of, or
waiver from, any Third Party to the extent required, but at no out-of-pocket
cost or expense to Seller); and (ii) only to the extent such Acquired Records
or other information are not, in the judgment of Seller or its counsel,
protected by the attorney-client privilege, the work product doctrine, or
other applicable privilege or any such privilege would be likely to be waived,
voided, rendered voidable or destroyed by disclosure to Purchaser or any of
its Entity Representatives (excluding title records).

(c) During all periods that Purchaser or its Entity Representatives or
environmental contractors are on the Acquired Properties or in Seller's
offices to perform the Due Diligence Review, Purchaser shall maintain in
effect, at its sole expense, such policies of insurance of the types and in

offices or onto the Acquired Properties to perform the Due Diligence Review
shall be at Purchaser's sole risk and that none of the Indemnified Seller

of such entry that may occur to any Indemnified Purchaser Parties pursuant to
this Agreement. IN CONNECTION WITH THE GRANTING OF ACCESS TO THE ACQUIRED
ASSETS TO PERFORM THE DUE DILIGENCE REVIEW, PURCHASER HEREBY WAIVES, RELEASES,
AND AGREES TO DEFEND, INDEMNIFY, SAVE, AND HOLD HARMLESS THE INDEMNIFIED
SELLER PARTIES AND THE THIRD PARTY OPERATORS OF THE ACQUIRED PROPERTIES FROM

ANY WAY RELATED TO THE ACCESS AFFORDED TO, OR ANY INVESTIGATIONS, ASSESSMENTS,
OR OTHER DUE DILIGENCE REVIEW ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED BY, ANY INDEMNIFIED
PURCHASER PARTIES OR ANY OF THEIR CONTRACTORS OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES, EVEN
IF SUCH CLAIMS OR LOSSES ARISE OUT OF OR RESULT FROM, SOLELY OR IN PART, THE
SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT, OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, OR OTHER FAULT OR VIOLATION OF LAW OF OR BY ANY INDEMNIFIED SELLER
PARTIES, EXCEPTING ONLY LIABILITIES ACTUALLY RESULTING FROM SELLER'S GROSS
NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT. This Section 4.1(d) shall survive the
Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement indefinitely.

(a) Within five (5) Business Days following the Execution Date, to facilitate
the Due Diligence Review, Seller shall provide Purchaser with access to

Section 4.1, during the period from the Execution Date until the Closing Date
or the earlier termination of this Agreement, Seller shall make physical
copies of the Acquired Records available to Purchaser at the Houston, Texas or
Canonsburg, Pennsylvania offices of Seller during Seller's normal business

the accuracy, completeness, or materiality of any Acquired Records, Background
Materials, or any other information provided by Seller, any of its Affiliates,
or any of its respective Entity Representatives to Purchaser, its Entity
Representatives, or their respective representatives, agents, or attorneys.
Purchaser agrees that any conclusions drawn from its Due Diligence Review or
from the Acquired Records, Background Materials, or any such other information
shall be the result of its own independent review and judgment.

4.3 Access to Acquired Properties.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Article IV and to the extent
permitted at Law or under applicable contracts, during the period from the
Execution Date until the Defect Notice Deadline or the earlier termination of
this Agreement, (i) with respect to all Acquired Properties and Water Assets
in the Covered Areas, in each case, operated by Seller or to which Seller
otherwise has the authority to unilaterally grant access to Purchaser, Seller
shall allow Purchaser to conduct on-site visual inspections of such Acquired
Assets and allow Purchaser to engage a qualified environmental contractor to
conduct an environmental review, including a visual inspection, record
reviews, interviews with applicable Persons, a regulatory compliance review
and a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment in accordance with the American
Society for Testing and Materials (A.S.T.M.) Standard Practice Environmental
Site Assessments: Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Process (Publication
Designation: E1527-05) (collectively, an "Environmental Assessment") of such
Acquired Assets and (ii) with respect to all Acquired Properties as to which
Seller does not have the authority to unilaterally grant access to Purchaser,
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts (at no cost, expense, or
Liability to Seller) to allow Purchaser to conduct on-site visual inspections
of such Acquired Properties and engage a qualified environmental contractor to
conduct an Environmental Assessment of such Acquired Properties; provided,
however, in connection with any such permitted on-site visual inspection or
Environmental Assessment of an Acquired Property, (A) Purchaser shall notify
Seller in writing at least five (5) Business Days prior thereto and coordinate
the conduct thereof with Seller's Entity Representatives (and Seller or its
designee shall have the right to accompany Purchaser and its Entity
Representatives and environmental contractor whenever on site at any Acquired
Property), (B) Purchaser shall, and shall cause all of its Entity
Representatives and environmental contractors to, comply in all material
respects with all applicable Laws and all of Seller's and any applicable Third
Party operator's requirements, rules, and safety policies and procedures, and
(C) any contractor engaged to perform all or any portion of an Environmental
Assessment shall execute and deliver to Seller a confidentiality agreement in
a form reasonably acceptable to Seller.

(b) If, following the conduct of any Environmental Assessment, Purchaser, in
its reasonable discretion based on the findings and results of the
Environmental Assessment, believes that further investigation, sampling or
testing or other invasive investigation is necessary to determine the
existence or magnitude of an Environmental Defect or Environmental Defect
Value, Purchaser shall furnish to Seller for its review a proposed scope of
such sampling, boring, drilling or other invasive investigation activities,
including a reasonable description of such activity and a description of the
approximate locations of any sampling to be conducted. Following the receipt
and review of such proposal by Seller, Seller shall elect, in its reasonable
discretion, to permit or refuse to permit the conduct of any such activities
by Purchaser.

(c) Purchaser agrees to provide to Seller, but in any event not later than
five (5) days after Purchaser's or any of its Entity Representative's receipt
or creation, copies of all final non-privileged reports prepared by
Purchaser's environmental contractors in connection with any Environmental
Assessment of Acquired Properties. None of Purchaser, any other Indemnified
Purchaser Party, Seller or any other Indemnified Seller Party shall be deemed,
by Seller's or any Indemnified Seller Party's receipt of said documents or
otherwise, to have made any representation or warranty, expressed, implied, or 

statutory, as to the condition of the Acquired Properties or to the accuracy
of said documents or the information contained therein.

(d) Upon completion of Purchaser's Due Diligence Review, Purchaser shall, at
its sole cost and expense and without any cost or expense to Seller or its
Affiliates: (i) repair all damage done to the Acquired Properties to the
extent resulting from Purchaser's due diligence and (ii) remove all equipment,
tools, and other property brought onto the Acquired Properties in connection
with Purchaser's due diligence.

(vii) a negative discrepancy between the actual number of Net Mineral Acres of
an Acquired Undeveloped Mineral Fee Interest located in a Specified Designated
Area and Target Formation and the Target NMA for such Acquired Undeveloped
Mineral Fee Interest and Target Formation, then the Title Defect Value shall
be equal to the product of (A) the Allocated Value of such Acquired
Undeveloped Mineral Fee Interests, multiplied by (B) a fraction, the numerator
of which is (1) the Target NMA for such Acquired Undeveloped Mineral Fee
Interests, minus the actual Net Mineral Acres for such Acquired Undeveloped
Mineral Fee Interests to which Seller is entitled after giving effect to such
Title Defect, and the denominator of which is (2) the Target NMA for such
Acquired Undeveloped Mineral Fee Interests; or

(viii) if the Title Defect represents an obligation, Lien upon or other defect
in title to the applicable Acquired Property of a type not described above,
then the Title Defect Value shall be determined by taking into account the
Allocated Value of the applicable Acquired Property, the portion of the
applicable Acquired Property affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of
the Title Defect, the potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the
life of the applicable Acquired Property, the values placed upon the Title
Defect by Purchaser and Seller and such other reasonable factors as are
necessary to make a proper evaluation. 

5.5 Title Defect Notices.

(a) Deadline. As a condition to asserting any claim with respect to any
alleged Title Defect, Purchaser must deliver to Seller a valid written Notice
of Title Defect as to such alleged Title Defect no later than 5:00 p.m.,
Houston, Texas time on June 20, 2017 (the "Defect Notice Deadline").

(b) Notice of Title Defects. On or before the Defect Notice Deadline,
Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a written notice (a "Notice of Title
Defects") that sets forth Title Defects affecting the Acquired Leases,
Acquired Mineral Fee Interests, and/or Acquired Wells that Purchaser desires
to assert under this Agreement and Interest Additions discovered by Purchaser
or of which Purchaser has been notified under Section 5.9. Each Notice of
Title Defects to be valid shall, with respect to each Title Defect or Interest
Addition set forth therein: (i) describe such Title Defect or Interest
Addition and the Assets affected thereby; (ii) describe the basis for the
assertion of such Title Defect or Interest Addition; (iii) in the case of each
Title Defect, describe Purchaser's good faith estimate of the Title Defect
Value with respect to each Acquired Lease, Acquired Mineral Fee Interest,
and/or Acquired Well affected by such Title Defect in accordance with and
subject to the limitations in Section 5.4; (iv) in the case of each Interest
Addition, describe Purchaser's good faith estimate of the value of such
Interest Addition; and (v) include reasonable documentation to establish the
existence and basis of such Title Defect or Interest Addition and Purchaser's
estimate of value included in subpart (iii) or (iv) of this Section 5.5(b).

(c) Preliminary Notice. To give Seller an opportunity to commence reviewing
and curing Title Defects asserted by Purchaser, Purchaser shall give Seller,
on or before the end of every two (2) calendar week period prior to the Defect
Notice Deadline, written notice of all alleged Title Defects discovered by
Purchaser during the preceding two (2) calendar weeks, which notice may be
preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the Defect Notice Deadline;
provided, however, that in no event shall Purchaser's failure to provide such
preliminary notices be deemed a waiver of any remedies or adjustment for Title
Defects available to Purchaser pursuant to this Article V.

5.6 Waiver; Cure; Adjustment; Deductible.

(a) Waiver. Except solely for Purchaser's rights under the special warranty of
title in the Assignment, each and every Title Defect shall be and is hereby
conclusively waived by Purchaser, and Purchaser shall not be entitled to any
remedies or adjustment for such Title Defect, if: (i) Purchaser fails to
provide a valid Notice of Title Defect to Seller of such Title Defect in
accordance with Section 5.5 on or before the Defect Notice Deadline; (ii) the
Title Defect Value with respect to such Title Defect is less than the Title
Defect Threshold; or (iii) the Allocated Value of the Acquired Asset affected
by such Title Defect is less than the Title Defect Threshold.

(b) Cure. Seller shall have the right and option, but not the obligation, to
attempt to cure any Title Defects that are not waived under Section 5.6(a) at
any time on or before the ninetieth (90th) day following the Closing Date (the
"Cure Period"). Seller's election to attempt to cure a Title Defect shall be
without prejudice to its rights under Section 5.10 and shall not constitute an
admission against interest or a waiver of Seller's right to dispute the
existence, nature, or Title Defect Value of such Title Defect. During the
period following the Closing and until the expiration of the Cure Period,
Purchaser shall provide (or cause to be provided) to Seller and its
representatives access to the Acquired Records in connection with Seller's
efforts to cure alleged Title Defects. Each Title Defect that is (i) not
waived under Section 5.6(a), (ii) not cured under this Section 5.6(b) and
(iii) not an Indemnified Title Defect is referred to in this Agreement as a
"Surviving Title Defect". The following shall apply with respect to each Title
Defect that Seller attempts to cure pursuant to this Section 5.6(b): 

(i) At any time prior to Closing, Seller may provide Purchaser written notice
that it will attempt to cure a Title Defect (each, a "Subject Title Defect").
If the Subject Title Defect is cured by Seller prior to Closing, the Acquired
Asset subject to such Subject Title Defect shall be assigned to Purchaser at
Closing, and there shall be no adjustment to the Base Fixed Purchase Price in
respect of such Subject Title Defect. If the Subject Title Defect is not cured
by Seller prior to Closing, (A) the Acquired Assets subject to such Subject
Title Defect (and any associated Acquired Assets to the extent relating
thereto) shall not be conveyed to Purchaser at Closing, (B) the Parties shall
enter into the Escrow Agreement, (C) the Base Fixed Purchase Price shall be
reduced at Closing by the aggregate Allocated Value of such Acquired Assets
(and any such associated Acquired Assets) and such aggregate amount shall be
deposited by Purchaser with the Escrow Agent at Closing in the escrow account
established under the Escrow Agreement (the "Escrow Account"), and (D) Seller
and Purchaser shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a fully executed Assignment or
Mineral Deed, as applicable, of such Acquired Assets (and any such associated
Acquired Assets) (the "Escrowed Assignment").

(ii) The amount deposited into the Escrow Account and the Escrowed Assignment
with respect to a Subject Title Defect will remain therein until released as
provided in this Section 5.6(b)(ii), and any such Title Defect Property shall
be referred to as an "Escrowed Title Defect Property".

(A) During the Cure Period, if Seller and Purchaser mutually agree, in their
reasonable and good faith opinion, that a Subject Title Defect with respect to
an Escrowed Title Defect Property has been completely cured, then Seller and
Purchaser shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to (1) pay to Seller from
the Escrow Account an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Escrowed
Title Defect Property (together with any interest earned thereon) and (2)
deliver to Purchaser the Escrowed Assignment attributable to such Escrowed
Title Defect Property; in each case, in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement.

(B) If, at the end of the Cure Period, Seller and Purchaser mutually agree, in
their reasonable and good faith opinion, that a Subject Title Defect with
respect to an Escrowed Title Defect Property has been partially cured, then,
subject to Section 5.6(a), Section 5.6(b)(ii)(E), and Section 5.8, Seller and
Purchaser shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to (1) pay to Purchaser from
the Escrow Account the portion of the Title Defect Amount attributable to such
Escrowed Title Defect Property attributable to the uncured portion of such
Subject Title Defect (together with interest earned thereon), (2) to pay to
Seller the Allocated Value of such Escrowed Title Defect Property less the
amount distributed to Purchaser pursuant to subpart (B)(1) above (together
with any interest earned thereon) and (3) deliver to Purchaser the Escrowed
Assignment attributable to such Escrowed Title Defect Property; in each case,
in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

(C) If, at the end of the Cure Period, Purchaser and Seller mutually agree, in
their reasonable and good faith opinion, that Seller has been unable to cure a
Subject Title Defect with respect to an Escrowed Title Defect Property, then,
subject to Section 5.6(a), Section 5.6(b)(ii)(E), and Section 5.8, Seller and
Purchaser shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to (1) pay to Purchaser from
the Escrow Account an amount equal to the agreed upon Title Defect Amount
attributable to such Escrowed Title Defect Property (together with any
interest earned thereon), (2) pay to Seller from the Defect Escrow an amount
equal to the Allocated Value of such Escrowed Title Defect Property less the
amount distributed to Purchaser pursuant to subpart(C)(1) above and (3)
deliver to Purchaser the Escrowed Assignment attributable to such Escrowed
Title Defect Property; in each case, in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement.

(D) If at the end of the Cure Period, Purchaser and Seller, in their
reasonable and good faith opinion, have not agreed whether there has been, or
the extent to which there has 

been, a cure of a Subject Title Defect with respect to an Escrowed Title
Defect Property or the extent to which any Party is entitled to any
disbursement from the Escrow Account pursuant to this Section 5.6(b)(ii), then
such disagreement shall be resolved as provided in Section 5.10 and, subject
to Section 5.6(a), Section 5.6(b)(ii)(E), and Section 5.8, following such
determination by the Title Expert, Seller and Purchaser shall jointly instruct
the Escrow Agent to (1) pay the amount owed to Purchaser and/or Seller from
the Escrow Account to the applicable Parties up to an amount equal to the
Allocated Value of the applicable Escrowed Title Defect Property (together
with any interest earned thereon) and (2) deliver to Purchaser the Escrowed
Assignment attributable to such Escrowed Title Defect Property; in each case,
in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

(E) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the Parties have
mutually agreed, in their reasonable and good faith opinion, or the Title
Expert has determined pursuant to Section 5.10 that, following Seller's
attempts to cure, a Subject Title Defect with respect to an Escrowed Title
Defect Property has not been completely cured, Seller may, at its sole option,
elect (in lieu of applying the provision of Section 5.6(b)(ii)(B), Section
5.6(b)(ii)(C) or Section 5.6(b)(ii)(D), as applicable):

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

if Purchaser consents in writing, the remedy set forth in Section 5.7(b), upon
which Seller and Purchaser shall (X) execute the Title Indemnity Agreement and
(Y) jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to (I) pay to Seller from the Escrow
Account an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Escrowed Title Defect
Property (together with any interest earned thereon) and (II) deliver to
Purchaser the Escrowed Assignment attributable to such Escrowed Title Defect
Property; in each case, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement;
or 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

if, and only if, the aggregate Title Defect Amount(s) with respect to any
Title Defect Property equals the Allocated Value of such Title Defect
Property, the remedy set forth in Section 5.7(c), upon which Seller and
Purchaser shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to (X) pay to Purchaser from
the Escrow Account an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Escrowed
Title Defect Property (together with any interest earned thereon) and (Y)
deliver to Seller the Escrowed Assignment attributable to such Escrowed Title
Defect Property; in each case, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement. 

(F) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, all disbursements from
the Escrow Account to Purchaser or Seller with respect to any Escrowed Title
Defect Property assigned to Purchaser shall be subject to further adjustments
in accordance with Section 3.3 (effective as of the Effective Time). To the
extent any additional funds are owed by either Party to the other Party as a
result of such adjustments and were not already accounted for under Section
3.4 or Section 3.5, such additional amounts shall be paid by the applicable
Party to the other Party at the time provided in Section 3.5(i) or within five
days following the applicable disbursement from the Escrow Account to
Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, whichever is later.

5.7 Remedies for Title Defects. Subject to Seller's continuing right to
dispute the existence of a Title Defect and/or the Title Defect Value asserted
with respect thereto and subject to the rights of the Parties pursuant to
Section 12.1(f), in the event that any Title Defect timely asserted by
Purchaser in accordance with Section 5.5(b) is not waived in writing by
Purchaser or waived pursuant to Section 5.6(a) or cured on or before Closing,
then, subject to the Title Defect Threshold and the Title Defect Deductible, 

Seller shall, at its sole option (except with respect to clause (b) below,
which is subject to Purchaser's consent), elect to:

(a) reduce the Purchase Price by the Title Defect Value determined pursuant to
Section 5.4 or Section 5.10;

(b) if, and only if, Purchaser agrees in writing, indemnify Purchaser against
all Liability resulting from such Title Defect with respect to the Acquired
Assets pursuant to an indemnity agreement in form and substance acceptable to
Purchaser, at its sole discretion (each, a "Title Indemnity Agreement" and
such indemnified Title Defect, an "Indemnified Title Defect"); or

(c) if, and only if, the aggregate Title Defect Value(s) with respect to any
Acquired Property equals or exceeds the Allocated Value of such Acquired
Property, retain the entirety of the Acquired Property that is subject to such
Title Defect, together with all associated Acquired Assets, in which event the
Base Fixed Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated
Value of such Acquired Property and such associated Acquired Assets, and such
Acquired Property and such associated Acquired Assets shall be deemed to be
Excluded Assets.

5.8 Limitations on Losses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) in no
event shall there be any adjustments to the Base Fixed Purchase Price or other
remedies provided by Seller for any individual Title Defect for which the
Title Defect Amount does not exceed the Title Defect Threshold; and (ii) in no
event shall there be any adjustments to the Base Fixed Purchase Price or other
remedies provided by Seller for any Title Defect that exceeds the Title Defect
Threshold unless (A) the sum of the Title Defect Values of all such Title
Defects that exceed the Title Defect Threshold (excluding any Title Defects
cured by Seller, waived in writing by Purchaser or waived pursuant to Section
5.6(a)), minus all Interest Additions, exceeds (B) the Title Defect
Deductible, after which point Purchaser shall be entitled to adjustments to
the Base Fixed Purchase Price or other remedies only with respect to such
Title Defects in excess of such Title Defect Deductible. The Parties also
agree as follows:

(a) Attempt to Agree. With respect to each Title Defect that is not an
Indemnified Title Defect and that the Parties do not agree has been waived or
cured under Section 5.6 (each, an "Open Title Defect"), from the receipt by
Seller of Purchaser's Notice of Title Defects until the Closing Date (or, with
respect to Title Defects that are subject to a Post-Closing Curative Election,
until the expiration of the Cure Period) or the earlier acknowledgement of
Purchaser in writing that it is not entitled to a Title Defect adjustment in
respect thereof, Purchaser and Seller shall attempt in good faith to agree on
the existence and associated Title Defect Value of each such Open Title
Defect.

(b) Agreement. If Seller and Purchaser agree on the existence and Title Defect
Value of any such Open Title Defect, then the Title Defect Value for such Open
Title Defect shall be the agreed Title Defect Value for purposes of
determining the Title Defect adjustments, if any. Upon any such agreement,
Seller and Purchaser shall execute a written instrument reflecting such
agreement.

(c) Agreement before Closing. If, before the Closing Date, Seller and
Purchaser agree on the existence and Title Defect Values of any Open Title
Defects (other than those that are the subject of a Post-Closing Curative
Election), then, subject to Section 5.6(b), the amount of the preliminary
Title Defect adjustments (i.e. not taking into account any Title Defects that
are the subject of a Post-Closing Curative Election or any Title Disputed
Matters), if any, shall be deducted from the Base Fixed Purchase Price at the
Closing and shall be reflected in the Closing Amount (which Title Defect
adjustments shall be finalized and, as and to the extent necessary, adjusted
pursuant to the final settlement under Section 3.5 or thereafter (to the
extent determined by the Title Expert following the Final Determination Date),
as 

applicable, in respect of Title Defects that are the subject of a Post-Closing
Curative Election and any Title Disputed Matters).

(d) Failure to Agree. If, before the Closing Date, Seller and Purchaser do not
agree on the existence and Title Defect Values of all Open Title Defects
(other than those that are the subject of a Post-Closing Curative Election),
then (1) the existence and Title Defect Value of such Open Title Defects that
are not agreed (but only those that are not agreed), shall be Title Disputed
Matters settled after Closing by the Title Expert under Section 5.10, and (2)
the following shall apply with respect to each Title Disputed Matter:

(i) (A) The Acquired Assets subject to such Title Disputed Matter shall not be
conveyed to Purchaser at Closing, (B) the Parties shall enter into the Escrow
Agreement, (C) the Base Fixed Purchase Price shall be reduced at Closing by
the aggregate Allocated Value of such Acquired Assets and such aggregate
amount shall be deposited by Purchaser into the Escrow Account, and (D) Seller
and Purchaser shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a fully executed Escrowed
Assignment of such Acquired Assets.

(ii) The amount deposited into the Escrow Account and the Escrowed Assignment
with respect to a Title Disputed Matter will remain therein until released as
provided in Section 5.10(d)

5.9 Interest Additions.

(a) Notice of Interest Additions. If Purchaser or Seller discovers any title
benefits or additional interests in or constituting Acquired Assets that are
not listed in Exhibit A, including any benefit or interest that (i) entitles
Seller to (A) more than the Target NRI for any Acquired Undeveloped Lease
located in a Specified Designated Area or (B) more than the Net Revenue
Interest set forth in Exhibit A-3 for any Acquired Unit, (ii) entitles Seller
to (A) more than the Aggregate Net Mineral Acres for the Acquired Undeveloped
Leases located within a Designated Area that is not a Specified Designated
Area or (B) more than the Target NMA for any Acquired Undeveloped Lease
located within a Specified Designated Area, (iii) entitles Seller to more than
the Net Revenue Interest set forth on Exhibit A-1 or Exhibit A-3, as
applicable, for any Acquired Undeveloped Mineral Fee Interest, (iv) entitles
Seller to (A) more than the Aggregate Net Mineral Acres for the Acquired
Undeveloped Mineral Fee Interests located within a Designated Area that is not
a Specified Designated Area or (B) more than the Target NMA for any Acquired
Undeveloped Mineral Fee Interests located within a Specified Designated Area
(v) obligates Seller to bear costs and expenses in an amount less than the
Working Interest set forth in Exhibit A-3 as to any Acquired Well, or (vi) an
Acquired Lease or Acquired Mineral Fee Interest that is not listed on Exhibit
A-1 or Exhibit A-3 as applicable (each for the foregoing, less and except any
such Net Mineral Acre benefit or Net Revenue Interest benefit affecting any
Acquired Lease described on Exhibit A-1 that is not a term assignment and also
has "0.000" or "N/A" set forth in the "Lease Net Acres" column or the "Net
Revenue Interest" column, an "Interest Addition"), then the discovering Party
shall promptly after discovery (but in any event before the Closing Date)
provide written notice to the other Parties of such Interest Addition. Such
notice shall be in writing and shall include: (A) a description of each such
Interest Addition; (B) the basis for the assertion of each such Interest
Addition, and supporting documentation with respect thereto; (C) the Acquired
Assets and the Allocated Value of the Acquired Assets affected by each such
Interest Addition (unless such Interest Addition is an Acquired Lease,
Acquired Mineral Fee Interest, or Acquired Well not set forth in Exhibit A-1,
Exhibit A-2, or Exhibit A-3); and (D) the amount by which the notifying Party
reasonably believes the Allocated Value of the affected Acquired Assets should
be increased by the Interest Addition (or the implied value of the Interest
Addition for Interest Additions based on additional Acquired Leases, Acquired
Mineral Fee Interests, or Acquired Wells not set forth in Exhibit A-1, Exhibit
A-2, or Exhibit A-3, as applicable, which shall be based on the Allocated
Value of comparable Acquired 

Assets listed in Exhibit A-1, Exhibit A-2, or Exhibit A-3, as applicable), and
the computations upon which such Party's belief is based.

(b) Effect of Interest Additions. The value of Interest Additions shall be
determined using the same principles as provided in Section 5.4 with respect
to Title Defects. Interest Additions shall first be offset against Title
Defect Values of Surviving Title Defects in determining the Title Defect
adjustment, if any, as provided in Section 5.6(c), and, if (i) the sum of the
value of all Interest Additions exceeds an amount equal to (ii) the sum of the
Title Defect Values with respect to all Surviving Title Defects, then the Base
Fixed Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount equal to such excess
amount. An Interest Addition need not be contained in Purchaser's Notice of
Title Defects to be taken into account; provided, however, that an Interest
Addition shall only be taken into account if Purchaser has received written
notice or has actual knowledge of such Interest Addition before the Closing
Date.

5.10 Dispute Resolution. If any Open Title Defects, including the existence,
waiver, cure, and Title Defect Values thereof, or any Interest Additions,
including the existence and values thereof, are not agreed upon under Section
5.8 or, if Seller elects under Section 5.6(b) to attempt to cure any alleged
Title Defects after Closing, are not agreed upon prior to the expiration of
the Cure Period (collectively, "Title Disputed Matters"), then all such Title
Disputed Matters shall be consolidated and resolved by a single Title Expert
under the dispute resolution procedure in this Section 5.10.

(a) Selection of Expert. Seller and Purchaser shall act in good faith to
promptly execute such engagement letters and other documents as shall be
necessary to engage, within fifteen (15) Business Days after the Closing or
Cure Period, as applicable, one (1) mutually agreed upon title attorney with
not less than ten (10) years' experience in oil and gas title issues in the
State(s) where the Acquired Assets which are the subject of the Title Disputed
Matters are located and having not worked as an employee or outside counsel
for any Party or its Affiliates during the five (5) year period preceding such
selection (the "Title Expert"). If Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree on
the Title Expert within such fifteen (15) Business Day period, then Seller and
Purchaser will each select one such title attorney (with each such Party
representative meeting the same criteria as set forth above for the Title
Expert) within five (5) Business Days thereafter, and the Party
representatives so selected will mutually appoint the Title Expert (which
Title Expert so appointed shall meet the same criteria as set forth above)
within five (5) Business Days after the two Party representatives are
selected, and the Title Expert so appointed by the two Party representatives
will resolve such matter without further involvement of the two Party
representatives. The fees and expenses of the Title Expert shall be paid fifty
percent (50%) by Seller and fifty percent (50%) by Purchaser. Seller and
Purchaser shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its
case.

(b) Materials to Title Expert. Seller and Purchaser shall each present to the
Title Expert, with a simultaneous copy to the other Party, a single written
statement of its position on each Title Disputed Matter, together with a copy
of this Agreement, Purchaser's Notice of Title Defects, and any supporting
material that such Party desires to furnish, not later than fifteen (15)
Business Days after appointment of the Title Expert. Each of Seller and
Purchaser shall in no event attempt to communicate with the Title Expert with
respect to any Title Disputed Matters without providing the other Party the
opportunity to jointly discuss or confer with the Title Expert with respect to
such Title Disputed Matters.

(c) Decisions of Title Expert. The Title Expert shall make his or her
determination and provide to the Parties written findings within twenty (20)
Business Days after he/she has received the materials under Section 5.10(b).
In making a determination, the Title Expert shall be bound by the terms of
this Agreement and, without any additional or supplemental submittals by
either Party (except as may be specifically requested by the Title Expert),
may consider available legal and industry matters as in his/her opinion are
necessary or appropriate to make a proper determination. The decision of the
Title Expert shall be final, conclusive, binding, non-appealable and
enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction and 

shall be limited to awarding only Seller's position or Purchaser's position
with respect to each Title Disputed Matter, provided that the Title Expert may
not award Purchaser any greater Title Defect Values than the Title Defect
Values asserted by Purchaser in its applicable Notice of Title Defects. The
Title Expert shall make a separate determination with respect to each Title
Disputed Matter. The written finding of the Title Expert shall only set forth
the Title Expert's decision with respect to each applicable Title Disputed
Matter and not the Title Expert's rationale for the decision. THE TITLE EXPERT
SHALL ACT AS AN EXPERT FOR THE LIMITED PURPOSE OF DETERMINING THE SPECIFIC
TITLE DISPUTED MATTER PRESENTED TO HIM/HER, SHALL NOT HAVE THE POWERS OF AN
ARBITRATOR, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION, MAY
NOT HEAR OR DECIDE ANY MATTERS EXCEPT THE SPECIFIC TITLE DISPUTED MATTER
PRESENTED TO HIM/HER AND MAY NOT AWARD DAMAGES, INTEREST, COSTS, ATTORNEY'S
FEES, EXPENSES, OR PENALTIES TO EITHER PARTY. IN ADDITION, THE TITLE EXPERT
SHALL AGREE IN WRITING TO KEEP STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL THE SPECIFICS AND
EXISTENCE OF ANY MATTERS SUBMITTED AS WELL AS ALL PROPRIETARY RECORDS OF THE
PARTIES, IF ANY, REVIEWED BY THE TITLE EXPERT IN THE PROCESS OF RESOLVING SUCH
DISPUTES.

(d) Adjustments. With respect to Title Disputed Matters submitted to the Title
Expert pursuant to this Section 5.10, within five days after all such disputes
are finally resolved (by the Title Expert and/or final agreement by the
Parties), subject to Section 5.6(a), Section 5.6(b)(ii)(E), and Section 5.8,
(1) Purchaser and Seller shall issue joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent to deliver (i) to Purchaser the Escrowed Assignment of such Acquired
Assets that were held out of Closing and (ii) to Seller and/or Purchaser, as
applicable, the funds in the Escrow Account attributable to Title Disputed
Matters pursuant to the determination of the Title Expert or final agreement
of the Parties, subject to further adjustments in accordance with Section 3.3,
effective as of the Effective Time, in each case, in accordance with the terms
of the Escrow Agreement, and (2) if the agreement or determination is that an
amount is owed to Seller in respect of any Title Disputed Matters related to
Interest Additions, then Purchaser shall pay to Seller concurrently therewith
the amounts owed in respect thereof by Purchaser to Seller.

5.11 Special Warranty of Title in the Assignment.

(a) The Assignment delivered at Closing will contain a special warranty of
title, effective as of Closing, whereby Seller shall warrant title to its
interest in the Acquired Properties unto Purchaser against every Person
whomsoever lawfully claiming or to claim the same or any part thereof by,
through or under Seller but not otherwise, subject, however, to the Permitted
Encumbrances.

(b) No later than the date five (5) years after the Closing Date, Purchaser
may furnish Seller a Notice of Title Defect meeting the requirements of
Section 5.5(b) setting forth any matters which Purchaser intends to assert as
a breach of the special warranty of title set forth in the Assignment. Seller
shall have a reasonable opportunity, but not the obligation, to cure any
alleged breach of such special warranty of title. Purchaser shall be deemed to
have waived all breaches of Seller's special warranty of title set forth in
the Assignment for which Seller has not received on or before the date five
(5) years after the Closing Date a valid Notice of Title Defects that
satisfies the requirements set forth in Section 5.5(b).

(c) For purposes of the special warranty of title contained in the Assignment,
the value of the Acquired Assets set forth in the exhibits hereto shall be
deemed to be the Allocated Value thereof, as adjusted herein. Recovery on the
special warranty of title contained in the Assignment shall be limited to an
amount (without any interest accruing thereon) equal to the reduction in the
Base Fixed Purchase Price to which Purchaser would have been entitled had
Purchaser asserted the Title Defect giving rise to such breach of the special
warranty of title contained in the Assignment as a Title Defect prior to the
Defect Notice Deadline pursuant to Section 5.5; provided that such calculation
shall not take into account the Title Defect Threshold and the Title Defect
Deductible. 

5.12 Changes in Prices; Well Events. Purchaser shall assume all risk of Loss
with respect to: (a) changes in commodity or product prices and any other
market factors or conditions from and after the Effective Time; (b) production
declines or any adverse change in the production characteristics or downhole
condition of an Acquired Well, including any Acquired Well watering out or
experiencing a collapse in the casing or sand infiltration; and (c)
depreciation of any Acquired Assets that constitute personal property through
ordinary wear and tear, and none of the foregoing shall constitute Title
Defects or otherwise give rise to any Claims by Purchaser before, on, or after
the Closing.

5.13 Exclusive Remedy. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS
AGREEMENT, EXCEPT FOR THE SPECIAL WARRANTY OF TITLE IN THE ASSIGNMENT, THIS
ARTICLE V AND ANY INDEMNIFICATIONS PROVIDED FOR UNDER SECTION 14.2(G) (WITH
RESPECT TO MATTERS DESCRIBED ON SCHEDULE 7.10) OR SECTION 14.2(I) CONSTITUTE
THE ENTIRE AND EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF PURCHASER AGAINST ANY
INDEMNIFIED SELLER PARTY WITH RESPECT TO ANY TITLE DEFECTS OR OTHER TITLE
MATTERS OR DEFICIENCIES IN TITLE WITH RESPECT TO THE ACQUIRED ASSETS
(COLLECTIVELY, "TITLE MATTERS"). IN THIS REGARD AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING
TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, IF A TITLE DEFECT OR OTHER TITLE MATTER
CONSTITUTES, OR RESULTS FROM ANY MATTER OR CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH CONSTITUTES, A
BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF SELLER SET FORTH IN THIS
AGREEMENT, THEN PURCHASER SHALL ONLY BE ENTITLED TO ASSERT SUCH MATTER AS AN
TITLE DEFECT AS AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY THIS ARTICLE V, AND SHALL BE
PRECLUDED FROM ASSERTING SUCH MATTER AS THE BASIS OF THE BREACH OF ANY SUCH
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY. OTHER THAN THE SPECIAL WARRANTY OF TITLE IN THE
ASSIGNMENT, THIS ARTICLE V, AND ANY INDEMNIFICATION RIGHTS PURCHASER MAY HAVE
UNDER SECTION 14.2(G) (WITH RESPECT TO MATTERS DESCRIBED ON SCHEDULE 7.10) OR
SECTION 14.2(I) WITH RESPECT TO INDEMNIFIED TITLE DEFECTS (AS LIMITED BY THE
OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS ARTICLE V AND ARTICLE XIV), PURCHASER (ON BEHALF OF
ITSELF, THE OTHER INDEMNIFIED PURCHASER PARTIES, AND ITS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE
SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS) HEREBY RELEASES, DISCHARGES, AND WAIVES ANY AND ALL
CLAIMS AND LOSSES, AND ALL RIGHTS AND REMEDIES WHETHER ARISING AT LAW (WHETHER
IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE) OR PURSUANT TO ANY OTHER LEGAL
THEORY, KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, AND WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR ARISING IN THE FUTURE,
CONTINGENT, OR OTHERWISE, AGAINST ANY OF THE INDEMNIFIED SELLER PARTIES
RELATING TO ANY TITLE MATTERS, IN EACH CASE, EVEN IF SUCH CLAIMS OR LOSSES ARE
CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER GROSS, SOLE, JOINT OR
CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF ANY INDEMNIFIED SELLER
PARTIES.

ARTICLE VI 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

6.1 Environmental Defect. The term "Environmental Defect" means, with respect
to any Acquired Asset, the failure to be in compliance with, or the existence
of any condition that gives rise to any penalty or fine or that requires, if
known, or will require, once discovered, removal, cleanup, Remediation or
other corrective action under, applicable Environmental Laws in effect on or
prior to the Closing Date.

6.2 Environmental Defect Value. The term "Environmental Defect Value" means,
with respect to an Environmental Defect, the present value as of the Closing
Date of the estimated cost (net to Seller's interest) to Remediate such
Environmental Defect in the lowest cost manner reasonably available,
consistent and in compliance with applicable Environmental Laws, taking into
account (a) the nature of the Environmental Defect, (b) any subsequent
Remediation or cure of the Environmental Defect by Seller within the time
frames permitted under this Agreement, and (c) that non-permanent remedies
(including without limitation, mechanisms to contain or stabilize Hazardous
Materials, including monitoring site conditions, natural attenuation, risk-
based corrective action, institutional controls, or other appropriate
restrictions on the industrial use of the property, caps, dikes,
encapsulation, leachate collection systems, 

and the like) may be the lowest cost manner reasonably available, to the
extent such Remediation is allowed under Environmental Law and authorized by
the applicable Governmental Authority, and only to the extent such Remediation
does not unreasonably interfere with the present operations of the Assets;
provided, however, "Environmental Defect Value" shall not include costs and
expenses that would not have been required under Environmental Laws as they
exist at the Defect Notice Deadline.

6.3 Environmental Defect Notices.

(a) Deadline. As a condition to asserting any claim with respect to any
alleged Environmental Defect, Purchaser must deliver to Seller a valid written
Notice of Environmental Defect as to such alleged Environmental Defect no
later than the Defect Notice Deadline.

(b) Notice of Environmental Defects. On or before the Defect Notice Deadline,
Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a written notice (a "Notice of Environmental
Defects") that sets forth Environmental Defects affecting the Acquired Assets
that Purchaser desires to assert under this Agreement. The Notice of
Environmental Defects, to be valid, shall, with respect to each Environmental
Defect set forth therein: (i) describe the nature of and basis for the
assertion of such Environmental Defect; (ii) describe the specific Acquired
Assets affected by such Environmental Defect; (iii) include references to the
specific provisions of Environmental Laws forming the basis of such
Environmental Defect; (iv) describe Purchaser's good-faith estimate of the
Environmental Defect Value with respect to each Acquired Asset affected by
such Environmental Defect (and identify all assumptions used by Purchaser in
calculating such amount); and (iv) include reasonable documentation to
establish the existence, nature, and basis of such Environmental Defect and
Purchaser's estimate of the associated Environmental Defect Value.

(c) Preliminary Notice. To give Seller an opportunity to commence reviewing
and curing Environmental Defects asserted by Purchaser, Purchaser shall give
Seller, on or before the end of every two (2) calendar week prior to the
Defect Notice Deadline, written notice of all alleged Environmental Defects
discovered by Purchaser during the preceding calendar two (2) week period,
which notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the Defect
Notice Deadline; provided, however, that in no event shall Purchaser's failure
to provide such preliminary notices be deemed a waiver of any remedies or
adjustment for Title Defects available to Purchaser pursuant to this Article
V.

6.4 Waiver; Remediation; Adjustment; Deductible.

(a) Waiver. Each and every Environmental Defect shall be and is hereby
conclusively waived by Purchaser, and Purchaser shall not be entitled to any
remedies or adjustment for such Environmental Defect, if: (i) Purchaser fails
to provide a written Notice of Environmental Defect to Seller of such
Environmental Defect in accordance with Section 6.3(b) on or before the Defect
Notice Deadline; or (ii) the aggregate Environmental Defect Value with respect
to such Environmental Defect (as it affects all applicable Acquired Assets) is
less than the Environmental Defect Threshold.

(b) Remediation. Seller shall have the right and option, but not the
obligation, to attempt to Remediate or otherwise cure any Environmental
Defects that are not waived under Section 6.4(a) at any time on or before the
expiration of the Cure Period. Seller's election to attempt to cure an
Environmental Defect shall be without prejudice to its rights under Section
6.7 and shall not constitute an admission against interest or a waiver of
Seller's right to dispute the existence, nature, or Environmental Defect Value
of such Environmental Defect. During the period following the Closing and
until the expiration of the Cure Period, Purchaser shall provide (or cause to
be provided) to Seller and its representatives access to the Acquired
Properties and Acquired Records in connection with Seller's efforts to cure
alleged Environmental Defects. Each Environmental Defect that is (i) not
waived under Section 6.4(a), (ii) not cured under this Section 6.4(b) and
(iii) not an Indemnified Environmental Defect is 

referred to in this Agreement as a "Surviving Environmental Defect". The
following shall apply with respect to each Environmental Defect that Seller
attempts to cure pursuant to this Section 6.4(b):

(i) At any time prior to Closing, but subject to the final sentence of Section
6.4(c), Seller may provide Purchaser written notice that it will attempt to
cure an Environmental Defect (each, a "Subject Environmental Defect"). If the
Subject Environmental Defect is cured by Seller prior to Closing, the Acquired
Asset subject to such Subject Environmental Defect shall be assigned to
Purchaser at Closing, and there shall be no adjustment to the Base Fixed
Purchase Price in respect of such Subject Environmental Defect. If the Subject
Environmental Defect is not cured by Seller prior to Closing, (A) the Acquired
Assets subject to such Subject Environmental Defect (and any associated
Acquired Assets to the extent relating thereto) shall not be conveyed to
Purchaser at Closing, (B) the Parties shall enter into the Escrow Agreement,
(C) the Base Fixed Purchase Price shall be reduced at Closing by the aggregate
Allocated Value of such Acquired Assets (and any such associated Acquired
Assets) and such aggregate amount shall be deposited by Purchaser in the
Escrow Account, and (D) Seller and Purchaser shall deliver to the Escrow Agent
an Escrowed Assignment of such Acquired Assets (and any such associated
Acquired Assets).

(ii) The amount deposited into the Escrow Account and the Escrowed Assignment
with respect to a Subject Environmental Defect will remain therein until
released as provided in this Section 6.4(b)(ii), and the Acquired Assets
included in such Escrowed Assignment and applicable to such Subject
Environmental Defect shall be referred to as the applicable "Escrowed
Environmental Defect Properties".

(A) During the Cure Period, if Seller and Purchaser mutually agree, in their
reasonable and good faith opinion, that a Subject Environmental Defect has
been completely cured, then Seller and Purchaser shall jointly instruct the
Escrow Agent to (1) pay to Seller from the Escrow Account an amount equal to
the Allocated Value of the applicable Escrowed Environmental Defect Properties
(together with any interest earned thereon) and (2) deliver to Purchaser the
Escrowed Assignment attributable to such Escrowed Environmental Defect
Properties, in each case, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement.

(B) If, at the end of the Cure Period, Purchaser and Seller mutually agree, in
their reasonable and good faith opinion, that a Subject Environmental Defect
has been partially cured, then, subject to Section 6.4(a), Section 6.5(a) and
the Environmental Defect Deductible, (1) Seller and Purchaser shall jointly
instruct the Escrow Agent to (a) pay to Purchaser from the Escrow Account an
amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Environmental Defect Value attributable
to the uncured portion of such Subject Environmental Defect and (ii) the
Allocated Value of the applicable Escrowed Environmental Defect Properties
(together with interest earned thereon), (b) pay to Seller from the Escrow
Account the Allocated Value of such Escrowed Environmental Defect Properties
less the amount distributed to Purchaser pursuant to subpart (B)(1)(a) above
(together with any interest earned thereon), and (c) deliver to Purchaser the
Escrowed Assignment attributable to the applicable Escrowed Title Defect
Properties, in each case, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, and (2) if the Environmental Defect Value attributable to the
uncured portion of such Subject Environmental Defect exceeds the Allocated
Value of the applicable Escrowed Environmental Defect Properties, then Seller
shall pay to Purchaser concurrently therewith an amount equal to such excess
amount.

(C) If, at the end of the Cure Period, Purchaser and Seller mutually agree, in
their reasonable and good faith opinion, that Seller has been unable to cure a
Subject Environmental Defect, then, subject to Section 6.4(a), Section 6.5(a)
and the Environmental Defect Deductible, (1) Seller and Purchaser shall
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to (a) pay to Purchaser from the Escrow
Account an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the agreed upon Environmental
Defect Value 

attributable to such Subject Environmental Defect and (ii) the Allocated Value
of the applicable Escrowed Environmental Defect Properties (together with any
interest earned thereon), (b) pay to Seller from the Escrow Account an amount
equal to the Allocated Value of the applicable Escrowed Title Defect
Properties less the amount distributed to Purchaser pursuant to subpart
(C)(1)(a) above, and (c) deliver to Purchaser the Escrowed Assignment
attributable to the applicable Escrowed Title Defect Properties, in each case,
in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, and (2) if the
Environmental Defect Value attributable to such Subject Environmental Defect
exceeds the Allocated Value of the applicable Escrowed Environmental Defect
Properties, then Seller shall pay to Purchaser concurrently therewith an
amount equal to such excess amount.

(D) If, at the end of the Cure Period, Purchaser and Seller, in their
reasonable and good faith opinion, have not agreed whether there has been, or
the extent to which there has been, a cure of a Subject Environmental Defect
or the extent to which any Party is entitled to any disbursement from the
Escrow Account pursuant to this Section 6.4(b)(ii), then such disagreement
shall be resolved as provided in Section 6.7 and, subject to Section 6.4(a),
Section 6.5(a) and the Environmental Defect Deductible, following such
determination by the Environmental Expert, (1) Seller and Purchaser shall
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to (a) pay the amount owed to Purchaser
and/or Seller from the Escrow Account to the applicable Parties up to an
amount equal to the Allocated Value of the applicable Escrowed Environmental
Defect Properties (together with any interest earned thereon) and (b) deliver
to Purchaser the Escrowed Assignment attributable to the Escrowed
Environmental Defect Properties, in each case, in accordance with the terms of
the Escrow Agreement, and (2) if the determination is that an amount is owed
to Purchaser in excess of the amount distributed to Purchaser pursuant to
subpart (D)(1)(a) above, then Seller shall pay to Purchaser concurrently
therewith an amount equal to such excess amount.

(E) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, all disbursements from
the Escrow Account to Purchaser or Seller with respect to any Escrowed
Environmental Defect Properties assigned to Purchaser shall be subject to
further adjustments in accordance with Section 3.3 (effective as of the
Effective Time). To the extent any additional funds are owed by either Party
to the other Party as a result of such adjustments and were not already
accounted for under Section 3.4 or Section 3.5, such additional amounts shall
be paid by the applicable Party to the other Party at the time provided in
Section 3.5(i) or within five days following the applicable disbursement from
the Escrow Account to Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, which is later.

(c) Adjustment; Deductible. Purchaser shall be entitled to a downward
adjustment to the Base Fixed Purchase Price in the amount, if any, by which
(i) the sum of the Environmental Defect Values with respect to all Surviving
Environmental Defects exceeds (ii) the Environmental Defect Deductible. If,
after taking into account the provisions of this Article VI, the Environmental
Defect Deductible is equal to or greater than the sum of the Environmental
Defect Values with respect to all Surviving Environmental Defects, then
Purchaser shall not be entitled to any Environmental Defect adjustments.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Environmental Defect
Value of any Environmental Defect equals or exceeds Two Million Dollars
($2,000,000) (such an Environmental Defect, a "Significant Environmental
Defect"), Purchaser may elect prior to the expiration of the Cure Period (to
the extent not already conveyed to Purchaser) to cause Seller to retain the
entirety of the Acquired Asset that is subject to such Significant
Environmental Defect, in which event the Purchase Price shall be reduced
(subject to the Environmental Defect Deductible) by an amount equal to the
Allocated Value of such Acquired Assets; provided, however, in no other event
shall any Acquired Assets be excluded from the Contemplated Transactions
arising out of or relating to any Environmental Defects.

6.5 Indemnification for Environmental Defects. 

(a) Election. At any time after the delivery by Purchaser of its Notice of
Environmental Defects and before the expiration of the Cure Period, Seller may
(but shall not be obligated to) make an election by written notice to
Purchaser to indemnify, defend, save, and hold harmless Purchaser under
Section 14.2(j) (subject to the other provisions and limitations of this
Section 6.5 and Article XIV) for all Claims and Losses arising out of,
attributable to, or in connection with one or more particular Environmental
Defects alleged by Purchaser in its Notice of Environmental Defects (each such
Environmental Defect as to which Seller so elects in writing, an "Indemnified
Environmental Defect"). Purchaser shall not be entitled to a downward
adjustment to the Base Fixed Purchase Price with respect to any alleged
Environmental Defect with respect to which Seller elects to indemnify
Purchaser pursuant to this Section 6.5.

(b) Limitations on Losses.

(i) Subject to Sections 6.5(b)(ii) and (iii) below, the aggregate amount of
any Losses or Claims arising out of, attributable to, or in connection with
the Indemnified Environmental Defect(s) must exceed the Environmental Defect
Indemnity Deductible before Seller shall have any Liability or obligation
under this Section 6.5 or Section 14.2(j) with respect to such Loss or Claim,
and if the aggregate amount of such Losses and Claims exceeds the
Environmental Defect Indemnity Deductible, then the obligation of Seller to
indemnify Purchaser under this Section 6.5 and Section 14.2(j) for such Losses
and Claims shall only apply from the first dollar of such Losses and Claims in
excess of the Environmental Defect Indemnity Deductible. The term
"Environmental Defect Indemnity Deductible" shall mean the positive
difference, if any, of (A) the Environmental Defect Deductible minus (B) the
Environmental Defect Values attributable to any Surviving Environmental
Defects.

(ii) Subject to Section 6.5(b)(iii) below and the further limitations in
Article XIV, the aggregate Liability of Seller for all Losses and Claims
arising out of, attributable to, or in connection with all Indemnified
Environmental Defects shall not exceed the positive difference, if any, of:
(A) the aggregate sum of Purchaser's asserted Environmental Defect Values in
its applicable Notice of Environmental Defects with respect to such
Indemnified Environmental Defects; minus (B) the Environmental Defect
Indemnity Deductible.

(iii) Subject to the further limitations in Article XIV, the aggregate
Liability of Seller for all Losses and Claims arising out of, attributable to,
or in connection with any particular Indemnified Environmental Defect shall
not exceed Purchaser's asserted Environmental Defect Value in its applicable
Notice of Environmental Defects with respect to such Indemnified Environmental
Defect.

6.6 Agreement on Environmental Defects.

(a) Attempt to Agree. With respect to each Environmental Defect that is not an
Indemnified Environmental Defect and that the Parties do not agree has been
waived or Remediated or otherwise cured under Section 6.4 (each, an "Open
Environmental Defect"), from the receipt by Seller of Purchaser's Notice of
Environmental Defects until the Closing Date (or, with respect to
Environmental Defects that are subject to a Post-Closing Curative Election,
until the expiration of the Cure Period) or the earlier acknowledgement of
Purchaser in writing that it is not entitled to an Environmental Defect
adjustment in respect thereof, Purchaser and Seller shall attempt in good
faith to agree on the existence and associated Environmental Defect Value of
each such Open Environmental Defect.

(b) Agreement. If Seller and Purchaser agree on the existence and
Environmental Defect Value of any such Open Environmental Defect, then the
Environmental Defect Value for such Open 

Environmental Defect shall be the agreed Environmental Defect Value for
purposes of determining the Environmental Defect adjustment, if any. Upon any
such agreement, Seller and Purchaser shall execute a written instrument
reflecting such agreement.

(c) Agreement before Closing. If, before the Closing Date, Seller and
Purchaser agree on the existence and Environmental Defect Values of any Open
Environmental Defects (other than those that are the subject of a Post-Closing
Curative Election), then, subject to Section 6.4(b), the amount of the
preliminary Environmental Defect adjustment (i.e. not taking into account any
Environmental Defects that are the subject of a Post-Closing Curative Election
or any Environmental Disputed Matters), if any, shall be deducted from the
Base Fixed Purchase Price at the Closing and shall be reflected in the Closing
Amount (which Environmental Defect adjustments shall be finalized and, as and
to the extent necessary, adjusted pursuant to the final settlement under
Section 3.5 or thereafter (to the extent determined by the Environmental
Expert following the Final Determination Date), as applicable, in respect of
Environmental Defects that are the subject of a Post-Closing Curative Election
and any Environmental Disputed Matters).

(d) Failure to Agree. If, before the Closing Date, Seller and Purchaser do not
agree on the existence and Environmental Defect Values of all Open
Environmental Defects (other than those that are the subject of a Post-Closing
Curative Election), then (1) the existence and Environmental Defect Value of
such Open Environmental Defects that are not agreed (but only those that are
not agreed), shall be Environmental Disputed Matters settled after Closing by
the Environmental Expert under Section 6.7, and (2) the following shall apply
with respect to each Environmental Disputed Matter:

(i) (A) The Acquired Assets subject to such Environmental Disputed Matter (and
any associated Acquired Assets to the extent relating thereto) shall not be
conveyed to Purchaser at Closing, (B) the Parties shall enter into the Escrow
Agreement, (C) the Base Fixed Purchase Price shall be reduced at Closing by
the aggregate Allocated Value of such Acquired Assets (and any such associated
Acquired Assets) and such aggregate amount shall be deposited by Purchaser
into the Escrow Account, and (D) Seller and Purchaser shall deliver to the
Escrow Agent a fully executed Escrowed Assignment of such Acquired Assets (and
any such associated Acquired Assets).

(ii) The amount deposited into the Escrow Account and the Escrowed Assignment
with respect to an Environmental Disputed Matter will remain therein until
released as provided in Section 6.7(d), and any such Acquired Asset subject to
an Environmental Disputed Matter shall be referred to as an "Escrowed
Environmental Defect Property".

6.7 Dispute Resolution. If any Open Environmental Defects, including the
existence, waiver, Remediation, and Environmental Defect Values thereof, are
not agreed upon under Section 6.6 or, if Seller elects under Section 6.4(b) to
attempt to cure any alleged Environmental Defects after Closing, are not
agreed upon prior to the expiration of the Cure Period (collectively,
"Environmental Disputed Matters"), then all such Environmental Disputed
Matters shall be consolidated and resolved by a single Environmental Expert
under the dispute resolution procedure in this Section 6.7.

(a) Selection of Expert. Seller and Purchaser shall act in good faith to
promptly execute such engagement letters and other documents as shall be
necessary to engage, within fifteen (15) Business Days after the Closing or
Cure Period, as applicable, one (1) mutually agreed upon environmental expert
in the energy industry with not less than ten (10) years' experience in
environmental issues in the State(s) where the Acquired Assets which are the
subject of the Environmental Disputed Matters are located and having not
worked as an employee or outside expert for any Party or its Affiliates during
the five (5) year period preceding such selection (the "Environmental
Expert"). If Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree on the Environmental
Expert within such fifteen (15) Business Day period, then Seller and Purchaser
will each select one such environmental expert (with each such Party
representative meeting the same 

criteria as set forth above for the Environmental Expert) within five (5)
Business Days thereafter, and the Party representatives so selected will
mutually appoint the Environmental Expert (which Environmental Expert so
appointed shall meet the same criteria as set forth above) within five (5)
Business Days after the two Party representatives are selected, and the
Environmental Expert so appointed by the two Party representatives will
resolve such matter without further involvement of the two Party
representatives. The fees and expenses of the Environmental Expert shall be
paid fifty percent (50%) by Seller and fifty percent (50%) by Purchaser.
Seller and Purchaser shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of
presenting its case.

(b) Materials to Environmental Expert. Seller and Purchaser shall each present
to the Environmental Expert, with a simultaneous copy to the other Party, a
single written statement of its position on each Environmental Disputed
Matter, together with a copy of this Agreement, Purchaser's Notice of
Environmental Defects, and any supporting material that such Party desires to
furnish, not later than fifteen (15) Business Days after appointment of the
Environmental Expert. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall in no event attempt
to communicate with the Environmental Expert with respect to any Environmental
Disputed Matters without providing the other Party the opportunity to jointly
discuss or confer with the Environmental Expert with respect to such
Environmental Disputed Matters.

(c) Decisions of Environmental Expert. The Environmental Expert shall make his
or her determination and provide to the Parties written findings within twenty
(20) Business Days after he/she has received the materials under Section
6.7(b). In making a determination, the Environmental Expert shall be bound by
the terms of this Agreement and, without any additional or supplemental
submittals by either Party (except as may be specifically requested by the
Environmental Expert), may consider available legal and industry matters as in
his/her opinion are necessary or appropriate to make a proper determination.
The decision of the Environmental Expert shall be final, conclusive, binding,
non-appealable and enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction and
shall be limited to awarding only Seller's position or Purchaser's position
with respect to each Environmental Disputed Matter, provided that the
Environmental Expert may not award Purchaser any greater Environmental Defect
Values than the Environmental Defect Values asserted by Purchaser in its
applicable Notice of Environmental Defects. The Environmental Expert shall
make a separate determination with respect to each Environmental Disputed
Matter. The written finding of the Environmental Expert shall only set forth
the Environmental Expert's decision with respect to each applicable
Environmental Disputed Matter and not the Environmental Expert's rationale for
the decision. THE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPERT SHALL ACT AS AN EXPERT FOR THE LIMITED
PURPOSE OF DETERMINING THE SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL DISPUTED MATTER PRESENTED TO
HIM/HER, SHALL NOT HAVE THE POWERS OF AN ARBITRATOR, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE
PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION, MAY NOT HEAR OR DECIDE ANY MATTERS
EXCEPT THE SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL DISPUTED MATTER PRESENTED TO HIM/HER AND MAY
NOT AWARD DAMAGES, INTEREST, COSTS, ATTORNEY'S FEES, EXPENSES, OR PENALTIES TO
EITHER PARTY. IN ADDITION, THE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPERT SHALL AGREE IN WRITING TO
KEEP STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL THE SPECIFICS AND EXISTENCE OF ANY MATTERS
SUBMITTED AS WELL AS ALL PROPRIETARY RECORDS OF THE PARTIES, IF ANY, REVIEWED
BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPERT IN THE PROCESS OF RESOLVING SUCH DISPUTES.

(d) Adjustments. With respect to Environmental Disputed Matters submitted to
the Environmental Expert pursuant to this Section 6.7, within five (5) days
after all such disputes are finally resolved pursuant to this Section 6.7,
subject to Section 6.4(a), Section 6.5(a) and the Environmental Defect
Deductible, Purchaser and Seller shall issue joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent to deliver (i) to Purchaser the Escrowed Assignment and (ii) to
Seller and/or Purchaser, as applicable, the funds in the Escrow Account
attributable to Environmental Disputed Matters pursuant to the determination
of the Environmental Expert or final agreement of the Parties, subject to
further adjustments in accordance with Section 3.3, effective as of the
Effective Time; in each case, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement. 

6.8 Exclusive Remedy. PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE ACQUIRED ASSETS HAVE
BEEN USED TO EXPLORE FOR, DEVELOP, AND PRODUCE HYDROCARBONS, AND THAT THERE
(I) MAY HAVE BEEN RELEASES OF WASTES, CRUDE OIL, CONDENSATE, PRODUCED WATER,
OR OTHER MATERIALS, INCLUDING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS, ABOVE, IN, ON, OR UNDER THE
ACQUIRED ASSETS AND (II) MAY EXIST OTHER CONDITIONS THAT MAY CONSTITUTE AN
ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECT OR RESULT IN LIABILITIES UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, THIS ARTICLE VI
AND ANY INDEMNIFICATIONS PROVIDED FOR UNDER SECTION 14.2(D) AND SECTION
14.2(J) CONSTITUTE THE ENTIRE AND EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF PURCHASER
AGAINST ANY INDEMNIFIED SELLER PARTY WITH RESPECT TO ANY ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECTS
OR OTHER CONDITIONS, EVENTS, CIRCUMSTANCES, ACTS, OR OMISSIONS OF, OR RELATING
TO, THE ENVIRONMENT, ANY ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, ANY HAZARDOUS MATERIALS, ANY
RELEASES, THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT OR HEALTH, OR ANY ASSUMED
ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES (COLLECTIVELY, "ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS"). IN THIS
REGARD AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, IF AN
ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECT OR OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL MATTER CONSTITUTES, OR RESULTS
FROM ANY MATTER OR CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH CONSTITUTES, A BREACH OF ANY
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF SELLER SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT (OTHER THAN
AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 7.12), THEN PURCHASER SHALL ONLY BE ENTITLED TO ASSERT
SUCH MATTER AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECT AS AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY THIS
ARTICLE VI, AND SHALL BE PRECLUDED FROM ASSERTING SUCH MATTER AS THE BASIS OF
THE BREACH OF ANY SUCH REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY (OTHER THAN AS SET FORTH IN
SECTION 7.12). OTHER THAN THIS ARTICLE VI, SECTION 7.12, AND ANY
INDEMNIFICATION RIGHTS PURCHASER MAY HAVE UNDER SECTION 14.2(D) AND SECTION
14.2(J) (AS LIMITED BY THE OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS ARTICLE VI AND ARTICLE
XIV), PURCHASER (ON BEHALF OF ITSELF, THE OTHER INDEMNIFIED PURCHASER PARTIES,
AND ITS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS) HEREBY RELEASES,
DISCHARGES, AND WAIVES ANY AND ALL CLAIMS AND LOSSES, AND ALL RIGHTS AND
REMEDIES WHETHER ARISING AT LAW (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR
OTHERWISE) OR PURSUANT TO ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, AND
WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR ARISING IN THE FUTURE, CONTINGENT, OR OTHERWISE,
AGAINST ANY OF THE INDEMNIFIED SELLER PARTIES RELATING TO ANY ENVIRONMENTAL
MATTERS, IN EACH CASE, EVEN IF SUCH CLAIMS OR LOSSES ARE CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN
PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER GROSS, SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT), STRICT
LIABILITY, OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF ANY INDEMNIFIED SELLER PARTIES.

Permits required under Environmental Laws for the ownership, lease, and
operation of such Water Assets; and (b) Seller has not received any written
notice, report, or other information from any Governmental Authority alleging
a material violation of or material Liability under Environmental Laws with
respect to the Acquired Assets other than any violations or Liabilities that
have been resolved to the satisfaction of all applicable Governmental
Authorities. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the

representations and warranties made by such Seller in any way related to
Environmental Matters or Environmental Laws or otherwise to the physical
condition of the Acquired Assets.

7.24 Certain Limitations. Any representation of Seller in this Article VII
that relates to Acquired Assets in which Seller is a non-operator under a
joint operating agreement or similar agreement is limited to the Knowledge of
Seller. Inclusion of a matter on a schedule attached hereto with respect to a
representation or warranty that addresses matters being material or having a
Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed an indication that such matter is
material or does, or may, have a Material Adverse Effect. Likewise, the
inclusion of a matter on a Schedule to this Agreement in relation to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an indication that such matter
necessarily would, or may, breach such representation or warranty absent its
inclusion on such Schedule. Matters may be set forth on a Schedule for
information purposes only, do not necessarily include other matters of a
similar nature and shall not expand the scope of the representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement. 

ARTICLE VIII 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER

Purchaser represents and warrants to Seller, as of the Execution Date and the
Closing Date, as follows:

8.1 Organization, Existence, and Qualification. Purchaser is a limited
liability company duly formed and validly existing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its formation and Purchaser has all requisite power and
authority to own and operate its property and to carry on its business as now
conducted. Purchaser is duly licensed or qualified to do business as a foreign
company in all jurisdictions in which it carries on business or owns assets
and such qualification is required by Law except where the failure to be so
qualified would not have a material adverse effect upon the ability of
Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Purchaser is duly licensed or qualified to do business in both the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the State of West Virginia.

8.2 Authority, Approval, and Enforceability. Purchaser has full power and
authority to enter into and perform this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents to which it is a party and the transactions contemplated herein and
therein. The execution, delivery, and performance by Purchaser of this
Agreement have been duly and validly authorized and approved by all necessary
company action on the part of Purchaser. This Agreement is, and the
Transaction Documents to which Purchaser is a party when executed and
delivered by Purchaser will be, the valid and binding obligation of Purchaser
and enforceable against Purchaser in accordance with their respective terms,
subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
and similar Laws, as well as to principles of equity (regardless of whether
such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law).

8.3 Bankruptcy. There are no bankruptcy, reorganization, or receivership
proceedings pending, being contemplated by or, to Purchaser's knowledge,
threatened in writing against Purchaser.

8.4 Brokers' Fees. Neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates has incurred
any liability, contingent or otherwise, for brokers', finders', or similar
fees in respect of the Contemplated Transactions for which Seller or its
Affiliates will have any responsibility whatsoever.

8.5 No Conflicts. Assuming receipt of all consents and approvals from Third
Parties applicable to the Contemplated Transactions, and except as would not
have a material adverse effect upon the ability of Purchaser to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions or perform its obligations hereunder, the execution,
delivery, and performance by Purchaser of this Agreement and the consummation
of the Contemplated Transactions will not (a) conflict with or result in a
breach of any provision of the Organizational Documents of Purchaser, (b)
result in a default or the creation of any Lien or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation, or acceleration under any of the terms or
provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, or other similar instrument
to which Purchaser is a party or by which Purchaser or any of its assets may
be bound, or (c) violate any Law or Order applicable to Purchaser or any of
its assets.

8.6 Consents. Except for Customary Post-Closing Consents and except for the
filing and other requirements of the HSR Act, there are no consents or
approvals of any Third Party that Purchaser is required to obtain in
connection with the transfer of the Acquired Assets from Seller to Purchaser
or the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions by Purchaser.

8.7 Litigation. There are no Proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of
Purchaser, threatened in writing by or before any Governmental Authority
against Purchaser which are reasonably likely to materially impair or delay
Purchaser's ability to perform its obligations hereunder. 

8.8 Financing. As of Closing, Purchaser has sufficient cash in immediately
available funds with which to pay the Purchase Price, consummate the
Contemplated Transactions, and perform its obligations under this Agreement
and the Transaction Documents.

8.9 Regulatory. At Closing, Purchaser or Purchaser's Affiliate will be
qualified to own and assume operatorship of the Acquired Assets in all
jurisdictions where the Acquired Assets are located, and the consummation of
the Contemplated Transactions will not cause Purchaser to be disqualified as
such an owner or to exceed any acreage limitations imposed by Law or cause
Purchaser or Purchaser's Affiliate to be disqualified as such an operator. To
the extent required by any applicable Laws, Purchaser or Purchaser's Affiliate
shall, as of the Closing Date, (a) hold all Permits, lease bonds, and any
other surety or similar requirements as may be required by, and in accordance
with, all applicable Laws governing the ownership and operation of the
Acquired Assets and (b) have filed any and all required reports necessary for
such ownership and operation with all Governmental Authorities having
jurisdiction over such ownership and operation.

8.10 Independent Evaluation. Purchaser is sophisticated in the evaluation,
purchase, ownership and operation of oil and gas properties and related
facilities, and has retained and taken advice concerning the Acquired Assets,
the Assumed Liabilities, and the Contemplated Transactions from attorneys,
advisors, and consultants that are knowledgeable about the oil and gas
business and the Laws applicable to the Acquired Assets, the Assumed
Liabilities, and the Contemplated Transactions. Purchaser has made all such
reviews and inspections of the Acquired Assets and Background Materials as
Purchaser has deemed necessary or appropriate to enter into this Agreement. In
making its decision to enter into this Agreement, Purchaser has (a) relied on
the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Article VII and in
the Assignment and the terms of this Agreement and (b) relied on its own
independent investigation and evaluation of the Acquired Assets and the advice
of its own legal, Tax, economic, environmental, engineering, geological and
geophysical advisors and not on any comments, statements, projections or other
material made or given by any representative, consultant or advisor of Seller.
Purchaser acknowledges and affirms that on or prior to Closing, Purchaser will
have completed its independent investigation, verification, analysis, and
evaluation of the Acquired Assets and made all such reviews and inspections of
the Acquired Assets as it has deemed necessary or appropriate to consummate
the transaction contemplated hereunder; provided, however, no such
investigation, verification, analysis or evaluation (or absence thereof) shall
reduce, modify, release or waive any of Seller's obligations or Liabilities
hereunder or under any of the other Transaction Documents.

8.11 Accredited Investor. Purchaser is an "accredited investor," as such term
is defined in Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and will
acquire the Acquired Assets for its own account and not with a view to a sale
or distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder, any applicable state blue
sky Laws, or any other applicable securities Laws. Purchaser has such
knowledge, sophistication, and experience in the business and financial
matters and in the ownership and operation of oil and gas properties and
assets that Purchaser is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the
acquisition of the Acquired Assets, and has so evaluated the merits and risks
of such acquisition.

with respect to the Acquired Assets operated by Seller, except to the extent

except contracts terminable by Seller with notice of sixty (60) days' or less
without penalty or detriment, without the written consent of Purchaser (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed);

(x) not terminate (unless the term thereof expires pursuant to the provisions

Acquired Lease to provide for renewal or extension);

(xi) not transfer, sell, mortgage, pledge, or dispose of any material portion
of the Acquired Assets other than (A) the sale and/or disposal of Hydrocarbons
in the ordinary course of business and (B) sales of equipment that is no

request for consent pursuant to this Section 9.1(b). In the event the Parties
are unable to agree within five (5) Business Days (unless a shorter time is

(d) Other Working Interest Owners. Purchaser acknowledges Seller owns
undivided interests in certain of the properties comprising the Acquired
Assets that it is not the operator thereof, and Purchaser agrees that the acts
or omissions of the other working interest owners (including the operators)
who are not Seller or any Affiliates of Seller shall not constitute a breach
of the provisions of this Section 9.1, nor shall any action required by a vote
of working interest owners constitute such a breach so long as Seller has
voted its interest in a manner that complies with the provisions of this
Section 9.1.

(e) Liability of Seller. Without expanding any obligations which Seller may
have to Purchaser, it is expressly agreed that Seller shall never have any
liability to Purchaser with respect to any breach or failure of Sections
9.1(a)(i), (ii), or (iii) greater than that which it might have as the
operator to a non-operator under the applicable operating agreement (or, in
the absence of such an agreement, under the AAPL 610 (1989 Revision) form
Operating Agreement), IT BEING RECOGNIZED THAT, UNDER SUCH AGREEMENTS AND SUCH
FORM, THE OPERATOR IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS OWN NEGLIGENCE, AND HAS NO
RESPONSIBILITY OTHER THAN FOR GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.

9.2 Successor Operator. Purchaser acknowledges that it desires to succeed
Seller as operator of those Acquired Assets or portions thereof that Seller
may, as of the Closing, operate. Purchaser further acknowledges and agrees
that Seller cannot and does not covenant or warrant that Purchaser or any
Affiliate of Purchaser shall become successor operator of such Acquired Assets
or portions thereof. Seller and Purchaser agree however that, as to the
Acquired Assets that Seller operates, prior to Closing they shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts (at no out-of-pocket cost to Seller) to have
Purchaser designated, to the extent legally possible and permitted under any
applicable joint operating agreements, as successor operator of such Acquired
Assets effective as of the Closing, and Purchaser hereby consents and agrees
to accept such designation and the responsibilities and Liabilities as the
operator of such Acquired Assets. 

9.3 HSR Act. If applicable, within ten (10) Business Days following the
Execution Date, Purchaser and Seller will each prepare and simultaneously file
with the DOJ and the FTC the notification and report form required for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the HSR Act and request early
termination of the waiting period thereunder. Purchaser and Seller agree to
respond promptly to any inquiries from the DOJ or the FTC concerning such
filings and to comply in all material respects with the filing requirements of
the HSR Act. Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate with each other and, subject
to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, shall promptly furnish all
information to the other Party that is reasonably necessary in connection with
Purchaser's and Seller's compliance with the HSR Act. Purchaser and Seller
shall keep each other fully advised with respect to any material requests from
or material communications with the DOJ or FTC concerning such filings and, to
the extent reasonably practicable, shall consult with each other with respect
to all responses thereto. Each of Purchaser and Seller shall use its
reasonable efforts to take all actions reasonably necessary and appropriate in
connection with any HSR Act filing to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Purchaser
be required to take any actions that Purchaser reasonably determines will
materially impair or substantially reduce the overall benefits Purchaser
expects to to realize from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including, but not limited to: (i) entering into any settlement, undertaking,
consent decree, stipulation or agreement with the FTC, DOJ or other
Governmental Authority; (ii) litigating, challenging or taking any other
action with respect to any judicial or administrative action or proceeding by
the FTC, DOJ or other Governmental Authority; or (iii) divesting or otherwise
holding separate, or taking any other action (or otherwise agreeing to do any
of the foregoing) with respect to any of its or its respective Affiliate's
businesses, assets or properties. The filing fees associated with any such HSR
Act filing shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Seller and fifty percent
(50%) by Purchaser.

9.4 Governmental Bonds; Guarantees. Purchaser acknowledges that none of the
bonds, letters of credit, guarantees, and other forms of financial assurance,
if any, posted by Seller or its Affiliates with Governmental Authorities
and/or other Third Parties relating to any of the Acquired Assets are
transferable to Purchaser. Prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall deliver
to Seller evidence of Purchaser or Purchaser's Affiliate having posted all
bonds, letters of credit, and other security with all applicable Governmental
Authorities meeting the requirements of such authorities necessary for Seller
to own and, where appropriate, operate, the Acquired Assets. In addition,
Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller in order to cause Seller and its
Affiliates to be released, as of the Closing Date, from all bonds, letters of
credit, guarantees, and other credit support put in place by Seller or its
Affiliates relating to any of the Acquired Assets to the extent set forth in
Schedule 9.4 or otherwise required under any Material Contract listed on
Schedule 7.13 (the "Guarantees"). Without limiting the foregoing, if required
by the counterparty to any Guarantee, Purchaser shall provide, effective as of
the Closing Date, substitute arrangements of Purchaser or its Affiliates
covering all periods covered by the Guarantees. In the event that any
counterparty to any such Guarantee does not release Seller and its Affiliates,
then, from and after Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify Seller or its relevant
Affiliate against all amounts incurred by Seller or its relevant Affiliate
under such Guarantee (and all costs incurred in connection with such
Guarantee); provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser shall have no
obligation to indemnify Seller for any bond, letter of credit, guarantee or
other credit support to the extent it is not set forth on Schedule 9.4 as of
the Execution Date or otherwise required under any Material Contract listed on
Schedule 7.13. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, any cash placed in escrow by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller
pursuant to the Guarantees must be returned to Seller, and shall be an
Excluded Asset.

9.5 Material Required Consents.

(a) With respect to each Material Required Consent set forth on Schedule 7.8,
reasonably promptly after the Execution Date (and, with respect to each
Material Required Consent that is not set forth on Schedule 7.8 but is
discovered by either Party after the Execution Date and before the Defect
Notice Deadline, reasonably promptly after the discovery thereof, and, with
respect to each other consent 

under an Acquired Lease identified by Purchaser to Seller after the Execution
Date and before the Defect Notice Deadline, reasonably promptly after the
Purchaser identifies such consent to Seller), Seller shall send to the holder
of each such consent a notice in material compliance with the contractual
provisions applicable to such consent seeking such holder's consent to the
Contemplated Transactions. Seller and Purchaser will thereafter use their
commercially reasonable efforts (at no out-of-pocket cost or expense to either
Party) to obtain such consents. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, and subject to the satisfaction of Seller's covenants under
this Section 9.5, Seller will have no liability to Purchaser for failure to
obtain any such consents.

(b) If, as of the Closing Date, a holder of a Material Required Consent has
not yet delivered such Material Required Consent and the time for granting
such consent has not expired, then (1) the Acquired Assets covered by that
Material Required Consent shall not be conveyed to Purchaser at Closing, (2)
the Base Fixed Purchase Price will be reduced by the Allocated Value of the
Acquired Assets so excluded and such aggregate amount shall be deposited by
Purchaser into the Escrow Account, and (3) Seller and Purchase shall deliver
to the Escrow Agent a fully executed Escrowed Assignment of such Acquired
Assets. If Acquired Assets have not been conveyed to Purchaser at the Closing
due to a failure to obtain a Material Required Consent, and if such Material
Required Consent has been received or deemed received pursuant to the terms of
the underlying agreement or instrument on or before the Final Settlement Date,
then (i) Seller shall so notify Purchaser and (ii) within five (5) days after
Purchaser's receipt of such notice, Purchaser and Seller shall issue joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent to deliver (A) to Purchaser the
Escrowed Assignment and (B) to Seller an amount equal to the Allocated Value
of the Acquired Assets covered by such Escrowed Assignment (together with any
interest earned thereon), subject to further adjustments in accordance with
Section 3.3, effective as of the Effective Time; in each case, in accordance
with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. If Acquired Assets have not been
conveyed to Purchaser at the Closing due to a failure to obtain a Material
Required Consent, and if such Material Required Consent has not been received
or deemed received pursuant to the terms of the underlying agreement or
instrument on or before the Final Settlement Date, then (i) Seller shall so
notify Purchaser and (ii) within five (5) days after Purchaser's receipt of
such notice, Purchaser and Seller shall issue joint written instructions to
the Escrow Agent to deliver (A) to Seller the Escrowed Assignment and (B) to
Purchaser an amount equal to the Allocated Value of the Acquired Assets
covered by such Escrowed Assignment (together with any interest earned
thereon); in each case, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

(c) With respect to each consent to assignment pertaining to the Assets and
the Contemplated Transactions other than a Material Required Consent,
Purchaser shall have no claim against, and hereby releases and agrees to
defend and indemnify the Indemnified Seller Parties from any Claim or Loss
for, the failure to obtain such consent, and Purchaser shall be solely
responsible from and after Closing for any and all Claims and Losses arising
from the failure to obtain such consents.

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, subject to
Section 9.5(e), in cases where a Material Required Consent has not been
obtained as of the Closing with respect to an Acquired Contract and Purchaser
is assigned the Acquired Assets to which the Acquired Contract relates but the
Acquired Contract is not transferred to Purchaser, then the following shall
apply: (i) Seller and Purchaser shall continue after Closing to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Material Required Consent so
that such Acquired Contract can be transferred to Purchaser upon receipt of
the Material Required Consent; (ii) the Acquired Contract shall be held by
Seller for the benefit of Purchaser; (iii) Purchaser shall pay all amounts due
thereunder; and (iv) Purchaser shall be responsible for all Liabilities under
such Acquired Contract and for the performance of any obligations under such
Acquired Contract (excluding any obligation to provide any bonds, letters of
credit, guarantees or other credit support) to the extent that Purchaser has
been transferred the Acquired Assets necessary to perform under such Acquired
Contract until such Material Required Consent is obtained. With respect to any
Acquired 

Contract for which the applicable Material Required Consent for the assignment
or transfer to the Purchaser is obtained at any time, Seller shall transfer
such Acquired Contract to Purchaser by execution and delivery of an instrument
of conveyance in the form of the Assignment and Assumption Agreement.

(e) In addition, the Parties covenant and agree as set forth in Exhibit N (the
"Contract Solution").

9.6 Preferential Rights.

(a) With respect to each Preferential Right set forth on Schedule 7.9,
reasonably promptly after the Execution Date (and, with respect to each
Preferential Right that is not set forth on Schedule 7.9 but is discovered by
either Party after the Execution Date and before the Defect Notice Deadline,
reasonably promptly after the discovery thereof), Seller shall send to the
holder of each such Preferential Right a notice in material compliance with
the contractual provisions applicable to such Preferential Right.

(b) If, prior to Closing, a holder of a Preferential Right has notified Seller
that it elects to exercise its Preferential Right and purchase the Acquired
Assets (or portions thereof) to which its Preferential Right applies, then the
Acquired Assets subject to such Preferential Right shall be excluded from the
Acquired Assets to be assigned to Purchaser at the Closing (but only to the
extent of the portions of such Acquired Assets affected by the Preferential
Right, and subject to the remaining provisions of this Section 9.6), and the
Base Fixed Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of the
Acquired Assets (or portions thereof) so excluded. Seller shall be entitled to
all proceeds paid by any Person exercising a Preferential Right prior to
Closing. If such holder of such Preferential Right thereafter fails to
consummate the purchase of the Acquired Assets covered by such Preferential
Right on or before the end of the period of time under such Preferential Right
for closing such sale and Seller is permitted to transfer such Acquired Assets
(or portions thereof) to Purchaser pursuant to the terms of such Preferential
Right, then (i) Seller shall so notify Purchaser, (ii) within ten (10)
Business Days after Purchaser's receipt of such notice, Purchaser shall
purchase and accept from Seller such Acquired Assets pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement and for the Allocated Value of such Acquired Assets, subject to
adjustments in accordance with Section 3.3, and (iii) Seller shall assign to
Purchaser such Acquired Assets pursuant to an instrument in substantially the
same form as the Assignment. If, as of the Closing Date, a Preferential Right
has (A) expired without exercise, (B) been waived, or (C) not been exercised
or waived and the time for exercising such Preferential Right has not expired,
then the Acquired Assets covered by that Preferential Right shall be sold and
transferred to Purchaser at Closing subject to the rights of the Preferential
Right holder, and no adjustment to the Fixed Purchase Price will be made with
respect to such Preferential Right and, in the event the holder of such
Preferential Right thereafter exercises such Preferential Right, Purchaser
will comply with all of the terms thereof, will convey the applicable Acquired
Assets to the holder of the Preferential Right, and will be entitled to all
proceeds paid by such holder with respect thereto.

9.7 Casualty Loss. If, after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing Date,
a Casualty Loss occurs with respect to a portion of the Acquired Assets, then,
notwithstanding such Casualty Loss, this Agreement shall remain in full force
and effect and (a) Purchaser will nevertheless be required to close, (b) there
shall be no reduction of the Base Fixed Purchase Price in respect of such
Casualty Loss (except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Section 9.7),
and (c) upon Closing, Purchaser shall be entitled to all rights of Seller, if
any, to insurance proceeds under insurance policies issued by Third Parties,
to condemnation awards, and to other claims against Third Parties with respect
to the Casualty Loss (excluding any Liabilities of or against any Indemnified
Seller Parties); provided, however, Seller shall reserve and retain (and
Purchaser shall assign to Seller) all rights, title, interests, and claims
against Third Parties for the recovery of Seller's costs and expenses (if any)
incurred prior to the Closing in pursuing or asserting any such insurance
claims or other rights against Third Parties with respect to any such Casualty
Loss. 

Until Closing (or if no Closing occurs, termination of this Agreement), Seller
shall maintain insurance coverage it currently has in effect with respect to
the Acquired Properties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the amount of the
Casualty Loss is greater than $1,000,000, then (i) Purchaser shall
nevertheless be required to close and the Base Fixed Purchase Price will be
reduced by the lesser of (1) the aggregate amount necessary to repair or
restore the affected Acquired Asset(s) to its condition prior to such Casualty
Loss or (2) the Allocated Value of the affected Acquired Asset(s); provided
that if such amount is in dispute as of Closing, then the amount determined in
good faith by Seller after consultation with its insurers shall be used to
adjust the Base Fixed Purchase Price at Closing and such dispute shall be
finally determined by the Accounting Referee in accordance with Section 3.5,
and (ii) Seller shall retain all rights to insurance, condemnation awards and
other claims against Third Parties with respect to the Casualty Loss.

9.8 Revenues. Seller shall be entitled to all amounts earned from the sale of
Hydrocarbons produced prior to the Effective Time from or attributable to the
Acquired Properties and Purchaser shall be entitled to all amounts earned from
the sale of Hydrocarbons produced on or after the Effective Time from or
attributable to the Acquired Properties. After the Closing, any revenues
received by Seller applicable to any post-Effective Time production of
Hydrocarbons from the Acquired Properties shall be paid by Seller to Purchaser
within thirty (30) days after receipt of such revenues, and any revenues
received by Purchaser applicable to any pre-Effective Time production of
Hydrocarbons from the Acquired Properties shall be paid by Purchaser to Seller
within thirty (30) days after receipt of such revenues. Payments under this
Section 9.8 shall not constitute an adjustment to any portion of the Fixed
Purchase Price. Adjustments to the Fixed Purchase Price after the Closing
shall be made only under Section 3.5.

9.9 Suspense Accounts. At the Closing, Seller shall transfer to Purchaser, and
Purchaser shall assume, the suspense accounts maintained by Seller related to
the amounts set forth on Schedule 7.16 holding monies payable to Third Party
owners of royalty, overriding royalty, working, or other interests in respect
of past production of Hydrocarbons attributable to the Acquired Properties. At
the Closing, Purchaser shall be deemed to assume full and complete Liability
and responsibility for maintaining and administering all such suspense
accounts and the proper handling and payment of all such suspended amounts, as
well as for compliance with all unclaimed property Laws.

9.10 Employee Matters.

(a) Business Employees. Reasonably promptly following the Execution Date,
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Purchaser a
list of each employee (i) of Seller or its Affiliates, including any such
individual on a leave of absence, (ii) who provides services in respect of the
ownership, management, operation and/or maintenance of any of the Acquired
Assets or the business of Seller with respect thereto, and (iii) whom Seller
agrees to make available to Purchaser (each, a "Business Employee"), and
Purchaser may offer employment (effective as of the earlier of (X) the date
such Business Employee is no longer providing services under the Transition
Services Agreement or (Y) the last day of the Transition Services Agreement)
to any or all of such Business Employees. Such list shall also include such
Business Employee's (A) name; (B) job title; (C) date of hire; and (D) base
salary or hourly wage rate, as applicable. Each offer of employment by
Purchaser to a Business Employee shall be in writing. Each Business Employee
who accepts such an offer of employment and commences employment with
Purchaser is referred to herein as a "Transferred Employee" as of his or her
effective date of hire.

(b) Purchaser and Seller intend that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall not result in a severance-qualifying termination of employment
of any Transferred Employee prior to or upon the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that the Transferred Employees
will have continuous and uninterrupted employment immediately before and
immediately after the effective date of hire, and Purchaser and Seller shall
make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure 

the same; provided, however, that Seller shall be responsible for any
severance payable to any Business Employee that is triggered under any
Employee Benefit Plan.

(c) COBRA. Seller and its selling group (as defined in Treasury Regulation
Section 54.4980B-9, QandA-2(b)) shall be solely responsible for providing
continuation coverage to the extent required by Section 4980B of the Code to
those individuals who are "MandA qualified beneficiaries" as defined in Treasury
Regulation Section 54.4980B-9, QandA-4(b) with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (other than the Transferred Employees).
Purchaser shall be responsible for COBRA continuation coverage for any
Transferred Employee who incurs a "qualifying event" (as such term is defined
in Section 4980B(f)(3) of the Code) on or following the Closing Date.

(d) No Third Party Beneficiaries. The provisions of this Section 9.10 are
solely for the benefit of the respective Parties to this Agreement and nothing
in this Section 9.10, express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person,
including any employee (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof), any Third
Party beneficiary rights or other rights or remedies, including any right to
continuance of employment or any other service relationship with Purchaser,
Seller or any of their Affiliates, or any right to compensation or benefits or
any term of condition of employment or service of any nature or kind
whatsoever under this Agreement or otherwise. Nothing in this Section 9.10,
express or implied, shall: (i) interfere with the right of Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates to terminate the employment or other service relationship of
any Transferred Employee at any time, (ii) obligate Purchaser or its
Affiliates to adopt, enter into or maintain any benefit or compensation plan,
program or arrangement at any time, (iii) be construed as the establishment of
or an amendment to any benefit or compensation plan, program, policy,
agreement, arrangement or contract, or (iv) limit the ability of Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any benefit or
compensation plan, program, policy, agreement, arrangement or contract.

9.11 Non-Solicitation; No-Hire. From and after the Closing Date until the
first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date, without Seller's prior written
consent, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall hire, retain, or
attempt to hire or retain any employee of Seller or in any way interfere with
the relationship between Seller and any of its employees; provided, however,
the non-solicitation restriction in this Section 9.11 shall not apply in the
event an employee of Seller contacts Purchaser (or any of its Affiliates)
regarding employment in response to an advertisement identifying employment
opportunities published by Purchaser (or any of its Affiliates) in a newspaper
of general circulation or on its web site or if an employee of Seller contacts
Purchaser (or any of its Affiliates) without having been directly solicited.
Purchaser shall be permitted to contact any of Seller's independent
contractors whose services relate to the Assets to discuss post-Closing
services.

9.12 Confidentiality. Purchaser acknowledges that, pursuant to its access to
the Acquired Records, Acquired Assets, and other information, Purchaser will
become privy to confidential and other information of Seller and its
Affiliates, and agrees that such information shall be held confidential by
Purchaser and its Entity Representatives in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement. Unless and until the Closing, the Confidentiality
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. If Closing should occur, then
the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate except as to (a) information
related to the Excluded Assets, (b) information related to assets other than
the Assets, and (c) the terms of this Agreement (as to all of which the
Confidentiality Agreement shall extend to and remain in full force and effect
with respect to both Purchaser and Seller, as applicable, following Closing).

9.13 Public Announcements. Neither Party shall make any press release or other
public announcements concerning the transaction contemplated by this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld. Any Party desiring to make a public announcement
shall first give the other Party forty-eight (48) hours written notification
of its desire to make such a public announcement. The written notification
shall include (a) a request for consent to 

make the announcement and (b) a written draft of the text of such public
announcement. Nothing contained herein shall prohibit either Party from
issuing or making a public announcement or statement (or require the consent
of the other party) if such Party deems it necessary to do so in order to
comply with any applicable Law, or any applicable rules, regulations, or
Orders of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction, or with disclosure
requirements of applicable securities Laws or the Securities and Exchange
Commission or any applicable stock exchanges, provided that such Party
provides the other Party with a written draft of the text of such public
announcement prior to issuing or making such public announcement.

9.14 Record Retention. Purchaser, for a period of seven (7) years following
Closing, will (a) retain the Acquired Records, (b) upon reasonable prior
written notice, provide Seller, its Affiliates, and its and their Entity
Representatives with access to the Acquired Records during normal business
hours for review and copying at Seller's expense, and (c) provide Seller, its
Affiliates, and its and their Entity Representatives with access, during
normal business hours, to materials received or produced after Closing
relating to any indemnity claim made under Section 14.2 for review and copying
at Seller's expense.

9.15 Breaches before Closing. During the period prior to Closing, each Party
(the "Notifying Party") shall notify the other Party promptly after the
Notifying Party obtains actual knowledge that any representation or warranty
of the other Party contained in this Agreement is untrue or will be untrue as
of the Closing Date or that any covenant or agreement to be performed or
observed by the other Party prior to or on the Closing Date has not been or
will not be so performed or observed; provided that Purchaser shall not be
deemed to have such actual knowledge solely by virtue of the inclusion of
materials in the Intralinks virtual data room hosted by Seller.

9.16 Amendment of Schedules. Purchaser agrees that, with respect to the
representations and warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement, Seller
shall have the continuing right (but not the obligation) until the Closing to
add, supplement, or amend the Schedules to its representations and warranties
with respect to any matter hereafter arising which, if existing at the
Execution Date or thereafter, would have been required to be set forth or
described in such Schedules. For purposes of determining whether the
conditions set forth in Section 10.3 have been fulfilled, the Schedules to
Seller's representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to include only that information contained therein on the Execution
Date and shall be deemed to exclude all information contained in any addition,
supplement, or amendment thereto; provided, however, if Closing shall occur,
then all matters disclosed pursuant to any such addition, supplement, or
amendment at or prior to Closing shall be waived and Purchaser shall not be
entitled to make a claim with respect thereto pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement or otherwise.

9.17 Hedging Contracts. The Parties covenant and agree as set forth in Exhibit
M (the "Hedging Solution").

9.18 Water Assets. The Parties acknowledge that Seller currently owns a fifty
percent (50%) undivided interest in the water assets described on Exhibit C
and related contracts (the "Water Assets"), some of which are currently used
in connection with the operation of the Acquired Properties. Seller shall,
from and after the Execution Date and for a period of one (1) year following
the Closing, use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate and consummate
an exchange agreement (upon terms reasonably acceptable to Seller) with
Seller's co-owner in the Water Assets to geographically partition ownership of
the Water Assets such that thereafter Seller would own all of a portion of the
Water Assets and such co-owner would own all of the remaining portion of the
Water Assets (such transaction, a "Water Assets Transaction"). Purchaser shall
have the right to approve any Water Assets Transaction in its sole discretion,
which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned. If
a Water Assets Transaction is consummated prior to Closing, then the Parties
agree that Seller will transfer to Purchaser (or to Purchaser's Affiliate
designee) at Closing, for no additional consideration and (except as set forth
in Section 7.12) without 

warranty of any kind, those Water Assets as are then being used in connection
with operation of the Acquired Properties and in and to which Seller then owns
a one hundred percent (100%) interest as a result of such Water Assets
Transaction (the "Applicable Fully Owned Water Assets"). If a Water Assets
Transaction is not consummated prior to Closing, then (a) Seller and Purchaser
will execute and deliver at Closing a services agreement in the form attached
as Exhibit L, and (b) if such a Water Assets Transaction is consummated
thereafter within one (1) year following the Closing, then Seller will
thereafter notify Purchaser of such Water Assets Transaction and will transfer
to Purchaser (or to Purchaser's Affiliate designee), and Purchaser (or such
designee) will accept, for no additional consideration and (except as set
forth in Section 7.12) without warranty of any kind, the Applicable Fully
Owned Water Assets.

9.19 Firm Transportation Agreements. The Parties covenant and agree as set
forth in Exhibit I (the "Marketing Solution").

9.20 Financing Statements and Cooperation.

(a) Seller acknowledges, without obligation, that Purchaser or its Affiliates
may be required to include statements of revenues and direct operating
expenses and other financial information relating to the Acquired Assets in
documents filed by Purchaser or its Affiliates or assignee with the Securities
Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, or in other
materials (including offering materials for securities offered and sold as
eligible for resale under Rule 144A of the Securities Act), and that such
financial statements may be required to be independently audited (together
with any supplementary oil and gas information required by ASC 932-235, the
"Requisite Financial Statement Information"). At Purchaser's reasonable
request, from and after the Execution Date and for up to twenty four (24)
months after the date of the Closing, Seller shall, at Purchaser's sole cost
and expense, use reasonable efforts to (i) make available to Purchaser such
asset level financial information maintained by Seller (and in the form so
maintained) regarding the Acquired Assets as Purchaser may reasonably request
relating to periods beginning prior to the Closing and necessary for Purchaser
to comply with its obligations under the Securities Act and (ii) upon written
request from Purchaser, reasonably cooperate, and cause its accountants to
reasonably cooperate, with Purchaser and its accountants in connection with
Purchaser's preparation of the Requisite Financial Statement Information.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (A) Seller shall in no event be
required to create new records relating to the Acquired Assets or financial
statements, (B) the access to be provided to Purchaser shall not interfere
with Seller's ability to prepare its own financial statements or its regular
conduct of business and shall be made available during Seller's normal
business hours and (C) such assistance shall not include any actions that
Seller reasonably believes would result in a violation of any material
agreement or any confidentiality arrangement or the loss of any legal or other
applicable privilege. All non-public or otherwise confidential information
regarding Seller obtained by Purchaser or their representative shall be kept
confidential for a period of one (1) year from such disclosure in accordance
with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement as if the Confidentiality
Agreement were still in effect.

(b) All of the information provided by Seller pursuant to this Section 9.20 is
given without any representation or warranty, express or implied, and no
member of Indemnified Seller Parties or Seller's accountants shall have any
liability or responsibility with respect thereto. Purchaser shall reimburse
Seller for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by Seller in complying with this Section 9.20.

TERMINATION

12.1 Termination. This Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein may
be terminated at any time prior to Closing:

(a) by the mutual written agreement of the Parties;

(b) by Seller, if Purchaser has materially breached this Agreement and such
breach causes any of the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 10.2 not
to be satisfied (or, if prior to Closing, is of such a magnitude or effect
that it will not be possible for such condition to be satisfied); provided,
however, that in the case of a breach that is capable of being cured,
Purchaser shall have until the date that is ten (10) Business Days following
receipt of such notice to cure all such breaches, and termination under this
Section 12.1(b) shall not become effective unless Purchaser fails to cure all
such breaches prior to the end of such period;

(c) by Purchaser, if Seller has materially breached this Agreement and such
breach causes any of the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 10.3 not
to be satisfied (or, if prior to Closing, is of such a magnitude or effect
that it will not be possible for such condition to be satisfied); provided,
however, that in the case of a breach that is capable of being cured, Seller
shall have until the date that is ten (10) Business Days following receipt of
such notice to cure all such breaches, and termination under this Section
12.1(c) shall not become effective unless Seller fails to cure all such
breaches prior to the end of such period;

(d) by either Party, if the Closing has not occurred on or before September
27, 2017 (the "Outside Date"), provided that such failure has not resulted
primarily from the terminating Party's material breach of its representations,
warranties, covenants, or agreements contained in this Agreement;

(e) by Seller, if either (i) the full amount of the Deposit or the full amount
of the Hedging Deposit has not been received by Seller from Purchaser within
one (1) Business Day following the Execution Date; or

(f) by either Party if the condition set forth in Section 10.1(d) has not been

provided, however, neither Seller nor Purchaser shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.1(b), Section 12.1(c) or
Section 12.1(d) if such Party is at such time in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements contained in this
Agreement.

12.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination, written notice
thereof will be given to the other Party specifying the provision pursuant to

(a) Purchaser Breach; Seller Remedies. If Seller is entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 12.1(b) and each of the conditions contained in
Section 10.3 has been either fulfilled or waived in writing (other than
conditions the fulfillment of which is expressly provided to occur at the
Closing), then Seller shall have the right, as its sole and exclusive remedy
and in lieu of all other damages, to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 12.1(b), as applicable, and, in connection therewith, receive the
Deposit as liquidated damages (and not as a penalty) free and clear of any
claims thereon by Purchaser, in lieu of all other damages. THE PARTIES
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE EXTENT OF DAMAGES TO SELLER OCCASIONED BY SUCH DEFAULT,
FAILURE, INABILITY, OR REFUSAL BY PURCHASER WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE OR EXTREMELY
IMPRACTICAL TO ASCERTAIN AND THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE DEPOSIT IS A FAIR AND
REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF SUCH DAMAGES UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. If Seller is
entitled to the Deposit pursuant to this Section 12.2(a) in connection with a
termination pursuant to Section 12.1(b), then the Parties shall, within five
(5) Business Days of the date that this Agreement is terminated, execute and
deliver to the Escrow Agent written instructions instructing the Escrow Agent
to disburse via wire transfer of immediately available funds the entirety of
the Deposit to Seller free and clear of any claims thereon by Purchaser. For
the avoidance of doubt, prior to Closing, retention of the Deposit shall
constitute full and complete satisfaction of any and all damages that Seller
may have against Purchaser, and Seller shall have no right to seek any other
remedies available at Law or in equity against Purchaser, including specific
performance. The provision for payment of the Deposit as liquidated damages in
this Section 12.2(a) has been included because, in the event of a termination
of this Agreement permitting Seller to retain the Deposit, the actual damages
to be incurred by Seller can reasonably be expected to approximate the amount
of liquidated damages called for herein and because the actual amount of such
damages would be difficult, if not impossible, to measure accurately.

(b) Seller Breach; Purchaser Remedies. If Purchaser is entitled to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.1(c), and each of the conditions
contained in Section 10.2 has been either fulfilled or waived in writing
(other than conditions the fulfillment of which is expressly provided to occur
at the Closing), then Purchaser shall have the right, as its sole and
exclusive remedy and in lieu of all other damages, to elect to either (i)
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.1(c) and, in conjunction
therewith, receive a return of the Deposit and seek to recover damages from
Seller in an amount up to but not exceeding the amount of the Deposit, or (ii)
seek the specific performance of Seller hereunder. If Purchaser is entitled to
the return of the Deposit pursuant to this Section 12.2(b), then the Parties
shall, within five (5) Business Days of the date that this Agreement is
terminated, execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent written instructions
instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse via wire transfer of immediately
available funds the entirety of the Deposit to Purchaser free and clear of any
claims thereon by Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, if Purchaser is entitled
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.1(c) and Purchaser elects
to seek, but is unable to obtain, the specific performance of Seller pursuant
to subclause (ii), above, Purchaser shall nevertheless be entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.1(c) and receive the Deposit
pursuant to subclause (i) above and seek to recover monetary damages from
Seller in an amount up to, but not exceeding, the amount of the Deposit.

(c) Termination for other Reasons. If this Agreement is terminated for any
reason other than as set forth in Section 12.1(b) or Section 12.1(c) then the
Parties shall have no liability or obligation hereunder as a result of such
termination, and the Parties shall, within five (5) Business Days of the date
that this Agreement is terminated, execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent
written instructions instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse via wire
transfer of immediately available funds the entirety of the Deposit to
Purchaser free and clear of any claims thereon by Seller. 

(d) Hedging Transactions and the Hedging Deposit and Deposit. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, in the event that this Agreement is
terminated prior to Closing, Seller shall be entitled to recover from
Purchaser any and all Losses and Liabilities suffered by Seller in connection
with the Hedging Transactions all as provided in Exhibit M, and the Hedging
Deposit and Deposit shall be retained by Seller and/or (except, with respect
to the Deposit, to the extent Seller is entitled under Section 12.2 to retain
the Deposit) returned to Purchaser in accordance with the provisions of
Exhibit M.

12.3 Return of Documentation and Confidentiality. In addition to any
obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, upon termination of this
Agreement, Purchaser shall promptly return or destroy (and provide written
certification of such destruction) to Seller all title, engineering,
geological and geophysical data, environmental assessments and/or reports,
maps, documents, and other information furnished by any Indemnified Seller
Party to any Indemnified Purchaser Party or prepared by or on behalf of
Purchaser in connection with its due diligence investigation of the Acquired
Assets and the Indemnified Purchaser Parties shall not retain any copies,
extracts, or other reproductions in whole or in part of such documents and
information. An officer of Purchaser shall certify, on behalf of Purchaser
(and not in his or her individual capacity), Purchaser's compliance with this
Section 12.3 to Seller in writing.

ARTICLE XIII 
TAX MATTERS

13.1 Apportionment.

(a) Straddle Period. All Property and Production Taxes for any taxable period
that begins prior to and ends on or after the Effective Time (a "Straddle
Period") shall be apportioned between Purchaser and Seller as of the Effective
Time, (i) in the case of Property Taxes, based on the number of days in the
Straddle Period that occurred before the Effective Time, in the case of
Seller, and on or after the Effective Time, in the case of Purchaser (provided
that West Virginia Property Taxes for which the assessed valuation is based,
in whole or in part, on the value of production in prior years, shall be
apportioned between Purchaser and Seller as of the Effective Time based on the
period of ownership of the applicable Acquired Assets during the "assessment
year" as defined in WV Code §11-3-1(f)(2)), and (ii) in the case of Production
Taxes, based on the Production Taxes that relate to (A) actual severance or
production, expressed in volume or units, or other transactions that give rise
to such Production Taxes occurring during the days in the Straddle Period that
occurred before the Effective Time (in the case of Seller) and (B) actual
severance or production, expressed in volume or units, or other transactions
that give rise to such Production Taxes occurring during the days in the
Straddle Period that occur on or after the Effective Time (in the case of
Purchaser).

(b) Liability of Parties. At the Closing, subject to Section 13.1(a), (i)
Purchaser shall assume all Liability for Property and Production Taxes
attributable to the ownership or operation of the Acquired Assets with respect
to all taxable periods that begin on or after the Effective Time, and (ii)
Seller shall retain all Liability for Property and Production Taxes
attributable to Seller's ownership or operation of the Acquired Assets with
respect to all taxable periods ending prior to the Effective Time.

(c) To the extent the actual amount of a Property and Production Tax is not
known at the time an adjustment is to be made with respect to such Property
and Production Tax pursuant to Section 3.3, Section 3.4 or Section 3.5, as
applicable, the Parties shall utilize the most recent information available in
estimating the amount of such Property and Production Tax for purposes of such
adjustment. To the extent the actual amount of a Property and Production Tax
(or the amount thereof paid or economically borne by a Party) is ultimately
determined to be different than the amount (if any) that was taken into
account in the Final Settlement Statement as finally determined pursuant to
Section 3.5, timely payments 

will be made from one Party to the other to the extent necessary to cause each
Party to bear the amount of such Property and Production Tax that is allocable
to such Party under this Section 13.1.

(d) Rights of Parties. Purchaser shall have the right to all deductions,
credits, and refunds pertaining to Property and Production Taxes allocated to
Purchaser pursuant to this Section 13.1 and Seller shall have the right to all
deductions, credits and refunds pertaining to Property and Production Taxes
allocated to Seller pursuant to this Section 13.1. All deductions, credits,
and refunds pertaining to Property Taxes with respect to a Straddle Period
shall be apportioned between Purchaser and Seller as of the Effective Time,
based on the number of days in the Straddle Period that occurred before the
Effective Time (in the case of Seller) and on or after the Effective Time (in
the case of Purchaser).

13.2 Tax Reports and Returns. Purchaser shall timely file all Tax Returns with
respect to Property and Production Taxes and pay all Property and Production
Taxes with respect to such Tax Returns for any Straddle Period (to the extent
such Tax Returns are required to be filed after Closing) and all Tax periods
that begin on or after the Effective Time, and Seller shall timely file all
Tax Returns with respect to Property and Production Taxes and pay all Property
and Production Taxes with respect to such Tax Returns for any Straddle Period
(to the extent such Tax Returns are required to be filed before Closing) and
all Tax periods that end before the Effective Time (regardless of when due).
Seller shall promptly forward to Purchaser any reports or documents received
by Seller after the Closing that relate to the Straddle Period, and provide
any information in Seller's possession or control that relate to the Straddle
Period that is necessary for Purchaser to file any Tax Returns relating to
Property and Production Taxes with respect to the Straddle Period in
accordance with this Section 13.2. The Parties agree that (x) this Section
13.2 is intended to solely address the timing and manner in which certain Tax
Returns relating to Property and Production Taxes are filed and the Property
and Production Taxes shown thereon are paid to the applicable taxing
authority, and (y) nothing in this Section 13.2 shall be interpreted as
altering the manner in which Property and Production Taxes are allocated to
and economically borne by the Parties.

13.3 Transfer Taxes. The Purchase Price excludes, and Purchaser shall be
liable for the entire amount of any sales, use, excise, stock, stamp,
documentary, filing, recording, registration, authorization, and similar
Taxes, fees, transfer fees, and charges incurred or required to be paid by any
of the Indemnified Parties in connection with the Contemplated Transactions
("Transfer Taxes"). Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in establishing the
applicability of any occasional sale or other exemption from Transfer Taxes
that may be applicable to the transfer to Purchaser of the Acquired Assets. If
required by applicable law, Seller will charge and collect any applicable
sales Tax unless Purchaser provides a valid exemption or direct pay
certificate. Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate with one another in the
preparation of any necessary Tax Returns and other related documentation with
respect to such Transfer Taxes (including any exemption certificates and forms
as each may request to establish an exemption from (or otherwise reduce) or
make a report with respect to Transfer Taxes).

13.4 Form 8594. Seller and Purchaser acknowledge that, under Section 1060 of
the Code, the Parties must report information regarding the allocation of the
Purchase Price and any other amounts treated as consideration for federal
Income Tax purposes to the United States Secretary of Treasury by attaching
Department of Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Form 8594 (Asset Acquisition
Statement under Section 1060) to their federal income Tax Returns for the Tax
period which includes the Closing Date. Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate
in the preparation of Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 to report the
allocation of the Purchase Price among the Acquired Assets. To the extent
permitted by Code Section 1060 and any Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder, any such allocations shall be consistent with the Purchase Price
allocation as set forth in Exhibit B. The allocations shall be revised, as
necessary, in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code to take into
account any adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement,
including any indemnification payments pursuant to Article XIV. Any disputes
between the Parties as to the allocation of the Purchase Price or adjustment
to the allocation pursuant to this 

Section 13.5 shall be resolved through binding dispute resolution by the
Accounting Referee in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set
forth in Sections 3.5(d)-3.5(f), mutatis mutandis. Except as required by Law,
none of the Parties (or their applicable Affiliates) shall take any Tax
position (whether in audits, on Tax Returns, or otherwise) that is
inconsistent with the allocation of the Purchase Price (plus other capitalized
costs) as so agreed or as adjusted; provided, however, that neither Party
shall be unreasonably impeded in its ability and discretion to negotiate,
compromise and/or settle any Tax audit, claim or similar proceedings in
connection with such allocation.

13.5 Section 1031 Exchange Accommodation.

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, but subject to this
Section 13.5, either Party (in such capacity, the "Exchanging Party") may at
any time prior to Closing assign all or any portion of its rights under this
Agreement and take such other steps as required to satisfy the requirements of
one or more like-kind exchange pursuant to Code section 1031 with respect to
such Exchanging Party (an "Exchange Transaction"). Subject to the other
provisions of this Section 13.5, the other Party (in such capacity, the "Non-
Exchanging Party") shall, as and when reasonably requested by the Exchanging
Party from time to time, execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, all such documents and instruments, and take, or cause to be taken,
all such further actions as the Exchanging Party may determine is reasonably
necessary or appropriate for purposes of causing the Contemplated
Transactions, in whole or in part, to satisfy the requirements of Code section
1031 with respect to the Exchanging Party.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless the Exchanging Party provides for
reimbursement or indemnity reasonably acceptable to the Non-Exchanging Party:
(i) the Non-Exchanging Party shall not be obligated to pay any additional
costs or incur any additional obligations or Liabilities in connection with
the Contemplated Transactions if such costs, obligations, or Liabilities arise
out of or result from the Exchange Transaction; and (ii) the Non-Exchanging
Party shall not be obligated to take title to any other assets or property, or
to undertake any obligations to any Third Party, as a result of the Exchange
Transaction. The Non-Exchanging Party shall provide no assurance to the
Exchanging Party that any particular tax treatment will be given to the
Exchanging Party as a result of the Exchange Transaction, and the Non-
Exchanging Party shall have no obligation to the Exchanging Party or any other
Person if the Exchange Transaction fails to qualify as a "like kind exchange"
under Code section 1031 or similar state or local tax provision.

(c) The Parties acknowledge and agree that a whole or partial assignment by
the Exchanging Party of rights under this Agreement or any of the Acquired
Assets to a qualified intermediaries or exchange accommodation titleholder as
required by Code section 1031 and the administrative rules governing same (an
"Intermediary") shall not (i) release the Exchanging Party from any of its
Liabilities and obligations under this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document, (ii) expand any Liabilities or obligations of the Non-Exchanging
Party under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or (iii) delay
the Closing of, or payment under, this Agreement, in connection with the
Exchange Transaction. The Exchanging Party and any such Intermediary, and
their successors and assigns, shall be jointly and severally liable for the
obligations and Liabilities of the Exchanging Party under this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents, and shall indemnify, defend, and hold
harmless the Non-Exchanging Party from and against all Claims and Losses, if
any, arising out of or resulting from an Exchange Transaction without regard
to the Indemnification Threshold, including any Claims and Losses (but only to
the extent such Claims and Losses would not have arisen if the Contemplated
Transactions had been conducted without the Exchange Transaction) arising out
of or resulting from the transfer, assignment, or conveyance of any Acquired
Assets to an Intermediary instead of the Exchanging Party.

13.6 Cooperation. Purchaser and Seller agree to furnish or cause to be
furnished to the other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such
information and assistance relating to the Acquired Assets, 

including access to books and records, as is reasonably necessary for the
filing of all Tax Returns by Purchaser or Seller, the making of any election
relating to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any taxing authority and
the prosecution or defense of any Proceeding relating to any Tax. The Parties
agree to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to
the Acquired Assets relating to any Tax period beginning before the Closing
Date until sixty (60) days after the expiration of the statute of limitations
of the respective Tax periods (taking into account any extensions thereof) and
to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing
authority.

may be exercised on its behalf by Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, pursuant
to this Section 14.4. Seller and Purchaser may elect to exercise or not
exercise indemnification rights under this Section on behalf of the
Indemnified Parties affiliated or associated with such Party in its sole
discretion and shall have no liability hereunder to any such other Indemnified
Party for any action or inaction under this Section 14.4.

14.5 Limitation on Liability.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Seller shall not have any liability for any indemnification under Sections
14.2(a) or (with respect to covenants to be performed prior to Closing)
Section 14.2(b) for any individual Loss unless the amount of such Loss exceeds
the Indemnification Threshold, provided that liabilities with respect to the
breach of the representations and warranties in Section 7.1, Section 7.2,
Section 7.3, Section 7.4, Section 7.5, Section 7.6 and Section 7.7 shall not

Losses and Claims shall have no liability for any portion of such Losses and

14.6 Express Negligence. THE DEFENSE, INDEMNIFICATION, HOLD HARMLESS, AND
RELEASE PROVISIONS AND THE ASSUMPTION OF THE ASSUMED LIABILITIES PROVISIONS
(IN EACH CASE) PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE APPLICABLE WHETHER OR
NOT THE LIABILITIES AND LOSSES IN QUESTION AROSE OR RESULTED SOLELY OR IN PART
FROM THE SOLE, JOINT, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, COMPARATIVE, OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE,
STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER FAULT OR VIOLATION OF LAW OF OR BY ANY INDEMNIFIED
PARTY, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL
MISCONDUCT OF SUCH INDEMNIFIED PARTY. WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT, BOTH
PARTIES AGREE THAT THE PROVISIONS SET OUT IN THIS ARTICLE XIV COMPLY WITH THE
REQUIREMENT, KNOWN AS THE EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE, TO EXPRESSLY STATE IN A
CONSPICUOUS MANNER TO AFFORD FAIR AND ADEQUATE NOTICE THAT THIS AGREEMENT HAS
PROVISIONS REQUIRING THE INDEMNIFYING PARTY TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, JOINT, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, COMPARATIVE, OR CONCURRENT),
STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER FAULT OR VIOLATION OF LAW OF OR BY THE INDEMNIFIED
PARTY, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL
MISCONDUCT OF SUCH INDEMNIFIED PARTY. EACH OF SELLER AND PURCHASER UNDERSTAND
THAT PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY IS SOMETIMES AN INDEMNIFYING PARTY
AND SOMETIMES AN INDEMNIFIED 

PARTY. EACH INDEMNIFYING PARTY REPRESENTS TO THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY (A) THAT
IT, THE INDEMNIFYING PARTY HAS CONSULTED AN ATTORNEY CONCERNING THIS AGREEMENT
OR, IF IT HAS NOT CONSULTED AN ATTORNEY, THAT IT WAS PROVIDED THE OPPORTUNITY
AND HAD THE ABILITY TO SO CONSULT, BUT MADE AN INFORMED DECISION NOT TO DO SO,
AND (B) THAT IT, THE INDEMNIFYING PARTY, FULLY UNDERSTANDS ITS OBLIGATIONS
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

14.7 Exclusive Remedy.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, from
and after Closing, subject to the terms of Article V and Article VI, Section
14.2 (as limited by this Agreement) and the special warranty of title
contained in the Assignment are Purchaser's sole and exclusive remedies
against any Indemnified Seller Party with respect to the Contemplated
Transactions and the sale of the Acquired Assets, including with respect to
breaches of Seller's representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements
contained in this Agreement and all other Claims and Losses arising out of,
relating to, or in connection with the Acquired Assets and the Assumed
Liabilities.

(b) Except for the remedies specified in Section 14.2 (as limited by this
Agreement) and for the special warranty of title contained in the Assignment,
effective as of Closing, subject to the terms of Article V and Article VI,
Purchaser, on its own behalf and on behalf of the other Indemnified Purchaser
Parties, hereby RELEASES, REMISES, AND FOREVER DISCHARGES the Indemnified
Seller Parties from any and all Proceedings, Claims, and Losses whatsoever, in
Law or in equity, known or unknown, absolute or contingent, which Purchaser or
its Affiliates might now or subsequently may have, based on, relating to, or
arising out of the Acquired Assets or the ownership, use, or operation thereof
prior to Closing, or the condition, quality, status, or nature of any of the
Acquired Assets prior to Closing, including rights to contribution under the
CERCLA or any other Environmental Law, breaches of statutory or implied
warranties, nuisance or other tort actions, rights to punitive damages, common
Law rights of contribution, and rights under insurance maintained by Seller or
any of its Affiliates.

(c) No Party or Person is asserting the accuracy, completeness, or truth of
any representation and warranty set forth in this Agreement; rather the
Parties have agreed that should any representation or warranty of any Party
prove inaccurate, incomplete, or untrue, the other Party shall have the
specific rights and remedies herein specified as the exclusive remedy
therefor, but that no other rights, remedies, or causes of action (whether in
Law or in equity or whether in contract or in tort or otherwise) are permitted
to any Party as a result of the failure, breach, inaccuracy, incompleteness,
or untruth of any such representation and warranty.

14.8 Indemnification Procedures. All claims for indemnification under Section
4.1(d), Section 9.4, Section 14.2, and Section 14.3 shall be asserted and
resolved as follows:

(a) For purposes of this Article XIV, the term "Indemnifying Party" when used
in connection with particular Claims or Losses shall mean the Party having an
obligation to indemnify another Person or Persons with respect to such Claims
or Losses pursuant to this Article XIV, and the term "Indemnified Party" when
used in connection with particular Claims or Losses shall mean the Person or
Persons having the right to be indemnified with respect to such Claims or
Losses by a Party pursuant to Article XIV.

(b) To make claim for indemnification under Section 4.1(d), Section 9.4,
Section 14.2, or Section 14.3, an Indemnified Party shall notify the
Indemnifying Party of its claim pursuant to this Section 14.8, including the
specific details of and specific basis under this Agreement for its claim (the
"Claim Notice"). In the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon
a claim by a Third Party against the Indemnified Party (a "Third Party
Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall provide its Claim Notice 

promptly after the Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of the Third Party
Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with respect to
the Third Party Claim, provided that the failure of any Indemnified Party to
give notice of a Third Party Claim as provided in this Section 14.8 shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under Section 4.1(d),
Section 9.4, Section 14.2, or Section 14.3 (as applicable) except to the
extent (and then only to the extent) such failure materially prejudices the
Indemnifying Party's ability to defend against the Third Party Claim. In the
event that the claim for indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or breach
of a representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement, the Claim Notice shall
specify the representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement that was
inaccurate or breached.

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the
Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Party whether it admits or denies its
Liability to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim at
the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, provided that the
Indemnifying Party's failure to respond during such thirty (30) day period
shall be deemed notice that the Indemnifying Party is disputing its Liability.
The Indemnified Party is authorized, prior to and during such thirty (30) day
period, to file any motion, answer, or other pleading that it shall reasonably
deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the
Indemnifying Party and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party.

(d) If the Indemnifying Party admits its Liability, then it shall have the
right and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the
Third Party Claim. Subject to the remaining provisions of this Section
14.8(d), the Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense and
proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof unless the
compromise or settlement includes the payment of any amount by (because of the
Indemnification Deductible or otherwise), the performance of any obligation
by, or the limitation of any material right or benefit of, the Indemnified
Party, in which event such settlement or compromise shall not be effective
without the consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Party agrees to reasonably cooperate in contesting any Third Party Claim which
the Indemnifying Party elects to contest; provided that the Indemnified Party
shall not be required to bring any counterclaim or cross-complaint against any
Person. The Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control, any defense
or settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this Section 14.8(d). An Indemnifying Party shall not, without the
written consent of the Indemnified Party, (i) settle any Third Party Claim or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto which does not
include an unconditional written release of the Indemnified Party from all
liability in respect of such Third Party Claim or (ii) settle any Third Party
Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto in any
manner that may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Party (other
than as a result of money damages covered by the indemnity).

(e) If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its Liability (which it will be
deemed to be disputing if it fails to respond) or admits its Liability but
fails to diligently prosecute or settle the Third Party Claim, then the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend against the Third Party Claim
at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party (if it is ultimately
determined that the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under
this Agreement), with counsel of the Indemnified Party's choosing (though the
Indemnifying Party will still have the right to participate in, but not
control, the defense of such Third-Party Claim at its own expense and with its
own counsel), subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party to admit its
liability and assume the defense of the Third Party Claim at any time prior to
settlement or final determination thereof. If the Indemnifying Party has not
yet admitted its obligation to defend and indemnify the Indemnified Party
against a Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall send written
notice to the Indemnifying Party of any proposed settlement and the
Indemnifying Party shall have the option for ten (10) days following receipt
of such notice to (i) admit in writing its Liability to indemnify the
Indemnified Party from and against the applicable Claims or Losses and consent
to such settlement, 

(ii) if Liability is so admitted, reject, in its reasonable judgment, the
proposed settlement, or (iii) deny Liability. Any failure by the Indemnifying
Party to respond to such notice shall be deemed to be an election under
subsection (iii) above.

(f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of
the Claim Notice to (i) cure the Loss or Claim complained of, (ii) admit its
liability for such Loss or Claim, or (iii) dispute the claim for such Loss or
Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within
such thirty (30) day period that it has cured the Loss or Claim or that it
disputes the claim for such Loss or and Claim, then the Indemnifying Party
shall be deemed to be disputing the claim for such Loss or Claim.

(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, for purposes of this
Article XIV, when determining the amount of Liabilities resulting from a
breach of a representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or in the
certificates delivered by the Parties hereunder (but not for purposes of
determining whether a breach of a representation or warranty has occurred),
all materiality qualifications (including Material Adverse Effect and any
correlative terms) contained in the representations and warranties or in such
certificates shall be disregarded.

other Transaction Documents, in each case, shall survive Closing and remain in
full force and effect indefinitely. 

(f) Representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements shall be of no
further force and effect after the date of their expiration, provided that

Agreement with respect to such a representation, warranty, covenant, or
agreement prior to its expiration date.

(g) Notwithstanding Sections 14.9(a), 14.9(b), 14.9(c), 14.9(d), 14.9(e), and
14.9(f) above: (i) the indemnities in Sections 14.2(a), 14.2(b) and 14.3(b)
shall terminate as of the termination date of each respective representation,
warranty, covenant, or agreement that is subject to indemnification
thereunder, except, in each case, solely as to matters for which a specific
written claim for indemnity has been delivered to the Indemnifying Party on or
before such termination date; (ii) the indemnities in Sections 14.2(i) and
14.2(j) shall survive Closing and remain in full force and effect
indefinitely; (iii) the indemnities in Section 14.3 (other than Section

Section 14.2(h) shall survive Closing without time limit; and (vi) with
respect to the matters set forth in Section 14.2(c) shall survive Closing for
the applicable statute of limitations period.

14.10 Waiver of Right to Rescission. Seller and Purchaser acknowledge that,
following Closing, specific performance or the payment of money, as limited by
the terms of this Agreement, shall be adequate compensation for breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement contained herein or for any
other claim arising in connection with or with respect to the Contemplated
Transactions. As such, following Closing, Purchaser and Seller each waive any
right to rescind this Agreement or any of the Contemplated Transactions.

14.11 Subrogation. To the extent of the indemnification obligations in this
Agreement, Purchaser and Seller hereby waive for themselves and their
respective successors and assigns, including any insurers, any rights to
subrogation for Losses for which such Party is liable or against which such
Party indemnifies any other Person under this Agreement. If required by
applicable insurance policies, each Party shall obtain a waiver of such
subrogation from its insurers.

14.12 Non-Compensatory Damages. NONE OF THE INDEMNIFIED PURCHASER PARTIES NOR
INDEMNIFIED SELLER PARTIES SHALL BE ENTITLED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
TRANSACTION DOCUMENT TO RECOVER FROM SELLER OR PURCHASER, OR THEIR RESPECTIVE
AFFILIATES, ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, REMOTE
OR SPECULATIVE DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS OF ANY KIND (EXCEPT TO THE
EXTENT CONSTITUTING DIRECT DAMAGES) (COLLECTIVELY, "NON-COMPENSATORY DAMAGES")
ARISING UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE CONTEMPLATED
TRANSACTIONS, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT ANY SUCH PARTY SUFFERS SUCH DAMAGES
(INCLUDING COSTS OF DEFENSE AND REASONABLE ATTORNEY'S FEES INCURRED IN
CONNECTION WITH DEFENDING OF SUCH DAMAGES) TO A THIRD PARTY, WHICH DAMAGES
(INCLUDING COSTS OF DEFENSE AND REASONABLE ATTORNEY'S FEES INCURRED IN
CONNECTION WITH DEFENDING AGAINST SUCH DAMAGES) SHALL NOT BE EXCLUDED BY THIS
PROVISION AS TO RECOVERY HEREUNDER. SUBJECT TO THE PRECEDING SENTENCE,
PURCHASER, ON BEHALF OF EACH OF THE INDEMNIFIED PURCHASER PARTIES, AND SELLER,
ON BEHALF OF EACH OF THE INDEMNIFIED SELLER PARTIES, WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO

ARTICLE XV 
MISCELLANEOUS

15.1 Legal Fees. If either Party institutes a Proceeding against the other
Party relating to the provisions of this Agreement, the Party to such
Proceeding which does not prevail will reimburse the prevailing Party therein
(regardless of whether the prevailing Party is the plaintiff or the defendant
in such Proceeding) for the reasonable expenses of attorneys' fees and
disbursements incurred by the prevailing Party. The applicable Governmental
Authority shall be empowered to designate the prevailing party for purposes of
this Section 15.1.

15.2 Expenses.

(a) Except as otherwise specifically provided, all fees, costs, and expenses

connection with the filing and recording of the assignments, conveyances, or
other instruments required to convey title to the Acquired Assets to Purchaser
(including the Assignment) shall be borne by Purchaser.

15.3 Governing Law. This Agreement and all Claims or causes of action (whether
in contract, tort, or based on any other legal theory) that may be based upon,
arise out of, or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution, or
performance of this Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based
upon, arising out of, or related to any representation or warranty made in or
in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal
laws of the State of Texas applicable to agreements made and to be performed
entirely within such State, without regard to any choice-of-law or conflicts-
of-law provision or rule (whether of the State of Texas or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the state of Texas; provided, however, in connection with the
determination of the existence of any Environmental Defect or Title Defect or
with respect to conveyancing matters as to any Acquired Asset, the Laws of the
state where such Acquired Asset is located shall govern and control such
determination.

15.4 Jurisdiction and Venue. Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.5,
Section 5.10, Section 6.7 and Section 13.5, any Proceeding arising under or
relating to this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, the

Documents (whether in Law, equity, or other theory) shall be brought or
otherwise commenced in any state court or the United States District Court

any such Proceeding except in such courts. Each Party agrees not to assert (by
way of motion, as a defense, or otherwise), and hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives in any such Proceeding commenced in such court, any
objection or claim that such Party is not subject personally to the
jurisdiction of such court or that such Proceeding has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. If such courts refuse to exercise jurisdiction hereunder,
then the Parties agree that such jurisdiction shall be proper in any court in
which jurisdiction may be obtained. Each Party irrevocably consents to service
of process by delivery of the copy of the process pursuant to the notice
provisions set forth in Section 15.7 with the same force and effect as if such
service had been made within the State of Texas. 

15.5 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HEREBY UNCONDITIONALLY AND IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL IN ANY LAWSUIT, ACTION, OR PROCEEDING BETWEEN
OR AMONG THE PARTIES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS.

Agreement. If the date specified in this Agreement for giving any notice or
taking any action is not a Business Day (or if the period during which any
notice is required to be given or any action taken expires on a date that is
not a Business Day), then the date for giving such notice or taking such
action (and the expiration date of such period during which notice is required
to be given or action taken) shall be the next day that is a Business Day.

15.8 Entire Agreement; Conflicts.

(a) Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Appendix, Exhibits, and
Schedules), the Confidentiality Agreement, and (when executed) the other
Transaction Documents contain the entire agreement and understanding between
the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and all
prior and contemporaneous negotiations, understandings, and agreements between
the Parties on the matters contained herein and therein are expressly merged
into and superseded by this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement, and
(when executed) the other Transaction Documents. The provisions of this
Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement, and (when executed) the other
Transaction Documents may not be explained, supplemented, or qualified through
evidence of trade usage or a prior course of dealings. No Party shall be
liable or bound to any other Party in any manner by any representations,
warranties, covenants, or agreements relating to such subject matter except as
specifically set forth in this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement, and
(when executed) the other Transaction Documents.

(b) Conflicts. In the event of a conflict between the terms and provisions of
this Agreement and the terms and provisions of any exhibit hereto, the terms
and provisions of this Agreement shall govern and control; provided, however,
the inclusion in any of the exhibits hereto of terms and provisions not
addressed in this Agreement shall not be deemed a conflict, and all such
additional provisions shall be given full force and effect, subject to the
provisions of this Section 15.8(b).

15.9 Amendments and Waivers.

(a) Amendments. This Agreement may not be amended except by a written
agreement of the Parties that is identified as an amendment to this Agreement.

(b) Waivers. Except for waivers specifically provided for in this Agreement,
rights under this Agreement may not be waived except by an instrument in
writing signed by the Party to be charged with the waiver. No waiver of, or
consent to a change in, or modification of any of the provisions of this
Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of, or consent to a
change in, or modification of other provisions hereof (whether or not
similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless
otherwise expressly provided. The rights of Seller and Purchaser under this
Agreement shall be cumulative, and the exercise or partial exercise of any
such right shall not preclude the exercise of any other right.

15.10 Binding Effect; Assignment.

(a) Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of
the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 

(b) Assignments Prohibited. Except as provided in Section 13.5, no Party may
assign this Agreement or any of its rights or interests under this Agreement,
or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement, without the prior
written consent of the other Parties, which consent may be withheld in each
such Party's sole and absolute discretion, and any attempt to do so shall be
void; provided that Purchaser shall be permitted to assign its rights or
interests or delegate its obligations under this Agreement to any Affiliate of
Purchaser without Seller's consent. In the event of any such assignment, such
assignment shall not relieve the assigning Party of any obligations and
responsibilities hereunder.

15.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered in one or
more counterparts, each of which when executed and delivered shall be an
original, and all of which when executed shall constitute one and the same
instrument. The exchange of copies of this Agreement and of signature pages by
facsimile or by electronic image scan transmission in .pdf shall constitute
effective execution and delivery of this Agreement as to the Parties and may
be used in lieu of the original Agreement for all purposes. Signatures of the
Parties transmitted by facsimile or electronic image scan transmission in .pdf
shall be deemed to be their original signatures for all purposes. Any Party
that delivers an executed counterpart signature page by facsimile or by
electronic image scan transmission in .pdf shall promptly thereafter deliver a
manually executed counterpart signature page to the other Party; provided,
however, that the failure to do so shall not affect the validity,
enforceability, or binding effect of this Agreement.

15.12 Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement confers certain indirect
rights and remedies upon the Indemnified Seller Parties and the Indemnified
Purchaser Parties, as applicable, as set forth in Section 4.1(d) and Article
XIV, each of which is, subject to the terms of Section 14.4, an express and
intended indirect third-party beneficiary of such Section and Article,
however, no other Person (other than the Parties, their respective successors
and permitted assigns and a Party's Party Affiliates) has any rights or
remedies under this Agreement or is an intended beneficiary of any provision
of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) the Parties reserve the
right to amend, modify, terminate, supplement, or waive any provision of this
Agreement or this entire Agreement without the consent or approval of the
other Indemnified Seller Parties or the other Indemnified Purchaser Parties;
and (b) no Party hereunder shall have any direct liability to any permitted
third party beneficiary, nor shall any permitted third party beneficiary have
any right to exercise any rights hereunder for such third-party beneficiary's
benefit except to the extent such rights are brought, exercised, and
administered by a Party hereto in accordance with Section 14.4.

15.13 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
adverse manner to any of Seller or Purchaser. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced,
the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this Agreement in any jurisdiction or with respect to any event
or circumstance shall not affect the validity or enforceability of such
provision in any other jurisdiction or with respect to any other event or
circumstance, nor shall the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of
this Agreement with respect to any Person affect the validity or
enforceability of such provision with respect to any other Person.

15.14 DTPA. Purchaser certifies that it is not a "consumer" within the meaning
of the Texas Business and Commerce Code, as amended and any similar Laws
related to the protection of consumers applicable in any other jurisdictions
(the "DTPA"). Purchaser covenants, for itself and for and on behalf of any
successor or assignee, that, if the DTPA is applicable to this Agreement, (A)
AFTER CONSULTATION WITH ATTORNEYS OF PURCHASER'S OWN SELECTION, PURCHASER
HEREBY VOLUNTARILY WAIVES AND 

RELEASES ALL OF PURCHASER'S RIGHTS AND REMEDIES UNDER THE DTPA AS APPLICABLE
TO SELLER AND SELLER'S SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS AND (B) PURCHASER SHALL DEFEND
AND INDEMNIFY THE INDEMNIFIED SELLER PARTIES FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL
CLAIMS OF OR BY ANY OF THE INDEMNIFIED PURCHASER PARTIES OR ANY OF THEIR
SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS BASED IN WHOLE OR IN PART ON THE DTPA ARISING OUT OF OR
IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT.

15.15 Headings. The headings and captions herein are inserted for convenience
of reference only and are not intended to govern, limit, or aid in the
construction of any term or provision hereof. The rights and obligations of
each Party shall be determined pursuant to this Agreement. Each of Seller and
Purchaser has had the opportunity to exercise business discretion in relation
to the negotiation of the details and terms of the transaction contemplated
hereby. This Agreement is the result of arm's length negotiations from equal
bargaining positions. It is the intention of the Parties that every covenant,
term, and provision of this Agreement shall be construed simply according to
its fair meaning and not strictly for or against any Party (notwithstanding
any rule of Law requiring an agreement to be strictly construed against the
drafting Party) and no consideration shall be given or presumption made, on
the basis of who drafted this Agreement or any particular provision thereof,
it being understood that the Parties to this Agreement are sophisticated and
have had adequate opportunity and means to exercise business discretion in
relation to the negotiation of the details of the transaction contemplated
hereby and retain counsel to represent their interests and to otherwise
negotiate the provisions of this Agreement.

15.16 Removal of Name. As promptly as practicable, but in any case within
thirty (30) days after expiration or termination of the Operating Services
under the Transition Services Agreement, Purchaser shall eliminate any
reference to the name "Noble Energy, Inc." and any variations or extensions of
such name from the Acquired Assets, and shall have no right to use any logos,
trade names, trademarks, service marks, and other marks belonging to Seller or
any of its Affiliates.

15.17 Litigation Support. For so long as any Party actively is contesting or
defending against any Claim or Proceeding brought by or against any Third
Party in connection with (a) this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions
or (b) any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity,
practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act, or
transaction, on or before the Closing Date relating to the Acquired Assets,
the other Party shall reasonably cooperate with the contesting or defending
Party and its counsel in the contest or defense at the sole cost and expense
of the contesting or defending Party (unless the contesting or defending Party
is entitled to indemnification for the foregoing under Section 4.1(d), Section
9.4, or Article XIV).

15.18 Further Assurances. From time to time after the Closing, Seller shall
execute, acknowledge, and deliver, or cause to be executed, acknowledged, and
delivered, to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall execute, acknowledge, and
deliver, and cause to be executed, acknowledged, and delivered to Seller, such
further documents and instruments, and take such other and further actions, as
may be reasonably requested by each such Party in order to convey and deliver
the Acquired Assets to Purchaser, to perfect Purchaser's title thereto, and to
accomplish the orderly transfer of the Acquired Assets to Purchaser in the
manner contemplated by this Agreement, and to more effectively assure to
Seller the full assumption by Purchaser of, and release of Seller from, the
Assumed Liabilities, and to otherwise fully accomplish the Contemplated
Transactions, in each case subject to the terms and conditions in this
Agreement.

15.19 Filings, Notices, and Certain Governmental Approvals. Promptly after
Closing, (a) Purchaser shall record all assignments of Acquired Assets
executed at Closing in the records of the applicable Governmental Authority,
(b) Purchaser shall, if applicable, send notices to vendors supplying goods
and services for the Acquired Assets and to the operator of such Acquired
Assets of the assignment of such Acquired Assets to Purchaser, (c) the Parties
shall actively pursue the unconditional approval of all 

applicable Governmental Authorities and other Persons of the assignment of the
Acquired Assets to Purchaser, and (d) the Parties shall actively pursue (but
with no obligation to pay any amounts to obtain) all other consents and
approvals that may be required in connection with the assignment of the
Acquired Assets to Purchaser and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities by
Purchaser, that, in each case, shall not have been obtained prior to Closing.
Purchaser obligates itself to take any and all action required by any
Governmental Authority in order to obtain such unconditional approval,
including the posting of any and all bonds or other security that may be
required in excess of its existing lease, pipeline, or area-wide bond. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, within thirty (30) days after the
last day of the calendar month in which the Closing occurs, Purchaser shall
file "well transfer requests" with respect to each Well included in the
Acquired Assets in the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (the "PUC") Act
13 online system. Purchaser agrees to include the transferred wells on its
"annual report" with the PUC and to pay any and all related impact fees.

15.20 No Recourse. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or implied
in this Agreement or any document, agreement, or instrument delivered
contemporaneously herewith, and notwithstanding the fact that Purchaser may be
a partnership or limited liability company, Seller, by its acceptance of the
benefits of this Agreement, covenants, agrees and acknowledges that no Persons
other than Purchaser (and their respective successors and assigns,
collectively, the "Recourse Parties") shall have any obligation hereunder and
that Seller has no rights of recovery hereunder against, and no recourse
hereunder or under any documents, agreements, or instruments delivered
contemporaneously herewith or in respect of any oral representations made or
alleged to be made in connection herewith with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby or therewith against (a) any former, current or future
general or limited partner, owner, member, director, officer, agent,
Affiliate, incorporator, controlling Person, fiduciary, representative or
employee of Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser (or any of the foregoing
Persons successors or permitted assignees) or (b) any former, current or
future director, owner, officer of a financing source (including the Financing
Sources), agent, employee, Affiliate, incorporator, controlling Person,
fiduciary, representative, general or limited partner, stockholder or member
of any of the foregoing, but in each case not including Purchaser (each, but
excluding for the avoidance of doubt, the Recourse Parties, a "Party
Affiliate"), whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate veil,
by or through a claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) by or on behalf
of Purchaser against the Party Affiliates, by the enforcement of any
assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any
statute, regulation or other Law, or otherwise; it being expressly agreed and
acknowledged that no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed
on, or otherwise be incurred by any Party Affiliate, as such, for any
obligations of Purchaser under this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, under any documents or instruments delivered contemporaneously
herewith, in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in
connection herewith or therewith, or for any claim (whether in tort, contract
or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or
their creation.
