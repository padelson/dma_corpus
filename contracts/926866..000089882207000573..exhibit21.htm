Elections shall be made in a form designated by Purchaser for that purpose, which form shall be reasonably acceptable to Innkeepers REIT (an " _Election Form_ "). The Election Form shall (a) state that, by making an Election, an Innkeepers LP Unitholder shall be deemed to have (i) consented to the Innkeepers LP Amendment and (ii) unconditionally and irrevocably waived any and all rights such Innkeepers LP Unitholder may have against the Innkeepers Parties or the Purchaser Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates or Representatives under the Innkeepers LP Agreement or the Surviving Partnership LP Agreement, in connection with and with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise, (b) when completed, specify the number of LP Units, if less than all, with respect to which an Election is made (failing which, the holder thereof shall be deemed to have made an Election with respect to

  all of such holder\'s LP Units), (c) provide any other information or
certification relating to Taxes that is reasonably required in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby and (d) include a Unitholder Letter of
Transmittal. In order to be effective, an Election Form must be duly
completed, signed and submitted to Purchaser, and must be received by
Purchaser by a date mutually agreed by Purchaser and Innkeepers REIT but in
any event no earlier than 20 days following the date on which such Election
Form is mailed and no later than 2 days prior to the Closing Date (the "
_Election Deadline_ ") specified in the Election Form or in the Unitholder
Letter of Transmittal. Any Innkeepers LP Unitholder who has the right to make,
and has made, an Election pursuant to this Section 1.5(a) (each, an "
_Electing Holder_ ") may at any time prior to the Election Deadline revoke
such Election by written notice to Purchaser received by Purchaser prior to
the Election Deadline. Any Electing Holder who does not submit a properly
completed Election Form which is received by Purchaser prior to the Election
Deadline, or who has duly revoked such Election, shall be deemed not to have
made an Election and shall be entitled to receive the Partnership
Consideration. Purchaser shall, in its sole discretion, determine whether an
Election Form has been timely and properly completed, signed and submitted or
revoked and whether to disregard immaterial defects in such form. Such
decision shall be conclusive and binding. The Purchaser Parties agree to
reasonably cooperate with the Innkeepers Parties in preparing any disclosure
statement or other disclosure information to accompany the Election Form,
including information applicable to an offering of securities exempt from
registration under the Securities Act.

 

 (b) From and after the adoption of the Innkeepers LP Amendment, (i) each LP Unit issued and outstanding and held by Purchaser Acquisition Entity immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be held by the Surviving Entity and shall remain a common limited partnership interest of the Surviving Partnership, and (ii) each LP Unit issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time with respect to which the holder thereof has the right to make, and has duly made, an Election in accordance with Section 1.5(a) shall remain a limited partnership interest of the Surviving Partnership, designated as a Series D Preferred Limited Partnership Unit of the Surviving Partnership (the " _Surviving Partnership_ _Series D Units_ ") pursuant to the Surviving Partnership LP Agreement, and, in each case, no payment shall be made pursuant to this Agreement with respect thereto. In addition, Purchaser shall contribute cash to the Surviving Partnership (directly or indirectly through depositing the same with the Exchange Agent in accordance with Section 2.1(a)) as needed to pay the Partnership Consideration to the non-Electing Holders, if any, and the Electing Holders who have elected to receive the Partnership Consideration, if any, and LP Units in the Surviving Partnership shall be issued to the Surviving Entity in an amount equal to the number of non-Electing Holders\' LP Units in Innkeepers LP cancelled pursuant to Section 1.5(a) (which LP Units shall be treated as having been sold to the Surviving Entity by the non-Electing Holders for federal and applicable state income Tax purposes). 

 

 (c) From and after the adoption of the Innkeepers LP Amendment, the general partnership interest of Innkeepers LP held by the General Partner, including each of the Series C Preferred Partnership Units (the " _GP Units_ " and, together with the LP Units, collectively, the " _Innkeepers LP Units_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, shall remain outstanding and held by the General Partner and shall constitute the only outstanding general partnership interest in the Surviving Partnership.

 (b) The Innkeepers LP Agreement, as in effect immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, as amended following the date hereof by the Innkeepers LP Amendment (as amended, the " _Surviving Partnership LP Agreement_ "), shall continue in full force and effect after the Merger Effective Time as the Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Surviving Partnership, until further amended in accordance with the terms of the Surviving Partnership LP Agreement and applicable Virginia Law. The Certificate of Limited Partnership of Innkeepers LP, as in effect immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, shall continue in full force and effect after the Merger Effective Time as the Certificate of Limited Partnership of the Surviving Partnership, until further amended in accordance with the terms of such Certificate of Limited Partnership and applicable Virginia Law.

 (a) The trustees of Purchaser Acquisition Entity and the officers of Innkeepers REIT immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be the trustees and officers of the Surviving Entity, and such trustee and officers shall serve until their successors have been duly elected or appointed, or until their death, resignation or removal from office in accordance with the Surviving Entity\'s Declaration of Trust and Bylaws.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the exercise price per share provided for in any Innkeepers Option exceeds the Merger Consideration, no cash shall be paid with regard to such Innkeepers Option to the holder of such Innkeepers Option. Prior to the Merger Effective Time, Innkeepers REIT shall use reasonable best efforts to establish a procedure to effectuate this Section 1.8(a).

Except as set forth in _Section 3.1(i) of the Innkeepers Disclosure Letter_ , each of Innkeepers REIT and the Innkeepers Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of Innkeepers Permits, except where the failure to so comply would not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute an Innkeepers Material Adverse Effect.

None of the Innkeepers Parties are subject to any order, 

  judgment, writ, injunction or decree, except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, (i) constitute an Innkeepers Material Adverse Effect or (ii) as
of the date hereof, challenge or seek to prevent or enjoin, alter or
materially delay the Merger.

 

 (k) _Taxes_. 

 

 (i) Each of Innkeepers REIT and each Innkeepers Subsidiary has timely filed or has had timely filed on its behalf all material Tax Returns required to be filed by it or on its behalf (after giving effect to any filing extension properly granted by a Governmental Entity having authority to do so or otherwise permitted by Law). Except as set forth in _Section 3.1(k)(i) of the Innkeepers Disclosure Letter_ , each such Tax Return was, at the time filed, true, correct and complete in all material respects. Each of Innkeepers REIT and the Innkeepers Subsidiaries has timely paid (or Innkeepers REIT has paid on behalf of such Innkeepers Subsidiary) all material Taxes that are due and payable (other than those being contested in good faith through appropriate proceedings and for which appropriate reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP). The most recent financial statements contained in the Innkeepers REIT SEC Documents filed with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement reflect in accordance with GAAP an adequate reserve or accrued Liabilities or expenses for all Taxes due and payable by Innkeepers REIT and the Innkeepers Subsidiaries as a group (excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and tax income) for all taxable periods and portions thereof through the date of such financial statements. Innkeepers REIT and the Innkeepers Subsidiaries (as a group) have established on their books and records (which may, but are not required to, be reflected only on the books and records of the Innkeepers Parties) reserves or accrued Liabilities or expenses that are adequate for the payment of all material Taxes for which Innkeepers REIT or any Innkeepers Subsidiary is liable but are not yet due and payable. Innkeepers REIT has incurred no Liability for any Taxes under Sections 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code or Treasury Regulation Sections 1.337(d)-5, 1.337(d)-6 or 1.337(d)-7, including any Tax arising from a prohibited transaction described in Section 857(b)(6) of the Code and the excise tax on redetermined rents, redetermined deductions, and excess interest under Section 857(b)(7) of the Code. No requests for waivers of the time to assess any material Taxes have been granted and remain in effect or are pending. No claim is pending or proposed in writing by any Governmental Entity in any jurisdiction where Innkeepers REIT or any Innkeepers Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns that Innkeepers REIT or any Innkeepers Subsidiary is or may be subject to taxation by such jurisdiction. Copies of all material Tax Returns with respect to taxable years commencing on or after the taxable year ending December 31, 2004 have been previously provided or made available to Representatives of Purchaser.

 

 (ii) Innkeepers REIT (A) for each taxable period beginning with its date of formation through its most recent taxable year ended on or before the date hereof, has been subject to taxation as a real estate investment trust within the meaning of the Code (a " _REIT_ ") and has satisfied the requirements to qualify as a REIT for such years, (B) has operated consistent with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT for the period from the end of its most recent taxable year ended before the date hereof through the date hereof, (C) has not taken any action or omitted to take any action 

  which would reasonably be expected to result in a successful challenge by the
Internal Revenue Service to its status as a REIT, and no such challenge is
pending, or to the Knowledge of the Innkeepers Parties, threatened and (D)
intends to continue to operate in such a manner as to permit it to continue to
qualify as a REIT for the taxable year or portion thereof that shall end with
the Merger. Each Innkeepers Subsidiary which files Tax Returns as a
partnership or is a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes
has since the later of its formation or its acquisition by Innkeepers been
classified for U.S. federal income tax purposes as either a partnership or
disregarded entity and not as an association taxable as a corporation, or a
"publicly traded partnership" within the meaning of Section 7704(b) of the
Code that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes
under Section 7704(a) of the Code. Except as set forth in _Section 3.1(k)(ii)
of the Innkeepers Disclosure Letter_ , each Innkeepers Subsidiary which is a
corporation has been since the later of its formation or acquisition by
Innkeepers classified as a "qualified REIT subsidiary" under Section 856(i) of
the Code or a "taxable REIT subsidiary" under Section 856(l) of the Code. No
Innkeepers Subsidiary is classified as or files Tax Returns as a REIT under
Sections 856 through 860 of the Code.

 

 (iii) All material Taxes which Innkeepers REIT or the Innkeepers Subsidiaries are required by Law to withhold or collect, including material Taxes required to have been withheld in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, shareholder or other third party and sales, gross receipts and use taxes, have been duly withheld or collected and, to the extent required, have been paid over to the proper Governmental Entities. There are no Liens for material Taxes upon the assets of Innkeepers REIT or the Innkeepers Subsidiaries except for statutory Liens for Taxes not yet due. 

 

 (iv) Except as set forth in _Section 3.1(k)(iv) of the Innkeepers_ _Disclosure Letter_ , (A) there are no audits by or contests with any taxing authority currently being conducted with regard to material Taxes or Tax Returns of Innkeepers REIT or any Innkeepers Subsidiary; (B) there are no audits, examinations or other proceedings pending with or proposed in writing by any taxing authority with respect to any Taxes or Tax Returns; (C) all deficiencies asserted or assessments made with respect to Innkeepers REIT or Innkeepers Subsidiaries prior to the date hereof by the Internal Revenue Service of the United States (the " _IRS_ ") or any other taxing authority have been fully paid; (D) neither Innkeepers REIT nor any Innkeepers Subsidiary is a party to any litigation or administrative proceeding relating to any Taxes; and (E) neither Innkeepers REIT nor any Innkeepers Subsidiary has requested, received or is subject to any written ruling of a taxing authority or has entered into any written agreement with a taxing authority with respect to any material Taxes.

 

 (v) Neither Innkeepers REIT nor any Innkeepers Subsidiary is a party to any Tax allocation or sharing agreement. 

 

 (vi) Innkeepers REIT and the Innkeepers Subsidiaries do not have any material Liability for the Taxes of any Person other than Innkeepers REIT and the

similar provision of state, local or foreign Law) or (B) as a transferee or
successor.

 

 (vii) Innkeepers REIT and Innkeepers Subsidiaries do not hold any asset the disposition of which would be subject to rules similar to Section 1374 of the Code. 

 

 (viii) Except as set forth in _Section 3.1(k)(viii) of the Innkeepers_ _Disclosure Letter_ , neither Innkeepers REIT nor any Innkeepers Subsidiary has entered into or is subject, directly or indirectly, to any Tax Protection Agreement that has not expired.

No Person has threatened a claim against Innkeepers REIT or any Innkeepers Subsidiary for any breach of any Tax Protection Agreement. 

 

 (ix) Innkeepers REIT and the Innkeepers Subsidiaries are not a party to any understanding or arrangement described in Section 6662(d)(2)(C)(ii) of the Code or Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b) and are not "material advisors" (as defined in Section 6111(b) of the Code).

 

 (x) Innkeepers REIT and the Innkeepers Subsidiaries have not entered into any "closing agreement" as described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax law).

 

 (xi) _Section 3.1(k)(xi) of the Innkeepers Disclosure Letter_ sets forth each entity in which any Innkeepers Subsidiaries owns an equity interest and states whether such entity is classified as a partnership, disregarded entity, or a corporation for federal income tax purposes. In the case of an entity classified as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, such schedule states whether an effective election has been made to treat such entity as a "taxable REIT subsidiary" under Section 856(l) of the Code.

 (i) Except with respect to the plans, agreements and arrangements listed in _Section 3.1(l)(i) of the Innkeepers Disclosure Letter_ , neither Innkeepers REIT, any Innkeepers Subsidiary nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates is a party to, sponsors, participates in or contributes to:

Agreement, any agreement or document contemplated hereby or delivered in
connection herewith, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, from and
after the Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Entity (the " _Indemnitor_ "),

Maryland real estate investment trust is permitted under applicable Law to
indemnify its own officers and directors, each Indemnified Party against any
losses, claims, damages, Liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable
attorneys\' fees and expenses), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action,

suit, proceeding or investigation (whether asserted before or after the Merger
Effective Time), (A) the Indemnitor, shall promptly (but in any event within
ten (10) calendar days of written request) advance expenses pending the final
disposition of any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand,
proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, (B) the Indemnitor shall have the right to defend
each Indemnified Party in any proceeding which may give rise to the payment of

shall notify such Indemnified Party of any such decision to defend within ten
(10) calendar days of receipt of written notice of any such proceeding;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Indemnitor shall not, without the prior
written consent of such Indemnified Party, consent to the entry of any
judgment against such Indemnified Party or enter into any settlement or
compromise which (x) includes an admission of fault of such Indemnified Party
or (y) does not include, as an unconditional term thereof, the full release of
such Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such proceeding, which
release shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such
Indemnified Party and (C) notwithstanding clause (B) above, if in a proceeding

other defendants in such proceeding, (y) a conflict of interest or potential
conflict of interest exists between such Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor

applicable Law. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
this Section 5.8, upon learning of any such threatened or actual claim,
action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify
Innkeepers REIT before the Merger Effective Time and, after the Merger
Effective Time, the Surviving Entity, thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the failure to so notify

  shall not affect the obligations of Innkeepers REIT and the Surviving Entity

adversely prejudices such party.

 

 (b) Purchaser and the Surviving Entity agree that all rights to indemnification existing in favor of, and all exculpations and limitations of the personal liability of, the Indemnified Parties provided for in Innkeepers REIT Charter or Innkeepers REIT Bylaws, as well as indemnification agreements, as in effect as of the date hereof and either (i) expressly and specifically disclosed in Innkeepers REIT\'s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 including the exhibits thereto or (ii) listed in _Section 5.8(b) of the Innkeepers_ _Disclosure Letter_ , with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Merger Effective Time, including the Merger, shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is expressly understood and agreed that Purchaser Parties\' obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are not subject to a financing condition or contingent upon the results of Purchaser Parties\' efforts to obtain the full amount of the Financing required to effect the Closing.
