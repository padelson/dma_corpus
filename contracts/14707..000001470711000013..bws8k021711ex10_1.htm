and Brown Shoe Charitable Trust in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement.

  

  

(ii) The Escrow Amount shall be treated as owned by Buyer for all Tax purposes
until such amounts are disbursed by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the

accordance with the terms hereof or the terms of the Escrow Agreement) to
provide a payment in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement, Buyer and the Representative shall, if necessary for release
of funds from the Escrow Account, promptly execute joint written instructions
to the Escrow Agent to disburse the determined amount from the Escrow Account
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

  

  

(c) Remaining Balance in Escrow Account. Upon the expiration of the twelve
(12) month period following the Closing Date, Buyer and the Representative
shall cause the Escrow Agent (in accordance with the terms of the Escrow

Parent to be owed to a Buyer Indemnified Person in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the Escrow Agreement), together with any interest
earned on any such amount, for distribution in accordance with the terms of
the Escrow Agreement.

cause to be paid (by wire transfer of immediately available funds) the Seller
Transaction Expenses listed on Annex 2 and the Company shall have paid all
other Seller Transaction Expenses not listed on Annex 2 on or prior to the
Closing; provided, however for the avoidance of doubt to the extent Annex 2

its employees in connection with the Closing and other amounts paid in
connection with the acquisition of WII.

  

  

(c) In no event shall Buyer be responsible for payment of Seller Transaction
Expenses and the Parties acknowledge that the payment of the Seller
Transaction Expenses out of the Cash Consideration by Buyer as indicated in
Section 1.3(a) is for convenience only and in no way reflects any liability of
Buyer for the Seller Transaction Expenses.

  

  

1.9. Sellers' Representative; Actions.

  

  

(a) The Sellers hereby consent to and acknowledge the appointment of Jerome A.
Turner as the true and lawful attorney-in-fact of the Sellers for all matters
in connection with this Agreement, the Earnout Agreement and, with respect to
the Founding Stockholders, the Escrow Agreement (the "Representative"), with
the power and authority to act on each of the Sellers' behalf as set forth in
this Section 1.9. The Representative will act on behalf of the Sellers with
respect to all matters requiring action by the Sellers under this Agreement,

representative will be appointed by the Sellers holding a majority of the
Company Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Closing Date.

  

  

(b) The Representative shall take all actions required to be taken by the
Sellers under this Agreement, the Earnout Agreement or, with respect to the
Founding Stockholders, the Escrow Agreement and may take any action
contemplated by this Agreement, the Earnout Agreement or, with respect to the
Founding Stockholders, the Escrow Agreement. By giving notice to the
Representative in the manner provided by Section 7.1, Buyer and Parent shall
be deemed to have given notice to all Sellers. Any action taken by the
Representative may be considered by Parent and Buyer to be the action of the
Sellers for whom such action was taken for all purposes of this Agreement, the
Earnout Agreement or, with respect to the Founding Stockholders, the Escrow
Agreement.

  

  

(c) In the event that Parent or Buyer gives notice to the Representative of a
claim for which indemnification may be sought, the Representative shall have
the authority to determine, in his or her sole judgment, whether to retain
counsel (and to select that counsel) to protect the Sellers' interests,
subject to Section 6.5, whether to assume the defense of or otherwise to
control the handling of the claim, whether to consent to indemnification and
to make all other decisions required to be made by the Sellers pursuant to
this Agreement, the Earnout Agreement or, with respect to the Founding
Stockholders, the Escrow Agreement, including without limitation whether to
consent or withhold his or her consent to any settlement or compromise of a
claim.

  

  

(d) The Representative shall not be liable to any Sellers for any act or
omission taken pursuant to or in conjunction with this Agreement, except for
his or her own bad faith or willful misconduct. The Sellers shall indemnify
and hold the Representative, and each successor thereof, harmless from any and
all liability and expenses (including, without limitation, counsel fees) which
may arise out of any action taken or omitted by him or her as Representative
in accordance with this Agreement, the Earnout Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement, as the same may be amended, modified or supplemented, except such
liability and expense as may result from the bad faith or willful misconduct
of the Representative.

Subsidiaries is a company duly organized, validly existing and in good

qualified to do business as a foreign corporation or a limited liability
company (as the case may be) and is in good standing in each jurisdiction
wherein the nature of its business or the ownership of its assets makes such
qualification necessary, other than those jurisdictions where the failure to

does not have, individually or in the aggregate, an adverse economic impact on
the Company or its Subsidiaries in excess of $25,000. The Company has provided
or made available in the electronic dealroom hosted by D.A. Davidson (as of

options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of any character,
written or oral, to which any of the Company's Subsidiaries is a party or by
which it is bound obligating any of the Company's Subsidiaries to issue,

thereof is at the time owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by that
Person or one or more of the other subsidiaries of that Person or a

basis in accordance with ERISA and the Code.

investigation, suit, grievance, arbitration or other manner of litigation, or
claim against or involving any Plan described in Schedule 2.21 of the Company

to severance pay or any other payment, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting, or increase the amount of any compensation due to any current or
former employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or (iii) give rise to the

rise or contributing to such failure may be taken into account in determining

through (iii) above has a disproportionate effect on the Company or its
Subsidiaries relative to other participants in the industry in which the

contemplated hereby. Each of Parent, the Sellers and the Representative shall
refrain from issuing any other press release in addition to the joint press

be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as practical, such
information (including reasonable access to books and records, Tax Returns and
Tax filings) and assistance as is reasonably requested for the filing of any
Tax Return, the conduct of any Tax audit, and for the prosecution or defense
of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax matter. The
Representative, Parent and Buyer shall cooperate with each other in the
conduct of any Tax audit or other Tax proceedings and each shall execute and

shall be treated for all Tax purposes as owned by Buyer unless and until it is
paid in whole or in part to the Brown Shoe Charitable Trust. Any amounts so
paid shall be treated as paid directly from Buyer to the Brown Shoe Charitable
Trust, and any deductions attributable to any such payment shall be solely for
the account of Parent and Buyer, and no party hereto shall take any position
inconsistent with such treatment for Tax purposes. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that any Governmental Authority of the United States,
a state or subdivision thereof, requires any Seller to include any portion of
the Charitable Escrow Amount in taxable income:

  

  

(i) Such Seller shall claim charitable contribution deductions attributable to
the contribution of that portion of the Charitable Escrow Amount to the Brown
Shoe Charitable Trust to the extent permitted by Law;

  

  

(ii) Parent and Buyer agree to indemnify such Seller for any such Taxes
actually paid attributable to the inclusion of such Seller's portion of the
Charitable Escrow Amount in such Seller's income, net of any reduction in such
Taxes actually paid by such Seller as a result of any charitable contribution
deduction attributable to any portion of the Charitable Escrow Amount; and

  

  

(iii) in the event that Parent and Buyer are required to indemnify any Seller
pursuant to clause (ii) above and such Taxes actually paid by any such Seller
in a future period is reduced as a result of a charitable contribution
deduction attributable to any portion of the Charitable Escrow Amount, such
Seller shall pay over to Buyer an amount equal to such reduction in such Tax
liability, provided that the aggregate payments made by any Seller under this
clause (iii) shall not exceed the amount of indemnification payments made to
such Seller under clause (ii).

agents, representatives, heirs, administrators, predecessors, attorneys,
successors and assigns of each of the foregoing (the "Releasees") from any and
all claims and/or causes of action, known or unknown, which each such Seller
may have or could claim to have against the Releasees in his or her capacity
as a stockholder, manager, member, officer, director or employee of the
Company or any other capacity, in each case whether absolute or contingent,
liquidated or unliquidated, known or unknown, and whether arising under any
agreement or understanding (other than this Agreement) or otherwise at law or
equity, and such Seller agrees that he or she shall not seek to recover any
amounts in connection therewith or thereunder from any of the Releasees;
provided, that the waivers contained in this Section 5.4 shall not apply to
(i) claims against Parent or Buyer asserted pursuant to this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement, the Earnout Agreement or the Non-Competition Agreement or
against the Company pursuant to the Consulting Agreement or the Non-
Competition Agreement, (ii) any claims for which the facts or circumstances
giving rise to such claim first occur following Closing, or (iii) liabilities
relating to the employment by the Company of such Seller relating to the
payment or provisions of wages, salaries, bonuses, benefits, expense
reimbursements and perquisites due to such employees incurred in the Ordinary
Course of Business prior to Closing. Each of the Sellers understands and
agrees that he or she waives any rights he or she may have under Section 1542
of the California Civil Code, which provides that "A General Release does not
extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his
favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have
materially affected his settlement with the debtor." By executing this
Agreement, each of the Sellers acknowledges that he or she has carefully read
and fully understand the provisions of this Section 5.4 and further
acknowledges that he or she is executing this Agreement, and agreeing to this
Section 5.4 knowingly and voluntarily and without duress, coercion or undue
influence.

ownership of any of the shares of Company Capital Stock, (ii) any claims
challenging or disputing the validity, enforceability, binding effect or
legality of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii)
any claims for breach of fiduciary duty arising from any actions or inactions
of others at or prior to the Closing Date, including, without limitation,
related to the transactions contemplated hereby. Each Seller understands and
agrees that he or she waives any rights that he or she may have with respect
to indemnification under Delaware law, the Company's and its Subsidiaries'
constituent documents and, as applicable, any policy of director and officer
liability insurance (other than claims covered by director and officer
liability insurance of the Company, which insurance exists on the day prior to
Closing and has been paid for by the Company prior to Closing).

  

  

5.5. Legal Representation. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby
agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its directors, members, partners,
officers, employees and Affiliates, that Dechert LLP ("Dechert") currently
serves as counsel to both (a) the Company and its Subsidiaries and (b) the
Founding Stockholders in connection with the negotiation, preparation,
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the other ancillary agreements and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. There may
come a time, including after consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, when the interests of the Founding Stockholders and the
Company may no longer be aligned or when, for any reason, the Founding
Stockholders, Dechert or the Company believes that Dechert cannot or should no
longer represent both the Founding Stockholders and the Company. In addition,
the Parties agree that following consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, Dechert may serve as counsel to (x) the Representative or
(y) any other Seller in the event such Person so requests, in either case,
including in connection with matters adverse to the Company, so long as
matters are not related to any matter where Dechert represented the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that the parties agree that
Dechert may continue to represent the Representative or any Seller in any
matter arising out of the enforcement of or resolution of a dispute related to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The parties understand
and specifically agree that in any matter arising out of the enforcement of or
resolution of a dispute related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, Dechert may withdraw from representing the Company and
continue to represent the Founding Stockholders, and the Company hereby
consents thereto and waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom.

  

  

5.6. Reliance. Each of the Sellers acknowledges and agrees that both Parent
and Buyer have relied upon each of the representations and warranties
(individually and in the aggregate) made by the Company and the Sellers in
this Agreement, including the representations and warranties contained herein
with respect to the materials, documents and other information relating to the
Company and/or its Subsidiaries made available to Parent, Buyer or their
Representatives in the Electronic Dealroom.

  

  

ARTICLE 6.

  

  

INDEMNIFICATION

  

  

6.1. Survival of Representations and Warranties and Covenants. The
representations and warranties of the Parties made herein shall survive the
Closing and continue in effect until the one year anniversary of the Closing
Date; provided, however, that the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 2.3 (Capitalization), Section 2.4(a) (Authorization; Enforceability),
Section 2.7(c) (Liabilities of the Designated Entities), Section 2.16(b)
(Distributions), Section 2.18 (Transactions with Related Persons), Section
2.24 (Brokers, Finders), Section 3.1 (Authorization; Enforceability), Section
3.2 (Ownership of Shares), Section 3.3 (Representation by Counsel), Section
3.4 (Brokers, Finders), Section 4.1(b) (Authorization) and Section 4.3
(Brokers, Finders) (collectively, such representations and warranties the
"Fundamental Reps") shall survive in perpetuity. The covenants made by the
Parties herein shall survive in accordance with their respective terms, and if
no specific term is specified, in perpetuity. Any claims under this Agreement
with respect to a breach of a representation and warranty or covenant must be
asserted by written notice within the applicable survival period contemplated
by this Section 6.1, and if such written notice is given in accordance with
the provisions hereof and the provisions of the Escrow Agreement, the survival
period for such representation and warranty shall continue until the claim is
finally resolved.

  

  

6.2. Indemnification of Parent and Buyer.

  

  

(a) Pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and subject to the
limitations contained in this Article 6, Parent, Buyer and their Affiliates
(including, from and after the Closing, the Company) and the stockholders
(other than the stockholders of Parent), directors, officers, partners,
employees, successors, assigns, representatives and agents of each of them in
their capacities as such (the "Buyer Indemnified Persons"), shall be
indemnified and held harmless by the Sellers from and against, and each Seller
shall thereby waive any claim for contribution or indemnity from any of the
Buyer Indemnified Persons with respect to, any and all claims, losses, Taxes,
judgments, orders, damages, liabilities, expenses or costs ("Losses"), minus
(i) (a) the amount actually recovered by the Indemnified Party with respect to
such Loss under any insurance policies maintained by the Company, net of
reasonable expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in obtaining such
recovery and the net present value of any increase in premiums the Indemnified
Party incurs as a result of such recovery minus (b) the amount of any Tax
benefit that is actually recognized as a result of all or part of such Losses,
when and as recognized, plus (ii) reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses
incurred or accrued in connection with Losses and/or enforcement of this
Agreement and interest on the amount of such Losses at the Prime Rate, as it
appears in the Wall Street Journal, from the date that such Losses were
incurred until the day immediately prior to the date of payment to the
Indemnified Party, determined based on a 360-day year (such net amount,
"Indemnified Losses") incurred by or sustained by, or imposed upon, any of
them resulting from or arising out of:

  

  

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company in
Article 2 of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any other ancillary
document;

  

  

(ii) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Sellers in
Article 3 of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any other ancillary
document;

  

  

(iii) any nonfulfillment, nonperformance, nonobservance or other breach or
violation, or default in performance by the Company, the Sellers or the
Representative of, any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement or any other ancillary document (including any certificate
delivered pursuant to this Agreement);

  

  

(iv) the amount of any Excess Transaction Expenses, but only to the extent
that such Excess Transaction Expenses were not deducted from the Aggregate
Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.3(a)(i); or

  

  

(v) actions taken to complete, or the failure to complete, the transactions
contemplated by that certain Shares Sale and Purchase Agreement dated as of 18
February, 2011 among Shirley Lee, Johnny Chi-Pao Liao, Johnny HC Liao and ASG
Asia for the proposed acquisition by ASG Asia of the outstanding shares of
WII, including any costs incurred by ASG Asia to enforce its rights
thereunder.

  

  

To the extent any Tax benefit relating to a Loss is not recognized until after
any Buyer Indemnified Persons receive indemnification payments pursuant to
this Article 6, such Buyer Indemnified Persons shall pay over to the Escrow
Agent (to the extent that (a) amounts have been paid to Buyer out of the
Escrow Amount and (b) the payment date is prior to the one (1) year
anniversary of this Agreement), to the Brown Shoe Charitable Trust (if such
amounts have been paid to Buyer out of the Escrow Account and would have been
released to the Brown Shoe Charitable Trust under the terms of the Escrow
Agreement) or to the Representative for further distribution to the Founding
Stockholders (if such amounts have been paid to Buyer out of the Escrow
Account and would have been released to the Founding Stockholders under the
terms of the Escrow Agreement) or to the Sellers (in any other circumstance)
an amount equal to any such Tax benefit at such time or times as such benefit
is actually recognized.

  

  

The Indemnified Party shall have no obligation to first submit or to collect
upon any applicable insurance coverage as a precondition to making a claim for
indemnification hereunder or obtaining indemnification for Indemnified Losses
therefor, and the Parties hereto agree, without limiting any other rights any
Indemnifying Party may have against Buyer, not to delay in any manner the
payment to Buyer or any Buyer Indemnified Person of such indemnification based
on Buyer's non-fulfillment of the foregoing obligation at the time any such
claim is made. To the extent that any insurance payment is actually recovered
by an Indemnified Party after the related indemnification payment has been
made pursuant to this Agreement and/or the Escrow Agreement, the Indemnified
Person will pay over to the Escrow Agent (to the extent that (a) amounts have
been paid to Buyer out of the Escrow Amount and (b) the payment date is prior
to the one (1) year anniversary of this Agreement), to the Brown Shoe
Charitable Trust (if such amounts have been paid to Buyer out of the Escrow
Account and would have been released to the Brown Shoe Charitable Trust under
the terms of the Escrow Agreement) or to the Representative for further
distribution to the Founding Stockholders (if such amounts have been paid to
Buyer out of the Escrow Account and would have been released to the Founding
Stockholders under the terms of the Escrow Agreement) or to the Sellers (in
any other circumstance) the amounts of such insurance payments promptly after
they are actually recovered.

  

  

If a payment with respect to a Tax benefit which is actually recognized is not
paid by such Buyer Indemnified Person to the Escrow Agent, the Brown Shoe
Charitable Trust or the Representative within thirty days of such time when
such benefit is actually recognized, the payment by the Buyer Indemnified
Person to the Escrow Agent, the Brown Shoe Charitable Trust or the
Representative with respect to such Tax benefit shall include interest on such
amount at the Prime Rate, as it appears in the Wall Street Journal, from the
date that such amount was actually recognized until the day immediately prior
to the date of payment to the Escrow Agent, the Brown Shoe Charitable Trust or
the Representative for further distribution to the Founding Stockholders or
the Sellers, as the case may be, determined based on a 360-day year.

  

  

If an insurance payment which is actually recovered is not paid by an
Indemnified Party to the Escrow Agent, the Brown Shoe Charitable Trust or the
Representative within thirty days of such time when such insurance payment is
actually recovered, the payment by the Indemnified Party to the Escrow Agent,
the Brown Shoe Charitable Trust or the Representative with respect to such
insurance payment shall include interest on such amount at the Prime Rate, as
it appears in the Wall Street Journal, from the date that such amount was
actually recovered until the day immediately prior to the date of payment to
the Escrow Agent, the Brown Shoe Charitable Trust or the Representative for
further distribution to the Founding Stockholders or the Sellers, as the case
may be, determined based on a 360-day year.

  

  

(b) The Sellers shall severally and not jointly indemnify and hold harmless
each of the Buyer Indemnified Persons from and against the Losses set forth in
Section 6.2(a), and each Seller waives any claim for contribution or indemnity
from any of the Buyer Indemnified Persons with respect to such Seller's
Percentage of any Indemnified Losses. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Percentage" means, with respect to each Seller, the percentage set forth next
to such Seller's name on Annex 1; provided, however, that each Seller shall
bear full responsibility for any breach of the representations and warranties
by such Seller contained in Article 3 and no other Seller shall have any
responsibility for any breach by any other Seller of such representations and
warranties, and further the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall have recourse
under this Article 6 only against such Seller (subject to the provisions of
this Article 6) in breach of such representations and warranties.

  

  

(c) For all Tax purposes, all indemnification payments under this Article 6
shall be treated by the Parties as adjustments to the Aggregate Purchase Price
to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

  

  

6.3. Indemnification of the Sellers. Parent and Buyer shall hold the Sellers,
and the members, directors, officers, partners, employees, successors,
assigns, representatives and agents of each of them in their capacities as
such (the "Seller Indemnified Persons") harmless and indemnify each of them
from and against any and all Indemnified Losses incurred or to be incurred by
any of them, resulting from or arising out of:

  

  

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Parent or Buyer in
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any ancillary document; or

  

  

(b) any nonfulfillment, nonperformance, nonobservance or other breach or
violation, or default in performance, by Parent or Buyer of any covenant or
agreement of Parent or Buyer contained in this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement
or any ancillary document.

  

  

6.4. Notice of Claim. In the event that Parent or Buyer seeks indemnification
on behalf of a Buyer Indemnified Person, or the Representative or a Seller
seeks indemnification on behalf of a Seller Indemnified Person, such Party
seeking indemnification (the "Indemnified Party") shall give reasonably prompt
written notice in accordance with Section 7.1 to the indemnifying Party (the
"Indemnifying Party") specifying the facts constituting the basis for such
claim and the amount, to the extent ascertainable, of the claim asserted;
provided, however, that the right of a Person to be indemnified hereunder
shall not be adversely affected by a failure to give such notice unless, and
then only to the extent that, an Indemnifying Party is actually damaged or
prejudiced thereby. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and any applicable
terms of the Escrow Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall pay (by wire
transfer of immediately available funds) the amount of any claim not more than
thirty (30) days after the claim is resolved in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and any applicable terms of the Escrow Agreement, or to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party does not respond to the notice from the
Indemnified Party, then thirty (30) days from the delivery of such notice. For
purposes of this Article 6, the Representative has the full authority to act
on behalf of the Sellers and the Seller Indemnified Persons as either an
Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, provided that as set forth in
this Agreement, Parent or Buyer shall have given notice to all Sellers
pursuant to giving notice to the Representative.

  

  

6.5. Right to Contest Claims of Third Persons.

  

  

(a) If an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder because
of a claim (a "Third Person Claim") asserted by any claimant other than an
Indemnified Party hereunder (a "Third Person"), the Indemnified Party shall
give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt notice thereof in accordance
with Section 7.1; provided, however, that the right of a Person to be
indemnified hereunder in respect of claims made by a Third Person shall not be
adversely affected by a failure to give such notice unless, and then only to
the extent that, an Indemnifying Party is actually damaged or prejudiced
thereby. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.5, in the event that
the Third Person Claim seeks recovery of damages in an amount which is less
than one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the maximum remaining amount of
Indemnified Losses for which the Indemnifying Party may be liable to indemnify
the Indemnified Party hereunder (a "Special Third Person Claim"), the
Indemnifying Party shall then have the right, upon written notice to the
Indemnified Party (a "Defense Notice") within fifteen (15) days after receipt
from the Indemnified Party of notice of such claim, and using counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, to investigate, contest, or
settle the Special Third Person Claim; provided that the Indemnifying Party
has unconditionally acknowledged to the Indemnified Party in writing its
obligation to indemnify the Persons to be indemnified hereunder with respect
to such Third Person Claim subject to the applicable limitations set forth in
this Article 6. The Indemnified Party may thereafter participate in (but not
control) the defense of any such Special Third Person Claim with its own
counsel at its own expense, unless in the reasonable opinion of counsel, there
exists a conflict of interest between the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party that cannot be waived, in which case such representation
shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. In the event that the
Indemnifying Party delivers a Defense Notice with respect to such Special
Third Party Claim and thereby elects to conduct the defense of the subject
claim, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to have control over said
defense and, subject to the provisions set forth below, settlement of the
subject claim, (ii) the Indemnified Party will cooperate with and make
available to the Indemnifying Party such assistance and materials as it may
reasonably request and (iii) the Indemnified Party shall have the rights at
its expense to participate in the defense assisted by counsel of its own
choosing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time a Third Person Claim
no longer qualifies as a Special Third Person Claim, then the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to take control of the defense of such Third Person
Claim and investigate, contest, and settle such Third Person Claim, subject to
the consent of the Indemnifying Party as set forth in Section 6.5(c) hereof.

  

  

(b) Unless and until the Indemnifying Party sends a Defense Notice, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its option, to assume and control
defense of the matter and to look to the Indemnifying Party for the full
amount, subject to this Article 6, of the reasonable costs of defense. In the
event that the Indemnifying Party shall fail to give the Defense Notice within
said fifteen (15) day period, in light of the circumstances, (i) the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have the control over said defense and
settlement of the subject claim (subject to the consent of the Indemnifying
Party as set forth in Section 6.5(c) hereof), (ii) the Indemnifying Party will
cooperate with and make available to the Indemnified Party such assistance and
materials as it may reasonably request, and (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall
have the right at its expense to participate in the defense assisted by
counsel of its own choosing, and the Indemnifying Party, if it is required to
provide indemnification under this Agreement, will be liable for all costs,
including reasonable out of pocket expenses, and settlement amounts, subject
to this Article 6, paid or incurred in connection therewith.

  

  

(c) The Indemnifying Party will not settle the subject claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed unless (i) there is no finding
or admission of any violation of Law or any violation of the rights of any
Person; (ii) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in
full by the Indemnifying Party; and (iii) the Indemnified Party shall have no
liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such Special Third
Person Claims effected without its consent, in which cases the consent of the
Indemnified Party shall not be required.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.5,
the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to control, but may participate
in, and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have sole control,
including the right to select defense counsel, over the defense or settlement
of any claim (i) that seeks a temporary restraining order, a preliminary or
permanent injunction or specific performance against the Indemnified Party,
(ii) that involves criminal allegations against the Indemnified Party, (iii)
that, if, in the Indemnified Party's reasonable judgment, it was unsuccessful,
(A) would set a precedent that would materially interfere with, or have a
material adverse effect on, the business or financial condition of the
Indemnified Party or (B) would reasonably be expected to exceed the Buyer Cap
or the Sellers' Cap, as applicable, in either case as mutually determined by
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party or, if such a determination
is not made within fifteen (15) days after the date on which the Indemnified
Party responds to the Defense Notice by asserting its rights under this
Section 6.5(d), in accordance with its reasonable judgment, or (iv) subject to
clause (iii) above, that imposes liability on the part of the Indemnified
Party for which the Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification
hereunder. In such event, the Indemnifying Party will still be subject to its
obligations hereunder but the Indemnified Party will not settle the subject
claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

  

6.6. Limitations on Indemnity.

  

  

(a) From and after the Closing, the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall not be
entitled to indemnification in respect of Indemnified Losses pursuant to
Section 6.2(a)(i) resulting from or arising out of breaches of the
representations and warranties contained in Article 2 of this Agreement unless
and until such Indemnified Losses exceed two million dollars ($2,000,000.00)
in the aggregate (the "Indemnification Threshold"), but then only to the
extent of any such excess; provided, however, the Indemnification Threshold
limitation shall not apply in any manner whatsoever to any breach of the
Fundamental Reps or to the obligations of the Sellers to the extent a breach
results from fraud or the obligations of Jerome A. Turner to the extent a
breach results from willful misconduct. For purposes of this Agreement,
"willful misconduct" shall mean a conscious, voluntary act or omission taken
with intentional disregard of legal or contractual duty and knowledge that
such action or omission is a breach of such legal or contractual duty.

  

  

(b) From and after the Closing, Parent and Buyer shall have no obligation to
indemnify Seller Indemnified Persons in respect of Indemnified Losses pursuant
to Section 6.3(a) resulting from or arising out of breaches of the
representations and warranties contained in Article 4 of this Agreement unless
such Indemnified Losses exceed the Indemnification Threshold, but then only to
the full extent of any such excess; provided, however, the Indemnification
Threshold limitation shall not apply in any manner whatsoever to any breach of
the Fundamental Reps.

  

  

(c) From and after the Closing, except as provided below, the aggregate amount
of Indemnified Losses that may be recovered by the Buyer Indemnified Persons
under Section 6.2(a)(i) may not exceed $7,500,000.00 (the "Buyer Cap"). From
and after the Closing, other than in the case of fraud, willful misconduct (as
provided in Section 6.6(d)), or breaches of Fundamental Reps, the Buyer
Indemnified Persons shall recover any Indemnified Losses that may be recovered
by the Buyer Indemnified Persons under Section 6.2(a)(i) first from the
available balance in the Escrow Account, and to the extent such amounts are
insufficient, then second, such remaining amounts from the Sellers, on a
several, and not joint, basis, based on each Seller's Percentage. For purposes
of clarification, other than in the case of fraud, willful misconduct (as
provided in Section 6.6(d)), or breaches of the Fundamental Reps, the amount
of Indemnified Losses that may be recovered by the Buyer Indemnified Persons
under Section 6.2(a)(i) other than from the Escrow Amount may not exceed
$2,500,000.00 in the aggregate. From and after the Closing, other than in the
case of fraud or willful misconduct (as provided in Section 6.6(d)), the Buyer
Indemnified Persons shall recover the first $100,000 of Indemnified Losses
that may be recovered by the Buyer Indemnified Persons under Section
6.2(a)(iv) from the available balance in the Escrow Account, and thereafter
from the Representative on behalf of the Sellers. Notwithstanding the first
four sentences of this Section 6.6(c), the Buyer Cap shall not apply to (A)
breaches of the Fundamental Reps, (B) Sections 6.2(a)(ii) through 6.2(a)(v),
(C) the obligations of the Sellers to the extent a breach results from fraud
or (D) the obligations of Jerome A. Turner to the extent a breach results from
willful misconduct.

  

  

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the limitations set forth in Section 6.6(a)
and Section 6.6(c) shall not apply (i) to the obligations of the Sellers to
the extent a breach results from fraud and (ii) to the obligations of Jerome
A. Turner to the extent a breach results from willful misconduct.

  

  

(e) From and after the Closing, the aggregate amount of Indemnified Losses
that may be recovered by the Seller Indemnified Persons under Section 6.3(a)
may not exceed $7,500,000.00 (the "Sellers Cap"). Notwithstanding the first
sentence of this Section 6.6(e), (A) the Sellers Cap shall not apply to the
Fundamental Reps, and (B) the Sellers Cap shall not apply to the obligations
of Parent or Buyer hereto to the extent a breach results from fraud.

  

  

(f) The representations and warranties of the Company and the Sellers shall
not be affected or diminished by, and no right of indemnification hereunder
shall be limited by reason of any investigation or audit conducted by Parent,
Buyer or their representatives before or after the Closing or the knowledge of
Parent or Buyer of any breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement by the other Parties at any time, or the decision of Parent or Buyer
to complete the Closing.

7.2. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Earnout
Agreement, the Consulting Agreement, the Non-Competition Agreements and the
Schedules and Exhibits hereto and thereto embody the entire agreement and
understanding of the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and
supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, relative to such subject matter.

  

  

7.3. Assignment; Binding Agreement. This Agreement and the various rights and
obligations arising hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and be binding
upon the Parties and their respective successors, heirs, devisees, legatees,
legal representatives and permitted assigns (whether direct or indirect, by

Agreement nor any of the rights, interests, or obligations hereunder shall be
transferred, delegated, or assigned (by operation of Law or otherwise);
provided, that the foregoing may be transferred, delegated, or assigned by
Parent and Buyer with the prior written consent of the Representative (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and may be transferred, delegated,

hereunder to any entity which is controlled by Parent or Buyer.

  

  

7.4. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in multiple

7.5. Headings; Interpretation; Company Disclosure Schedules.

  

  

(a) The Article and Section headings contained in this Agreement are inserted
for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of the Agreement. Each reference in this Agreement to an
Article, Section, Schedule or Exhibit, unless otherwise indicated, shall mean
an Article or a Section of this Agreement or a Schedule or Exhibit attached to
this Agreement, respectively. References herein to "days," unless otherwise
indicated, are to consecutive calendar days. Each Party hereto has
participated substantially in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement
and each Party agrees that any ambiguity herein should not be construed
against the draftsman. Whenever required by the context, any gender shall
include any other gender, the singular shall include the plural and the plural
shall include the singular.

  

  

(b) The representations and warranties in this Agreement (i) are the product
of negotiations among the parties hereto, (ii) are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto, (iii) may be intended not as statements of fact, but rather as
a way of allocating the risk to one of the parties if those statements prove
to be inaccurate, (iv) have been qualified by reference to the Company
Disclosure Schedule which contains certain disclosures that are not reflected
in the text of this Agreement and (v) may apply standards of materiality in a
way that is different from what may be viewed as material by stockholders of,
or other investors in, the Company. Consequently, Persons other than the
Indemnified Parties hereto may not rely upon the representations and
warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

  

  

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, "Person" shall mean and include an
individual, a partnership, a joint venture, a corporation, a limited liability

(d) A disclosure of an item included on a Schedule in Article 2 or Article 3
shall be deemed to relate to (i) the representations and warranties of the
Company or the Sellers that are contained in the corresponding Section or
subsection, as applicable, of this Agreement and (ii) any other representation
and warranty of the Company or Sellers that is contained in another Section or
subsection of this Agreement, but only so long as the application to any such
other Section or subsection is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other Section or
subsection.

  

  

7.6. Expenses. Except for Seller Transaction Expenses, which shall be handled
in accordance with Section 1.5, Section 1.8 and Article 6, each Party hereto

Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.
