resolve the dispute during the 30-day period commencing on the date the Parent

Price Dispute Notice or, if no such notice is delivered, upon the expiration

be delivered. If the Seller and the Parent do not obtain a final resolution
within such 30-day period, then the items remaining in dispute (including such
partys proposed resolution thereof and resulting value of the Purchase Price)
shall be submitted in writing immediately by the Seller and the Parent to a
nationally-recognized, independent accounting firm reasonably acceptable to
the Seller and the Parent (the " _Accounting Firm_ "). The terms of
appointment and engagement of the Accounting Firm shall be as agreed upon
between the Seller and the Parent, and any associated engagement fees shall be
borne 50% by the Seller and 50% by the Parent; _provided_ , that such fees
shall ultimately be allocated in accordance with  _Section 2.4(d)_. The
Accounting Firm shall be required to render a determination of the applicable
dispute within 30 days after referral of the matter to the Accounting Firm,
which determination must be in writing, must be based solely on presentations
by the Seller and the Parent (and not by independent review) and must set
forth, in reasonable detail, the basis therefor. The determination of the
Accounting Firm shall be conclusive, non-appealable and binding upon the
Seller, the Parent and the other parties hereto. The Accounting Firm (i) shall
be bound by the principles and methodologies set forth in this _Section
2.4(b)_ and in the definition of " _Net Working Capital_ " and (ii) shall not
assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed
by either party. In connection with the resolution of any dispute, the
Accounting Firm shall have access to all documents, records, work papers,
facilities and personnel necessary to make its determination. The Parent will
revise the Proposed Closing Date Calculations as appropriate to reflect the
resolution of any objections thereto pursuant to this _Section 2.4(b)_. The "
_Final Statement of Purchase Price_ " shall mean the Proposed Purchase Price
Calculation together with any revisions thereto pursuant to this _Section
2.4(b)_.

 

(c) The Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, make its financial
records available to the Seller and its accountants and other representatives
at reasonable times during the preparation and/or review by Seller of, and the
resolution of any objections with respect to, the Proposed Closing Date
Calculations.

 

(d) In the event Seller and Parent submit any unresolved objections to the
Accounting Firm for resolution as provided in _Section 2.4(b)_ , the
responsibility for the fees and expenses of such Accounting Firm shall be as
follows:

 

(i) if such Accounting Firm resolves all of the remaining objections in favor
of the Parents position (the Purchase Price so determined is referred to
herein as the " _Low Value_ "), then all of the fees and expenses of such
Accounting Firm shall be paid by Seller;

 



 



  

13

     

(ii) if such Accounting Firm resolves all of the remaining objections in favor
of Sellers position (the Purchase Price so determined is referred to herein
as the " _High Value_ "), then all of the fees and expenses of such Accounting
Firm shall be paid by Parent; and

 

(iii) if such Accounting Firm neither resolves all of the remaining objections
in favor of Parents position nor resolves all of the remaining objections in
favor of Sellers position (the Purchase Price so determined is referred to
herein as the " _Actual Value_ "), then that fraction of the fees and expenses
of the Accounting Firm equal to (x) the difference between the High Value and
the Actual Value over (y) the difference between the High Value and the Low
Value shall be paid by Seller, and Parent will be responsible for the
remainder of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm.

 

(e) Adjustment to Estimated Purchase Price.

 

(i) If the Actual Adjustment is a positive amount, Parent shall promptly pay
the amount of the Actual Adjustment by issuing shares of Parent Common Stock,
with an aggregate value (based on the Average Trading Price as of the date of
determination of the Actual Adjustment) equal to the Actual Adjustment, to
those Members who held Common Units as of the Closing Date (on a pro rata
basis based on the number of Common Units held by each Member as of
immediately prior to the Closing), as set forth in a written notice by Seller.

 

(ii) If the Actual Adjustment is a negative amount, then Seller shall promptly
pay Parent the amount of the Actual Adjustment by instructing the Escrow Agent
to deliver to Parent such number of shares of Escrowed Stock that has an
aggregate value (based on the Average Trading Price as of the date of
determination of the Actual Adjustment) equal to the Actual Adjustment.

43

     

Parent and Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all
consents, approvals and agreements of, and make all notices and filings with,
any Authority necessary to permit the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In the event any claim, action, suit,
investigation or other proceeding by any Authority or other Person is
commenced which questions the validity or legality of the transactions
contemplated hereby or seeks damages in connection therewith, the parties
hereto agree to cooperate and use best efforts to defend against such claim,
action, suit, investigation or other proceeding and, if an injunction or other
order is issued in any such action, suit or other proceeding, to use best
efforts to have such injunction or other order lifted, and to cooperate
reasonably regarding any other impediment to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

8.2. _**Reasonable Efforts to Obtain Consents**_ **.** The Company hereby
agrees to use its reasonable efforts to obtain the Company Consents on a
timely manner prior to the Closing Date.

 

8.3. _**Tax Matters**_.

 

(a) The Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared and duly and timely file
or cause to be duly and timely filed on a timely basis all Tax Returns with
respect to the Company and each of the Subsidiaries for taxable periods ending
on or prior to the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be true, correct and
complete in all material respects, shall be prepared on a basis consistent
with the similar Tax Returns for the immediately preceding periods and shall
not make, amend, revoke, terminate or rescind any election or change any
accounting practice or procedure without Parents consent (which will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Seller shall give a copy of each such
Tax Return to Parent with sufficient time for its review and comment prior to
filing. The Seller shall pay or cause to be paid the Taxes shown due and owing
on such Tax Returns. Parents receipt or review of or giving comments on any
Tax Return does not affect the obligations of the Seller pursuant to _ARTICLE
XI_ of this Agreement. The Company and each Subsidiary will permit the Seller
and its representatives to have reasonable access to the Companys and each
Subsidiarys respective officers, directors, employees, agents, assets and
properties and all relevant Books and Records relating to the Business and
assets of the Company or any Subsidiary during normal business hours and will
furnish to the Seller and its representatives such information, financial
records and other documents relating to the Company and each Subsidiary and
the Business as may reasonably be requested; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such access and information is reasonably related to the completion of the
Tax Returns the Seller is required to file pursuant to this _Section 8.3(a)_.
Any such information, financial records and other documents relating to the
Company, any Subsidiary and the Business provided to the Seller and its
representatives shall be subject to the provisions of _Section 7.1_ , but such
information may be incorporated into any such Tax Return.

 

(b) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the parties shall elect to
treat the period that includes the Closing Date with respect to any Tax as
ending on the Closing Date and shall take such steps as may be necessary
therefor. For purposes of this Agreement, any Taxes for a period which
includes but does not end on the Closing Date shall be allocated between the
period through and including the Closing Date and the balance of the period
based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of the Closing Date,
_provided_ , _however_ , that

 



 



 

44

     

any real property or personal property taxes and any annual exemption amounts
shall be allocated based on the relative number of days in the Pre-Closing
Period and the balance of the period.

 

8.4. _**Proxy Statement; Special Meeting**_.

 

(a) As soon as is reasonably practicable after receipt by the Parent from the
Company of all financial and other information relating to the Company as the
Parent may reasonably request for its preparation, the Parent shall prepare
and file with the SEC under the Exchange Act, and with all other applicable
regulatory bodies, proxy materials for the purpose of soliciting proxies from
holders of Parent Common Stock to vote in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated hereby (" _Parent
Stockholder Approval_ ") at a meeting of holders of Parent Common Stock to be
called and held for such purpose (the " _Special Meeting_ "). Such proxy
materials shall be in the form of a proxy statement to be used for the purpose
of soliciting proxies from holders of Parent Common Stock for the matters to
be acted upon at the Special Meeting (the " _Proxy Statement_ "). The Company
shall furnish to the Parent all information concerning the Company as the
Parent may reasonably request in connection with the preparation of the Proxy
Statement. The Company and its counsel shall be given an opportunity to review
and comment on the preliminary Proxy Statement prior to its filing with the
SEC. The Parent, with the assistance of the Company, shall promptly respond to
any SEC comments on the Proxy Statement and shall otherwise use reasonable
best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be approved by the SEC as
promptly as practicable. The Parent shall also take any and all actions
required to satisfy the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act. Prior to the Closing Date, the Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to
this Agreement to be registered or qualified under all applicable blue sky
laws of each of the states and territories of the United States in which it
is believed, based on information furnished by the Company, the Members reside
and in which such registration or qualification is required and to take any
other such actions that may be reasonably necessary to enable the Parent
Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this Agreement in each such
jurisdiction.

 

(b) As soon as practicable (but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days)
following the approval of the Proxy Statement by the SEC, the Parent shall
distribute the Proxy Statement to the holders of Parent Common Stock and,
pursuant thereto, shall call, give notice of, convene and hold the Special
Meeting in accordance with the DGCL not more than 25 days after mailing the
Proxy Statement to the holders of Parent Common Stock and, subject to the
other provisions of this Agreement, solicit proxies from such holders to vote
in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the
transactions contemplated hereby and the other matters presented to the
stockholders of Parent for approval or adoption at the Special Meeting.

 

(c) The Parent shall comply with all applicable provisions of and rules under
the Exchange Act and all applicable provisions of the DGCL in the preparation,
filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement, the solicitation of proxies
thereunder, and the calling and holding of the Special Meeting. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
ensure that the Proxy Statement does not, as of the date on which it is first
distributed to stockholders of the Parent, and as of the date of the Special
Meeting, contain

 



 



 

45

     

any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. The Parent shall promptly correct
any information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement if and to the
extent that such information becomes false or misleading and the Parent shall
take all steps necessary to cause the Proxy Statement as so corrected to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of the Parent (as and
to the extent required by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act) and to the
Seller. The Parent will provide to the Seller and its counsel any comments
that the Parent or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff, whether
written or oral, with respect to the Proxy Statement promptly after receipt of
any such comments. The Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to respond
promptly to any comments received from the SEC or its staff, in each case (if
necessary) after consultation with the Seller and compliance with the terms
hereof with respect to the preparation of the Proxy Statement and any
amendments or supplements thereto.

 

(d) The Parent, acting through its board of directors, shall include in the
Proxy Statement the recommendation of its board of directors that the holders
of Parent Common Stock vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the
approval of the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not withdraw or
modify its recommendation. The Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the Parent Stockholder Approval.

 

8.5. _**Other Actions**_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after execution of this Agreement, the Parent
will prepare and file a Current Report on Form 8-K pursuant to the Exchange
Act to report the execution of this Agreement (" _Signing Form 8-K_ "), which
the Company shall be entitled to review and comment upon prior to filing.
Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall
also issue a press release announcing the execution of this Agreement (the "
_Signing Press Release_ ").

 

(b) At least five (5) days prior to Closing, the Parent shall prepare a draft
Form 8-K announcing the Closing, together with, or incorporating by reference,
the financial statements prepared by the Company and its accountant, and such
other information that may be required to be disclosed with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any report or form to be filed
with the SEC (" _Closing Form 8-K_ "), which shall be in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Company. Prior to Closing, the Parent and the Company shall
jointly prepare a press release announcing the consummation of the
transactions hereunder (" _Closing Press Release_ "). Concurrently with the
Closing, Parent shall distribute the Closing Press Release. Concurrently with
the Closing, or as soon as practicable thereafter, Parent shall file the
Closing Form 8-K with the SEC.

 

8.6. _**Access to Information**_. From the date hereof until and including the
Closing Date, the Parent and the Purchaser shall (i) provide the Company, the

representatives such information relating to the business of the Parent and
the Purchaser as such Persons may reasonably request and (iii) cause the
employees, counsel, accountants and representatives of the Parent and the
Purchaser to cooperate with the

 



 



 

46

     

Company, the Seller and their counsel in their investigation of the business
and operations of the Parent and the Purchaser; _provided_ that no
investigation pursuant to this _Section 8.6_ (or any investigation prior to
the date hereof) shall affect any representation or warranty given by the
Parent or the Company hereunder.

 

8.7. _**Notices of Certain Events; Updated Disclosure Schedules**_.

 

(a) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, each party hereto will give
prompt notice to the other parties hereto of:

 

(i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging or raising the
possibility that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or that the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement would result
in the loss of any rights or privileges of such notifying person to any such
Person;

 

(ii) any notice or other communication from any Authority that may adversely
affect the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

(iii) any Actions commenced or, to such notifying partys knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving such notifying party or otherwise
affecting the notifying party or that relate to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

 

(iv) the occurrence of any fact or circumstance which would likely cause any
representation or warranty made by such notifying party in this Agreement to
be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect.

 

(b) At any time prior to the Closing, Seller and the Company may deliver to
the Purchaser and the Parent a supplement or amendment to the disclosure
schedules to this Agreement (the " _Updated Schedules_ "); _provided_ , that
such Updated Schedules shall not relate to, and shall only be effective with
respect to, any occurrence or state of facts that, to the Knowledge of the
Company, existed prior to the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that following written notice thereof from the Company and/or Seller (as
applicable) to Parent and Purchaser, Parent and Purchaser shall have the right
to terminate this Agreement within seven (7) days following their receipt of
the Updated Schedules to the extent that, in the absence of the changes to
such Updated Schedules, the condition set forth in Section 9.2(a) would not be
capable of being satisfied. Unless Parent or Purchaser exercises its right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing, the Updated Schedules will
be deemed to have amended the disclosure schedules to this Agreement, to have
qualified the representations and warranties contained herein with respect to
such events or circumstances set forth in the Updated Schedules, and to have
cured any misrepresentation or breach of warranty that otherwise might have
existed hereunder by reason of the event or circumstance set forth in such
Updated Schedules (including for purposes of _ARTICLE XI_  hereof).

 

8.8. _**Securities Law Compliance**_ **.** Prior to the Closing, the Parent
shall use its best efforts to ensure that the issuance of Parent Common Stock
hereunder will be conducted in compliance with Regulation D under the

(a) For a period of one year following the Closing, Purchaser shall provide or
cause to be provided, to each individual who is a current employee of the
Company as of the Closing (" _Company Employees_ ") total compensation and
benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the total
compensation and benefits provided to Company Employees immediately before the
Closing (excluding any equity based compensation); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing herein shall be construed to establish or amend any benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement or to prevent the amendment or termination
of any Company Plan or interfere with Purchasers or any of its subsidiaries
right or obligation to make such changes as are necessary to conform with
applicable Law or shall cause or require the extension, renewal or amendment
of, or prevent the expiration of, any employment agreement which shall expire,
terminate or fail to renew pursuant to its terms during such period.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this

the employment of any employee at any time and for any or no reason.

 

(b) For purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and
entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant under any benefit

Employees as of the Closing shall receive service credit for service with the
Company to the same extent such service credit was granted under the Employee
Benefits Plans, subject to offsets for previously accrued benefits and no
duplication of benefits and not for purposes of benefit accrual under a
defined benefit plan. The Purchaser shall (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Company Employees
under any welfare benefit plans that such employees may be eligible to
participate in after the Closing, other than limitations or waiting
periods that are already in effect with respect to such employees and that
have not been satisfied as of the Closing under any welfare benefit plan
maintained for the Company Employees immediately prior to the Closing and (ii)
provide each Company Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles

harmless each present and former director and officer of the Company
(collectively, the " _D andO_

 



 



 

48

     

 _Indemnified Parties_ "), against any and all damages incurred or suffered by
any of the DandO Indemnified Parties in connection with any liabilities or any
action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out
of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing, to the fullest
extent that the Company would have been permitted under applicable Law and

be, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, to indemnify such
DandO Indemnified Parties and (ii) advance expenses as incurred by any DandO
Indemnified Party in connection with any matters for which such DandO
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification from Purchaser pursuant to
this  _Section 8.10_ to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law or,
if greater, under the Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the DandO Indemnified Party to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
and finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction and all rights of
appeal have lapsed that such DandO Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification under applicable Law, the Company certificate of incorporation
and Company bylaws, and pursuant to this _Section 8.10(a)_.

 

(b) For a period of six (6) years following the Closing, Purchaser shall
maintain in effect a directors and officers liability insurance policy
covering those persons who are currently covered by the Companys directors
and officers liability insurance policy (copies of which have been heretofore
delivered by the Company to Purchaser and its agents and representatives) with
coverage in amount and scope at least as favorable as the Companys existing
coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Purchaser be
required to expend in the aggregate in excess of two hundred percent (200%) of
the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage, and if
such premium would at any time exceed two hundred percent (200%) of such
amount, then Purchaser shall maintain insurance policies which provide the
maximum and best coverage available at an annual premium equal to two hundred
percent (200%) of such amount; and _provided_ , _further_ , that this _Section
8.10(b)_ shall be deemed to have been satisfied if a prepaid policy or
policies (i.e., "tail coverage") have been obtained by the Company which
policy or policies provide such directors and officers with the coverage
described in this _Section 8.10(b)_ for an aggregate period of not less than
six (6) years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
occurred on or before the Closing Date, including with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(c) The terms and provisions of this _Section 8.10_ are intended to be in
addition to the rights otherwise available to the DandO Indemnified Parties by
applicable Law, charter, bylaw or agreement, and shall operate for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, the DandO Indemnified Parties and their
respective heirs and representatives, each of whom is an intended third party
beneficiary of this _Section 8.10_.

 

(d) Nothing contained herein shall be interpreted to require the Purchaser or
the Parent to indemnify or provide for the indemnification of any DandO
Indemnified Party in connection with any damages incurred or loss suffered by
any DandO Indemnified Party as a result of such partys gross negligence or
willful or unlawful conduct.

these transactions, and adequate reserves shall be made against amounts
distributed from the Trust Fund therefor. Promptly following such disbursement

8.12. _**Settlement of Prior Dispute**_. In the event that the Company
recovers (whether before, on or after the Closing Date) any amounts in the

paid to the Members in the manner directed in writing by the Seller.
Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, in the event that, following the Closing, the Company or any
Subsidiary is subjected to any loss, liability or expense as a result of the
foregoing actions and proceedings, all such losses, liabilities and expenses
shall be for the account of the Seller. This covenant shall survive the
Closing.

ARTICLE XI

 

INDEMNIFICATION

 

11.1. _**Indemnification of Parent, Purchaser**_ **.** After the Closing, the
Seller and the Members hereby severally (but not jointly) agree to indemnify
and hold harmless Parent, Purchaser, and their respective Affiliates and each
of their respective directors, officers, employees, shareholders, attorneys
and agents and permitted assignees (collectively, the " _Parent Indemnitees_
," _provided_ , _however_ , the term "Parent Indemnitees" shall not include
any of the Members regardless of their capacity), against and in respect of
any and all loss, payment, demand, penalty, liability, judgment, damage,
diminution in value, claim or out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
actual costs of investigation and reasonable attorneys fees and other out-of-
pocket costs and expenses) (all of the foregoing collectively, " _Losses_ ")
incurred or sustained by any Parent Indemnitee after the Closing as a result
of (a) any breach of any of the representations, warranties and covenants of
the Company or the Seller contained herein or any certificate or other writing
delivered pursuant hereto; _provided_ , that with respect to any breach of any
of the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.5_ ,

 



 



 

54

     

any indemnification obligation related thereto may only be made against the
applicable Member who had breached such representation or warranty in _Section
4.5_ or (b) Taxes of the Company, the Seller or any Subsidiary for any Pre-
Closing Period, and all costs in connection therewith or with enforcing rights
hereunder.

 

11.2. _**Indemnification of Seller**_ **.** After the Closing, Parent and the
Purchaser hereby agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Seller and its
respective Affiliates, and each of their respective directors, officers,
employees, shareholders, attorneys, agents and permitted assignees (the "
_Company Indemnitees_ ") against and in respect of any Losses incurred or
sustained by the Company Indemnitees after the Closing as a result of any
breach of any of the representations, warranties and covenants of Parent or
the Purchaser contained herein or any certificate or other writing delivered
pursuant hereto.

 

11.3. _**Procedure**_. The following shall apply with respect to all claims by
either a Parent Indemnitee or a Company Indemnitee (each, an " _Indemnified
Party_ ") for indemnification:

 

(a) An Indemnified Party shall give to the party obligated to indemnify such
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Agreement (the " _Indemnifying Parties_ "),
prompt written notice (an " _Indemnification Notice_ ") of any third-party
claim, investigation, action, suit, hearing or proceeding with respect to
which such Indemnified Party seeks indemnification pursuant to _Section 11.1_
or _11.2_ (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), which shall describe in reasonable
detail the Loss, liability or damage that has been or may be suffered by the
Indemnified Party. The failure to give the Indemnification Notice shall not
impair any of the rights or benefits of such Indemnified Party under _Section
11.1_ or _11.2_ , except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually
prejudiced thereby. The Indemnification Notice shall identify specifically the
basis in reasonable detail under which indemnification is sought pursuant to
_ARTICLE XI_ and enclose true and correct copies of any written document
furnished to the Indemnified Party by the Person that instituted the Third
Party Claim.

 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of such
Indemnification Notice to assume the conduct and control, through counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party, of the settlement or defense thereof (and by assuming such
control, the Indemnifying Party agrees that such Claim is an indemnifiable
Claim hereunder, subject to the terms, provisions and limitations contained in
this Agreement), and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party and such counsel in connection therewith; _provided_ , that
the Indemnifying Party shall permit the Indemnified Party to participate in
such settlement or defense through counsel chosen by such Indemnified Party at
the Indemnified Partys expense ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the fees for counsel of the Indemnified Party if
(i) the employment of separate counsel shall have been authorized in writing
by any Indemnifying Party in connection with the defense of such Third Party
Claim or (ii) the Indemnified Partys counsel shall have advised the
Indemnified Party in writing, with a copy delivered to the Indemnifying Party,
that there is a conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate under
applicable standards of professional conduct to have common counsel). So long
as the Indemnifying Party is actively and diligently contesting any such claim
in good faith, the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle any such claim
without the prior written consent of the

 



 



 

55

     

Indemnifying Party (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless the
Indemnified Party waives any right to indemnity therefor by the Indemnifying
Party for such claim. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), consent to any admission or the entry of
any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to any Third Party
Claim which (x) imposes an injunction or other equitable relief upon the
Indemnified Party or (y) does not include an unconditional provision whereby
the plaintiff or claimant in the matter releases the Indemnified Party from
all liability with respect thereto.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the above, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to
control (but shall be entitled to participate at its own expense in the
defense of), and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have sole control
over, the defense or settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment of
any Third Party Claim (i) as to which the Indemnifying Party fails to assume
the defense within 30 days after the Indemnified Party gives notice thereof to
the Indemnifying Party, or (ii) that specifically seeks a monetary payment in
an amount that is less than the difference between the Deductible Amount and
the amount of Losses, if any, that the Parent Indemnitees have incurred as of
the date of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnified Party shall make no settlement, compromise, admission, or
acknowledgment that would give rise to liability on the part of any
Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of such Indemnifying
Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 

(d) The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in the
defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim in respect of which indemnity
may be sought hereunder and shall furnish such records, information and
testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials and appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

 

11.4. _**Insurance; Tax Benefits**_. The amount of any Losses for which
indemnification is provided under this _ARTICLE XI_ shall be reduced by any
amounts recoverable by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates from any
third party (including under any insurance policy). If the amount with respect
to which any claim is made under this _ARTICLE XI_ gives rise to a Tax Benefit
to the Indemnified Party that made the claim, such Indemnified Party shall
refund to the Indemnifying Party the amount of such Tax Benefit when, as and
if actually realized. " _Tax Benefit_ " means, with respect to any Indemnified
Party, an amount by which the Tax liability of such Indemnified Party (or
group of Affiliates including such Indemnified Party) is actually reduced
(including by deduction, reduction of income by virtue of increased tax basis
or otherwise, entitlement to refund, credit or otherwise), net of any increase
in such partys Tax liability, as a result of its receipt of payment for the
applicable indemnity claim (but in any case, not below zero).

 

11.5. _**Limitations on Indemnification**_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _ARTICLE XI_ ,

 

(a) (i) no claim for indemnification shall be made by any Indemnified Party
unless the aggregate amount of Losses of the Indemnified Parties exceed one
million two hundred thousand dollars ($1,200,000) (the " _Deductible Amount_
") and then only to the extent

 



 



 

56

     

such Losses exceed the Deductible Amount; and (ii) in no event shall the
aggregate obligation of the Indemnifying Parties under this Article XI exceed
twelve million dollars ($12,000,000) (the " _Cap_ "); _provided_ , that the
Deductible Amount and the Cap shall not apply to: (1) Losses pursuant to
_Section 11.1(b)_ ; and (2) Losses arising under _Section 11.1(a)_ solely with
respect to any breach of the representations or warranties set forth in
Sections _3.1_ (Corporate Existence and Power), _Section 3.2_ (Corporate
Authorization), _Section 3.4_ (Subsidiaries), _Section 3.5_ (Capitalization
and Ownership), _Section 4.1_ (Ownership of Stock; Authority), _Section 0_
(Due Incorporation), _Section 5.2_ (Corporate Authorization), _Section 5.9_
(Capitalization and Ownership of Parent), and _Section 5.14_   (Issuance and
Ownership of Parent Common Stock (such representations and warranties shall
be collectively referred to as the " _Fundamental Representations_ "); and

 

(b) no party hereto shall have any liability under any provision of this
Agreement or otherwise for any punitive, incidental, consequential, special or
indirect damages, including business interruption, loss of future revenue,
profits or income, or loss of business reputation or opportunity relating to
the breach or alleged breach of this Agreement or any of the agreements
contemplated hereby or any schedule, certificate or other document delivered
pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 

11.6. _**Survival of Indemnification Rights**_ **.** The representations and
warranties of the Company, the Seller, Parent and the Purchaser shall survive
until the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
that the Fundamental Representations shall survive until 30 days following the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. The indemnification to
which any Indemnified Party is entitled from the Indemnifying Parties pursuant
to _Section 11.1_ or _11.2_ for Losses shall be effective so long as it is
asserted prior to the time such representations, warranties or covenants cease
to survive hereunder.

 

11.7. _**Manner of Payment**_. Any indemnification to be paid by any
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _ARTICLE XI_ will be paid only in shares
of Parent Common Stock; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller and each
Member shall have the option, at their sole election, to pay any and all such
amounts in cash.

 

(a) Except to the extent that any Member elects to satisfy any indemnification
obligation in cash, any indemnification obligation owing to the Parent
Indemnitees pursuant to this Article XI shall be effected (i) first by
offsetting such amount against the Escrowed Stock in the manner described
below, in which case the Seller, the Company and Parent shall promptly deliver
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to distribute the appropriate
number of shares of Parent Common Stock to the Parent Indemnitees within five
(5) Business Days after the determination thereof in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement, and (ii) thereafter, the Parent Indemnities shall have
recourse, on a several basis and in accordance with this _ARTICLE XI_ , to the
Parent Common Stock then held by the Members in the manner described below.
For purposes of determining the portion of any indemnification obligation
owing to the Parent Indemnitees by each Member pursuant to this _Section 11.7_
, such indemnification obligation shall first be allocated to the Members on a
pro rata basis (based on the number of shares of the Parent Common Stock that
the Parent was instructed to deliver to such Member pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement) and, to the extent

 



 



 

57

     

that the aggregate indemnification obligations owing to the Parent Indemnitees
in accordance with this _ARTICLE XI_ exceeds the value (based on the Average
Trading Price as of the applicable date of determination) of the Parent Common
Stock that the Parent was instructed to deliver to such Member pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, such indemnification obligation shall thereafter be
allocated to the Members on a pro rata basis (based on the number of shares of
the Parent Common Stock that the Parent was instructed to deliver to such
Member pursuant to the terms of this Agreement with respect to such Members
Series A Preferred Units).

 

(b) In the event that the Company Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this _ARTICLE XI_ , such indemnification shall be paid in the form
of Parent Common Stock. For purposes of this _Section 11.7(b)_ , the value of
each share of Parent Common Stock shall be equal to its Average Trading Price
at such time.

 

11.8. _**Mitigation of Loss**_. The Company, the Seller, the Purchaser and the
Parent shall cooperate with each other with respect to resolving any claim,
liability or Loss with respect to which one party is obligated to indemnify
any Parent Indemnitee or Company Indemnitee, as the case may be, including by
making commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any such claim, liability
or Loss. In the event that the Company, the Seller, the Purchaser or the
Parent shall fail to make such commercially reasonably efforts to mitigate any
such claim, liability or Loss, then notwithstanding anything else to the
contrary contained herein, the other party shall not be required to indemnify
any Person for that portion of any claim, liability or Loss that could
reasonably be expected to have been avoided if the Company, the Seller, the
Purchaser or the Parent, as the case may be, had made such efforts. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Parent and Purchaser shall, and
shall cause the Company and their respective Affiliates to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to seek full recovery under all insurance policies covering
any Loss to the same extent as they would if such Loss were not subject to
indemnification hereunder. Parent and Purchaser shall, and shall cause the
Company and their respective Affiliates to, attempt to cause the party making
a claim for indemnification under this Agreement to realize as soon as
possible the Tax Benefit available to such party in connection with the
accrual, incurrence or payment of any Loss.

 

11.9. _**Exclusive Remedy**_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, after the Closing, indemnification pursuant to the
provisions of this _ARTICLE XI_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for the
parties hereto for any misrepresentation or breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or other provision contained in this Agreement
or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto and for any claims with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than for
fraud. The Parent Common Stock issued to the Members hereunder shall be the
sole source of recovery for any claim for indemnification made pursuant to
_Section 11.1_ hereof.

 

11.10. _**Adjustment to Purchase Price**_. The parties agree that the payment
of any indemnity under this Article XI shall be treated as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price paid by the Parent and Purchaser hereunder for Tax purposes
to the extent that it may properly be so characterized under applicable law.

the Arbitration. The parties expressly consent to the personal and subject
matter jurisdiction of the Arbitrator to arbitrate any and all matters to be

subject of any bankruptcy, reorganization, or insolvency proceeding.

 

(j) The parties shall indemnify the Arbitrator and any experts employed by the
