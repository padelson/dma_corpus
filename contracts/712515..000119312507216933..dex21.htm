 of shares of Company Capital Stock, each share of Company Capital Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 1.6 and throughout
this Agreement, will be canceled and extinguished and will be converted
automatically into the right to receive upon surrender of the certificate
representing such shares of Company Capital Stock in the manner provided in
Section 1.8, an amount of cash without interest equal to:

(i) In the case of Series C Preferred Stock (other than any Dissenting
Shares), the Series C Preferred Preference Per Share;

(ii) In the case of Series B Preferred Stock (other than any Dissenting
Shares), the Series B Preferred Preference Per Share;

(iii) In the case of Series A Preferred Stock (other than any Dissenting
Shares), the Series A Preferred Preference Per Share; and

The effect of the Merger on the Company Capital Stock provided
hereunder shall constitute an amendment to the Companys Organizational
Documents to the extent that the consideration for such Company Capital Stock
provided for under this Section 1.6(b) conflicts with any such Organizational
Documents. 

(c) _Repurchase Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 1.6 to the
contrary, if any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk
of forfeiture, escrow or other condition under any applicable restricted stock
purchase agreement or other agreement with the Company or any subsidiary
thereof, then the portion of the Common Consideration payable by Parent for
such shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.6(b)(iv) will also
be unvested and subject to the same risk of forfeiture, escrow or other
condition and will be paid to the holders thereof over time as such shares of
Company Common Stock would have vested, in each case as set forth in such
agreements, or such other time frame as is agreed to between Parent and the
holders of such shares of Company Common Stock. For the avoidance of doubt,
it is understood that the Common Consideration payable (a) with respect to the
Company Common Stock held in the Escrow Account (as defined in the Pandemic
Contribution Agreement) at the Effective Time, when delivered pursuant to
Section 1.8, shall be deposited in such Escrow Account pursuant to Section
2.6(d) of the Pandemic Contribution Agreement and (b) with respect to any
Company Common Stock held in the Escrow Account (as defined in the BioWare
Combination Agreement) at the Effective Time (after giving effect to the
Exchange and Tender Offer), when delivered pursuant to Section 1.8, shall be
deposited in such Escrow Account pursuant to Section 2.6(d) of the BioWare
Combination Agreement. The Common Consideration and any interest or earnings
on the Common Consideration deposited in either of such escrow accounts shall
accrue and be paid in the manner set forth in the respective escrow
agreements entered into pursuant to the Pandemic Contribution Agreement and
the BioWare Combination Agreement (true and complete copies of such escrow
agreements have been made available to Parent prior to the date hereof). 

(d) _Treatment of Company Options; Company Warrants; and Exchangeable Shares_.

(i) _Effect on Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each then outstanding
Company Option, regardless of the exercise prices thereof or whether vested

Parent under this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to, the same
terms and conditions set forth in the agreement and plan governing such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any vesting
provisions), except that (A) each such  



 

-11- ##### Table of Contents

  

 Company Option will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance
with its terms) for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal
to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were
issuable upon exercise of such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest
whole share of Parent Common Stock and (B) the per share exercise price for
the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed
Company Option will be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the exercise
price per share of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

(ii) _Company Warrants_. No outstanding Company Warrants shall be assumed by
Parent and each such Company Warrant outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time will at and after the Effective Time represent only the
right to receive the Per Warrant Spread Amount upon delivery of such Company
Warrants for cancellation.

(iii) _Exchangeable Shares_. On the Closing Date but immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each Exchangeable Share (other than Exchangeable Shares held
by the Company or its subsidiaries) shall be purchased by the Company or by
Callco, at Parents option, for one share of Company Common Stock as
contemplated by Section 7.2 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions and Section
5.18.

(e) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each share of common stock of Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and exchanged for one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate of Sub
evidencing ownership of any such shares shall continue to evidence ownership
of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(f) _Adjustments_. In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into Company Capital Stock), reorganization, reclassification, combination,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company Capital Stock or
Parent Common Stock occurring after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Effective Time, all references in this Agreement to specified numbers of
shares of any class or series (or trading prices therefor) affected thereby,
shall be equitably adjusted to the extent necessary to provide the parties the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization, reclassification,
combination, recapitalization or other like change.

 1.7 _Dissenting Shares_.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary,
any shares of Company Capital Stock held by a holder who has not effectively
withdrawn or lost such holders appraisal rights for such shares under
Delaware Law (the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into or
represent a right to receive the applicable consideration for Company Capital
Stock set forth in Section 1.6, but the holder thereof shall only be entitled
to such rights as are provided by Section 262 of Delaware Law.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.7(a), if any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) such holders appraisal rights under Delaware Law, then,
as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such
holders shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only
the right to receive the consideration for Company Capital Stock set forth in
Section 1.6, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate
representing such shares.



 

-12- ##### Table of Contents

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall give Parent (i) prompt
notice of any written demand for appraisal received by the Company pursuant
to the applicable provisions of Delaware Law, and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation, except with the prior written
consent of the Stockholder Representative, shall make any payment with respect
to any such demands or offer to settle or settle any such demands.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Company (i) makes any payment or payments in respect of any
Dissenting Shares or (ii) incurs any out-of-pocket Losses in respect of any
Dissenting Shares (excluding payments for such shares) ((i) and (ii)
together, "Dissenting Share Payments"), Parent shall be entitled to recover
under the terms of Article VII the amount by which such Dissenting Share
Payments exceed the amount that the holder of such Dissenting Shares would
have otherwise received pursuant to Section 1.6 had such holder complied with
the exchange procedures set forth in Section 1.8.

 1.8 _Surrender of Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall select a nationally

shall make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with
this Article I that portion of the Total Consideration payable pursuant to
Section 1.6 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock.

Date, Parent or the Exchange Agent shall mail or cause to be mailed the letter
of transmittal in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit F (the
"Letter of Transmittal") to the Company Stockholders at the address set forth
opposite each such Company Stockholders name delivered by the Company prior
thereto. After receipt of such Letter of Transmittal and any other documents
that Parent or the Exchange Agent may reasonably require in order to effect
the exchange (the "Exchange Documents"), the Company Stockholders will
surrender the certificates representing their shares of Company Capital Stock
(the "Company Stock Certificates") to the Exchange Agent for cancellation
together with duly completed and validly executed Exchange Documents. Upon
surrender of a Company Stock Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent, together with such Exchange Documents, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and subject to the terms
of Section 1.8(d), (i) the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be
entitled to receive from the Exchange Agent in exchange therefor, the cash
constituting that portion of the Total Consideration to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 1.6 (rounded to the nearest cent, with $0.005
rounding up), and (ii) the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be
canceled as of the Effective Time. Any such holder surrendering its Company
Stock Certificate and duly completed Letter of Transmittal in accordance with
the terms hereof prior to the Closing Date shall be entitled to receive (or
have delivery commenced, if by check) its applicable portion of the Total
Consideration promptly following the Effective Time, in each case either, at
the election of such holder, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated in writing by such holder or by check delivered to
the address of such holder. Until so surrendered, each Company Stock
Certificate outstanding after the Effective Time will be deemed, for
all corporate purposes thereafter, to evidence only the right to receive the
consideration provided for in this Article I. No portion of the Total
Consideration will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock
Certificate with respect to shares of Company Capital Stock formerly
represented thereby until the holder of record of such Company Stock
Certificate shall surrender such Company Stock Certificate and the Exchange
Documents pursuant hereto.

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. If the cash payment or check evidencing the cash
to be paid pursuant to Section 1.6 is to be made to a Person other than the
Person whose name is reflected on the Company Stock Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor, it will be a condition of the payment thereof that the
certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper
form for transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange will have paid
to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes required
by reason of the payment of any portion of the Total Consideration in any
name other than that of the registered holder of the certificate surrendered,
or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it
that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

(e) _Exchange Agent to Return Merger Consideration_. At any time following the
last day of the twelfth month following the Effective Time, Parent shall be
entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to Parent or its designated
successor or assign all Total Consideration that has been deposited with the
Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 1.8(b), not disbursed to the holders of
Company Stock Certificates pursuant to Section 1.8(c), and thereafter the
holders of Company Stock Certificates shall be entitled to look only to Parent
(subject to the terms of Section 1.8(f)) only as general creditors thereof
with respect to any and all cash amounts that may be payable to such holders
of Company Stock Certificates pursuant to Sections 1.6 upon the due surrender
of such Company Stock Certificates and duly executed Exchange Documents
in the manner set forth in Section 1.8(c). No interest shall be payable for
the cash amounts delivered to Parent pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 1.8(e) and which are subsequently delivered to the holders of
Company Stock Certificates.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
1.8, neither the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation, nor any party
hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Capital Stock for any
amount paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law. 

 1.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. The portion of
the Total Consideration paid or payable in respect of the surrender for
exchange of shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to be full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of Company Capital Stock, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of
shares of Company Capital Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Company Stock Certificates
are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.

 1.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Company
Stock Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof, such consideration, if any, as may be required pursuant to
Section 1.6; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent or Exchange Agent may, in
their discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof,
require the Company Stockholder who is the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificates to either (i) deliver a bond in such amount as it may
reasonably direct or (ii) provide an indemnification agreement in a form and
substance acceptable to Parent and Exchange Agent, against any claim that may
be made against Parent or the Exchange Agent with respect to the certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 1.11 _Withholding Taxes_. The Company and, on its behalf, Parent, Callco,
the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent, shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement such amounts as may be
required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under any provision of federal,
local or foreign tax law or under any applicable legal requirement. To
the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

with counsel and the Company, will provide Parent with timely access to the
fullest extent possible to the substance of the information described in this
Section 5.2 in a manner that allows the Company to comply with applicable Law
and confidentiality obligations or preserve the Companys attorney-client
privilege, as the case may be. The Company agrees to provide to Parent and
its accountants, counsel and other representatives copies of internal
financial statements (including Tax Returns and supporting documentation) that

applicable securities laws, (ii) necessary to comply with the rules of the
Nasdaq Global Select Market, or (iii) is reasonably necessary in response to

breach of their respective representations, warranties or covenants of which
they are aware that the Company believes is likely to cause any condition
contained in Article VI to not be satisfied at the Closing and (b) the receipt
by the Company or any of its subsidiaries of any actual, or to the Knowledge
of the Company, Threatened material Action against the Company or its

Parents request, assist Parent and its subsidiaries with its efforts to
enter into an offer letter and related agreements (or similar documents) with
such Company Employees as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement

in this Section 5.8, the Company will consult with Parent (and will consider
in good faith the advice of Parent) prior to sending any notices or other
communication materials to the Company Employees.

(b) To the extent Parent elects to have Continuing Employees, and their
eligible dependents where applicable, participate in Parents employee
benefit plans, programs or policies following the Closing Date, (i) each such
Continuing Employee will receive credit for purposes of eligibility to
participate and vesting under such plans, programs and policies for years of
service with Company (or any of its subsidiaries) prior to the Closing Date,
provided such credit does not result in duplication of benefits, and (ii)
Parent, to the extent required by applicable Law and as permitted by the
terms of the applicable group health plans, will give credit for any co-
payments or deductibles paid during the year in which the Closing Date occurs
and will cause any and all pre-existing condition limitations, eligibility
waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements under any group
health plans of Parent in which such employees and their eligible dependents
will participate to be waived.

(c) Parent shall file with the SEC promptly following the Closing Date (and in

statement on Form S-8 that registers under the Securities Act the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to Company Options assumed by Parent

necessary notices and obtain all necessary consents, waivers and approvals of
any parties to any of its or its subsidiaries Contracts as are (a) required
thereunder in connection with the Merger so as to preserve all rights of, and
benefits to, the Company under such Contract from and after the Effective Time
or (b) requested by Parent in writing to the extent that it would be required
for any post-Merger assignment to Parent or its Affiliates for any such
Contracts to remain in full force and effect or otherwise not be breached (it
being understood that Parent will reimburse the Company for any reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred and documented by the Company in
connection with delivering all necessary notices and obtaining all necessary
consents, waivers and approvals pursuant to clause (b) to the extent that
such costs and expenses represent non-deminimus additional cost and expense
relative to the costs and expenses to be incurred in connection with clause
(a)). For the avoidance of doubt, it is acknowledged and agreed that the
covenant in the preceding sentence to use all reasonable efforts to obtain
consents, waivers and approvals does not constitute a guarantee that any or
all such consents, waivers and approvals will be obtained. Parent and the
Company shall discuss and agree on a process to send such notices and seek
such consents prior to the Company contacting third Persons to obtain such
consents. Such notices, consents, waivers and approvals shall be in a form
acceptable to Parent. No  



 

-41- ##### Table of Contents

  

 party shall be obligated to pay any consideration to any third party from
whom such consent or approval is requested and the Company shall not make
any payments to the other party to any such Contract or enter into any
amendment or modification to any Contract in connection with obtaining such
consents, waivers and approvals without Parents prior written consent (it
being acknowledged and agreed that any such payment which is made by the
Company with Parents prior written consent shall not constitute Third Party
Expenses of the Company).

 5.10 _Terminated Agreements_. The Company shall cause each of the agreements
listed on Schedule 5.10 (the "Terminated Agreements") to be terminated,
effective as of and contingent upon the Closing, including sending all

a result of the termination of the Terminated Agreements or otherwise), and
none of the Surviving Corporation any of its subsidiaries will incur any
claim, liability or obligation (absolute, accrued, asserted or
unasserted, contingent or otherwise) under any Terminated Agreement following
the Closing Date. All payments payable or incurred by the Company or its
subsidiaries or anticipated to be incurred or payable after the Closing
arising from the Terminated Agreements shall be reflected on the Statement of
Expenses. In the event the Merger does not close for any reason, Parent shall
not have any liability to the Company or any other Person for any costs,
claims, liabilities or damages resulting from the Company seeking to obtain
such terminations.

 5.11 _Resignation of Officers and Directors_. The Company shall cause each
officer and director of the Company and each of its subsidiaries to execute a
resignation letter in the form attached hereto as Exhibit H (the "Director

effectuation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including any payments made or anticipated
to be made by the Company as a brokerage or finders fee, agents commission
or any similar charge, in connection with the Merger ("Third Party Expenses"),
shall be the obligation of the respective party incurring such fees and
expenses (it being understood that the amount of any fees and expenses paid
or payable by the Company (i) to Parent or its subsidiaries pursuant to
Section 9.3 of the Loan Agreement, (ii) to Cooley Godward Kronish LLP in
connection with the negotiation and effectuation of the terms and conditions
of the Management Retention Agreements (but only to the extent incurred on or
prior to October 4, 2007) and (iii) that are incurred solely as a result of
actions taken after the Effective Time, in each case shall not be Third Party
Expenses). It is also understood that the amount of such Third Party Expenses
set forth in the Statement of Expenses will reduce the amount of Common
Consideration on a dollar-for-dollar basis. The Company shall provide Parent
with a statement of Estimated Third Party Expenses showing reasonable detail
of both the paid and unpaid Third Party Expenses incurred and expected in good
faith to be incurred by the Company (including any Third Party Expenses
anticipated to be incurred after the Closing) not less than two (2) Business

approval of Parent. The Company also shall take such other actions in
furtherance of terminating such other Plan(s) as Parent may reasonably
require. In the event that termination of the Companys 401(k) Plan would
reasonably be anticipated to trigger liquidation charges, surrender charges
or other fees then the Company shall take such actions as are necessary to
reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees and provide such
estimate in writing to Parent no later than ten (10) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date.

(b) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, and pursuant to the

 5.18 _Exchangeable Shares_.

(a) Subject to the rights of recipients of the Tender Offer to accept
the Tender Offer, the Company shall cause the board of directors of
Exchangeco to establish a Redemption Date (as defined in the Exchangeable
Share Provisions) and cause Exchangeco to deliver, at least thirty (30) days
prior to the Closing Date, to each of the holders of Exchangeable Shares a
written notice (the "Exchange Notice") pursuant to clause (c) of the
definition of "Redemption Date" in the Exchangeable Share Provisions, which
shall provide for the redemption by Exchangeco pursuant to Article 7 of the
Exchangeable Share Provisions of all but not less than all of the then
outstanding Exchangeable Shares on the Closing Date but immediately prior to
the Effective Time pursuant to Article 7 of the Exchangeable Share
Provisions. Prior to the proposed redemption of the Exchangeable Shares
contemplated by the immediately foregoing sentence and subject to the rights
of recipients of the Tender Offer to accept the Tender Offer, the Company
shall or shall cause Callco to exercise the Redemption Call Right (as defined
in the Exchangeable Share Provisions) pursuant to Section 7.2 of the
Exchangeable Share Provisions to purchase from all but not less than all of
the holders of Exchangeable Shares (other than any holder of Exchangeable
Shares which is the Company or an Affiliate (as defined in the Exchangeable
Share Provisions) of the Company) on the Closing Date but immediately prior to
the time on the Redemption Date set out in the Exchange Notice of all but not
less than all of the Exchangeable Shares held by such holders on payment by
the Company or Callco of an amount per Exchangeable Share equal to one share
of Company Common Stock (the foregoing, the "Exchange"). The Company agrees
to take or cause Callco to take all actions necessary to be taken by the
Company pursuant to Section 7.2 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions in
connection with the exercise of its Redemption Call Right in order to acquire
all outstanding Exchangeable Shares as contemplated by the immediately
foregoing sentence.

(b) The Company shall or shall cause Callco, at such times and in such manner
as Parent may reasonably request prior to the completion of the Exchange in
accordance with the terms and conditions hereof, to commence an offer to
purchase all unvested Exchangeable Shares that are Unvested Equity
Consideration (as defined in the Combination Agreement) as of the date of
completion of the Tender Offer ("Unvested Exchangeable Shares") and that are
held by residents of Canada that are not "U.S. Persons" ("Eligible Holders of
Exchangeable Shares") as defined in Regulation S promulgated by the SEC or
held on their behalf by the trustee in accordance with the Escrow Agreement,
pursuant to such documentation as Parent may provide (the "Tender Offer").
The terms of the Tender Offer shall permit such Eligible Holders of
Exchangeable Shares to elect to sell their Unvested Exchangeable Shares to the
Company or Callco, as the case may be, immediately prior to the Exchange in
exchange for the delivery to such Eligible Holders of  



 

-44- ##### Table of Contents

  

 Exchangeable Shares of non-transferable rights to receive payment equal to
the Common Consideration Per Share from Parent or its designee (as evidenced
by a promissory note or similar instrument bearing interest at a rate equal
to four percent (4%) per annum) at the same respective times set out in
Section 2.6 of the Combination Agreement and subject to the same conditions,
as the Exchangeable Shares tendered would have vested if not tendered. The
Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, provide all assistance
reasonably requested by Parent and its representatives in connection with the
Tender Offer, including distributing materials in connection with the Tender
Offer to Eligible Holders of Exchangeable Shares, holding explanatory meetings
for the benefit of such holders (outside of the United States) in compliance
with applicable Law and collecting certificates and other documents of
transfer from such holders in connection with the Tender Offer. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Company shall cause its subsidiaries not to exchange
any Exchangeable Shares acquired in the Tender Offer for Company Common Stock
in the Exchange. Any documents delivered to holders of Unvested Exchangeable
Shares in connection with the Tender Offer (including the promissory note or
similar instrument associated therewith) shall be subject to the prior review
of the Company, and Parent shall consider in good faith and include any
reasonable comments of the Company in such documents.

(c) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall
cause the Combination Agreement and that certain Escrow Agreement dated as of
November 22, 2005 (the "Escrow Agreement") by and among the Company, U.S. Bank
National Association and the two "Representatives" named therein shall be
amended pursuant to the amendment agreement attached as Exhibit I (the "Escrow
and Combination Agreement Amendment") so as to, among other things, permit
the Tender Offer to be effected. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
Exchangeco shall be recapitalized so that any Exchangeable Shares held by the
Company or Callco as a result of the Exchange or the Tender Offer are
converted into ordinary shares of Exchangeco in a manner determined by Parent
and reasonably acceptable to the Company.

 5.19 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) _Indemnification and Advancement_. From and after the Effective Time,
each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to honor the indemnification and advancement of expenses
obligations of the Company with respect to each person who served as
a director or officer of the Company or its subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time (collectively, the "DandO Indemnified Parties") to the extent
that such indemnification and/or advancement of expenses obligations arose out
of Contracts that were in effect as of the date of this Agreement, true,
correct and complete copies of which have been provided to Parent as of the
date of this Agreement or such indemnification and/or advancement of expense
obligations arose out Organizational Documents in effect as of the date of
this Agreement, true, correct and complete copies of which have been provided
to Parent as of the date of this Agreement, and in each case, subject to
applicable Law.

(b) _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. In furtherance and not in
limitation of this Section 5.19, from and after the Effective Time, each of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to include and cause to be maintained in the Surviving
Corporations Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws for a period of at least
six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, provisions regarding
elimination of liability of directors, officers and employees and
indemnification which are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries
than the corresponding provisions contained in the Companys Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws, in each case, as in effect on the date of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in the immediately preceding sentence to
the contrary, nothing herein shall restrict Parents ability to dissolve the
Surviving Corporation or otherwise cause it to be merged with or into another
entity for valid business reasons provided that should any such action reduce
the indemnity to which any DandO Indemnified Party is entitled to hereunder,
Parent shall provide such additional indemnification to the DandO Indemnified
Parties as is necessary for them to be indemnified hereunder to the same

the Stockholder Representative agrees to make such  



 

-46- ##### Table of Contents

not complied therewith as Parent may reasonably request. In addition,
following the Effective Time, the Stockholder Representative agrees to use
all reasonable efforts to enforce its contractual rights to cause other former

violation or breach of, or a default under, any Contract to which the Company

 5.23 _Section 116 of the Income Tax Act (Canada) Withholding_.

(a) Each holder of Exchangeable Shares that is a non-resident person within
the meaning of Section 116 of the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada) (a "Non-Resident
Exchangeable Shareholder") shall deliver to Callco or the Company a
certificate issued by the Minister of National Revenue (Canada) specifying a
certificate limit in an amount that is not less than the amount of the
applicable consideration paid for the Exchangeable Shares held by such Non-
Resident Exchangeable Shareholder (the "Non-Resident Exchangeable Shareholder
Purchase Price").

(b) In the event that a Non-Resident Exchangeable Shareholder does not comply
with the requirements in paragraph (a) above, Callco or the Company shall, on
the Closing Date, withhold twenty five percent (25%) of the Non-Resident
Exchangeable Shareholder Purchase Price and shall convert such amount into

rate at which Callco or the Company is able to convert the withheld
amount into Canadian currency is referred to herein as the "FOREX Rate". The
Non-Resident Exchangeable Shareholder Purchase Price converted into Canadian
currency at the FOREX Rate is referred to herein as the "Canadian Dollar
Purchase Price" and (i) if, prior to the 26th day of the month following the
month in which the Closing Date occurs, the Non-Resident Exchangeable
Shareholder delivers to Callco or the Company a certificate of compliance
issued by the Minister of National Revenue under subsection 116(4) of the
_Income Tax Act_ (Canada), then Callco or the Company shall pay forthwith to
the Non-Resident Exchangeable Shareholder the 116 Withheld Amount and the US
dollar equivalent of the amount paid (converted at the inverse of the FOREX
Rate) shall be credited to Callco or the Company as payment on account of the
Non-Resident Exchangeable Shareholder Purchase Price, (ii) if, prior to the
26th day of the month following the month in which the Closing Date occurs,
the Non-Resident Exchangeable Shareholder has delivered to Callco or the
Company a 116(2) Certificate, then Callco or the Company shall (A) remit, (on
behalf of the Non-Resident Exchangeable Shareholder) to the Receiver General
of Canada, twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount, if any, by which the
Canadian Dollar Purchase Price exceeds the  



 

-47- ##### Table of Contents

  

 amount of the certificate limit set out in the 116(2) Certificate and the US
dollar equivalent of the amount remitted (converted at the inverse of
the FOREX Rate) shall be credited to Callco or the Company as payment on
account of the applicable Non-Resident Exchangeable Shareholder Purchase Price
and (B) pay to such Non-Resident Exchangeable Shareholder the balance, if any,
of the 116 Withheld Amount and the US dollar equivalent of the balance paid
(converted at the inverse of the FOREX Rate) shall be credited to Callco or
the Company as payment on account of the applicable Non-Resident Exchangeable
Shareholder Purchase Price or (iii) if neither a 116(4) Certificate nor a
116(2) Certificate has been delivered to Callco or the Company by the Non-
Resident Seller in accordance with Clause (i) or (ii) of this Section 5.23
prior to the 26th day of the month following the month in which the Closing
Date occurs, (or such later time if the Canada Revenue Agency confirms in
writing that it will not enforce the remittance of funds as required by
subsection 116(5) of the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada)), then Callco or the
Company shall remit the 116 Withheld Amount (or such lesser amount as would be
required by the Canada Revenue Agency to issue the 116(4) Certificate) in
respect of such Non-Resident Exchangeable Shareholder to the Receiver General
of Canada forthwith and such amount shall be credited to the Non-Resident
Exchangeable Shareholder as payment on account of the Non-Resident
Exchangeable Shareholder Purchase Price, at the inverse of the FOREX Rate.

 7.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties identified in Schedule 7.1, which
representations and warranties will survive indefinitely
(such representations and warranties set forth in Schedule 7.1, the
"Surviving Representations"), the representations and warranties contained in
Article II and Article III of this Agreement, the Related Agreements or in
any certificate or other instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall
terminate at the Closing such that no party hereto shall have any further
liability or obligation with respect to such representations or warranties,
except as provided in the last sentence of this Section 7.1. All covenants and
other agreements of the parties set forth in this Agreement (other than those
in Section 9.6) to the extent required to be performed prior to the Closing
shall expire at the Closing (such that no party hereto shall have any further
liability or obligation with respect to such covenants and agreements, except
as provided in the last sentence of Section 7.1) and all covenants and
agreements of the Parties set forth in this Agreement to the extent required
to be performed after the Closing shall survive pursuant to the terms set
forth herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no termination or expiration of
any representation, warranty or covenant shall limit in any way the specific
rights of indemnification set forth in Section 7.2 below (and the other
provisions of this Article VII as they relate to such Section 7.2) or limit
in any way any rights or remedies with regard to fraud.

 7.2 _Indemnification_. Subject to the terms of this Article VII, following
the Effective Time, each of the Stockholder Parties, severally (based on the
respective Pro Rata Share of such Stockholder Party) and not jointly, will
indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its officers, directors, Affiliates,
employees, agents and representatives, including the Surviving Corporation
(the "Indemnified Parties"), against all claims, losses, liabilities,
damages, costs, awards, judgments, penalties and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys and consultants fees and expenses and including any
such reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection
with investigating, defending against or settling any of the foregoing
(hereinafter individually a "Loss" and collectively "Losses") incurred,
sustained or accrued by the Indemnified Parties, or any of them
(including the Surviving Corporation) as a result of the following (the
"Indemnifiable Matters"):

(a) any breach of a Surviving Representation of the Company or a Stockholder
Party;



 

-51- ##### Table of Contents

  

(b) any willful failure by the Company or any Stockholder Party to perform or
comply in any material respect with any covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement and required to be performed as of or prior to the Closing;

(c) the amount, if any, by which Third Party Expenses of the Company or its
subsidiaries exceeds the amounts set forth in the Statement of Expenses
("Excess Third Party Expenses");

(d) the amount, if any, by which any Dissenting Share Payments exceed the
amount that the holder of such Dissenting Shares would have otherwise
received pursuant to Section 1.6 had such holder complied with the exchange
procedures set forth in Section 1.8; or

(e) any of the matters disclosed on Schedule 7.2(e).

The Indemnifying Parties shall not have any right of
contribution, indemnification or right of advancement from the Surviving
Corporation (including any of its subsidiaries) or Parent with respect to any
Loss claimed by an Indemnified Party, including as a result of the application
of the provisions of Section 5.19. As used in this Article VII, the term "Pro
Rata Share" means, with respect to any Stockholder Party, the quotient
obtained by dividing (i) the amount of the Total Consideration receivable by
such Stockholder Party upon consummation of the Merger (other than any such
Total Consideration payable with respect to Series C Preferred Stock) plus the
amount of consideration receivable by such Stockholder Party pursuant to the
Tender Offer by (ii) the amount of the Total Consideration receivable by all
Stockholder Parties (other than any such Total Consideration payable with
respect to Series C Preferred Stock) plus the total amount of consideration
receivable by all Stockholder Parties pursuant to the Tender Offer.

 7.3 _Claims for Indemnification; Resolution of Conflicts_.

(a) _Making a Claim for Indemnification; Officer s Certificate_. An
Indemnified Party may seek recovery of Losses pursuant to this Article VII by
delivering to the Stockholder Representative an Officers Certificate in
respect of such claim. The date of such delivery of an Officers Certificate
is referred to herein as the "Claim Date" of such Officers Certificate (and
the claims for indemnification contained therein). For purposes hereof,
"Officers Certificate" shall mean a certificate signed by any officer of
Parent: (A) stating that an Indemnified Party has paid, sustained, incurred,
or accrued, or reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay, sustain, incur
or accrue Losses and (B) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items
of Losses included in the amount so stated, the date each such item was paid,
sustained, incurred, or accrued, or the basis for such anticipated liability,
and the nature of the Indemnifiable Matter to which such item is related.

(b) _Objecting to a Claim for Indemnification_.

(i) The Stockholder Representative may object to a claim for indemnification
set forth in an Officers Certificate by delivering to the Indemnified Party
seeking indemnification a written statement of objection to the claim made in
the Officers Certificate (an "Objection Notice"), _provided_ that, to be
effective, such Objection Notice must (i) be delivered to the Indemnified
Party prior to midnight (California time) on the 30th day following the Claim
Date of the Officers Certificate (such deadline, the "Objection Deadline" for
such Officers Certificate and the claims for indemnification contained
therein) and (ii) set forth in reasonable detail the nature of the objections
to the claims in respect of which the objection is made.

(ii) If the Stockholder Representative does not object in writing (as provided
in Section 7.3(b)(i)) to the claims contained in an Officers Certificate
prior to the Objection Deadline for such  



 

-52- ##### Table of Contents

  

 Officers Certificate, such failure to so object shall be an irrevocable
acknowledgment by the Stockholder Representative and the Company
Stockholders that the Indemnified Party is entitled to the full amount of the
claims for Losses set forth in such Officers Certificate (and such
entitlement shall be conclusively and irrefutably established) (any such
claim, an "Unobjected Claim").

(c) _Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration_.

(i) In case the Stockholder Representative timely delivers an Objection Notice
in accordance with Section 7.3(b)(i), the Stockholder Representative and
Parent shall attempt in good faith for 30 days after delivery of such
Objection Notice (the "Negotiation Period") to agree upon the rights of the
respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Stockholder
Representative (or the objecting Indemnifying Parties) and Parent reach an
agreement, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and
signed by both parties (any claims covered by such an agreement,
"Settled Claims").

(ii) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation during
the Negotiation Period, either Parent or the Stockholder Representative may
demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the Loss that is at
issue is the subject of a pending litigation with a third party, in which
event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or
both parties agree to arbitration, and in either such event the matter shall
be finally settled by binding arbitration in the County of San Mateo,
California in accordance with the then current Commercial Arbitration Rules of
the American Arbitration Association and judgment upon the award rendered may
be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator(s) shall
have the authority to grant any equitable and legal remedies that would be
available in any judicial proceeding instituted to resolve a dispute.

(iii) Arbitration under Section 7.3(c)(ii) shall apply to any dispute among
the Indemnifying Parties and the Indemnified Parties under this Article VII.

(iv) The decision of the arbitrator or a majority of the three arbitrators,
as the case may be, as to the validity and amount of any claim in such
Officers Certificate shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon the parties
to this Agreement and the Indemnifying Parties. Such decision shall be
written and shall be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions
which shall set forth the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the
arbitrator(s). Claims determined by arbitration as provided in this Section
7.3(c) are referred to as "Resolved Claims." Within 30 days of a decision of
the arbitrator(s) requiring payment by one party to another, such party shall
make the payment to such other party.

(d) _Payable and Unresolved Claims_. A "Payable Claim" shall mean a claim for
indemnification of Losses, to the extent that such claim has not been
satisfied by cash payment which is (i) a Resolved Claim, (ii) a Settled Claim,
or (iii) an Unobjected Claim. An "Unresolved Claim" shall mean any claim
specified in any Officers Certificate, to the extent that such claim is not
a Payable Claim and has not been satisfied by cash payment.

 7.4 _Third-Party Claims_. With respect to a claim made by any third party
against an Indemnified Party for a matter which, if adversely determined,
would be indemnifiable under Section 7.2 (a "Third-Party Claim"), an
Indemnified Party shall notify the Stockholder Representative in writing of
the Third-Party Claim promptly following receipt by such Indemnified Party of
written notice of the Third-Party Claim;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification
provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Parties shall have
been actually materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. Upon receipt
of such a written notice of a Third-Party Claim, subject to the other
provisions of this paragraph, the Stockholder Representative shall assume the
defense and control of such Third-Party Claim and shall deliver to the
Indemnified Party written notice of such assumption by the  



 

-53- ##### Table of Contents

  

 Stockholder Representative within five (5) Business Days of its receipt of
notice of such Third-Party Claim from the Indemnified Party; provided
that the Indemnified Parties shall be allowed a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the defense of such Third-Party Claim with their own counsel,
at their own expense. None of the Stockholder Representative nor the
Stockholder Parties shall seek or have any right to receive reimbursement for
any expenses or losses incurred in investigating, settling or defending any
Third-Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for any Third-Party Claim
which may be subject to indemnification under Section 7.2(b), Parent may, at
its election, control, and if Parent so elects (which election must be made by
written notice to the Stockholder Representative within five (5) Business Days
of Parents delivery to the Stockholder Representative of notice of such
Third-Party Claim), the Stockholder Representative shall not be entitled to
control the defense of, such Third-Party Claim. The Stockholder Representative
and Parent (as the case may be) shall act diligently and in good faith and
take all steps reasonably necessary in the defense or settlement of any Third-
Party Claim being controlled by or required to be controlled by the
Stockholder Representative or Parent (as the case may be); in the event that
the Stockholder Representative or Parent (as applicable) shall not so act, the
other party may assume and control the defense or settlement of such Third-
Party Claim, and the Indemnifying Parties shall indemnify the Indemnified
Parties for any Losses incurred, sustained or accrued by them in connection
therewith, including Losses arising from the defense, investigation and/or
judgment and reasonable amounts paid in settlement thereof. Parent shall use
reasonable efforts to, and shall use reasonable efforts to cause each of its
respective controlled Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate in the defense of
any Third-Party Claim being controlled by the Stockholder Representative in
accordance with the terms hereof. The Indemnifying Party may not consent to a
settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third-Party
Claim, without the prior written consent of Parent, _provided_ that such
consent will not be required if the Indemnifying Party is controlling the
defense of such Third-Party Claim in accordance with the terms hereof and
shall (i) pay or cause to be paid all amounts arising out of such settlement
or judgment concurrently with the effectiveness of such settlement, (ii) not
encumber any of the assets of any Indemnified Party or agree to any
restriction or condition that would apply to or adversely affect any
Indemnified Party or the conduct of any Indemnified Partys business and (iii)
obtain, as a condition of any settlement or other resolution, a complete
release of the Indemnified Party affected by such Third-Party Claim. If the
Stockholder Representative is diligently and in good faith defending a Third-
Party Claim it is entitled to defend hereunder, no Indemnified Party may
consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, such
Third-Party Claim, without the prior written consent of the Stockholder
Representative (which consent, if unreasonably withheld or delayed, shall not
be required). In the case of a Third-Party Claim the defense of which is
controlled by Parent, Parent may settle or consent to the entry of a judgment
against it or any Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of
the Stockholder Representative, provided that in such case, Parent shall use
all reasonable efforts to deliver prior written notice to the Stockholder
Representative of any such settlement effected by Parent and the Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to indemnification for amounts paid in settlement
and judgment and Losses related thereto only to the extent such amounts are
reasonable under the circumstances relating to the Third Party Claim.

 7.5 _Stockholder Representative_.

(a) Elevation Management, LLC is hereby constituted and appointed as the
agent and attorney-in-fact of the Company Stockholders as the Stockholder
Representative for and on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties to give and
receive notices and communications, to authorize payment to Parent in
satisfaction of claims by Parent, to object to such payments, to agree to,
negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration
and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to
such claims, and to take all other actions that are either (i) necessary or
appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholder Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii) specifically mandated by the terms of
this Agreement. Such agency may be changed by the Indemnifying Parties from
time to time upon not less than ten (10) days prior written notice to Parent;
_provided, however_ , that the Stockholder

 Representative may not be removed unless a majority interest of the
Indemnifying Parties agree in writing to such removal and to the identity of
the substituted agent. A vacancy in the position of Stockholder
Representative may be filled by the holders of a majority in interest of the
Indemnifying Parties. No bond shall be required of the Stockholder

Stockholder Representative and hold it harmless against any loss, liability or
expense incurred without fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad
faith on the part of the Stockholder Representative and arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the duties hereunder,
including any out-of-pocket costs and expenses and legal fees and other legal
costs reasonably incurred by the Stockholder Representative (including in
connection with the defense of any Third-Party Claim pursuant to Section 7.4).

in a matter entrusted to the Stockholder Representative by this
Agreement shall constitute a decision of the Indemnifying Parties and shall
be final, binding and conclusive upon the Indemnifying Parties; and Parent may
rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder
Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Indemnifying Parties. Parent is hereby relieved from any liability to any
Person for any acts done by it in accordance with such decision, act, consent
or instruction of the Stockholder Representative. 

(d) This Section 7.5 is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, any subsequent Stockholder Representative against
Indemnifying Parties. Under no circumstance shall Parent or any Indemnified
Party be liable to the Stockholder Representative under this Section 7.5.

 7.6 _Limitation of Indemnification_. Notwithstanding any other provision in
this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall (i) any Indemnifying Party
have any liability in excess of the aggregate Total Consideration actually
received by such Indemnifying Party (other than any such Total Consideration
payable with respect to Series C Preferred Stock) in connection with the
consummation of the Merger, and (ii) Parents liability for breach of a
Surviving Representation made by Parent exceed the Total Consideration less
the amount of the Total Consideration payable with respect to Series C
Preferred Stock.

 7.7 _Tax Treatment_. Any payment under Article VII of this Agreement shall
be treated by the parties for federal, state, local and foreign income Tax
purposes as a purchase price adjustment unless otherwise required by
applicable law.

 7.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Effective Time, except in the
case of fraud, the indemnification provisions in this Article VII shall be the
Indemnified Parties sole and exclusive remedy, whether at law or in equity
or otherwise and Parent and the Stockholder Parties each hereby waives any and
all other remedies otherwise available, in each case, for all Losses arising
out of the Merger, the representations and warranties of the Company and the
Stockholder Parties contained herein and the covenants and agreements of the
Company and the Stockholder Parties (other those contained in Section 9.6)
contained herein to be performed prior to the Effective Time. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement will release any Person from
liability or otherwise limit any remedy for fraud.

 9.4 _Entire Agreement; Parties in Interest_. This Agreement and the
documents and instruments and other agreements specifically referred to herein
or delivered pursuant hereto, including all the exhibits attached hereto, the
Schedules, including the Disclosure Letter, (a) constitute the entire
agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof

 9.6 _Releases_.

(a) As of the date of this Agreement (or such later date as a Stockholder
Party becomes a party to this Agreement), each Stockholder Party, for itself
and on behalf of its heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns
(collectively, the "Relevant Persons"), does hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably waive, release and forever discharge the Company and each current
(as of the Effective Time) and former director, officer, employee, agent or
controlling stockholder of the Company and each of its subsidiaries from any
and all claims, contentions, demands, debts, liabilities, agreements, costs,
expenses, attorneys fees, damages, losses, suits, liens, actions or causes of
action, whether known or unknown, whether matured or unmatured (collectively,
"Stockholder Claims"), that such Relevant Person may have against the Company
or a director, officer, employee, agent or controlling stockholder of the
Company except, without limiting the penultimate sentence of Section 7.2, (a)
for any breach of this Agreement or Related Agreement or any rights hereunder
or thereunder, (b) with respect to the Contracts (or portions thereof) or
other documents identified on Schedule 9.6(a) and (c) in the case of a
Relevant Person who is an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
for Stockholder Claims under any Plan or related to such Relevant Persons
employment with the Company or any of its subsidiaries for unpaid salary,
bonus, expense reimbursement, for paid time off or other benefits in
connection therewith. With respect to such Stockholder Claims, each
Stockholder Party hereby expressly waives any and all rights conferred upon
him, her or it by any statute or rule of law which provides that a release
does not extend to claims which the claimant does not know or suspect to
exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known
by him or her must have materially affected his, her or its settlement with
the released party, including, without limitation, the following provisions
of California Civil Code Section 1542: "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO
CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER
FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST
HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."

release substantially identical to the release set forth in Section 9.6(a)

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, the release contained in Section 9.6(a) shall
be of no force or effect if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
8.1.

 9.7 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and shall be interpreted so
as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties hereto
shall use all reasonable efforts to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that shall achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

 9.8 _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereto shall be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by
law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party hereto of any one
remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other remedy and nothing in this
Agreement shall be deemed a waiver by any party of any right to specific
performance or injunctive relief.

 9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws
thereof. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the exclusive
jurisdiction and venue of any federal or state court within the State of
Delaware in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of this
Agreement or the matters contemplated herein (other than as provided in
Article VII), agrees that process may be served upon them in any manner
authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware for such persons and waives
and covenants not to assert or plead any objection that they otherwise might
have to such jurisdiction, venue and process. Each party hereto hereby agrees
not to commence any legal proceedings relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any jurisdiction or
courts other than as provided herein.

 9.10 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto have been represented by
counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, hereby waive, with respect to this Agreement, each Schedule
and each Exhibit attached hereto, the application of any law, regulation,

other document shall be construed against the party drafting such agreement
or document.

Personal Information to the Recipient it must only be used for due diligence
to evaluate whether or not to proceed with the transactions contemplated
hereby, or if the determination is to proceed, for the parties to carry out
and complete the transactions contemplated hereby. At all times the Personal
