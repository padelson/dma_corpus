WHEREAS, pursuant to this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub 1 will
be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company being

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 and the Company wish to make
certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection
with the Combination and to prescribe certain conditions to the consummation

 **ARTICLE II**

 



 

 ** _CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_**

 



 

Section 2.1 _Effect on Stock and Interests_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Merger Sub 1 or the Company or the holders of any
securities of Parent, Merger Sub 1 or the Company:

 



 

(i) _Conversion of the Company Common Stock_. Subject to _Section 2.2(f)_,
each issued and outstanding share (other than shares to be canceled or
converted in accordance with _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_) of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") shall
thereupon be converted into the right to receive 0.818 fully paid and non-
assessable shares (as the same may be adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_,
the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of Parent Common Stock (the " _Merger Consideration_
"). All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of Book-Entry Shares or a Certificate that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common
Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor and any
dividends or other distributions to which such holder becomes entitled upon
surrender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, without interest.

 



 

(ii) _Merger Sub 1 Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub 1 (the " _Merger Sub 1 Common
Stock_ ") shall be converted into one validly issued fully paid and non-
assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation Common Stock_ ") and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing
shares of Merger Sub 1 Common Stock, if any, shall be deemed for all purposes
to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation
into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence.

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) _Company, Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2-Owned Shares_. Each
share of Company Common Stock that is issued and held by the Company or any of
the Companys direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries, and each share of
Company Common Stock that is owned by Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 or
any of their respective direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries, in each
case immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall automatically be canceled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be issued or
delivered in exchange therefor.

 



 

(b) _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of Parent or the Company shall occur as a result of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, the
Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to provide to the holders of
Company Common Stock (or such rights that are convertible into shares of
Company Common Stock) and Parent the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such action; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
contained in this _Section 2.1(b)_ shall be deemed to permit any action that
Parent or the Company is otherwise prohibited from taking pursuant to this
Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Effect on Interests_. At the Subsequent Effective Time, each share of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Subsequent Effective Time shall be converted into one limited liability
company interest of the Surviving Company and each limited liability company
interest of Merger Sub 2 issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Subsequent Effective Time shall be converted into one limited liability
company interest of the Surviving Company.

 



 

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate
Computershare Investor Service L.L.C. to act as exchange agent hereunder (the
" _Exchange Agent_ "), for the purpose of exchanging certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common
Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") and shares of Company Common Stock represented
by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ").

 



 

(b) _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. From time to time as needed, at or
after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause the Surviving
Company to deposit, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the equity
holders of the Company entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant
to this Agreement, (i) certificates or, at Parents option, evidence of shares
in book-entry form, representing shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Parent
Certificates_ ") in such denominations as the Exchange Agent may reasonably
specify sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration, (ii) cash sufficient to
make payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.2(f)(ii)_,
and (iii) unless the Company has already paid such amount to its transfer
agent for distribution to stockholders, an amount in cash equal to any Final
Pre-Closing Quarterly Dividend for which Parent is responsible under _Section
5.16_. Such Parent Certificates and such cash so deposited, together with any
dividends or distributions pursuant to _Section 2.2(d)_ with respect thereto,
are hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ".

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Exchange Procedures_.

 



 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than the third (3rd) Business Day following the Effective
Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate
or Book-Entry Shares whose shares were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(i)_, (x) a letter of
transmittal in customary form (and which shall specify, in the case of
tendered Certificates, that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Exchange Agent), and (y) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Each former stockholder of the Company, upon surrender to the
Exchange Agent of a Certificate or a Book-Entry Share, as applicable, together
with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
customarily be required by the Exchange Agent, shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor, the following:

 



 

(A) the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, into which such
holders shares of Company Common Stock, represented by such holders properly
surrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, were converted
in accordance with _Section 2.1_, and such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
so surrendered shall be forthwith canceled, and

 



 

(B) a check in an amount of U.S. dollars (after giving effect to any required
withholdings pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)(iii)_) equal to the amount of (x)
the cash that such holder has the right to receive in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.2(f)(ii)_, _plus_ (y)
the dividends such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section
5.16_.

 



 

(ii) In the event of a transfer of ownership of the Company Common Stock that
is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a Parent Certificate
representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued
to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares so surrendered are registered if such Certificate (if applicable) shall
be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and shall be
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and the person requesting such issuance
shall pay any transfer or other non-income Taxes required by reason of the
issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock to a person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares or establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of Parent that any such Taxes have been paid or are
not applicable.

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent,
Merger Sub 1, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company

 



      
 

 



 

and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement such amounts as are
required to be withheld or deducted under any provision of any Tax Law with
respect to the making of such payments. As of the date hereof, Parent, Merger
Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 are not aware of any such withholding obligation. Upon
becoming aware of any such withholding obligation, Parent, Merger Sub 1,
Merger Sub 2 or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall provide
commercially reasonable notice to the Person with respect to which such
withholding obligation applies, and shall reasonably cooperate with such
Person to obtain any available reduction of or relief from such deduction or
withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted, such
withheld or deducted amounts shall be remitted by Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger
Sub 2, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent to the appropriate
Governmental Entity and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding were made.

 



 

(iv) Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_, each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by _Section 2.1(a)_(i), cash,
if any, in lieu of any fractional share in accordance with _Section
2.2(f)(ii)_ and the dividends the holder has the right to receive pursuant to
_Section 5.16_.

 



 

(v) No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares under the provisions of this _Article II_.

 



 

(d) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_.

 



 

(i) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time, or that are payable to the
holders of record thereof who become such at or after the Effective Time,
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares until such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares are surrendered as provided
in this _Article II_. All such dividends and other distributions with respect
to Parent Common Stock that are to be paid in respect of the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be received upon surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares shall be paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in
the Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this _Article II_.

 



 

(ii) Subject to the effect of applicable escheat or similar Laws and Laws with
respect to the withholding of Taxes, following surrender of any such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, there shall be paid to the holder of the
Parent Certificate representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time previously paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of
Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section
2.2(f)(ii)_, and the dividends such holder has the right to receive

 



      
 

 



 

pursuant to _Section 5.16_ and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent
to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock. Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent sufficient cash for
the purpose of satisfying its obligations under this _Section 2.2(d)_. No
cash in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares until such Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares are surrendered as provided in this _Article II_.

 



 

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The shares of
Parent Common Stock issued and cash paid in accordance with the terms of this
_Article II_ upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, for the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this
_Article II_ (including distributions and dividends paid pursuant to _Section
2.2(d)_ and _Section 5.16_ and any cash paid in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to _Section 2.2(f)(ii)_) shall be deemed payment in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 



 

(f) _No Fractional Shares_.

 



 

(i) No Parent Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares, no dividend or distribution of Parent shall relate to
such fractional share interests, and such fractional share interests will not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of Parent.

 



 

(ii) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall pay
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Company to pay to
the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of each holder of Company Common Stock, an
amount in cash, if any, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the
fractional share interest to which such holder (after taking into account all
shares of Company Common Stock held at the Effective Time by such holder)
would otherwise be entitled by (B) the closing price for a share of Parent
Common Stock on the NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. (the " _NASDAQ_ ") (as reported
in _The Wall Street Journal_ , or, if not reported thereby, any other
authoritative source) on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing
Date (the " _Parent Closing Price_ "). To the extent that the Exchange Agent
shall sell shares of Parent Common Stock included in the Exchange Fund in
order to satisfy Parents obligation to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares,
Parent shall pay all commissions, transfer Taxes and other out-of-pocket
transaction costs in connection with such sale, if any.

 



 

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon
demand, and any holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not
theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, and any
distributions and dividends paid pursuant to _Section 2.2(d)_ and _Section
5.16_ and any cash paid in

 



      
 

 



 

lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.2(f)(ii)_).

 



 

(h) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the transfer books of Parent of shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented
to Parent or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this _Section 2.2_.

 



 

(i) _No Liability_. None of the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation,
the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in
respect of any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions
with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund, in each case, delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been
surrendered prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration, any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or any dividends or
distributions payable to the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
pursuant to _Section 5.16_ would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration or cash, dividends
or distributions in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall,
immediately prior to such time, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Company, free and clear of any claims or
interests of any person previously entitled thereto, and any holders of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this
_Article II_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Company for payment
of their claim for Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock, any dividends pursuant to _Section 5.16_, and any
dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock (in each case,
without interest and subject to abandoned property, escheat, and other similar
laws).

 



 

(j) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest all cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America or obligations of an agency of the
United States of America which are backed by the full faith and credit of the
United States of America. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Parent. No investment or losses thereon shall
affect the consideration to which holders of Company Common Stock are entitled
under this _Article II_ and to the extent that there are any losses with
respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund, or the Exchange Fund
diminishes for any reason below the amount required to promptly pay in full
the cash amounts contemplated by this _Article II_, Parent shall promptly
replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the
Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make in full
such payments contemplated by this _Article II_.

 



 

(k) _Lost Certificates_. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the provision by such person of an
indemnity, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger

 



       
 

 



 

Consideration and, if applicable, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and
unpaid dividends and distributions deliverable in accordance with this
_Article II_ in respect thereof.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Treatment of Equity-Based Grants_.

 



 

(a) _Company Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding and
unexercised option to purchase or acquire a share of Company Common Stock
(each, a " _Company Stock Option_ "), whether such Company Stock Option is
then vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and converted into, and shall
become a right to receive the Company Stock Option Consideration, if any. For
purposes of this Agreement, the " _Company Stock Option Consideration_ " means
a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to (x) the product of the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Option
and the Exchange Ratio, less (y) that number of shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to the Company Stock Option with a fair market value (based on the
Company Closing Price) that is equal to the sum of (1) the aggregate exercise
price of the Company Stock Option (the " _Option Exercise Price_ ") plus (2)
the amount of any withholding under the Code or any provision of federal,
state, local or foreign Tax Laws and (B) the Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , that
any resulting fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be treated in the
same manner as any resulting fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable
as Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_. For purposes of
this Agreement, the " _Company Closing Price_ " means the closing price for a
share of Company Common Stock on the NASDAQ (as reported in _The Wall Street
Journal_ , or, if not reported thereby, any other authoritative source) on the
Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date. Parent shall issue (or
cause to be issued) the Company Stock Option Consideration as determined in
accordance with this _Section 2.3(a)_ to such holder as soon as practicable
(and no later than thirty (30) days) following the Effective Time. The right
of a holder of any Company Stock Option to receive the Company Stock Option
Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of any withholding
under the Code or any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax Laws
as described above.

 



 

(b) _Company Restricted Stock Units_. As of the Effective Time, each
outstanding right to receive Company Common Stock pursuant to a stock unit
award granted under any Company Equity Plan (each, a " _Company Restricted
Stock Unit_ ") shall be assumed by Parent and converted into a restricted
stock unit with respect to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock
determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company Restricted Stock Unit by the Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , that
any resulting fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be treated in the
same manner as any resulting fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable
as Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_. The other pre-
existing terms of such Company Restricted Stock Units, including vesting,
shall continue to apply in accordance with their terms. Each Company
Restricted Stock Unit assumed and converted pursuant to the terms of this
_Section 2.3(b)_ shall be referred to as a " _Parent Exchange Unit_."

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take all actions necessary to effect the provisions of this
_Section 2.3_ (other than actions expressly required of Parent), including
obtaining any required consents. Parent shall take all corporate action
necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of

 



      
 

 



 

Parent Common Stock for delivery in connection with the settlement of the
Company Stock Option Consideration and the issuance of the Parent Exchange
Units, including registering such shares on an appropriate form of
registration statement under the Securities Act, and maintaining the
effectiveness of such registration statement.

operations of such person and all of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or
(B) the ability of such person to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in the manner contemplated hereby prior to the Outside Date;

generally affecting the industries in which such person and its Subsidiaries
operate, including changes in the use, adoption or non-adoption of

Circumstances giving rise to or contributing to such change in stock price or
trading volume or such failure may (to the extent not otherwise falling within
any of the exceptions set forth in clauses (i) through (ix) of this
definition) be deemed to constitute, and may be taken into account in
determining whether there has been, or would reasonably be expected to be, a
Material Adverse Effect), (v) the negotiation, announcement or execution of
this Agreement or the pendency of the consummation of the Combination (other
than for purposes of _Section 3.3(b)_, _Section 3.3(c)_, _Section 4.3(b)_
and _Section 4.3(c)_, as applicable), including the impact thereof on

change in credit ratings may be deemed to constitute, and may (to the extent
not otherwise falling within any of the exceptions set forth in clauses (i)
through (ix) of this definition) be taken into account in determining whether
there has been, or would reasonably be expected to be, a Material Adverse
Effect), in the case of clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (vi) or (vii) above, such

disproportionate adverse impact on the financial condition, properties,
business or results of operations of such person and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, relative to other persons operating in the industries in which
such person and its Subsidiaries operate (in which case the incremental
disproportionate impact or impacts may be taken into account in determining
whether there has been, or would reasonably be expected to be, a Material
Adverse Effect).

therein required to be filed or

during such periods by the Company on a voluntary basis on a Current Report on
Form 8-K, but excluding the Joint Proxy Statement, collectively, the "
_Company SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective dates, or, if amended, as

the Company with the SEC after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time
(the " _Subsequent Company SEC Documents_ ") will comply in all material
respects, with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (" _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the case may be, subject
to the last sentence of _Section 3.12_ with respect to the Joint Proxy
Statement, and none of the Company SEC Documents contained, and the Subsequent
Company SEC Documents will not contain, any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted, or will omit, to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, or are to be made, not misleading.
There are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters received
from the SEC with respect to the Company SEC Documents and, to the knowledge
of the Company, none of the Company SEC Documents is the subject of ongoing
SEC review. None of the Subsidiaries of the Company is, or has at any time
since December 31, 2013 been, required to file or is required to file reports
with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act.

 



 

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including all related notes
and schedules) of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents (i) fairly
presents in all material respects, and the consolidated financial statements
(including all related notes and schedules) of the Company included in the
Subsequent Company SEC Documents will fairly present in all material respects,
the consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for the respective
periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to
normal year-end audit adjustments) and (ii) complied at the time it was filed,
and each of the consolidated financial statements (including all related notes
and schedules) of the Company included in the Subsequent Company SEC Documents
will comply at the time it is filed, as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, prepared in conformity with United States
generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") (except, in the case of
the unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
therein or in the notes thereto). Since December 31, 2013 to the date of this
Agreement, the Company has not made any material change in the accounting
practices or policies applied in the preparation of its financial statements,
except as required by GAAP, SEC rule or policy or applicable Law and as
disclosed in the Company SEC Documents.

 



 

Section 3.5 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. The Company is in compliance
in all material respects with all of the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
and the provisions of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act relating
thereto, which are applicable to the Company. Each of the principal executive
officers and the principal financial officers of the Company (or, as
applicable, each former principal executive officer and each former principal
financial officer of the Company), has made all applicable certifications
required by Rule 13a-14

 



      
 

 



 

or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act or Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder with
respect to the Company SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such
certifications are true and accurate. For purposes of the preceding sentence,
"principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the
meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding, or has arranged any outstanding,
"extensions of credit" to directors or executive officers within the meaning
of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Company has established and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and procedures are
reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or furnishes under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to applicable management
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company and its Subsidiaries maintain a system of internal accounting controls
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (a) transactions are executed
in accordance with managements general or specific authorizations; (b)
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability; (c)
access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements general or
specific authorization; and (d) the recorded accounting for assets is compared
with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is
taken with respect to any material differences. The Company has delivered to
Parent complete and accurate copies of notices received from its independent
auditor of any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the
Companys internal control over financial reporting since December 31, 2013
and any other management letter or similar correspondence from any independent
auditor of the Company or any of their Subsidiaries received since December
31, 2013. The Company has implemented such programs and taken such steps as it
believes are necessary to effect compliance with all provisions of Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and, since December 31, 2013, has not received,
orally or in writing, any notification that its independent auditor (i)
believes that the Company will not be able to complete its assessment before
the reporting deadline, or, if it will be completed prior to such deadline,
that it will not be completed in sufficient time for the independent auditor
to complete its assessment or (ii) will not be able to issue unqualified
attestation reports with respect thereto.

 



 

Section 3.6 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except (i) as reflected or reserved
against in the Companys consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2015
(or as disclosed in the notes thereto) included in the Company SEC Documents,
(ii) for liabilities and obligations incurred in connection with or
contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) for liabilities or obligations
incurred in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past practice,
since December 31, 2015, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company
has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether or not accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would be required by GAAP to be
reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(or required to be disclosed in the notes thereto) that are, individually or
in the aggregate, material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 3.7 _No Violation of Law; Permits_.

 



 

(a) Since December 31, 2013, except for such matters that have not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company, the Company and each of the Companys
Subsidiaries are in compliance with and are not in default under or in
violation of any federal, state, local or foreign treaty, law, statute,
ordinance, rule, executive order, ruling, regulation, judgment, order,
injunction, decree, arbitration award, agency requirement, license or permit
of any Governmental Entity (collectively, " _Laws_ ") applicable to the
Company, such Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets,
including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the " _FCPA_
"), and the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations
of the NASDAQ. Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section 3.7(a)_,
no representation or warranty shall be deemed to be made pursuant to this
_Section 3.7(a)_ in respect of the matters referenced in _Section 3.5_ or in
respect of environmental, employee benefits, tax, labor, intellectual property
or communications regulatory matters, which are the subject of the
representations and warranties made in _Section 3.8_, _Section 3.9_,

Agreement, respectively.

exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals, registrations and orders of any
Governmental Entity required for the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries to
own, lease and operate their properties and assets or to carry on their
businesses as they are now being conducted (other than any such items which
constitute Company Licenses, the " _Company Permits_ "), except where the
failure to have any Company Permit has not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company. All Company Permits are in full force and effect, except where
the failure to be in full force and effect has not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.

 



 

(c) The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all applicable
Laws and industry standards (including PCI and DSS), related to privacy, data
protection or the collection and use of personal information and customer
proprietary network information gathered or used by the Company or its
Subsidiaries applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses
or properties is bound, except where the failure to so comply has not had, and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

 



 

Section 3.8 _Environmental Laws and Regulations_.

 



 

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are and, except with respect to
matters that have been fully resolved, have been in compliance with all
applicable Laws and Contracts entered into with, any Governmental Entity, in
each case relating to pollution or protection of human health, endangered
species, the environment or natural resources (including ambient air, surface
water, groundwater, land surface or subsurface strata) and including Laws
relating to the exposure to or disposal, generation, handling, release or

not limited to, the possession by the Company and its Subsidiaries of all
Company Permits that are required under applicable Environmental Laws, and

in good standing and will not be subject to modification or revocation as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for such
non-compliance or failure to possess, modification or revocation of such
Company Permits as has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. As
used herein, the term " _Hazardous Materials_ " means (i) any petroleum or
petroleum products, explosive or radioactive materials or wastes, asbestos in
any form, toxic mold and polychlorinated biphenyls; and (ii) any other
chemical, material, substance or waste that in relevant form or concentration

and all software implementations of algorithms, models and methodologies
whether in source code or object code form, associated databases and
compilations.

(b) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company is in breach of or
default under the terms of any Company Material Contract where such breach or
default has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. To the knowledge of
the Company, no other party to any Company Material Contract is in breach of
or default under the terms of any Company Material Contract where such breach
or default has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Each Company
Material Contract is a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the
Company or the Subsidiary of the Company that is party thereto and, to the
knowledge of the Company, of each other party thereto, and is in full force
and effect, except (i) that such enforcement may be subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws, now
or hereafter in effect, relating to creditors rights generally, (ii) that
equitable remedies of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of
equitable relief may be subject to

 



      
 

 



 

equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any
proceeding therefor may be brought, and (iii) as has not had, or would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.

 



 

(c) Since December 31, 2013, neither the Company, any Subsidiary of the
Company, nor to the knowledge of the Company, any officer or director of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, has been suspended, debarred,
proposed for debarment or excluded from any Company Government Contract or
government program, or determined to be nonresponsible with respect to any
Company Governmental Contract or government program, and, to the knowledge of
the Company, there is no threat, proposal or valid basis for such suspension,
debarment, proposal for debarment or exclusion of any of the Company, any
Subsidiary of the Company, or any officer or director of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company. For purposes of this _Section 3.20(c)_, " _Company
Government Contract_ " means a Company Material Contract between the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity
or prime contractor or subcontractor to a Governmental Entity, on the other
hand.

 



 

Section 3.21 _Communications Regulatory Matters_.

 



 

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries hold all approvals,
authorizations, certificates and licenses issued by the FCC or State
Regulators and all other material regulatory permits, approvals, licenses and
other authorizations, including franchises, ordinances and other agreements
granting access to public rights of way, issued or granted to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries by a Governmental Entity that are required for the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries to conduct its business, as presently
conducted (collectively, the " _Company Licenses_ "), except such Company
Licenses the failure of which to so hold has not had, and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company. _Section 3.21(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter
sets forth a list of all Company Licenses, together with the name of the
entity holding each such Company License and the date of expiration, if any,
of each such Company License, in each case as of the date hereof.

 



 

(b) Each Company License is valid and in full force and effect and has not
been suspended, revoked, canceled or adversely modified, except where the
failure to be in full force and effect, or the suspension, revocation,
cancellation or modification of which has not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company. No Company License is subject to (i) any conditions or
requirements that have not been imposed generally upon licenses in the same
service, unless such conditions or requirements are set forth on the face of
the applicable authorization or have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company or (ii) any pending proceeding by or before the FCC or State
Regulators to suspend, revoke or cancel, or any judicial review of a decision
by the FCC or State Regulators with respect thereto, unless such pending
proceeding or judicial review has not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company. To the knowledge of the Company, there is no (A) event,
condition or circumstance attributable specifically to the Company that would
preclude any Company License from being renewed in the ordinary course (to the
extent that such Company

 



      
 

 



 

License is renewable by its terms), except where the failure to be renewed has
not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, (B) pending or threatened
FCC or State Regulator regulatory proceedings relating specifically to one or
more of the Company Licenses that have had or would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company or (C) event, condition or circumstance attributable specifically to
the Company that would materially impair, delay or preclude the ability of the
Company or its Subsidiaries to obtain any Consents from any Governmental
Entity, except as has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. No
Company License, order or other agreement, obtained from, issued by or
concluded with any State Regulator imposes or would impose restrictions on the
ability of any Subsidiary of the Company to make payments, dividends or other
distributions to the Company or any other Subsidiary of the Company that
limits, or would reasonably be expected to limit, the cash funding and
management alternatives of the Company on a consolidated basis in a manner
disproportionate to restrictions applied by such State Regulators to similarly
situated companies.

 



 

(c) The Company, with respect to any Company License and any activity
regulated by the FCC or State Regulators but not requiring a license ("
_Unlicensed Activity_ "), and each licensee of each Company License and each
Subsidiary engaged in Unlicensed Activity (" _Unlicensed Subsidiary_ ") is,
and since December 31, 2013 has been, in compliance with each Company License
and has fulfilled and performed all of its obligations with respect thereto
and with respect to any Unlicensed Activity required by the Communications Act
of 1934, as amended (the " _Communications Act_ ") or the rules, regulations,
written policies and orders of the FCC (the " _FCC Rules_ ") or similar rules,
regulations, written policies and orders of State Regulators, and the payment
of all regulatory fees and contributions, except (i) for exemptions, waivers
or similar concessions or allowances and (ii) where such failure to be in
compliance, fulfill or perform its obligations or pay such fees or
contributions has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
The Company and each licensee of each Company License and each Unlicensed
Subsidiary is in good standing with the FCC and all other Governmental
Entities, and neither the Company nor any licensee or Unlicensed Subsidiary
is, to the knowledge of the Company, the respondent with respect to any formal
complaint, investigation, audit, inquiry, subpoena, forfeiture, or petition to
suspend before the FCC, the Universal Service Administrative Company (the "
_USAC_ ") or any other Governmental Entity (each an " _Enforcement Proceeding_
"), except where any such Enforcement Proceedings have not and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company or a Subsidiary of the Company owns
one hundred percent (100%) of the equity and controls one hundred percent
(100%) of the voting power and decision-making authority of each licensee of
the Company Licenses and each Unlicensed Subsidiary.

 



 

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any material
cease-and-desist order or enforcement action issued by, or is a party to any
consent agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or has been ordered to
pay any material civil money penalty by, the FCC, USAC or any other
Governmental Entity (other than a taxing authority, which is covered by
_Section 3.15_), other than those of general application that apply to
similarly situated providers of the same services or their Subsidiaries (each
item in this sentence,

 



      
 

 



 

whether or not set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, a " _Company
Regulatory Agreement_ "), nor has the Company or any of its Subsidiaries been
advised in writing since December 31, 2013 by any Governmental Entity that it
is considering issuing, initiating, ordering or requesting any such Company
Regulatory Agreement.

 



 

Section 3.22 _Affiliate Transactions_. Since December 31, 2013, all
transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings between the Company
and the Companys affiliates or other persons (" _Company Affiliate
Transactions_ ") that are required to be disclosed in the Company SEC
Documents in accordance with Item 404 of Regulation S-K of the SEC have been
so disclosed.

 



 

Section 3.23 _Takeover Provisions_. Assuming the accuracy of the
representations contained in _Section 4.14(a)_, the Company Board has adopted
such resolutions as are necessary to render inapplicable to this Agreement,
the Combination and the other transactions contemplated hereby the
restrictions on "business combinations" (as defined in Section 203 of the
DGCL) as set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL. Assuming the accuracy of the
representation contained in _Section 4.14(a)_, to the knowledge of the
Company, no other state "fair price," "moratorium," "control share
acquisition" or similar state antitakeover statute or regulation is applicable
to the Combination or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 3.24 _Insurance_. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries maintains
insurance policies with reputable insurance carriers against all risks of a
character and in such amounts as are usually insured against by similarly
situated companies in the same or similar businesses. All such policies are in
full force and effect and were in full force and effect during the periods of
time each such insurance policy is purported to be in effect and all premiums
due with respect to such policies have either been paid or adequate provision
for the payment thereof by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries has been
made, except for such failures to be in full force and effect or to pay such
premiums as have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is, with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both, in breach or default (including any such breach or
default with respect to the payment of premiums or the giving of notice) under
any such policies, except as has not had, and would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. There is no material claim by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pending under any such policies that (a) has been denied or disputed by the
insurer other than denials and disputes in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice or (b) if not paid would cause a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company has made available to Parent a
summary of all material insurance policies maintained by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

 



 

Section 3.25 _Finders or Brokers_. Except for the Company Financial Advisors,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has employed any investment
banker, broker or finder or other person in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement who is entitled to any brokers, finders,
financial advisors or other similar fee or commission in connection with or
upon consummation of the Combination or the other transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 3.26 _Swap Agreements_. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is party to any agreement with respect to any swap, forward,
future or derivative transaction or option or similar agreement involving, or
settled by reference to, one or more rates, currencies, commodities, equity or
debt instruments or securities, or economic, financial or pricing indices or
measures of economic, financial or pricing risk or value or any similar
transaction or any combination of these transactions.

 



 

Section 3.27 _Real Property; Networks_.

 



 

(a) Except as has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company,
(a) either the Company or its Subsidiaries owns, and has good and valid title
to, all of its owned real property and has valid leasehold interests in all of
its leased properties, free and clear of all Liens, (b) all leases with
respect to real property to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a

effect against the Company or such Subsidiary and, to the knowledge of the
Company, the counterparties thereto, in accordance with their respective
terms, (c) there is not, under any of such leases, any existing default by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries which, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would become a default by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (d)
the properties owned or leased by the Company or its Subsidiaries are in all
respects, adequate and sufficient, and in satisfactory condition, to support
the operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries as presently conducted.

 



 

(b) The Company has delivered or otherwise made available for inspection to
Parent the following information related to the network of the Company and its
Subsidiaries: (i) a list of all switch locations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and (ii) maps that depict generally the fiber routes operated by
the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Network Facilities_ ").
The Network Facilities are in all material respects in good operating
condition and repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted. With respect to each
Network Facility, except as set forth on _Section 3.27(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, to the knowledge of the Company, any notices or other
actions required to be taken to renew the term of such Network Facility for
any upcoming renewal term have been taken or given in the manner and within
the time provided in such Network Facility agreement or contract (or the time
period provided for giving of such notice or to undertake such action has not
expired) to effectively renew the term of such Network Facility agreement or
contract for the upcoming term thereof to the extent that such Network
Facility agreement or contract is renewable by its terms and the Company or
its applicable Subsidiary intends to renew such Network Facility agreement or
contract. To the knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred, or
circumstance exists, that, but for the passage of time or giving of notice,
would preclude any Network Facility agreement or contract from being renewed
in accordance with the terms thereof to the extent the Company or its
applicable Subsidiary intends to renew such Network Facility agreement or
contract. Each of the Network Facilities is free and clear of all Liens and
other rights in favor of other persons, subject, however, to the terms of the
agreements or contracts pursuant to which such Network Facilities were
acquired.

(the " _Telecommunications Act_ "), between the Company or its Subsidiaries
and incumbent local exchange carriers (each, an " _ILEC_ "). All
Interconnection Agreements include the general terms, conditions and pricing
for any unbundled network elements (" _UNEs_ "), collocation or other network
facilities or services provided under Sections 251 and 252 of the
Telecommunications Act to the Company and its Subsidiaries by the ILECs. An
Interconnection Agreement has been obtained and is effective for each ILEC
territory in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate. The Company and
its Subsidiaries pay for network facilities and services provisioned under the
Interconnection Agreements at rates no higher than those rates approved in the
most recent TELRIC cost order from each respective State PSC in states in

of this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being agreed that

and Merger Sub 2 hereby represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

 



 

Section 4.1 _Qualification; Organization, Etc._

qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the ownership of its properties or the conduct of its
business requires such qualification, except for jurisdictions in which the
failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing has not had, and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent. The copies of Parents certificate of
incorporation and bylaws that are included in or incorporated by reference
into the Parent SEC Documents are complete and correct copies thereof, each as
amended. Parent is not in violation of any provision of the Parent
Organizational Documents.

 



 

(b) Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 and each of Parents other Subsidiaries is a

authority to own, lease or hold its properties and to carry on its business as
it is now being conducted, and is duly qualified or licensed to do business
and, if applicable, is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the
ownership of its property or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification or license, except for jurisdictions in which the failure to be

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent.

 



 

(c) Parent is the sole member of Services. Services is the sole stockholder of
Merger Sub 1 and the sole member of Merger Sub 2. Since its date of
incorporation, neither Merger Sub 1 nor Merger Sub 2 has carried on any

reports, together with any amendments required to be made with respect thereto
and exhibits or other information incorporated therein required to be filed or
furnished by them prior to the date hereof, with the SEC since December 31,

such period by Parent and/or Services on a voluntary basis on a Current Report
on Form 8-K, but excluding the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement,

or, if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment, the Parent SEC

filed or furnished by Parent with the SEC after the date hereof and prior to
the Effective Time (the " _Subsequent Parent SEC Documents_ ") will comply in
all material respects, with the requirements of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, subject to the
last sentence of _Section 4.12_ with respect to the Form S-4 and the Joint
Proxy Statement, and none of the Parent SEC Documents contained, and the
Subsequent Parent SEC Documents will not contain, any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted, or will omit, to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, or are to be made, not misleading.
There are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters received
from the SEC with respect to the Parent SEC Documents and, to the knowledge of
Parent, none of the Parent SEC Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review.
None of the Subsidiaries of Parent is, or has at any time since December 31,
2013 been, required to file or is required to file reports with the SEC
pursuant to the Exchange Act, other than Services.

 



 

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including all related notes
and schedules) of Parent and Services included in the Parent SEC Documents (i)
fairly presents in all material respects, and the consolidated financial
statements (including all related notes and schedules) of Parent and Services
included in the Subsequent Parent SEC Documents will fairly present in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Parent and Services
and their consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof and
the consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows
for the respective

 



      
 

 



 

periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to
normal year-end audit adjustments) and (ii) complied at the time it was filed,
and each of the consolidated financial statements (including all related notes
and schedules) of Parent and Services included in the Subsequent Parent SEC
Documents will comply at the time it is filed, as to form in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, prepared in conformity with GAAP
(except, in the case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of
the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as
may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto). Since December 31, 2013 to
the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor Services has made any material
change in the accounting practices or policies applied in the preparation of
their financial statements, except as required by GAAP, SEC rule or policy or
applicable Law and as disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents.

 



 

Section 4.5 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. Parent and Services are in
compliance in all material respects with all of the provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the provisions of the Exchange Act and the Securities
Act relating thereto, which are applicable to Parent and Services. Each of the
principal executive officers of Parent and Services and the principal
financial officers of Parent and Services (or each former principal executive
officer of Parent and Services and each former principal financial officer of
Parent and Services, as applicable) has made all applicable certifications
required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act or Sections 302 and
906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder with respect to the Parent SEC Documents, and the
statements contained in such certifications are true and accurate. For
purposes of the preceding sentence, "principal executive officer" and
"principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Neither Parent, Services nor any of its other
Subsidiaries has outstanding, or has arranged any outstanding, "extensions of
credit" to directors or executive officers within the meaning of Section 402
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Each of Parent and Services has established and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Each of Parents and Services disclosure
controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material
information required to be disclosed by Parent and Services in the reports
that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and
communicated to Parents and Services management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and its Subsidiaries,
including Services, maintain a system of internal accounting controls
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (a) transactions are executed
in accordance with managements general or specific authorizations; (b)
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability; (c)
access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements general or
specific authorization; and (d) the recorded accounting for assets is compared
with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is
taken with respect to any material differences. Parent has delivered to the
Company complete and accurate copies of notices received from its independent
auditor of any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in Parents or
Services internal control over financial

 



      
 

 



 

reporting since December 31, 2013 and any other management letter or similar
correspondence from any independent auditor of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, including Services, received since December 31, 2013. Parent and
Services have implemented such programs and taken such steps as they believe
are necessary to effect compliance with all provisions of Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and, since December 31, 2013, has not received, orally or
in writing, any notification that its independent auditor (i) believes that
either Parent or Services will not be able to complete its assessment before
the reporting deadline, or, if it will be completed prior to such deadline,
that it will not be completed in sufficient time for the independent auditor
to complete its assessment or (ii) will not be able to issue unqualified
attestation reports with respect thereto.

 



 

Section 4.6 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except (i) as reflected or reserved
against in Parents and Services consolidated balance sheets as of December

Documents, (ii) for liabilities and obligations incurred in connection with or
contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) for liabilities or obligations
incurred in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past practice,
since December 31, 2015, neither Parent nor any Subsidiary of Parent has any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether or not accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) that would be required by GAAP to be reflected on a
consolidated balance sheet of Parent and its Subsidiaries (or required to be
disclosed in the notes thereto) that are, individually or in the aggregate,
material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

Laws applicable to Parent, such Subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties or assets, including FCPA and the applicable listing and corporate
governance rules and regulations of the NASDAQ. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this _Section 4.7(a)_, no representation or warranty shall be

lease and operate their properties and assets or to carry on their businesses
as they are now being conducted (other than any such items which constitute

excluded from any Parent Government Contract or government program, or
determined to be nonresponsible with respect to any Parent Governmental
Contract or government program, and, to the knowledge of Parent, there is no
threat, proposal or valid basis for such suspension, debarment, proposal for
debarment or exclusion of any of Parent, any Subsidiary of Parent, or any
officer or director of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent. For purposes of
this _Section 4.20(c)_, " _Parent Government Contract_ " means a Parent
Material Contract between Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, on the one hand,
and any Governmental Entity or prime contractor or subcontractor to a
Governmental Entity, on the other hand.

 



 

Section 4.21 _Communications Regulatory Matters_.

 



 

(a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries hold all approvals, authorizations,
certificates and licenses issued by the FCC or State Regulators and all other
material regulatory permits, approvals, licenses and other authorizations,
including franchises, ordinances and other agreements granting access to
public rights of way, issued or granted to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
by a Governmental Entity that are required for Parent and each of its
Subsidiaries to conduct its business, as presently conducted (collectively,
the " _Parent Licenses_ "), except such Parent Licenses the failure of which
to so hold has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

 



 

(b) Each Parent License is valid and in full force and effect and has not been
suspended, revoked, canceled or adversely modified, except where the failure
to be in full force and effect, or the suspension, revocation, cancellation or
modification of which has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.
No Parent License is subject to (i) any conditions or requirements that have
not been imposed generally upon licenses in the same service, unless such
conditions or requirements are set forth on the face of the applicable
authorization or have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, or (ii)
any pending proceeding by or before the FCC or State Regulators to suspend,
revoke or cancel, or any judicial review of a decision by the FCC or State
Regulators with respect thereto, unless such pending proceeding or judicial
review has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. To the knowledge of
Parent, there is no event, condition or circumstance attributable specifically
to Parent that would preclude any Parent License from being renewed in the
ordinary course (to the extent that such Parent License is renewable by its
terms), except where the failure to be renewed has not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent.

 



 

(c) Parent, with respect to any Parent License and any Unlicensed Activity,
and each licensee of each Parent License and each Unlicensed Subsidiary is,
and since December 31, 2013 has been, in compliance with each Parent License
and has fulfilled and performed all of its obligations with respect thereto
and with respect to any Unlicensed Activity required by the Communications Act
or the FCC Rules or similar rules, regulations, written policies and orders of
State Regulators, and the payment of all regulatory fees and contributions,
except (i) for exemptions, waivers or similar concessions or allowances and
(ii) where such

 



      
 

 



 

failure to be in compliance, fulfill or perform its obligations or pay such
fees or contributions has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.
Parent and each licensee of each Parent License and Unlicensed Subsidiary is
in good standing with the FCC and all other Governmental Entities, and neither
Parent nor any such licensee or Unlicensed Subsidiary is, to the knowledge of
Parent, the respondent with respect to any Enforcement Proceeding, except
where any such Enforcement Proceedings have not and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent. Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent owns one hundred percent (100%) of
the equity and controls one hundred percent (100%) of the voting power and
decision making authority of each licensee of the Parent Licenses and each
Unlicensed Subsidiary.

 



 

(d) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any material
cease-and-desist order or enforcement action issued by, or is a party to any
consent agreement or memorandum of understanding with or has been ordered to
pay any material civil money penalty by, the FCC, USAC or any other
Governmental Entity (other than a taxing authority, which is covered by
_Section 4.15_), other than those of general application that apply to

Letter, a " _Parent Regulatory Agreement_ "), nor has Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries been advised in writing since December 31, 2013 by any
Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing, initiating, ordering or
requesting any such Parent Regulatory Agreement.

time each such insurance policy is purported to be in effect and all premiums
due with respect to such policies have either been paid or adequate provision
for the payment thereof by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries has been
made, except for such failures to be in full force and effect or to pay such
premiums as have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Neither
Parent

is no material claim by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pending under any

securities, or economic, financial or pricing indices or measures of economic,
financial or pricing risk or value or any similar transaction or any
combination of these transactions.

continue to maintain through the Closing Date, available funds necessary to
consummate the Combination and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including pursuant to _Section 5.17(e)_ and _Section 5.18_ and, for
avoidance of doubt, repayment of the Existing Notes, if necessary, in
accordance with their terms), taking into account (i) unrestricted cash, (ii)

the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative
agent and collateral agent thereunder, (iii) the proceeds of any subsequent
borrowings or of any other financing permitted by this Agreement and incurred
for the primary purpose of consummating the Combination and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv) any commitment letter

and in full force and effect against Parent or such Subsidiary and, to the
knowledge of Parent, the counterparties thereto, in accordance with their
respective terms, (c) there is not, under any of such leases, any existing
default by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries which, with notice or lapse of
time or both, would become a default by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and
(d) the properties owned or leased by Parent or its Subsidiaries are in all
respects, adequate and sufficient, and in satisfactory condition, to support
the operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries as presently conducted.

Company the following information related to the network of Parent and its
Subsidiaries: (i) a list of all switch locations of Parent and its
Subsidiaries and (ii) maps that depict generally the fiber routes operated by
Parent and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Parent Network Facilities_
"). The Parent Network Facilities are in all material respects in good
operating condition and repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted. With respect
to each Parent Network Facility, except as set forth on Section 4.28(b) of the
Parent Disclosure Letter, to the knowledge of Parent, any notices or other
actions required to be taken to renew the term of such Parent Network Facility
for any upcoming renewal term have been taken or given in the manner and
within the time provided in such Parent Network Facility agreement or contract
(or the time period provided for giving of such notice or to undertake such
action has not expired) to effectively renew the term of such Parent Network
Facility agreement or contract for the upcoming term thereof to the extent
that such Parent Network Facility agreement or contract is renewable by its
terms and Parent or its applicable Subsidiary intends to renew such Parent
Network Facility agreement or contract. To the knowledge of Parent, no event
has occurred, or circumstance exists, that, but for the passage of time or
giving of notice, would preclude any Parent Network Facility agreement or
contract from being renewed in accordance with the terms thereof to the extent
Parent or its applicable Subsidiary intends to renew such Parent Network
Facility agreement or contract. Each of the Parent Network Facilities is free
and clear of all Liens and other rights in favor of other persons, subject,
however, to the terms of the agreements or contracts pursuant to which such
Parent Network Facilities were acquired.

discussions or negotiations with any person regarding, or furnish to any
person any non-public information with respect to, or knowingly cooperate in
any way with any person in connection with soliciting, initiating,

expected to lead to a Parent Alternative Transaction Proposal. During the No
Shop Period, Parent shall, and shall instruct its affiliates and its and their
respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
all existing discussions or negotiations with any person conducted heretofore
with respect to any Parent Alternative Transaction Proposal or any inquiry or
proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent Alternative
Transaction Proposal, request the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished and immediately terminate all
physical and electronic dataroom access previously granted to any such person
or its Representatives that was provided by or on behalf of Parent in
connection with any Parent Alternative Transaction Proposal or any inquiry or
proposal that would reasonably be expected

 



      
 

 



 

to lead to a Parent Alternative Transaction Proposal. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if at any
time prior to obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval, Parent or any of its
Representatives receives a Parent Alternative Transaction Proposal that did
not result from any breach of this _Section 5.4(a)_, (i) Parent and its
Representatives may contact the person or group making the Parent Alternative
Transaction Proposal solely to clarify the terms and conditions thereof or to
request that any Parent Alternative Transaction Proposal made orally be made
in writing and (ii) if the Parent Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors) that such Parent
Alternative Transaction Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected
to lead to a Superior Parent Proposal, then Parent and any of its
Representatives may, subject to compliance with _Section 5.4(c)_, (x) furnish
information with respect to Parent and its Subsidiaries to the person or group
making such Parent Alternative Transaction Proposal (and its or their
Representatives) ( _provided_ that all such information has previously been
provided to the Company or is provided to the Company prior to or
substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such person) pursuant
to a customary confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of such person
than the Confidentiality Agreement is to the Company, including with respect
to any standstill or similar provisions contained therein, and (y) participate
in discussions regarding the terms of such Parent Alternative Transaction
Proposal and the negotiation of such terms with the person or group making
such Parent Alternative Transaction Proposal (and such persons or groups
Representatives). Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent agree
that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.4(a)_
applicable to Parent by any of its Representatives, to the extent acting on
its behalf or at its direction, shall constitute a breach of this _Section
5.4(a)_ by Parent.

 



 

(b) Except as set forth below, neither the Parent Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to the
Company), or propose publicly to withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to
the Company), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by
the Parent Board or any such committee thereof with respect to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Stock Issuance and the
Parent Charter Amendment, or (B) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or
propose publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Parent
Alternative Transaction Proposal (any action in this clause (i) being referred
to as a " _Parent Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) allow Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any binding agreement in
connection with any Parent Alternative Transaction Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement expressly permitted pursuant to _Section 5.4(a)_).
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval, the
Parent Board may make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change (and, in the case
of clause (1) of this sentence, terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(h)_) (1) if the Parent Board determines hereunder that a Parent
Alternative Transaction Proposal constitutes a Superior Parent Proposal or (2)
in response to any event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence that
is material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that was not
known to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the Parent Board as of the date of
this Agreement, which event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence
becomes known to the Parent Board prior to obtaining the Parent Stockholder
Approval and does not involve or relate to a Parent Alternative Transaction
Proposal, in either case, the Parent Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors) that the failure
to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its

 



      
 

 



 

fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent
shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change or, in the case of a Parent Alternative Transaction
Proposal which constitutes a Superior Parent Proposal, terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_ unless, in either case, (A) Parent has
given the Company at least three (3) Business Days prior written notice (a "
_Parent Notice of Change_ ") that the Parent Board intends to take such action
and specifying the reasons therefor, including, in the case of a Superior
Parent Proposal, the material terms of any Superior Parent Proposal that is
the basis of the proposed action by the Parent Board, including the identity
of the person making such Superior Parent Proposal and a copy of the agreement
or proposal with respect to such Superior Parent Proposal (it being understood
and agreed that a material amendment to any material term of such Superior
Parent Proposal shall require a new Parent Notice of Change and a new two (2)
Business Day period), (B) during such three (3) Business Day or two (2)
Business Day period, as applicable, Parent has negotiated, and has caused its
Representatives to negotiate, with the Company in good faith, to the extent
the Company desires to negotiate, to enable the Company to propose in writing
a binding offer to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that, if applicable, such Parent Alternative Transaction Proposal
ceases to constitute a Superior Parent Proposal or, in connection with a
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change not involving or relating to a Parent
Alternative Transaction Proposal, would cause the Parent Board no longer to
believe that the failure to make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change would
be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, and (C) at the end of such three (3) Business Day or two (2)
Business Day period, as applicable, the Parent Board shall have considered in
good faith such binding offer and shall have determined that the Superior
Parent Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Parent Proposal or, other
than in the case of a Parent Alternative Transaction Proposal, that it would
continue to be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Parent Boards
fiduciary duties under applicable Law if the Parent Board failed to make a
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change. Subject to Parents right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_, notwithstanding any Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change, Parent shall cause the approvals of the Parent
Charter Amendment and the Stock Issuance to be submitted to a vote of Parent
stockholders at the Parent Stockholders Meeting.

 



 

(c) In addition to the obligations of Parent set forth in _Sections 5.4(a)_
and _5.4(b)_ , at any time prior to obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval,
Parent shall promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day after
knowledge of Parent of the receipt thereof) advise the Company in writing of
its receipt of any Parent Alternative Transaction Proposal, the material terms
and conditions of any such Parent Alternative Transaction Proposal (including
a copy thereof, if made in writing), and the identity of the person or group
making such Parent Alternative Transaction Proposal. Parent shall keep the
Company informed on a reasonably prompt basis of any material developments
with respect to any such Parent Alternative Transaction Proposal (including
any material changes to the terms thereof) (and Parent shall as promptly as
practicable after knowledge of Parent of the receipt thereof provide the
Company with copies of any material written materials relating to such Parent
Alternative Transaction Proposal or any material changes to the terms
thereof).

 



 

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.4_ shall prohibit Parent from (x)
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making "stop-look-and-listen"
communications of the

 



      
 

 



 

nature contemplated by Rule 14d-9 of the Exchange Act or (y) making any
disclosure to the stockholders of Parent if, in the good faith judgment of the
Parent Board (after consultation with its outside counsel) failure to so
disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure that addresses or relates to
the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability of the Parent
Board with respect to this Agreement, the Combination, the Parent Charter
Amendment, the Stock Issuance or a Parent Alternative Transaction Proposal
shall be deemed to be a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Parent
Board in connection with such communication publicly states that its
recommendation with respect to this Agreement, the Combination, the Parent
Charter Amendment and the Stock Issuance has not changed; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that this _Section 5.4(d)_ shall not be deemed to permit Parent
or the Parent Board or any committee thereof to effect a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change except in accordance with _Section 5.4(b)_.

 



 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " _Parent Alternative Transaction Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer
(whether or not in writing) by a third party or group relating to any
transaction or series of related transactions resulting in any: (i) merger,
consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer, share exchange, other business
combination or similar transaction involving Parent (A) pursuant to which any
person (or the stockholders of any person) or group, other than the
stockholders of Parent (as a group) immediately prior to the consummation of
such transaction, would hold Parent Common Stock representing fifteen percent
(15%) or more of the voting power of the surviving or resulting entity after
giving effect to the consummation of such transaction or (B) as a result of
which the stockholders of Parent (as a group) immediately prior to the
consummation of such transaction would hold Parent Common Stock representing
less than eighty-five percent (85%) of the voting power of the surviving or
resulting entity after giving effect to the consummation of such transaction,
(ii) sale, lease, contribution or other disposition, directly or indirectly
(including by way of merger, consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer,
share exchange, other business combination, partnership, joint venture, sale
of capital stock of or other equity interests in a Subsidiary of Parent or
otherwise), of any business or assets of Parent or the Subsidiaries of Parent
representing fifteen percent (15%) or more of the consolidated revenues, net
income or assets of Parent and the Subsidiaries of Parent, taken as a whole,
(iii) issuance, sale or other disposition, directly or indirectly, to any
person (or the stockholders of any person) or group of securities (or options,
rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable
for, such securities) representing fifteen percent (15%) or more of the voting
power of Parent, (iv) transaction in which any person (or the stockholders of
any person) shall acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership, or
the right to acquire beneficial ownership, or formation of any group which
beneficially owns or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, fifteen
percent (15%) or more of the Parent Common Stock or (v) any combination of the
foregoing (in each case, other than in connection with the Stock Issuance and
the Combination).

 



 

(ii) " _Superior Parent Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Parent
Alternative Transaction Proposal made by a third party or group (i) on terms
which the Parent Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside

 



      
 

 



 

counsel and financial advisors) to be superior, from a financial point of
view, to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Stock
Issuance and the Combination, for Parent or holders of Parent Common Stock,
taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this
Agreement (including any changes proposed by the Company to the terms of this
Agreement), and (ii) that the Parent Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors) would reasonably
be expected to be completed, taking into account all financial, regulatory,
legal and other aspects of such proposal (including the financing terms of any
such proposal and conditions to its consummation); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that for purposes of the reference to a Parent Alternative Transaction
Proposal in this definition of Superior Parent Proposal, all references to
"fifteen percent (15%)" and "eighty-five percent (85%)" in the definition of
Parent Alternative Transaction Proposal shall be deemed to be references to
"fifty percent (50%)."

 



 

Section 5.5 _No Solicitation by the Company; Company Board Recommendation_.

 



 

(a) During the No-Shop Period, the Company shall not, and shall instruct its
affiliates and its and their respective Representatives not to, (i) directly
or indirectly solicit, initiate, or knowingly facilitate or encourage any
Company Alternative Transaction Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Alternative Transaction Proposal
or (ii) directly or indirectly participate in any discussions or negotiations
with any person regarding, or furnish to any person any non-public information
with respect to, or knowingly cooperate in any way with any person in
connection with soliciting, initiating, facilitating or encouraging, any
Company Alternative Transaction Proposal or the submission or making of any
inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company
Alternative Transaction Proposal. During the No-Shop Period, the Company
shall, and shall instruct its affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
discussions or negotiations with any person conducted heretofore with respect
to any Company Alternative Transaction Proposal, or any inquiry or proposal
that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Alternative Transaction
Proposal, request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential
information previously furnished and immediately terminate all physical and
electronic dataroom access previously granted to any such person or its
Representatives that was provided by or on behalf of the Company in connection
with any Company Alternative Transaction Proposal or any inquiry or proposal
that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Alternative Transaction
Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, if at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval the Company or any of its Representatives receives a
Company Alternative Transaction Proposal that did not result from any breach
of this _Section 5.5(a)_, (i) the Company and its Representatives may contact
the person or group making the Company Alternative Transaction Proposal solely
to clarify the terms and conditions thereof or to request that any Company
Alternative Transaction Proposal made orally be made in writing and (ii) if
the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside counsel and financial advisors) that such Company Alternative
Transaction Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Company Proposal, then the Company and any of its Representatives
may, subject to compliance with _Section 5.5(c)_, (x) furnish information
with respect to the Company and its

 



       
 

 



 

Subsidiaries to the person or group making such Company Alternative
Transaction Proposal (and its or their Representatives) ( _provided_ that all
such information has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to
Parent prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to
such person) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement not less
restrictive of such person than the Confidentiality Agreement is to Parent,
including with respect to any standstill or similar provisions contained
therein, and (y) participate in discussions regarding the terms of such
Company Alternative Transaction Proposal and the negotiation of such terms
with the person or group making such Company Alternative Transaction Proposal
(and such persons or groups Representatives). Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company and Parent agree that any violation of the restrictions
set forth in this _Section 5.5(a)_ applicable to the Company by any of its
Representatives, to the extent acting on its behalf or at its direction, shall
constitute a breach of this _Section 5.5(a)_ by the Company.

 



 

(b) Except as set forth below, neither the Company Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to Parent), or
propose publicly to withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to Parent), the
approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company Board
or any such committee thereof with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby or (B) approve, recommend or declare
advisable, or propose publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable, any
Company Alternative Transaction Proposal (any action in this clause (i) being
referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) allow
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any binding
agreement in connection with any Company Alternative Transaction Proposal
(other than a confidentiality agreement expressly permitted pursuant to
_Section 5.5(a)_). Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change (and, in the case of clause (1) of this sentence,
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_) (1) if the Company
Board determines hereunder that a Company Alternative Transaction Proposal
constitutes a Superior Company Proposal or (2) in response to any event, fact,
circumstance, development or occurrence that is material to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that was not known to, or reasonably
foreseeable by, the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement, which
event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence becomes known to the
Company Board prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and does not
involve or relate to a Company Alternative Transaction Proposal, in either
case, the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside counsel and financial advisors) that the failure to do so would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be
entitled to exercise its right to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
or, in the case of a Company Alternative Transaction Proposal which
constitutes a Superior Company Proposal, terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(g)_ unless, in either case, (A) the Company has given Parent at
least three (3) Business Days prior written notice (a " _Company Notice of
Change_ ") that the Company Board intends to take such action and specifying
the reasons therefor, including, in the case of a Superior Company Proposal,
the material terms of any Superior Company Proposal that is the basis of the
proposed action by the Company Board, including the identity of the person
making such Superior Company Proposal and a copy of the agreement or proposal
with respect to such Superior Company Proposal (it being understood and agreed
that a material amendment to any material term of such Superior Company
Proposal shall require a new Company Notice of

 



      
 

 



 

Change and a new two (2) Business Day period), (B) during such three (3)
Business Day or two (2) Business Day period, as applicable, the Company has
negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, with Parent in
good faith, to the extent Parent desires to negotiate, to enable Parent to
propose in writing a binding offer to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that, if applicable, such Company Alternative
Transaction Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Company Proposal or, in
connection with a Company Adverse Recommendation Change not involving or
relating to a Company Alternative Transaction Proposal, would cause the
Company Board no longer to believe that the failure to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (C) at the end of such three (3)
Business Day or two (2) Business Day period, as applicable, the Company Board
shall have considered in good faith such binding offer and shall have
determined that the Superior Company Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Company Proposal or, other than in the case of a Company Alternative
Transaction Proposal, that it would continue to be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law if
the Company Board failed to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.
Subject to the Companys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(g)_, notwithstanding any Company Adverse Recommendation Change,
the Company shall cause the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the
Combination to be submitted to a vote of the Companys stockholders at the
Company Stockholders Meeting.

 



 

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in _Sections
5.5(a)_ and _5.5(b)_ , at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business
Day after knowledge of the Company of the receipt thereof) advise Parent in
writing of its receipt of any Company Alternative Transaction Proposal, the
material terms and conditions of any such Company Alternative Transaction
Proposal (including a copy thereof, if made in writing), and the identity of
the person or group making such Company Alternative Transaction Proposal. The
Company shall keep Parent informed on a reasonably prompt basis of any
material developments with respect to any such Company Alternative Transaction
Proposal (including any material changes to the terms thereof) (and the
Company shall as promptly as practicable after knowledge of the Company of the
receipt thereof provide Parent with copies of any material written materials
relating to such Company Alternative Transaction Proposal or any material
changes to the terms thereof).

 



 

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.5_ shall prohibit the Company from
(x) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making "stop-look-and-listen"
communications of the nature contemplated by Rule 14d-9 of the Exchange Act or
(y) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if, in the good
faith judgment of the Company Board (after consultation with its outside
counsel) failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations
under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure that
addresses or relates to the approval, recommendation or declaration of
advisability of the Company Board with respect to this Agreement, the
Combination or a Company Alternative Transaction Proposal shall be deemed to
be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Company Board in
connection with such communication publicly states that its recommendation
with respect to this Agreement and the Combination has not changed; _provided_
, _further_ , that this _Section 5.5(d)_

 



      
 

 



 

shall not be deemed to permit the Company or the Company Board or any
committee thereof to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change except in
accordance with _Section 5.5(b)_.

(ii) sale, lease, contribution or other disposition, directly or indirectly
(including by way of merger, consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer,

Company, taken as a whole, (iii) issuance, sale or other disposition, directly

securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities) representing fifteen
percent (15%) or more of the voting power of the Company, (iv) transaction in
which any person (or the stockholders of any person) shall acquire, directly
or indirectly, beneficial ownership, or the right to acquire beneficial
ownership, or formation of any group which beneficially owns or has the right

other than the Combination).

 



 

(ii) " _Superior Company Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Company
Alternative Transaction Proposal made by a third party or group (i) on terms
which the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside counsel and financial advisors) to be superior, from a financial point
of view, to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Combination, for the holders of Company Common Stock, taking into account all
the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any
changes proposed by Parent to the terms of this Agreement), and (ii) that the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
counsel and financial advisors) would reasonably be expected to be completed,
taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such
proposal (including the financing terms of any such proposal and conditions to
its consummation); _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of the reference

 



      
 

 



 

to a Company Alternative Transaction Proposal in this definition of Superior
Company Proposal, all references to "fifteen percent (15%)" and "eighty-five
percent (85%)" in the definition of Company Alternative Transaction Proposal
shall be deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%)."

 



 

Section 5.6 _Preparation of SEC Documents; Stockholders  Meetings_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement
(and in any event within thirty (30) days after the date of this Agreement or
such later date as the parties may mutually agree in writing), Parent and the
Company shall jointly prepare and file with the SEC the Joint Proxy Statement,
and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the Form S-4, in which the
Joint Proxy Statement shall be included as a prospectus. Each of Parent and
the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to respond to any comments from
the SEC (and shall promptly provide copies of any such comments and responses
thereto to the other party) and to have the Form S-4 declared effective under
the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing. Parent shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be
mailed to Parents stockholders, and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys
stockholders, in each case as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. Each of the Company
and Parent shall also take any action (other than qualifying to do business in
any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or filing a general
consent to service of process) required to be taken under any applicable state
securities Laws in connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock and
Parent Restricted Stock Units in the Merger and in connection with the
reservation for issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock as described in
_Section 2.3(a)_, and each such party shall furnish all information
concerning such party and its stockholders as may be reasonably requested by
the other party in connection with any such action. No filing of, or amendment
or supplement to, the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, and no response
to SEC comments thereon, as the case may be, shall be made by either party
without the others prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) and without providing such other party a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon (and each party shall
consider in good faith for inclusion in such document all comments reasonably
proposed by the other). Each of Parent and the Company shall advise the other
promptly after receipt of oral or written notice of the time when the Form S-4
has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the
issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent
Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, or any oral or written request by the SEC for amendment of
the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or comments thereon and responses
thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information, and shall promptly
provide the other party with copies of any written communication from the SEC
or any state securities commission. If at any time prior to the Effective Time
any information (including any termination, withdrawal, modification or change
of the Parent Board Recommendation or the Company Board Recommendation)
relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective affiliates,
officers or directors, is discovered by Parent or the Company that should be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement to ensure that such documents would not include any misstatement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the

 



      
 

 



 

other party hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required
by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of Parent and the Company.

 



 

(b) Subject to each of Parents and the Companys rights to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_ and _Section 7.1(g)_, respectively,
each of the Company and Parent shall, as promptly as practicable after the
Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act, take all action
reasonably necessary in accordance with applicable Laws and the Company
Organizational Documents, in the case of the Company, and the Parent
Organizational Documents, in the case of Parent, to duly give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders, to be held as promptly as
practicable, and in any event within forty-five (45) days (or such longer
period as mutually agreed between the Company and Parent) after the Form S-4
is declared effective under the Securities Act, to consider, in the case of
the Company, the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the
Combination (the " _Company Stockholders  Meeting_"), and, in the case of
Parent, the approval of the Parent Charter Amendment and the Stock Issuance
(the " _Parent Stockholders  Meeting_") and, subject to each of Parents and
the Companys rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_
and _Section 7.1(g)_, respectively, and to the provisions of this _Section
5.6(b)_ with respect to any adjournment or postponement, each of the Company
and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the
Parent Stockholders Meeting and the Company Stockholders Meeting to be held
on the same day. In the absence of a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
a termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.1(g)_, in the
case of the Company, and in the absence of a Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change or a termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section
7.1(h)_, in the case of Parent, each of the Company and Parent shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in
favor of, in the case of the Company, the adoption of this Agreement and the
approval of the Combination and, in the case of Parent, the approval of the
Parent Charter Amendment and the Stock Issuance, and shall take all other
action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of its
stockholders, as applicable, required by the rules of the NASDAQ or applicable
Laws to obtain such approvals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Company or Parent shall adjourn or postpone,
on one or more occasions and whether or not a quorum is present, the Company
Stockholders Meeting or the Parent Stockholders Meeting, as the case may be,
if, on a date on which the Company Stockholders Meeting or the Parent
Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Company
Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, respectively, to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval or the Parent Stockholder Approval; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company Stockholders Meeting or Parent Stockholders
Meeting, as applicable, is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is more
than thirty (30) days after the date on which the Company Stockholders
Meeting or Parent Stockholders Meeting, as applicable, was originally
scheduled (excluding any postponements or adjournments required by Law).
Unless this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(g)_, or by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_, the Companys obligation
to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting and Parents obligation to hold the
Parent Stockholders Meeting, in each case pursuant to this _Section 5.6(b)_,
shall not be affected by (i) the commencement, public proposal, public
disclosure or communication to (A) the Company of any Company Alternative
Transaction Proposal or (B) Parent of any Parent Alternative Transaction
Proposal, or (ii) the making of any Company Adverse Recommendation

 



      
 

 



 

Change by the Company Board or any Parent Adverse Recommendation Change by the
Parent Board; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the public announcement of a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or the delivery of a Company Notice of
Change, on the one hand, or a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change or a Parent
Notice of Change, on the other hand, is less than ten (10) Business Days prior
to the Company Stockholders Meeting or the Parent Stockholders Meeting,
respectively, such party shall be entitled to postpone the meeting of its
stockholders to a date not more than ten (10) Business Days after such event.
Unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_ or _Section
7.1(h)_, each of the Company and Parent shall ensure that the Company
Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders Meeting, respectively, is
called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited
in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting or the Parent
Stockholders Meeting, as the case may be, are solicited in compliance with
applicable Laws, the rules of the NASDAQ and each of the Company
Organizational Documents and the Parent Organizational Documents, as
applicable.

 



 

(c) Without the prior written consent of the Company, the only matters that
Parent shall propose to be acted on by Parents stockholders at the Parent
Stockholders Meeting are (i) the approval of the Parent Charter Amendment,
(ii) the approval of the Stock Issuance and (iii) if Parent has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock to
obtain the Parent Stockholder Approval, the adjournment of the Parent
Stockholders Meeting to solicit additional proxies. Without the prior written
consent of Parent, the only matters that the Company shall propose to be acted
on by the Companys stockholders at the Company Stockholders Meeting are (i)
the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Combination, (ii) a
non-binding, advisory vote to approve the payment by the Company of certain
compensation to the named executive officers of the Company that is based on
or otherwise relates to the Combination, and (iii) if the Company has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Company Common
Stock to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, the adjournment of the

of Parent, and _Section 5.5(b)_, in the case of the Company: (i) the Company
Board shall recommend that its stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement and the approval of the Combination at the Company
Stockholders Meeting, (ii) the Parent Board shall recommend that its
stockholders vote in favor of the approval of the Parent Charter Amendment and
the Stock Issuance at the Parent Stockholders Meeting, (iii) the Joint Proxy

of (A) Parent has recommended that Parents stockholders vote in favor of the
approval of the Parent Charter Amendment and the Stock Issuance at the Parent
Stockholders Meeting (the " _Parent Board Recommendation_ ") and (B) the
Company has recommended that the Companys stockholders vote in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Combination at the Company
Stockholders Meeting (the " _Company Board Recommendation_ "), (iv) neither
the Parent Board nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, amend or modify, or
propose or resolve to withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to the
Company, the recommendation of the Parent Board that the stockholders of
Parent vote in favor of the approval of the Parent Charter Amendment and the
Stock Issuance and (v) neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof
shall withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw, amend or

case of Parent, and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP, in the case
of the Company (" _Tax Counsel_ "), substantially in the form attached hereto
as _Exhibit C_ (each such opinion, a " _Tax Opinion_ "), dated as of the
Closing Date, to the effect that, on the basis of the facts, representations
and assumptions set forth in such tax opinion, the Combination will qualify as
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Each of
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 shall cooperate with each
Tax Counsel and shall deliver to each Tax Counsel for purposes of each Tax
Opinion, certificates of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2
dated as of the Closing Date and signed by an officer thereof, containing
representations as reasonably necessary and appropriate to enable Tax Counsel
to render the Tax Opinions, each substantially in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit D_ (collectively, the " _Tax Representation Letters_ ").

 



 

(f) Subject to the limitations contained in _Section 5.3_, the Company and
Parent shall each furnish to the other and its counsel all such information as
may be required in order to effect the foregoing actions, and each represents
and warrants to the other that no information furnished by it in connection
with such actions, or otherwise in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated in
order to make any information so furnished, in light of the circumstances
under which it is so furnished, not misleading. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (i) the Company will deliver after execution of
this Agreement complete and accurate copies of the opinions of the Company
Financial Advisors referenced in _Section 3.19_ to Parent (on a non-reliance
basis for informational purposes only), and (ii) Parent will deliver after
execution of this Agreement a complete and accurate copy of the opinion of the
Parent Financial Advisor referenced in _Section 4.19_ to the Company (on a
non-reliance basis for informational purposes only), which opinions shall,
subject to compliance with the respective Company Financial Advisors
engagement letters with the Company, be included in the Joint Proxy Statement.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.7 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, from and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall honor all Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms as
in effect immediately before the date hereof or as modified after the date
hereof through the Effective Time as permitted by this Agreement and the terms
of such Company Benefit Plan; _provided_ that nothing in this Agreement shall
be deemed to limit or otherwise impair Parents ability to amend or terminate
any Company Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms. Each of the Company and
Parent agrees that, for purposes of each Company Benefit Plan, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall constitute a "change of
control" or "change in control" or term of similar import, as applicable.

 



 

(b) From the Effective Time until the twelve (12) month anniversary of the
Effective Time, subject to statutory and other legal requirements, Parent
shall ensure that each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries who
continues in employment with Parent or its Subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Company, and who is not subject to a collective bargaining agreement
(the " _Company Employees_ ") shall receive a base salary or hourly wage rate
no less than that provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time. From the Effective Time until December 31, 2017,
Parent shall provide or shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries
to provide to each Company Employee a cash commission opportunity and target
cash bonus opportunity each no less than that provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time. From the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to provide
welfare and employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements (other than with
respect to non-cash incentive or severance) that are substantially comparable,
in the aggregate, to those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent
and its Subsidiaries. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall provide
to each Company Employee an equity or equity-based incentive opportunity that
is substantially similar to the equity or equity-based incentive opportunity
provided to similarly-situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries. For
a period commencing at the Effective Time and ending not less than twelve (12)
months after the Effective Time, Parent shall ensure that each Company
Employee who is not party to either a Company Individual Agreement providing
severance benefits or the Company Change in Control Severance Plan shall
receive severance benefits that are no less favorable than those provided by
the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in this _Section
5.7(b)_ shall be deemed to be a guarantee of employment to any employee or
officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries or to impose any obligation on
Parent or its Subsidiaries to continue the employment of any person.

 



 

(c) Parent and its affiliates shall recognize the service of employees with
the Company and its Subsidiaries and their predecessors prior to Closing as
service with Parent for all purposes in connection with any employee benefit
plan, program or arrangement (including any vacation, paid time off and
severance policies) maintained by Parent or one of its affiliates following
the Effective Time to the extent credited for such purpose by the Company or
its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, except (i) for
benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit pension plan, (ii) for
purposes of any retiree welfare plan or (iii) as would result in a duplication
of benefits.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Parent and its affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
waive, or cause its insurance carriers to waive, all limitations as to pre-
existing and at-work conditions, if any, with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to Company Employees under any group health
plan (as defined in Section 4980B of the Code) that is made available to such
employees following the Effective Time by Parent or one of its affiliates,
unless such conditions would not have been waived under the comparable plans
of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such employees participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) provide credit to Company
Employees for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid by
such employees under any group health plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries
during the portion of the relevant plan year following the Effective Time in
which Company Employees first participate therein for purposes of any
applicable co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expense requirements
under any such group health plan of Parent and its affiliates.

 



 

(e) Nothing in this _Section 5.7_ shall be treated as an amendment of, or
undertaking to amend, any employee benefit plan. The provisions of this
_Section 5.7_ are solely for the benefit of the respective parties to this
Agreement and nothing in this _Section 5.7_, express or implied, shall (i) be
deemed or construed to establish any Company Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit
Plan, (iii) prevent or limit Parent, the Surviving Company or any Affiliate of
Parent from amending or terminating any Company Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit
Plan in accordance with their terms, or (iv) create any third-party rights in
any Company Employee (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

 



 

Section 5.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (1)
the occurrence of any event known to it which (A) has had, or would reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on it or (B) has caused, or would reasonably be expected to cause,
individually or in the aggregate, any condition set forth in _Article VI_ to
be unsatisfied at any time prior to the Effective Time; or (2) any action,
suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company or Parent, as applicable, threatened that questions or challenges the
validity of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this _Section 5.8_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice, nor shall the
party giving such notice be prejudiced with respect to any such matters solely
by virtue of having given such notice.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Filings; Other Action_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts (subject to, and in
accordance with, applicable Law) to take promptly, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate
with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
Combination and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including to (i) obtain all necessary Consents from Governmental Entities and
the making of all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all

action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) obtain all

 



      
 

 



 

necessary Consents from third parties, (iii) defend all lawsuits or other

the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall:

 



 

(i) (A) promptly, but in any event within eight (8) Business Days from the
date hereof, make or cause to be made, in consultation and cooperation with
the other, (1) an appropriate filing of a notification and report form
pursuant to the HSR Act relating to the Combination and (2) all other
necessary registrations, declarations, notices and filings relating to the
Combination with other Governmental Entities under any other antitrust,
competition, trade regulation or similar Laws or (B) respond as promptly as
practicable to any additional requests for information received from the
Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice, or any other Governmental Entities in connection with
any filing referenced in clause (A);

 



 

(ii) (A) promptly, (1) but in any event within eight (8) Business Days from
the date hereof, make or cause to be made, in consultation and cooperation
with the other, all filings required to be made with the FCC in order to
obtain the FCC Consents and all filings required to be made with any State
Regulators in order to obtain the PSC Consents set forth in _Section
5.9(b)(ii)(A)(1)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (the " _First Tier Filings_
"), and (2) within fifteen (15) Business Days from the date hereof, make or
cause to be made, in consultation and cooperation with the other, all filings
required to be made with any State Regulators in order to obtain all other PSC
Consents set forth in _Section 5.9(b)(ii)(A)(2)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter (the " _Second Tier Filings_ "), (such applications for FCC Consents
set forth in the preceding clause (1) the " _FCC Applications_ " and such
applications for PSC Consents set forth in the preceding clauses (1) and (2)
collectively, the " _PSC Applications_ "), (B) respond as promptly as
practicable to any additional requests for information received from the FCC,
or any State Regulator by Parent or the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries and (C) use reasonable best efforts to cure, not later than the
Effective Time, any material violations or defaults under any FCC Rules or
rules of any State Regulator; _provided_ that Parent shall pay all filing fees
for the FCC Applications and PSC Applications;

 



 

(iii) use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other in (A)
determining whether any filings are required to be made with, or Consents are
required to be obtained from, any other third parties (including any Consents
required under any contract to which a party hereto is bound) or Governmental
Entities in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; and (B) timely
making all such required or appropriate filings and timely seeking all
required or appropriate consents, permits, clearances, authorizations or
approvals; and

 



       
 

 



 

(iv) use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other
actions and do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated
hereby, including taking all such further action as reasonably may be
necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the Federal Trade Commission,
the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, the FCC,
any State Regulator or any other Governmental Entity may assert under a
Regulatory Law with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, subject
to _Section 5.9(e)_; _provided_ , that such actions, individually or
collectively, would not reasonably be expected to constitute a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent or the Company.

 



 

(c) Parent and Company shall jointly and in cooperation with each other direct
the parties proceedings before any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Combination, this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. In
furtherance of the foregoing, the parties further agree as follows:

 



 

(i) Unless prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental
Entity, to the extent reasonably practicable, each of Parent and the Company
shall provide the other with an opportunity to attend any meeting of such
party with, or participate in any substantive conversation of such party with,
any Governmental Entity in respect of the Combination (including with respect
to any of the actions referred to in _Sections 5.9(a)_ and _5.9(b)_ );
_provided_ that the foregoing shall not be deemed to restrict Parent in
attending such meetings or participating in such substantive conversations
without the Company; _provided_ that, to the extent reasonably practicable, it
has given the Company reasonable prior notice of any such meeting or
conversation and that it keeps the Company reasonably apprised with respect
thereto. The Company shall not participate in or attend any meeting, or engage
in any substantive conversation, with any Governmental Entity in respect of
the Combination (including with respect to any of the actions referred to in
_Sections 5.9(a)_ and _5.9(b)_ without Parents participation, unless such
substantive conversation is initiated by the Governmental Entity to the
Company or its counsel via telephone and the scope is limited to information
pertaining to the Company.

 



 

(ii) Parent and the Company shall jointly and in cooperation with each other
prepare all written communications with any Governmental Entity with respect
to this Agreement and the Combination. Parent and the Company each shall
provide the other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such
written materials prior to submission (and shall consider for inclusion in
such written communications all comments reasonably proposed by the other),
and shall furnish the other with copies of all such written communications
between it, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives on the one
hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of any Governmental Entitys
staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Combination,
except that any materials concerning valuation of the Company may be redacted
or withheld. Neither Parent nor the Company will extend any waiting period
under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with any Governmental Entity or
other authorities not to consummate any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the other.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this _Section 5.9_ (but subject to _Section 5.9(e)_), if any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a
private party, is instituted or if any objections are asserted (or threatened
to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement
as violative of any Law or not in the public interest, each of the Company and
Parent shall cooperate in all respects with each other and take all actions
necessary to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement, nothing in this _Section 5.9_ shall limit a
partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(ii)_ so
long as such party has, prior to such termination, complied with its
obligations under this _Section 5.9_.

 



 

(e) Without limiting this _Section 5.9_, Parent and the Company agree to
take, and Parent shall take, any and all steps, and to make any and all
reasonable undertakings necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any Regulatory Law that may be asserted by any third party or
Governmental Entity with respect to the Combination so as to enable the
Closing to occur (and in any event no later than on or prior to the Outside
Date), including proposing, negotiating, committing to, and effecting by
consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture,
licensing or disposition of such assets or businesses of Parent (or its
Subsidiaries) or the Company (or its Subsidiaries) or otherwise taking or
committing to take actions that limit Parents or its Subsidiaries freedom of
action with respect to, or their ability to retain, any of the businesses,
product lines or assets of Parent (or its Subsidiaries) or the Company (or its
Subsidiaries) in each case, as may be required in order to obtain any
clearances or approvals required to consummate the Combination, or avoid the
entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order, or other order in any suit or proceeding, that would
otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the Closing; _provided_ ,
that any action taken pursuant to this _Section 5.9_ is conditioned upon the
consummation of the Combination; _provided further_ , that Parent, the Company
and their Subsidiaries shall not be required to, and Parent, the Company and
their Subsidiaries shall not be permitted to (without others prior written
consent), (1) divest or otherwise dispose of any assets or businesses of such
party or transfer the same to a trust or similar vehicle pending disposition
or divestiture or (2) undertake any efforts or to take any action if the
taking of such efforts or action is or would reasonably be expected to result,
individually or in the aggregate, in a material adverse effect on the assets,
liabilities, business, results of operations or condition (financial or
otherwise) of Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company),
taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Combination (it being understood
that such material adverse effect shall be measured solely on a scale relative
to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to the
Combination), (the requirement to take the actions described in each of the
foregoing clauses (1) and (2), a " _Substantial Detriment_ "); and Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall take any action that has the effect of, or agree
with any Governmental Entity to, any Substantial Detriment without the prior
written consent of Parent. " _Regulatory Law_ " means: (i) the Sherman
Antitrust Act of 1890, as amended, the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, as
amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914, as amended,
and all other statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative
and judicial doctrines and other Laws that are designed or intended to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect

 



      
 

 



 

of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening competition, whether in
the communications industry or otherwise, through merger or acquisition, and
(ii) FCC Rules, any other approval required by the United States government
and any applicable laws, rules, regulations, practices and orders of any State
Regulators or Governmental Entities regulating competition and/or the
telecommunication and data communications industry.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Takeover Statute_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition" or other form of antitakeover statute or regulation shall
become applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company
and Parent and the members of their respective Boards of Directors shall grant
such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize
the effects of such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Public Announcements_. Except as provided in _Section 5.4(b)_
and _Section 5.5(b)_, neither the Company, on the one hand, nor Parent,
Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2, on the other hand, shall issue (or cause its
affiliates or Representatives to issue) any press release or other public
statement relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
without the prior written consent of the other (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by
Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other
party or parties hereto a reasonable opportunity to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance. Parent and the Company agree that
the initial press release (or releases) to be issued with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form previously
agreed to by the parties (the " _Announcement_ "). Notwithstanding the
forgoing, this _Section 5.11_ shall not apply to any press release or other
public statement made by the Company or Parent (a) which is consistent with
the Announcement and the terms of this Agreement and does not contain any
information relating to the Company or Parent that has not been previously
announced or made public in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or (b)
is made in the ordinary course of business and does not relate specifically to
the signing of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.12 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification and payment or
reimbursement of fees and expenses incurred in advance of the final
disposition of any claim related to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), now existing in favor of the
current or former directors or officers, as the case may be (individually, an
" _Indemnified Party_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") of
the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) or
indemnification agreements with any Indemnified Party listed in _Section
5.12(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, in each case as in effect on the
date of this Agreement, shall survive the Combination and shall continue (or,
in the case of the Company following the Subsequent Merger, shall continue to
be provided for in the limited liability company agreement of the

 



      
 

 



 

Surviving Company) in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years from
and after the Effective Time. For a period of six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to,
indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
costs, expenses, judgments, fines and, with Parents prior consent, amounts
paid in settlement in connection with any threatened or actual civil, criminal
or administrative action, suit, litigation, arbitration, mediation, claim,
hearing, inquiry investigation or other proceeding (an " _Action_ ") to which
such Indemnified Party is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole
or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the
fact that such individual is or was a director or officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the request of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person or (ii)
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether
asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time. In the event of any
such Action, each Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of
reasonable expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim, action, suit or
proceeding from the Surviving Company to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law within thirty (30) days of receipt by the Surviving Company
from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor together with reasonable
documentation thereof; _provided_ that any person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.

 



 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under _Section
5.12(a)_, upon learning of any such Action, shall promptly notify Parent
thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or the
Surviving Company of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party,
except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the indemnifying
party. In the event of any such Action (arising after the Effective Time), (i)
Parent shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and Parent shall not
be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel
or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in
connection with the defense thereof, except that if Parent elects not to
assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there
are issues which raise conflicts of interest between Parent and the
Indemnified Parties, or between the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified
Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Parent shall pay all
reasonable, documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses of such counsel for the
Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are received; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall be obligated pursuant to this _Section 5.12(b)_
to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any
jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel for such Indemnified Parties would
present such counsel with a conflict of interest; _provided further_ , that
the fewest number of counsels necessary to avoid conflicts of interest shall
be used, (ii) the Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the defense of any
such matter and (iii) Parent shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without its prior written consent. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section
5.12_ to the contrary, Parent shall not have any obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party if and to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction
shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final,
that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated
hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.

 



 

(c) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to) maintain in effect directors and
officers liability insurance in

 



      
 

 



 

respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
covering each person covered by the Companys currently in force directors
and officers liability insurance (" _Current Company D andO Insurance_"), on
terms with respect to the coverage and amounts that are no less favorable than
those of the Current Company DandO Insurance; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
the aggregate annual premiums for such insurance exceeds three hundred percent
(300%) of the annual premium for such insurance as of the date hereof (the "
_Premium Cap_ "), then the Surviving Company or Parent shall cause to be
provided a policy covering such individuals with the greatest coverage as is
then available at a cost up to but not exceeding such Premium Cap. The Company
may (or if requested by Parent, the Company shall), in consultation with
Parent, purchase prior to the Effective Time a six-year prepaid "tail policy"
on terms and conditions providing at least substantially equivalent benefits
in the aggregate as the Current Company DandO Insurance with respect to matters
existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time, covering without limitation
the Combination and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, at an
aggregate cost up to but not exceeding the aggregate maximum amount payable
pursuant to the proviso above for such six-year period. If such prepaid "tail
policy" has been obtained by the Company, it shall be deemed to satisfy all
obligations to obtain insurance pursuant to this _Section 5.12(c)_ and the
Surviving Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such policy
to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and to honor all
of its obligations thereunder.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.12_ to the contrary, the
rights of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and legal representatives
under this _Section 5.12_ shall be in addition to any rights such Indemnified
Parties may have under the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or
comparable organizational documents) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, under the indemnification agreements listed in _Section
5.12(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, or under any other applicable Laws.

 



 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.12_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their
respective heirs and legal representatives.

 



 

Section 5.13 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to approve in advance in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act and the Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP SEC No-Action
Letter (January 12, 1999) any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including
derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of
Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Parent
Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by each respective officer or director of the Company who is subject to
Section 16 of the Exchange Act (or who will become subject to Section 16 of
the Exchange Act as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby) with
respect to equity securities of the Company or Parent, as the case may be.

 



 

Section 5.14 _Control of Operations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall give Parent or the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the others operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent and the Company

 



      
 

 



 

shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over its respective operations.

 



 

Section 5.15 _Parent Board; Governance Matters_.

 



 

(a) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all actions
reasonably necessary to increase the size of the Parent Board to twelve (12)
members and to appoint to the Parent Board three (3) members of the Companys
Board of Directors selected by the Company from any of the directors elected
at or appointed after the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders of the Company
(the " _Company Designees_ "); _provided_ , that such directors are reasonably
acceptable to Parent taking into account Parents normal corporate governance
process for selection of its board members, including, but not limited to, a
review of such individuals skills, experience and independence; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if any Company Designee is not acceptable to Parent in its
reasonable discretion, or is unable or unwilling to serve on the Parent Board,
then the Company shall select a different director in accordance with this
_Section 5.15(a)_ (who shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent) until three
(3) Company Designees are able and willing to serve on the Parent Board and
have been deemed reasonably acceptable to Parent.

 



 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Company Designees shall serve as
directors of Parent until the next annual meeting of Parents stockholders and
until their successors are duly elected and qualified in accordance with the
organizational documents of Parent. Subject to consummation of the
Combination, Parent shall cause the Company Designees to be included in
Parents proxy statement in respect of the first annual meeting of
stockholders immediately following the Closing, as nominees of Parent for
election to the Parent Board and shall solicit proxies in favor of the
election of the Company Designees to the Parent Board from the stockholders of
Parent eligible to vote for the election of directors at such next annual
meeting, using efforts no less than the efforts used to solicit proxies in
favor of the election of other individuals nominated to the Parent Board by
Parent.

that the accuracy of representations and warranties that by their terms speak
as of the date of this Agreement or some other date shall be determined at and
as of such date and not as of the Effective Time, and (y) solely with respect
to the foregoing clause (i), where any such failure of the representations and
warranties to be true and correct (without giving effect to any "materiality"
or "Material Adverse Effect" qualifications contained therein) has not had,
and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

 



 

(b) The Company shall have performed in all material respects all obligations
and complied in all material respects with all covenants required by this
Agreement to be performed or complied with by it prior to the Effective Time.

the Closing Date, to the effect that, on the basis of the facts,
representations and assumptions set forth in such opinion, the Combination

Code. In rendering its Tax Opinions, Parents Tax Counsel shall be entitled to
receive and rely upon the Tax Representation Letters.

Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this

Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2, the Company or any of their former, current and
future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling persons, stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, agents or affiliates (collectively, the "
_Covered Persons_ ") except (i) as set forth in _Section 3.30_, _Section
4.31_, _Section 5.3(c)_, the second-to-last and third-to-last sentences of
_Section 5.17(c)_, _Section 5.18(f)_, this _Section 7.2_, _Section 7.3_
and _Article VIII_, each of which shall survive the termination of this
Agreement, and (ii) that, subject to the second sentence of _Section 7.3(f)_,
nothing herein shall relieve any Covered Person from any further liability or
damages for any willful and material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained herein or for actual and intentional fraud,
which liability or damages shall not be limited to reimbursement of the
partys expenses or out-of-pocket costs and may include, to the extent proven
and recoverable under applicable Law, other damages suffered by the party, and
the calculation of damages suffered by the party may include, to the extent
proven, loss suffered by the partys stockholders (including the benefit of
the bargain lost by the partys stockholders, taking into account without
limitation the total amount payable to such stockholders under this
Agreement), which shall be deemed in such event to be damages only of the
party and not of the partys stockholders themselves. For purposes of this
Agreement, "willful and material breach" means a material breach that is a
consequence of an act undertaken by the breaching party with the knowledge
(actual or constructive) that the taking of such act would, or would
reasonably be expected to, cause a material breach of this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, any partys failure to effect the Closing when required
under this Agreement shall be a willful and material breach of this Agreement
by such party.

Company Termination Fee and the Company Expenses or the Parent Termination Fee

against the other party or its associated Covered Persons arising out of, or
related to, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, whether at
law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and neither the Company, in
the case of any payment of the Company Termination Fee and the Company
Expenses to Parent, nor Parent, in the case of any payment of the Parent
Termination Fee and the Parent Expenses to the Company, nor their respective
associated Covered Persons shall have any further liability or obligation
arising out of, or related to, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby; _provided_ that, in the event that the termination of this Agreement
does not give rise to an immediate right of payment of the Company Termination
Fee and the Company Expenses or the Parent Termination Fee and the Parent
Expenses, as applicable, due to the terms of this _Section 7.3_ and either
party shall have instituted an Action and/or the parties shall have settled
any Action or otherwise resulting in payment of any damages or other amounts
by one party to the other, then the amount of the Company Termination Fee and
the Company Expenses or the Parent Termination Fee and the Parent Expenses, as
applicable, shall be reduced dollar for dollar by the amount of any such
payment by the Company or Parent, as applicable, described above in this
proviso (and thereafter the sole and exclusive remedy provisions of this
_Section 7.3(f)_ shall apply in all respects), including for any loss
suffered as a result of the failure of the Combination to be consummated or
for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, including for any
willful and material breach or actual and intentional fraud, whether in equity
or at Law, in contract, in tort or otherwise. If this Agreement is terminated
(x) by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_ or by Parent pursuant to
_Section 7.1(h)_ and the Company pays the Company Termination Fee in
accordance with _Section 7.3(a)_ or Parent pays the Parent Termination Fee in
accordance with _Section 7.3(b)_, as applicable, or (y) by the Company
pursuant to _Section 7.1(i)_, the Company elects to receive the Parent
Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 7.3(b)(iv)_, and Parent pays the
Parent Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 7.3(b)_, then in each of
the foregoing clauses (x) and (y), such payment of the Company Termination Fee
or Parent Termination Fee shall, together with the Company Expenses and Parent
Expenses, as and if applicable, be the sole and exclusive monetary damages
remedy of Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 and their associated Cover
Persons against the Company, in the case of Parent, and be the sole and
exclusive monetary damages remedy of the Company against Parent, Merger Sub 1
and Merger Sub 2, in the case of the Company and its associated Cover Persons,
for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Combination to be
consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise,
including for any willful and material breach or actual and intentional fraud,
whether in equity or at Law, in contract, in tort or otherwise. If this
Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(i)_ and the
Company elects not to demand payment of the Parent Termination Fee in
accordance with _Section 7.3(b)(iv)_, the Company shall be entitled to seek
damages to the fullest extent provided hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in the event the Company commences an Action to seek damages hereunder
following termination, it shall irrevocably forfeit and waive any right to
receive the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)(iv)_. The
foregoing shall not limit the right of the Company to seek specific
performance of this Agreement prior to its termination, including in the event
the Company is entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(i)_. For the avoidance of doubt,

 



      
 

 



 

(x) the Company does not waive its right to seek monetary damages (including
the Parent Termination Fee) in accordance with and pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement in the event the Company brings an Action for specific
performance prior to termination of this Agreement and the Closing does not
occur following such Action and (y) the foregoing provisions of this _Section
7.3(f)_ shall not apply to the rights and obligations of the parties contained
in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which rights and obligations shall
survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.

 



 

Section 7.4 _Amendment or Supplement_. At any time before or after approval of
the matters presented in connection with the Combination by the respective
stockholders of the Company and Parent and prior to the Effective Time, this
Agreement may be amended or supplemented in writing by the Company and Parent
with respect to any of the terms contained in this Agreement, except that
following approval by the stockholders of the Company or Parent there shall be
no amendment or change to the provisions hereof which by Law or in accordance
with the rules of the NASDAQ or this Agreement requires further approval by
such stockholders without such further approval, nor shall there be any
amendment or change not permitted under applicable Law.

 



 

Section 7.5 _Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc._ At any time prior to the
Effective Time, the Company and Parent may:

 



 

(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of
the other party;

 



 

(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; or

 



 

(c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other
party contained herein.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company or Parent in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of
any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party.

by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (c) agrees that it

or to such other address as any party shall specify by written notice so
given, and such notice shall be deemed to have been delivered as of the date
so communicated or personally delivered or mailed by overnight service. Any
party to this Agreement may notify any other party of any changes to the
address or any of the other details specified in this _Section 8.7_;
_provided_ that such notification shall only be effective on the date
specified in such notice or five (5) Business Days after the notice is given,
whichever is later. Rejection or other refusal to accept or the inability to
deliver because of changed address of which no notice was given shall be
deemed to be receipt of the notice as of the date of such rejection, refusal
or inability to deliver.

 



 

Section 8.8 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

 



 

Section 8.9 _Date For Any Action_. In the event that any date on which any
action is required to be taken hereunder by any of the parties hereto is not a
Business Day, such action shall be required to be taken on the next succeeding
day which is a Business Day.

 



 

Section 8.10 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any other jurisdiction so long as neither the economic nor legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party, unless such party waives its rights under
this _Section 8.10_ with respect thereto. If any provision of this Agreement
is so broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be
only so broad as is enforceable.

 



 

Section 8.11 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
and the exhibits and schedules hereto and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, between the parties, or any of them,
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. Notwithstanding
anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, except for, following
the Effective Time, the right of the Companys stockholders to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(i)_ and the holders of
Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock Units to receive,
respectively, the Company Stock Option

 



      
 

 



 

Consideration and Parent Exchange Units pursuant to _Section 2.3_ (provided
that the Companys stockholders shall not have the right to enforce their
right to receive Merger Consideration against Parent or any of its affiliates
while the aggregate Merger Consideration to which the Companys stockholders
are entitled pursuant to _Article II_ remains deposited with the Exchange
Agent and the Exchange Agent has not received any instruction from Parent or
any of its affiliates to withhold payment); and the right of the Indemnified
Parties to enforce the provisions of _Section 5.12_, which rights are hereby
acknowledged and agreed by Parent, nothing contained in this Agreement is
intended to, and nothing herein shall, confer upon any person other than the
parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder; _provided_ , _that_ , nothing
in this _Section 8.11_ shall limit the right of Parent or the Company to seek
damages as contemplated by _Section 7.2_.

 



 

Section 8.12 _Headings_. Headings of the Articles and Sections of this
Agreement are for convenience of the parties only, and shall be given no
substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever.

 



 

Section 8.13 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
an Article or Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents to this
Agreement is for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein"
and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings
when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant
thereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this
Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such
terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of
such term. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein
or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such
agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented, including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver
or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor
statutes and references to all attachments thereto and instruments
incorporated therein. References to a person are also to its permitted
successors and assigns. Each of the parties has participated in the drafting
and negotiation of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is drafted by
all the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of authorship of any of the provisions of this
Agreement.
