 (a) all cash and cash equivalents of Seller, including without limitation certificates of deposit, commercial paper, treasury bills, marketable securities, money market accounts and all such similar accounts or investments; 

    

 (b) all tangible and intangible personal property of Seller retired or disposed of  between the date of this Agreement and Closing in accordance with Article 4; 

    

 (c) all Station Contracts that are terminated or expire prior to Closing in accordance with Article 4; 

    

 (d) Sellers corporate and trade names unrelated to the operation of the Stations (including the name "Emmis"), charter documents, and books and records relating to the organization, existence or ownership of Seller, duplicate copies of the records of the Stations, and all records not relating to the operation of the Stations; 

    

 (e) all contracts of insurance, all coverages and proceeds thereunder and all rights in connection therewith, including without limitation rights arising from any  refunds due with respect to insurance premium payments to the extent related to  such insurance policies; 

    

 (f) all pension, profit sharing plans and trusts and the assets thereof and any other employee benefit plan or arrangement and the assets thereof, if any, maintained by Seller; 

     (g) the Stations accounts receivable and any other rights to payment of cash  consideration (including without limitation all rights to payments under the  Stations network affiliation agreements, whether or not offset) for goods  or services provided prior to the Effective Time (defined below) or commencement of the LMA (defined below), as applicable (the "A/R"); 

    

 (h) any computer software and programs used in the operation of the Stations that are not transferable; 

    

 (i) all rights and claims of Seller, whether mature, contingent or otherwise, against third parties with respect to the Stations and the Station Assets, to the extent arising during or attributable to any period prior to the Effective  Time;

 (m) the assets listed on _Schedule 1.2_ , and the slogan "Great Media, Great People, Great Service." 

    

 1.3. _Shared Assets_. 

    

 (a) Some of the Station Contracts may be used in the operation of multiple stations or other business units (the "Shared Contracts") and are identified as  such on _Schedule 1.1(d)_. The rights and obligations under the Shared  Contracts shall be equitably allocated among stations in a manner reasonably  determined by Seller in accordance with the following equitable allocation  principles: 

    

 (i) any allocation set forth in the Shared Contract shall control; 

    

 (ii) if none, then any allocation previously made by Seller in the ordinary course of  Station operations shall control; 

    

 (iii) if none, then the quantifiable proportionate benefit to be received by the parties after Closing shall control; and 

    

 (iv) if not quantifiable, then reasonable accommodation shall control. 

    

 (b) Buyer shall cooperate with Seller (and any third party designated by Seller) in such allocation, and the Station Contracts (and Assumed Obligations (defined below)) will include only Buyers allocated portion of the rights and obligations under the Shared Contracts (without need for further action and whether such allocation occurs before or after Closing). If designated by Seller, such allocation will occur by termination of the Shared Contract and execution of new contracts. Buyers allocated portion of the Shared Contracts will not include any group discounts or similar benefits specific to Seller or its affiliates. Completion of documentation of any such allocation is not a condition to Closing. 

     (c) Seller operates a centralcasting facility serving WKCF (Orlando), WVUE (New Orleans), WFTX (Cape Coral) and WALA and WBPG (Mobile-Pensacola). Since the Stations include WFTX (Cape Coral), then the terms set forth on _Schedule 1.3_ shall apply. Assets used in the operation of such facility are Excluded Assets. If any Schedule attached hereto includes any such items, then such items are nonetheless Excluded Assets. If applicable, at Closing, the parties shall enter into the agreements set forth on _Schedule 1.3_ , in the forms attached hereto as _Exhibit 1.3_ (or, where appropriate, the parties shall execute an assignment and assumption agreement with respect to such agreements). 

    

 1.4. _Assumption of Obligations_. On the Closing Date (defined below), Buyer shall assume the obligations of Seller arising during, or attributable to, any period of time on or after the Closing Date under the Station Contracts and the FCC Licenses, the obligations described in Section 5.7 and any other liabilities of Seller to the extent, and only to the extent, Buyer receives a credit therefor under Section 1.7 (collectively, the "Assumed Obligations"). Except for the Assumed Obligations, Buyer does not assume, and will not be deemed by the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby to have assumed, any other liabilities or obligations of Seller (the "Retained Obligations"). 

    

 1.5. _Purchase Price_. In consideration for the sale of the Station Assets to Buyer, at Closing Buyer shall pay Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the sum of Two Hundred Thirty-Five Million Dollars ($235,000,000), subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 1.7 (the "Purchase Price"). 

    

 1.6. _Deposit_. Within one (1) business day of the date of this Agreement, Buyer shall make a cash deposit in immediately available funds in an amount equal to 10% of the Purchase Price (the "Deposit") with Bank of America (the "Escrow Agent") pursuant to the Escrow Agreement (the "Escrow Agreement") of even date herewith among Buyer, Seller and the Escrow Agent. At Closing, the Deposit shall be disbursed to Seller and applied to the Purchase Price and any interest accrued thereon shall be disbursed to Buyer. If this Agreement is terminated by Seller pursuant to Section 10.1(c), the Deposit and any interest accrued thereon shall be disbursed to Seller and credited as partial payment of liquidated damages under Section 10.5. If this Agreement is terminated for any other reason, the Deposit and any interest accrued thereon shall be disbursed to Buyer. The parties shall each instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse the Deposit and all interest thereon to the party entitled thereto and shall not, by any act or omission, delay or prevent any such disbursement. Any failure by Buyer to make the Deposit within one (1) business day of the date hereof constitutes a material default as to which the Cure Period under Section 10.1 does not apply entitling Seller to immediately terminate this Agreement. 

    

 1.7. _Prorations and Adjustments_. 

    

 (a) Subject to the LMA (as applicable), all prepaid and deferred income and expenses  relating to the Station Assets and arising from the operation of the Stations  shall be prorated between Buyer and Seller in accordance with accounting  principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") as of  12:01 a.m. on the day of Closing (the "Effective Time"). Such  prorations shall include without limitation all ad valorem, real estate and  other property taxes (except transfer taxes as provided by Section 11.1), music  and other license fees, employee performance incentives set forth in employment  agreements or annual compensation plans Buyer is assuming hereunder, any  vacation for Transferred Employees (defined below) (except accruals for the  fiscal year of Seller in which Closing occurs for which there shall be no  adjustment), utility expenses, rent and other amounts under Station Contracts  and similar prepaid and deferred items. Seller shall receive a credit for all of the Stations deposits and prepaid expenses. Sales commissions related to the sale of advertisements broadcast on the Stations prior to Closing or  commencement of the LMA, as applicable, shall be the responsibility of Seller,  and sales commissions related to the sale of advertisements broadcast on the  Stations after Closing or commencement of the LMA, as applicable, shall be the  responsibility of Buyer. 

      (b) With respect to trade, barter or similar agreements for the sale of time for goods or services ("Barter") assumed by Buyer pursuant to Section 1.1(d), if at Closing the Stations have an aggregate negative or positive Barter balance ( _i.e_., the amount by which the value of air time to be provided by the Stations after the Effective Time exceeds, or conversely, is less than, the fair market value of corresponding goods and services), there shall be no proration or adjustment, unless the negative or positive Barter balance of the Stations as an aggregate exceeds $35,000 per Station, in which event such excess or deficiency, as the case may be, shall be treated either as prepaid time sales or a receivable of Seller, and adjusted for as a proration in Buyers or Sellers favor, as applicable. In determining Barter balances, the value of air time shall be based upon the value of the goods and services provided, and goods and services shall include those to be received by the Stations after Closing _plus_ those received by the Stations before  Closing to the extent conveyed by Seller to Buyer as a part of the Station  Assets. 

    

 (c) No later than three (3) business days prior to the scheduled Closing date, Seller shall provide Buyer with a statement setting forth a reasonably detailed  computation of Sellers reasonable and good faith estimate of the  Adjustment Amount (defined below) as of Closing (the "Preliminary  Adjustment Report"). As used herein, the "Adjustment Amount" means the net amount by which the Purchase Price is to be increased or decreased in accordance with this Section 1.7. If the Adjustment Amount reflected on the  Preliminary Adjustment Report is a credit to Buyer, then the Purchase Price  payable at Closing shall be reduced by the amount of the preliminary Adjustment  Amount, and if the Adjustment Amount reflected on the Preliminary Adjustment  Report is a charge to Buyer, then the Purchase Price payable at Closing shall be increased by the amount of such preliminary Adjustment Amount. For a period of ninety (90) days after Closing, Seller and its auditors and Buyer and its  auditors may review the Preliminary Adjustment Report and the related books and  records of Seller with respect to the Stations, and Buyer and Seller will in  good faith seek to reach agreement on the final Adjustment Amount. If agreement  is reached within such 90-day period, then promptly thereafter Seller shall pay  to Buyer or Buyer shall pay to Seller, as the case may be, an amount equal to  the difference between (i) the agreed Adjustment Amount and (ii) the preliminary Adjustment Amount indicated in the Preliminary Adjustment Report. If agreement is not reached within such 90-day period, then the dispute resolutions of Section 1.7(d) shall apply. 

    

 (d) If the parties do not reach an agreement on the Adjustment Amount within the  90-day period specified in Section 1.7(c), then Seller and Buyer shall select an independent accounting firm of recognized national standing (the  "Arbitrating Firm") to resolve the disputed items. If Seller and Buyer do not agree on the Arbitrating Firm within five (5) calendar days after the end of such 90-day period, then the Arbitrating Firm shall be a nationally  recognized independent accounting firm selected by lot (after excluding one firm designated by Seller and one firm designated by Buyer). Buyer and Seller shall each inform the Arbitrating Firm in writing as to their respective positions with respect to the Adjustment Amount, and each shall make available to the Arbitrating Firm any books and records and work papers relevant to the  preparation of the Arbitrating Firms computation of the Adjustment Amount. The Arbitrating Firm shall be instructed to complete its analysis within thirty (30) days from the date of its engagement and upon completion to inform the parties in writing of its own determination of the Adjustment Amount, the basis for its determination and whether its determination is within the Mid-Range (defined below) or if not, whether it is closer to Buyers or Sellers written determination of the Adjustment Amount. Any determination by the Arbitrating Firm in accordance with this Section shall be final and binding on the parties. Within five (5) calendar days after the Arbitrating Firm delivers to the parties its written determination of the Adjustment Amount, Seller shall pay to Buyer, or Buyer shall pay to Seller, as the case may be, an amount equal to the difference between (i) the Adjustment Amount as determined by the Arbitrating Firm and (ii) the preliminary Adjustment Amount indicated in the Preliminary Adjustment Report. 

     (e) If the Arbitrating Firms determination of the Adjustment Amount is within  the Mid-Range, then Seller and Buyer shall each pay one-half of the fees and  disbursements of the Arbitrating Firm in connection with its analysis. If not,  then (i) if the Arbitrating Firm determines that the written position of Buyer  concerning the Adjustment Amount is closer to its own determination, then Seller shall pay the fees and disbursements of the Arbitrating Firm in connection with its analysis, or (ii) if the Arbitrating Firm determines that the written position of Seller concerning the Adjustment Amount is closer to its own determination, then Buyer shall pay the fees and disbursements of the  Arbitrating Firm in connection with its analysis. As used herein, the term  "Mid-Range" means a range that (i) equals twenty percent (20%) of the  absolute difference between the written positions of Buyer and Seller as to the  Adjustment Amount and (ii) has a midpoint equal to the average of such written  positions of Buyer and Seller. 

    

 (f) Concurrently with the payment of any amount required to be paid under Section 1.7(c) or (d), the payor shall pay the payee interest on such amount for the period from the Closing Date until the date paid at a rate equal to seven percent (7%) per annum. All payments to be made under Section 1.7 shall be paid by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account of the payee at a financial institution in the United States and shall for all purposes constitute an adjustment to the Purchase Price. 

    

 1.8. _Allocation_. After Closing, Buyer and Seller will engage a mutually agreeable appraiser (with the fees and expenses thereof to be equally shared) to allocate the Purchase Price in accordance with the respective fair market values of the Station Assets and the goodwill being purchased and sold in accordance with the requirements of Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Buyer and Seller shall file its federal income tax returns and its other tax returns reflecting the allocation made by such  appraiser pursuant to this Section. 

    

 1.9. _Closing_. The consummation of the sale and purchase of the Station Assets provided for in this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place on the fifth business day after the date of the FCC Consent pursuant to the FCCs initial order (or on such earlier day after such consent as Buyer and Seller may mutually agree), subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Articles 6 or 7 below. The date on which the Closing is to occur is referred to herein as the "Closing Date." 

     1.10. _Governmental Consents_. 

    

 (a) Within five (5) business days of the date of this Agreement, except as provided by Section 1.12, Buyer and Seller shall file an application with the FCC (the  "FCC Application") requesting FCC consent to the assignment of the FCC Licenses to JBC. FCC consent to the assignment of the main station and Tucson translator FCC Licenses to JBC is referred to herein as the "FCC  Consent." Buyer and Seller shall diligently prosecute the FCC Application  and otherwise use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the FCC  Consent as soon as possible. 

    

 (b) If applicable, within ten (10) business days after the date of this Agreement,  Buyer and Seller shall make any required filings with the Federal Trade  Commission and the United States Department of Justice pursuant to the  Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR  Act") with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (including a  request for early termination of the waiting period thereunder), and shall  thereafter promptly respond to all requests received from such agencies for  additional information or documentation. Expiration or termination of any  applicable waiting period under the HSR Act is referred to herein as "HSR  Clearance." 

    

 (c) Buyer and Seller shall notify each other of all documents filed with or received from any governmental agency with respect to this Agreement or the transactions  contemplated hereby. Buyer and Seller shall furnish each other with such  information and assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection  with their preparation of any governmental filing hereunder. The FCC Consent and HSR Clearance are referred to herein collectively as the "Governmental  Consents." 

    

 1.11. _Renewal_. The main station FCC Licenses expire on the dates set forth on _Schedule 1.1(a)_. If due prior to Closing and if not previously filed, then Seller shall timely file FCC renewal applications with respect to the Stations and thereafter prosecute such applications. The parties acknowledge that under current FCC policy, either the FCC will not grant an assignment application while a renewal application is pending, or the FCC will grant an assignment application with a renewal condition. If the FCC Application is granted subject to a renewal condition, then the term "FCC Consent" shall mean FCC consent to the FCC Application and satisfaction of such renewal condition. 

    

 1.12. _Multiple Closings_. To comply with the FCCs multiple ownership rules, prior to Closing with respect to KMTV (Omaha), Buyer must consummate the divestiture of two or more radio stations now owned by it that are located in the market in which KMTV is located. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary: 

    

 (a) the FCC Application shall consist of separate applications (each a "Partial  Application"), one for WFTX and KGUN (the "Primary Application")  which shall be filed at the time provided by Section 1.10(a), and one for KMTV  (the "KMTV Application") which shall be filed no later than the date  on which the application for FCC consent for the last necessary Omaha radio  divestiture is filed; 

     (b) if the Primary Application is granted before the KMTV Application, then the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be consummated in two separate Closings (each a "Partial Closing") as follows: 

    

 (i) at a Closing (the "First Closing") on the fifth business day after the  date of the FCC Consent with respect to the Primary Application (subject to the  satisfaction or waiver of the applicable conditions set forth in Articles 6 or 7 below), (A) Buyer shall pay Seller the Purchase Price less $10,000,000, and (B) Seller shall convey to Buyer all Station Assets other than the KMTV FCC  Licenses; 

    

 (ii) at a second Closing (the "Second Closing") on the fifth business day  after the date of the FCC Consent with respect to the KMTV Application (subject  to the satisfaction or waiver of the applicable conditions set forth in Articles 6 or 7 below), (A) Buyer shall pay Seller the balance of the Purchase Price, and (B) Seller shall convey the KMTV FCC Licenses; and 

    

 (iii) at the First Closing, (A) the Outside Date (defined below) for KMTV shall be  extended to October 15, 2008, provided, however, that if the FCC Consent for  KMTV has not been obtained at least five (5) business days prior to October 15,  2008 due to allegations concerning Sellers licensee qualifications, the  Outside Date shall automatically be extended until five (5) business days after  the date of the FCC Consent with respect to KMTV, and (B) the parties shall  enter into a local programming and marketing agreement with respect to KMTV (the "LMA") in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, and (C) Buyer shall provide Seller the rent-free use of those KMTV Station Assets that are necessary for Seller to comply with its obligations under the KMTV FCC Licenses and the LMA during the term thereof (and, if the LMA term ends without an assignment of the KMTV FCC Licenses to Buyer, then such facility use term may be extended by Seller for one year thereafter); and 

    

 (c) taking into account such multiple closings: 

    

 (i) the terms "Closing," "Closing Date," "FCC Application" and "FCC Consent" shall mean, and refer separately to, the applicable Partial Closing, the date on which such Partial Closing occurs (or is to occur), the applicable Partial Application, and the applicable partial FCC Consent, each as the context requires; 

    

 (ii) with respect to each Partial Closing, the provisions of this Agreement that apply before, at or after a Closing shall apply before, at or after the applicable Partial Closing; 

    

 (iii) for purposes of Section 9.2(b), with respect to each Partial Closing, the maximum liability amount shall be determined based upon the portion of the Purchase Price paid at such Partial Closing; and 

     (iv) any termination of this Agreement prior to the first Partial Closing shall  constitute a termination of this Agreement in its entirety, but after the first  Partial Closing, any termination of this Agreement shall constitute a  termination only with respect to the Station Assets not subject to any prior  Partial Closing, each Partial Closing and each partial payment of the Purchase  Price being final and non-rescindable; _provided, however_ , that if after  the First Closing and before the Second Closing the main station FCC Licenses  for KMTV are revoked or renewal thereof is denied by Final Order (defined below) other than as a result of a breach or default by Buyer under the LMA, then the parties will cooperate in good faith to restore the status quo ante as to KMTV, including but not limited to (a) the reassignment, transfer and conveyance from Buyer to Seller of the Station Assets relating to KMTV that are still in existence as the same were assigned, transferred and conveyed to Buyer at the First Closing; (b) the assumption by Seller and the assignment by Buyer of all liabilities, obligations and commitments of Buyer arising or accruing on or after the date of termination pursuant to the KMTV Station Contracts included in the reconveyed assets, which liabilities, obligations and commitments shall be prorated to the effective date of termination; (c) the offer by Seller of employment to all persons employed by Buyer at KMTV immediately prior to the effective date of termination upon substantially the same terms and conditions and with substantially the same duties and benefits as in effect immediately preceding the effective date of termination; and (d) the repayment by Seller to Buyer of the portion of Purchase Price that is attributable to KMTV. 

    

ARTICLE 2: _SELLER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_

   

 Seller makes the following representations and warranties to Buyer: 

   

 2.1. _Organization_. Seller is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, and is qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the Station Assets are located. Seller has the requisite power and authority to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and all of the other agreements and instruments to be executed and delivered by Seller pursuant hereto (collectively, the "Seller Ancillary Agreements") and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. 

    

 2.2. _Authorization_. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Seller Ancillary Agreements by Seller have been duly authorized and approved by all necessary action of Seller and do not require any further authorization or consent of Seller. This Agreement is, and each Seller Ancillary Agreement when made by Seller and the other parties thereto will be, a legal, valid and binding agreement of Seller enforceable in accordance with its terms, except in each case as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, moratorium, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws affecting or limiting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and except as such  enforceability is subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). 

    

 2.3. _No Conflicts_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 2.3_ and except for the Governmental Consents and consents to assign certain of the Station Contracts, the execution, delivery and performance by Seller of this Agreement and the Seller Ancillary Agreements and the consummation by Seller of any of the  transactions contemplated hereby does not conflict with any organizational  documents of Seller or any law, judgment, order, or decree to which Seller is  subject, or require the consent or approval of, or a filing by Seller with, any  governmental or regulatory authority or any third party. 

     2.4. _FCC Licenses_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 1.1(a)_ : 

    

 (a) Seller is the holder of the FCC Licenses described on _Schedule 1.1(a)_. Seller has delivered true and complete copies of the main station and Tucson  translator FCC Licenses to Buyer. The FCC Licenses are in full force and effect  and have not been revoked, suspended, canceled, rescinded or terminated and have not expired. The issuance by the FCC of each of the main station and Tucson translator FCC Licenses are Final Orders. "Final Order" means an action by the FCC (i) that has not been vacated, reversed, stayed, enjoined, set aside, annulled or suspended, (ii) with respect to which no request for stay, motion or petition for rehearing, reconsideration or review, or application or request for review or notice of appeal or _sua sponte_ review by the FCC is pending, and (iii) as to which the time for filing any such request, motion, petition, application, appeal or notice, and for the entry of orders staying, reconsidering or reviewing on the FCCs own motion has expired. 

    

 (b) Other than matters affecting the television industry generally, Seller has no reason to believe that the FCC will not renew the FCC Licenses in the ordinary course. There is not pending any action by or before the FCC to revoke, suspend,  cancel, rescind or materially adversely modify any of the FCC Licenses (other  than proceedings to amend FCC rules of general applicability). There is not  issued or outstanding, by or before the FCC, any order to show cause, notice of  violation, notice of apparent liability, or order of forfeiture against the  Stations or against Seller with respect to the Stations that could result in any such action. Except as disclosed on _Schedule 1.1(a)_ , Seller has no  knowledge of any petition, complaint, proceeding or other action pending or  threatened at the FCC that materially adversely affects the Stations, other than proceedings affecting the broadcast television industry generally. The Stations are operating in compliance in all material respects with the FCC Licenses, the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the "Communications Act"), and the rules, regulations and policies of the FCC. 

    

 (c) As of the date of this Agreement, Seller has no applications before the FCC  relating to the operation of the Stations. 

    

 (d) Each Station has been assigned a channel by the FCC for the provision of digital  television ("DTV") service, and the FCC Licenses include such  authorization. The Stations are broadcasting the DTV signal in accordance with  such authorization in all material respects. 

    

 (e) Seller does not hold any of the FCC Licenses pursuant to any waiver of any FCC rule, regulation or policy, and there are no matters related to Seller which might reasonably be expected to result in the FCCs denial or delay of approval of the FCC Application. 

    

 2.5. _Taxes_. Seller has, in respect of the Stations business, filed all foreign, federal, state, county and local income, excise, property, sales, use,  franchise and other tax returns and reports which are required to have been  filed by it under applicable law, and has paid all taxes which have become due  pursuant to such returns or pursuant to any assessments which have become  payable. 

     2.6. _Personal Property_. _Schedule 1.1(b)_ contains a list of material items of Tangible Personal Property included in the Station Assets, subject to Section 1.3(c). Except as set forth on _Schedule 1.1(b)_ , Seller has title to the Tangible Personal Property free and clear of liens, claims and encumbrances ("Liens") other than Permitted Liens (defined below). Except as set forth on _Schedule 1.1(b)_ , all material items of Tangible Personal Property are in normal operating condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted. As used herein, "Permitted Liens" means, collectively, the Assumed Obligations, the shared use arrangements described in Section 1.3, liens for taxes not yet due and payable, liens that will be released at or prior to Closing, and such other easements, rights of way, building and use restrictions, exceptions, reservations and limitations that do not in any material respect detract from the value of the property subject thereto or impair the use thereof in the ordinary course of the business of the Stations. 

    

 2.7. _Real Property_. _Schedule 1.1(c_) contains a description of all Real Property included in the Station Assets, subject to Section 1.3(c).

To Sellers knowledge, the Real Property is not subject to any suit for condemnation or other taking by any public authority. 

    

 2.8. _Contracts_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 1.1(d)_ , each of the Station Contracts (including without limitation each of the Real Property Leases) is in effect and is binding upon Seller and, to Sellers knowledge, the other parties thereto (subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally).

Except as set forth in Section 1.12 with respect to KMTV (Omaha), Buyer is legally, financially and otherwise qualified to be the licensee of, acquire, own and operate the Stations under the Communications Act and the rules, regulations and policies of the FCC; there are no facts that would, under existing law and the existing rules, regulations, policies and procedures of the FCC, disqualify Buyer as an assignee of the FCC Licenses or as the owner and operator of the Stations; no waiver of or exemption from any FCC rule or policy is necessary for the FCC Consent to be obtained; and there are no  matters related to Buyer which might reasonably be expected to result in the  FCCs denial or delay of approval of the FCC Application. 

      ARTICLE 4: _SELLER COVENANTS_

   

 4.1. _Seller s Covenants_. Between the date hereof and Closing, except as contemplated by  _Schedule 1.3_ and subject to the LMA (as applicable), and except as permitted by this Agreement or with the prior written consent of Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, Seller shall: 

    

 (a) operate the Stations in the ordinary course of business and in all material respects in accordance with FCC rules and regulations and with all other applicable laws, regulations, rules and orders;

      ARTICLE 5: _JOINT COVENANTS_

   

 Buyer and Seller hereby covenant and agree as follows: 

   

 5.1. _Confidentiality_. Seller (or The Blackstone Group, LLC on behalf of Seller) and Buyer (or an affiliate of Buyer on behalf of Buyer) are parties to a non-disclosure agreement with respect to Seller and its television stations (the "NDA"). To the extent not already a direct party thereto, Seller and Buyer hereby assume the NDA and agree to be bound by the provisions thereof. Without limiting the terms of the NDA, subject to the requirements of applicable law, all non-public information regarding the parties and their business and  properties that is disclosed in connection with the negotiation, preparation or  performance of this Agreement (including without limitation all financial  information provided by Seller to Buyer) shall be confidential and shall not be  disclosed to any other person or entity, except in accordance with the terms of  the NDA. 

    

 5.2. _Announcements_. Prior to Closing, no party shall, without the prior written consent of the other, issue any press release or make any other public announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except to the extent that such party is so obligated by law, in which case such party shall give advance notice to the other. 

    

 5.3. _Control_. Buyer shall not, directly or indirectly, control, supervise or direct the operation of the Stations prior to Closing. Consistent with the Communications Act and the FCC rules and regulations, control, supervision and direction of the operation of the Stations prior to Closing shall remain the responsibility of Seller as the holder of the FCC Licenses. 

    

 5.4. _Risk of Loss_. 

    

 (a) Seller shall bear the risk of any loss of or damage to any of the Station Assets at all times until the Effective Time, and Buyer shall bear the risk of any such  loss or damage thereafter. 

    

 (b) If prior to the Effective Time any item of Tangible Personal Property is damaged  or destroyed or otherwise not in the condition described in Section 2.6 in any  material respect, then: 

    

 (i) Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to repair or replace such item in all material respects in the ordinary course of business, 

    

 (ii) Sellers representations and warranties, and Buyers pre-Closing termination rights and post-Closing indemnification rights, are hereby modified to take into account any such condition, and 

    

 (iii) if such repair or replacement is not completed prior to Closing, then as Buyers sole remedy, the parties shall proceed to Closing and Seller shall repair or replace such item in all material respects after Closing (and Buyer will provide Seller access and any other reasonable assistance requested by Seller with respect to such obligation, provided that such access and assistance shall not be exercised in a manner that unreasonably interferes with the operation of the Stations). 

     (c) If a Station is off the air prior to Closing, then Seller shall use commercially  reasonable efforts to return the Station to the air as promptly as practicable  in the ordinary course of business. Notwithstanding anything herein to the  contrary, if on the day otherwise scheduled for Closing a Station is off the air or an analog main station or Tucson translator is operating with a material  reduction in coverage, then Closing shall be postponed until the date five (5)  business days after the Station returns to the air and, if applicable, such  coverage is substantially corrected, subject to Section 10.1. 

    

 5.5. _Environmental_. 

    

 (a) Seller has provided Buyer with copies of Phase I environmental assessments of certain Real Property sites as shown on _Schedule 1.1(c)_ , if any __(each a "Phase I"). Buyer shall not conduct further environmental assessments of any Real Property prior to Closing.

    

 (b) One of the Phase Is identified the item set forth on _Schedule 1.1(c)_. With respect to such item: 

    

 (i) Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to remediate such item in all  material respects in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with all  applicable environmental laws, 

    

 (ii) Sellers representations and warranties, and Buyers pre-Closing termination rights and post-Closing indemnification rights, are hereby modified to take into account such item, and 

    

 (iii) if such remediation is not completed prior to Closing, then as Buyers sole  remedy, the parties shall proceed to Closing and Seller shall remediate such  item in all material respects and in accordance with all applicable  environmental laws as soon as reasonably practical after Closing (and Buyer will provide Seller access and any other reasonable assistance requested by Seller with respect to such obligation, provided that such access and assistance shall not be exercised in a manner that unreasonably interferes with the operation of the Stations). 

    

 5.6. _Consents_. 

    

 (a) The parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain (i) any third party consents necessary for the assignment of any Station Contract (which shall not require any payment to any such third party), and (ii) execution of reasonable estoppel certificates by lessors under any Real Property Leases requiring consent to assignment (if any), but no such consents or estoppel certificates are conditions to Closing except for the Required Consents (defined below). Receipt of consent to assign to JBG the WFTX (Cape Coral) and KMTV (Omaha) network affiliation agreements without any material adverse conditions and the Stations main tower leases designated with a diamond on _Schedule 1.1(c)_ (if any) is a condition precedent to Buyers obligation to close under this Agreement (the "Required Consents"). 

    

 (b) To the extent that any Station Contract may not be assigned without the consent of any third party, and such consent is not obtained prior to Closing, this  Agreement and any assignment executed pursuant to this Agreement shall not  constitute an assignment of such Station Contract; provided, however, with  respect to each such Station Contract, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate to the  extent feasible in effecting a lawful and commercially reasonable arrangement  under which Buyer shall receive the benefits under the Station Contract from and after Closing, and to the extent of the benefits received, Buyer shall pay and perform Sellers obligations arising under the Station Contract from and after Closing in accordance with its terms. 

     5.7. _Employees_. 

    

 (a) For a period of two (2) years from the date of this Agreement, Buyer shall not,  without the prior written consent of Seller, solicit for employment or induce or attempt to induce to leave Sellers or an affiliate of Sellers  employ, any employees of Seller or its affiliates staffed in Sellers  Indianapolis headquarters or at any other television station owned by Seller or  its affiliates (other than general solicitations not directed solely to any such employees). 

    

 (b) If the Stations include any stations identified in Section 1.3(c) or 1.3(d), then any shared employees shall be allocated as set forth on _Schedule 1.3_. With respect to such shared employees, the terms of this Section 5.7 shall apply only to those who are allocated to Buyer pursuant to _Schedule 1.3_ , and Buyer shall not solicit for employment those who are not allocated to Buyer (other than general solicitations not directed solely to any such employees). 

    

 (c) Seller has provided Buyer a list showing employee positions and annualized pay rates for employees of the Stations. Except as provided by Section 5.7(b), Buyer  shall offer employment to all persons employed by Seller immediately prior to  Closing (or commencement of the LMA, as applicable) (including any hired after  the date hereof in the ordinary course of business or in connection with any  bifurcation of operations contemplated by _Schedule 1.3_ ) upon  substantially the same terms and conditions and with substantially the same  duties and benefits as in effect immediately preceding the Closing, including  but not limited to wages, salaries, commission rate (if applicable) and target  bonuses (all determined on a cash basis before taking into account Sellers  stock compensation program). With respect to each employee who accepts such  offer (collectively, the "Transferred Employees"), at Closing  employment with Seller shall terminate and employment with Buyer shall commence, and Buyer shall retain each such employee on such terms for a period of not less than one (1) year after Closing, unless terminated for cause. Without limiting the foregoing, with respect to any Transferred Employee, Buyer shall be responsible for any applicable severance in accordance with Sellers  severance policy (a copy of which has been provided to Buyer). 

    

 (d) With respect to Transferred Employees, Seller shall be responsible for all  compensation and benefits arising prior to the Effective Time, and Buyer shall  be responsible for all compensation and benefits arising after the Effective  Time. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall grant credit  to each Transferred Employee for all unused vacation accrued as of the Effective Time as an employee of Seller, and Buyer shall assume and discharge  Sellers obligation to provide such leave to such employees (such  obligations being a part of the Assumed Obligations). 

    

 (e) Buyer shall permit Transferred Employees (and their spouses and dependents) to  participate in its "employee welfare benefit plans" (including without limitation health insurance plans) and "employee pension benefit  plans" (as defined in Section 3(1) and 3(2) of ERISA, respectively) in  which similarly situated employees are generally eligible to participate, with  coverage effective immediately upon Closing (and without exclusion from coverage on account of any pre-existing condition), with service with Seller deemed service with the Buyer for purposes of any length of service requirements, waiting periods, vesting periods and differential benefits based on length of service, and with credit under any welfare benefit plan for any deductibles or co-payments paid for the current plan year under any plan maintained by Seller. 

     (f) Buyer shall also permit each Transferred Employee who participates in the Sellers 401(k) plan to elect to make direct rollovers of their account balances into the Buyers 401(k) plan as of Closing, including the direct rollover of any outstanding loan balances such that they will continue to make payments under the terms of such loans under the Buyers 401(k) plan, subject to compliance with applicable law and subject to the reasonable requirements of Buyers 401(k) plan. 

    

 5.8. _Accounting Services_. 

    

 (a) For a period of one hundred twenty (120) days after Closing or commencement of the LMA, as applicable (the "Collection Period"), Buyer shall, without  charge to Seller, use commercially reasonable efforts to collect the A/R in the  ordinary course of business and shall apply all amounts collected from the  Stations account debtors to the invoice specified by the account debtor,  provided that, to the extent no such specification is made by the account  debtor, such amounts collected shall be applied to the oldest, undisputed  account of such debtor. Any amounts relating to the A/R that are paid directly  to Seller shall be retained by Seller. Buyer shall not discount, adjust or  otherwise compromise any A/R and Buyer shall refer any disputed A/R to Seller.  Within ten calendar days after the end of each month, Buyer shall deliver to  Seller a report showing A/R collections for the prior month and Buyer shall make a payment, without offset, to Seller equal to the amount of all such  collections. At the end of the Collection Period, any remaining A/R shall be  returned to Seller for collection. 

    

 (b) During the first fifteen (15) business days after Closing, Buyer shall provide to Seller at no additional cost the services of the Stations business  offices, together with reasonable access to related systems and records, for the purposes of closing the books of the Stations for the period prior to  Closing and of facilitating the distribution of any stock compensation from  Seller to the Stations employees, all in accordance with the procedures  and practices applied by the business offices for periods prior to Closing. 

    

 5.9. _1031 Exchange_. To facilitate a like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Code, Seller may assign its rights under this Agreement (in whole or in part) to a "qualified intermediary" under section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4) of the treasury regulations (but such assignment shall not relieve Seller of its  obligations under this Agreement) and any such qualified intermediary may  re-assign to Seller. If Seller gives notice of such assignment, Buyer shall  provide Seller with a written acknowledgment of such notice prior to Closing and pay the Purchase Price (or such portion thereof as is designated in writing by the qualified intermediary) to or on behalf of the qualified intermediary at  Closing and otherwise reasonably cooperate therewith. 

    

 5.10. _ABC Affiliation_. Buyer acknowledges that the ABC network affiliation for KGUN (Tucson) consists only of a term sheet and not a long-form network affiliation agreement and that Seller has no obligation to negotiate or execute a long-form network affiliation agreement for KGUN. No ABC consent is a condition to Closing under this Agreement.

 (ii) the indemnifying party shall not, without the indemnified partys written  consent, settle or compromise any Claim or consent to entry of any judgment  which does not include the giving by the claimant to the indemnified party of a  release from all liability in respect of such Claim; and 

    

 (iii) in the event that the indemnifying party undertakes defense of or opposition to  any Claim, the indemnified party, by counsel or other representative of its own  choosing and at its sole cost and expense, shall have the right to consult with  the indemnifying party and its counsel concerning such Claim and the  indemnifying party and the indemnified party and their respective counsel shall  cooperate in good faith with respect to such Claim. 

    

ARTICLE 10: _TERMINATION AND REMEDIES_

   

 10.1. _Termination_. Subject to Section 10.3, this Agreement may be terminated prior to Closing as follows: 

    

 (a) by mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller; 

    

 (b) by written notice of Buyer to Seller if Seller breaches its representations or  warranties or defaults in the performance of its covenants contained in this  Agreement and such breach or default is material in the context of the  transactions contemplated hereby and is not cured within the Cure Period  (defined below); 

    

 (c) by written notice of Seller to Buyer if Buyer breaches its representations or  warranties or defaults in the performance of its covenants contained in this  Agreement and such breach or default is material in the context of the  transactions contemplated hereby and is not cured within the Cure Period;  provided, however, that the Cure Period shall not apply to Buyers  obligations to make the Deposit within one (1) business day of the date hereof  and to pay the Purchase Price at Closing; or 

    

 (d) by written notice of Seller to Buyer or Buyer to Seller if Closing does not occur by May 31, 2006 (the "Outside Date"), except as provided by Section 1.12. 

      10.2. _Cure Period_. Each party shall give the other party prompt written notice upon learning of any breach or default by the other party under this Agreement. The term "Cure Period" as used herein means a period commencing on the  date Buyer or Seller receives from the other written notice of breach or default hereunder and continuing until the earlier of (i) twenty (20) calendar days thereafter or (ii) five (5) business days after the scheduled Closing date; provided, however, that if the breach or default is non-monetary and cannot reasonably be cured within such period but can be cured before the date five (5) business days after the scheduled Closing date, and if diligent efforts to cure promptly commence, then the Cure Period shall continue as long as such diligent efforts to cure continue, but not beyond the date five (5) business days after the scheduled Closing date. 

    

 10.3. _Survival_. Neither party may terminate under Sections 10.1(b) or (c) if it is then in material default under this Agreement.Except as provided by Section 10.5, the termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any party of any liability for breach or default under this Agreement prior to the date of  termination. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Sections 1.6 (Deposit) (and Sections 10.4 and 10.5 with respect to the Deposit), 5.1 (Confidentiality) and 11.1 (Expenses) shall survive any termination of this Agreement. 

    

 10.4. _Specific Performance_. In the event of failure or threatened failure by either party to comply with the terms of this Agreement, the other party shall be entitled to an injunction restraining such failure or threatened failure and, subject to obtaining any necessary FCC consent, to enforcement of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance requiring compliance with this Agreement. 

    

 10.5. _Liquidated Damages_. If Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(c) prior to the First Closing, then Buyer shall pay Seller on demand an amount equal to 20% of the Purchase Price by wire transfer of immediately available funds, and such payment shall constitute liquidated damages and the sole remedy of Seller under this Agreement. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Sellers recovery of such amount shall constitute payment of liquidated damages and not a penalty and that Sellers liquidated damages amount is reasonable in light of the substantial but indeterminate harm anticipated to be caused by Buyers material breach or default under this Agreement, the difficulty of proof of loss and damages, the inconvenience and non-feasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy, and the value of the transactions to be consummated hereunder. 

    

ARTICLE 11: _MISCELLANEOUS_

   

 11.1. _Expenses_. Each party shall be solely responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by it in connection with the negotiation, preparation and performance of and compliance with the terms of this Agreement. All governmental fees and charges applicable to any requests for Governmental Consents shall be paid by the party upon whom the applicable governmental authority imposes the fee or charge (or shall be shared equally if not imposed upon either party). Buyer shall be solely responsible for all governmental taxes, fees and charges applicable to the transfer of the Station Assets under this Agreement. Each party is responsible for any commission, brokerage fee, advisory fee or other similar payment that arises as a result of any agreement or action of it or any party acting on its behalf in connection with this Agreement or the transactions  contemplated hereby. 

      11.2. _Further Assurances_. After Closing, each party shall from time to time, at the request of and without further cost or expense to the other, execute and  deliver such other instruments of conveyance and assumption and take such other  actions as may reasonably be requested in order to more effectively consummate  the transactions contemplated hereby. 

    

 11.3. _Assignment_. Except as provided by Section 5.9 (1031 Exchange), neither party may assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party hereto; provided, however, that following the First Closing, Buyer may assign its rights to acquire the KMTV FCC Licenses to an FCC-qualified third party without Sellers consent upon delivery to Seller of a written assumption of this Agreement. No such assignment shall release Buyer from any liability or obligation hereunder. The terms of this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties respective successors and any permitted assigns, and no assignment shall relieve any party of any obligation or liability under this Agreement.

 11.7. _Severability_. If any court or governmental authority holds any provision in this Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable under any applicable law, then, so long as no party is deprived of the benefits of this Agreement in any material respect, this Agreement shall be construed with the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision deleted and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not be affected or impaired  thereby.

This Agreement shall be deemed to have been jointly and equally drafted by Buyer and Seller, and the provisions hereof should not be construed against a party on the grounds that the party drafted or was more responsible for drafting the provision. 

     11.11. _Cooperation_. After Closing, Buyer shall cooperate with Seller in the investigation, defense or prosecution of any action which is pending or threatened against Seller or its affiliates with respect to the Stations, whether or not any party has notified the other of a claim for indemnity with respect to such matter. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall make available its employees to give depositions or testimony and shall furnish all documentary or other evidence that Seller may reasonably request. Seller shall reimburse Buyer for all reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the performance of its obligations under this Section 11.11. 

    

 11.12. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in separate counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original and all of which together will constitute one and the same agreement.
