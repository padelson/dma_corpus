and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Final

days immediately following the Selling Stockholders receipt of such
statement, the Selling Stockholder shall be provided reasonable access to and
shall be permitted to review the working papers relating to such statement.
Such statement shall become final and binding (in its final and binding form,
the " _Statement_ ") upon the parties on the forty-fifth (45th) day following
receipt thereof by the Selling Stockholder unless the Selling Stockholder
gives written notice of its disagreement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to
Purchaser prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify in
reasonable detail the nature and amount of any disagreement so asserted (each,
a " _Disputed Item_ "). If a timely Notice of Disagreement is received by
Purchaser, then the Statement (as revised as contemplated in clause _(x)_ or
_(y)_ below) shall become final and binding upon the parties on the earlier
of (x) the date the parties hereto resolve in writing any differences they
have with respect to any matter specified in the Notice of Disagreement or
(y) the date any matters properly in dispute are finally resolved in writing
by the Independent Auditor (defined below); _provided_ that any items that are
not so disputed shall become final and binding upon the parties on the forty-
fifth (45th) day following the Selling Stockholders receipt of the Statement.
During the forty-five (45) days immediately following the delivery of a Notice
of Disagreement, Purchaser and the Selling Stockholder shall seek in good
faith to resolve in writing any differences which they may have with respect
to any matter specified in the Notice of Disagreement. During such period,
Purchaser shall be provided reasonable access to and shall be permitted to
review the calculations of the Selling Stockholder relating to the Notice of
Disagreement. If, at the end of such forty-five (45) day period, any Disputed
Item specified in the Notice of Disagreement has not been resolved by
the Selling Stockholder and Purchaser, the Selling Stockholder and Purchaser
shall submit to the New York office of Deloitte and Touche LLP (" _Deloitte_ "),
or if Deloitte is unable or unwilling to accept its mandate, any
other independent auditing firm of national recognition mutually selected by
Purchaser and the Selling Stockholder (the " _Independent Auditor_ "), for
review and resolution any such Disputed Items which remain in dispute
(including such partys proposed resolution thereof) and which were properly
included in the Notice of Disagreement. The Independent Auditor shall make a
final determination of each Disputed Item as of immediately prior to the
Closing based solely on presentations by Purchaser and the Selling
Stockholder (and not by independent review), which determination shall be
binding on the parties. The Independent Auditor (i) shall be bound by the
principles set forth in this _Section 3.3_, (ii) shall limit its review to
matters specifically set forth in the Notice of Disagreement, (iii) shall not
assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed
by either party and (iv) shall act as an auditor, not an arbitrator.

(b) The Independent Auditor shall be retained to resolve such dispute
promptly and, in any event, within sixty (60) days from the date the dispute
is submitted to the Independent Auditor. The fees and expenses of the
Independent Auditor acting under this  _Section 3.3_ shall be borne fifty
percent (50%) by Purchaser and fifty percent (50%) by the Selling Stockholder.
The determination as to each Disputed Item as of immediately prior to the
Closing as determined by agreement of the parties or by the Independent
Auditor shall be final and binding on the parties. The Purchase Price as
further adjusted pursuant to this _Section 3.3_ shall be referred to herein
as the " _Final Purchase Price_."

 



17 (c) The Purchase Price shall be adjusted as follows:

 

(i) reduced by the amount, if any, by which the Final Cash on Hand is less
than the Estimated Cash on Hand, or increased by the amount, if any, by which
the Final Cash on Hand exceeds the Estimated Cash on Hand.

(ii) reduced by the amount, if any, by which the Final Net Working Capital is
less than the Estimated Net Working Capital, or increased by the amount, if
any, by which the Final Net Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Net Working
Capital;

 

(iii) reduced by the amount, if any, by which the Final Indebtedness exceeds
the Debt Payoff Amount, or increased by the amount, if any, by which the
Final Indebtedness is less than the Debt Payoff Amount;

(iv) reduced by the amount, if any, by which the Final Transaction Expenses
exceed the Estimated Transaction Expenses, or increased by the amount, if any,
by which the Final Transaction Expenses are less than the Estimated
Transaction Expenses; and

 

(v) reduced by the amount, if any, by which the Final Asset Sale Tax Amount
exceeds the Estimated Asset Sale Tax Amount, or increased by the amount, if
any, by which the Final Asset Sale Tax Amount is less than the Estimated Asset
Sale Tax Amount.

The aggregate amount by which the Purchase Price is adjusted pursuant to
_Sections 3.3(c)(i)_, _(ii)_ , _(iii)_ , _(iv)_ and (v) shall be referred to
herein as the " _Final Adjustment Amount_."

 

(d) In the event that the Final Adjustment Amount results in a reduction to
the Purchase Price, Purchaser and the Selling Stockholder shall cause the
Escrow Agent to release an amount of cash equal to the Final Adjustment Amount
from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount to Purchaser, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing
by Purchaser; _provided_ that, if the Final Adjustment Amount exceeds the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount, then the remaining amount in the
Escrow Account shall be available as recourse and be the sole recourse of
Purchaser and Purchaser shall not be entitled to recover any remaining excess
from any other source.

(e) In the event that the Final Adjustment Amount results in an increase to
the Purchase Price, Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid an amount in cash
equal to such Final Adjustment Amount to the Selling Stockholder.

 

(f) Any payments required under _Sections 3.3(d)_ or _(e)_ shall be made
within five (5) Business Days of the final determination of such amount
pursuant to _Section 3.3(a)_, together with interest thereon at a rate equal
to the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal on the Closing Date
calculated on the basis of the number of days elapsed from the Closing Date
to the date of the payment.

 



18 (g) Following the determination of the Final Adjustment Amount and the payment
of any amount that is required under _Section 3.3(d)_, Purchaser and the
Selling Stockholder shall cause the Escrow Agent to release the remaining
portion (if any) of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount to the Selling
Stockholder within five (5) Business Days.

3.4 _Withholding_. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
payment payable under this Agreement such amounts as Purchaser is required to
deduct and withhold under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign
Tax law applicable to such payment; _provided_ , _however_ , that before
making any such deduction or withholding, Purchaser shall (A) give the
Selling Stockholder commercially reasonable advance notice of Purchasers
intention to make such deduction or withholding (" _Withholding Notice_ ")
(which, to the extent reasonably practicable, shall be at least five (5)
Business Days prior to Closing), and (B) cooperate with Selling Stockholder to
the extent reasonable in efforts to obtain reduction of or relief from such
deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
Purchaser, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction
and withholding was made by Purchaser.

default by Purchaser of any of its covenants, agreements, representations or

shall promptly appeal any adverse determination which is appealable), or (ii)
that would prevent the Closing from occurring as contemplated by this
Agreement on or prior to the Termination Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that

termination set forth above are in addition to any other rights a terminating
party may have under this Agreement, and the exercise of a right of
termination will not be an election of remedies. Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence, in the event that this Agreement is validly terminated in
accordance with _Sections 4.2_ and _4.3_ , then each of the parties shall be
relieved of their duties and obligations arising under this Agreement
after the date of such termination and such termination shall be without
liability to Purchaser, the Company or the Selling Stockholder; _provided_
that no such termination shall relieve any party hereto from liability for any
willful breach of this Agreement and, _provided_ , _further_ , that the
obligations of the parties set forth in _Article X_ and _Article XI_ hereof,
except as otherwise set forth therein, shall survive any such termination and
shall be enforceable hereunder.

(a) Each of Purchaser, the Company and the Selling Stockholder (if necessary)
shall (a) make or cause to be made all filings (including the Foreign

event, within ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement in the
case of all filings required under the HSR Act and, if practicable, within
fifteen (15) Business Days in the case of all other filings (including the
Foreign Filings) required by other Antitrust Laws, (b) comply at the earliest
practicable date with any request under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws
for additional information, documents, or other materials received by each of
them or any of their respective subsidiaries or Affiliates from the FTC, the

or such transactions, and (c) cooperate with each other in connection with any

transaction. Each such party shall furnish to each other all information
required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant to any
applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each such party shall promptly inform the other parties hereto of
any oral communication with, and provide copies of written communications

transaction. No party hereto shall independently participate in any formal
meeting with any Governmental Body in respect of any such filings,

notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Body,
the opportunity to attend and/or participate. Subject to applicable Law, the
parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another in connection with
any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,
opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party
hereto relating to proceedings under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws. Any
party may, as it deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other parties under this
_Section 8.4_ as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers, or directors of the recipient, unless express written permission is

62 (b) Each of Purchaser and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Body
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR
Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal
Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other United States federal or
state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative
or judicial doctrines or other laws that are designed to prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint
of trade (collectively, the " _Antitrust Laws_ "). In connection therewith, if
any Legal Proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as in violation of
any Antitrust Law, each of Purchaser and the Company shall cooperate and use
its reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such Legal Proceeding,
and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is
in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including by pursuing all
available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal, unless by mutual
agreement, Purchaser and the Company decide that litigation is not in their
respective best interests. Each of Purchaser and the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to take such action as may be required to
cause the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act or other
Antitrust Laws with respect to such transactions as promptly as possible after
the execution of this Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the
foregoing, each of Purchaser and the Company agree to use reasonable best
efforts to take promptly steps necessary to avoid or eliminate any impediment
under any Antitrust Laws that may be asserted by any federal, state and local
and non-United States antitrust or competition authority, so as to enable the
parties to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
expeditiously as possible; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
Purchaser be required to (i) effect or commit to effect, by consent decree,
hold separate orders, trust or otherwise, the sale or disposition of any of
the assets or businesses of Purchaser or its Affiliates, (ii) otherwise take
any action that limits the freedom of action of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates with respect to, or its respective ability to retain, any of its
businesses, product lines, or assets or those of its Affiliates or (iii)
propose or accept the imposition of any conditions on Purchaser or its
Affiliates.

 



63 8.5 _Further Assurances_. Subject to, and not in limitation of,  _Section
8.4_, each of Purchaser, the Selling Stockholder and the Company shall use
(and the Company shall cause each of the Subsidiaries to use) its commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) take all actions necessary or appropriate
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) cause
the fulfillment at the earliest practicable date of all of the conditions to
their respective obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by

or disclose (except as required by law or as authorized in writing by

negotiations regarding, provide any information with respect to, assist or
participate in, or facilitate in any other manner any effort or attempt by

and the Company shall, and shall cause each Subsidiary and the officers,
directors, employees, representatives, agents, investment bankers and
Affiliates of the Company and each Subsidiary to, (x) immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any and all contacts, discussions and negotiations with
any Person other than Purchaser and its Affiliates and representatives

third parties and copies of any proposals and the specific terms and
conditions discussed or proposed). The Company and the Selling Stockholder
agree not to, and to cause each Subsidiary not to, without the prior consent
of Purchaser, release any Person from, or waive any provision of, any
standstill agreement or confidentiality agreement to which any Selling
Stockholder, the Company or any Subsidiary is a party.

(a) Purchaser agrees that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall not affect or diminish, and from and after the Closing, Purchaser shall

indemnification existing as of the Closing Date in favor of directors or
officers of the Company and the Subsidiaries (as of the date of this
Agreement) arising by virtue of the organizational documents of the Company
and the Subsidiaries in the form in effect at the date of this Agreement or

for no less than six (6) years from the Closing Date.

 



65 (b) The provisions of _Section 8.9(a)_ (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each person entitled to

be third party beneficiaries of _Section 8.9(a)_, and (ii) are in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise.

 

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall obtain, on terms and conditions
reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, a six (6) year prepaid directors and
officers liability insurance policy or policies ( _i.e._ , tail coverage),

per cent (50%) by the Company, for the purpose of covering acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Closing Date (" _D andO Policy_") with respect to the
directors and officers of the Company and any Subsidiary who are currently
covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy
on terms with respect to such coverage and amount no less favorable to the
Companys directors and officers currently covered by such insurance than

Date. The Company shall include Mattel, Inc. and Purchaser each as an insured
company under such DandO Policy.

8.10 _Preservation of Records_. The Selling Stockholder and Purchaser agree
that each of them shall preserve and keep the records held by them or their
Affiliates relating to the respective businesses of the Company and the
Subsidiaries for a period of seven (7) years from the Closing Date and shall
make such records available to the other as may be reasonably required by such
party, upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, including in
connection with, among other things, any insurance claims by, Legal
Proceedings or Tax audits against, or governmental investigations of the
Selling Stockholder or Purchaser or any of their Affiliates, or in order
to enable the Selling Stockholder or Purchaser to comply with their
respective obligations under this Agreement and each other agreement, document
or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby. Each of the Selling Stockholder
and Purchaser shall be entitled, at its sole cost and expense, to make copies
of the books and records to which they are entitled to access pursuant to this

destroy such records after that time, such party shall first give sixty (60)
days prior written notice to the other and such other party shall have the
right at its option and expense, upon prior written notice given to such party
within that sixty (60) day period, to take possession of the records within
ninety (90) days after the date of such notice.

8.11 _Publicity_. 

(a) None of the Selling Stockholder, the Company or Purchaser shall issue any
press release or public announcement concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby prior to the Closing without obtaining the
prior written approval of the other party hereto, which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless, in the sole judgment of the Selling
Stockholder, the Company or Purchaser, as applicable, disclosure is otherwise
required by applicable Law or by the applicable rules of any stock exchange on
which the Selling Stockholder, the Company or Purchaser lists securities, 
_provided_ that, to the extent required by applicable Law, the party intending
to make such release shall use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent
with such applicable Law to consult with the other party with respect to the
timing and content thereof.

 



66 (b) Each of Purchaser, the Company and the Selling Stockholder agrees that the

required by such Law.

8.12 _Employment and Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Purchaser covenants and agrees that each employee of the Company or any of
the Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing shall, while employed
during the one (1) year period beginning on the Closing Date, receive at least
the same base salary or hourly wage rate as provided to such employee
immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_ , that Purchaser may adjust such
base salary or hourly wage to reasonably reflect any change in
responsibilities or based upon such employees performance following the
Closing. Such individuals who continue their employment with the Company or
the Subsidiaries following the Closing Date are hereinafter referred to as
the " _Continuing Employees_." For a period of one (1) year following the
Closing Date or such longer period of time required by applicable Law (the "
_Benefit Period_ "), Purchaser shall cause the Company and the Subsidiaries
to provide Continuing Employees in each country with employee benefits that
are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to those provided to similarly
situated employees of the Purchaser or those provided to such Continuing
Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date, as determined by Purchaser in
its sole discretion; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for the Benefit Period,
each Continuing Employee shall be eligible to receive severance benefits that
are no less favorable than the severance benefits described on _Schedule
8.12(a)_ ; _provided_ , _further_ , that Purchaser shall retain the sole
discretion to amend, restate, merge or terminate any Company Benefit Plan at
any time after the Closing. Except as otherwise required under applicable Law
or to the extent expressly set forth in a written agreement with the Company
or a Subsidiary, employees of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries,
including Continuing Employees, shall be considered to be employed "at will"
and nothing shall be construed to limit the ability of Purchaser, the Company
or any of the Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any such employee
at any time, subject to any applicable severance and related benefits.

(b) To the extent permitted by Law, Purchaser shall credit each Continuing
Employee with his or her years of service with the Company, the Subsidiaries
and any predecessor entities under each of Purchasers employee benefit plans,
programs and arrangements in which such Continuing Employee participates (the
" _Purchaser Plans_ "), to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was
entitled immediately prior to the Closing to credit for such service under any
similar Company Benefit Plan, for purposes of eligibility, vesting and, to
the extent applicable, calculation of the amount of vacation or severance
benefits. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no service prior to the Closing Date
shall be credited for the purpose of benefit accrual or eligibility for
early retirement benefits or subsidies under any pension benefit plan, nor
for purposes of eligibility under any retiree medical plan, except to the
extent required by any applicable Contract or Law (and then only to the extent
crediting such service would not result in the duplication of benefits). The
Purchaser Plans shall not deny Continuing Employees coverage on the basis of
pre-existing conditions and shall credit such Continuing Employees for any
deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid in the year of initial
participation in the Purchaser Plans.

 



67 (c) If requested by Purchaser at least five (5) business days prior to the
Closing, the Company shall take or cause to be taken all actions necessary to
terminate any or all Company Benefit Plans intended to qualify under Section
401(k) of the Code effective not later than the last Business Day immediately
preceding the Closing. 

(d) The Company shall promptly provide written notice to Purchaser if,
following the date of this Agreement, a Key Service Provider (i) gives or
receives written notice terminating his or her employment or service with the
Company, or (ii) is placed on probation which could reasonably be expected to
result in a termination of employment or service with the Company.

(e) The Company shall promptly, but no later than immediately prior to the
Closing, provide written notice to Purchaser of all terminations of
employment by the Company or the Subsidiaries that have occurred within ninety
(90) days immediately preceding the Closing Date.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall not be interpreted as
an amendment or modification of any employee benefit plan, program, policy,
agreement or arrangement, and, subject to Purchasers obligations set forth
in the third sentence of _Section 8.12(a)_, nothing in this Agreement shall
interfere with or limit Purchasers right to amend or terminate any individual
plan, program, policy or arrangement of Purchaser, the Company or any
Subsidiary, and nothing contained herein shall obligate Purchaser, the Company
or any Subsidiary to maintain or continue any individual plan, program, policy
or arrangement.

 

(g) It is expressly agreed that the provisions of this _Section 8.12_ are not
intended to be for the benefit of or otherwise enforceable by any third
Person, including any employee of the Company, or any collective bargaining
unit or employee organization. Without limiting the foregoing, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall create or imply any obligation on the
part of the Purchaser or Company to provide any continuing employment right
to any individual on or after the Closing.

 



68 8.13 _Code Section 280G_.

 

(a) The Company shall obtain and deliver to Purchaser, prior to the initiation
of the requisite stockholder approval procedure under  _Section 8.13(b)_, a
Parachute Payment Waiver from each Person who is, with respect to the Company,
and/or any ERISA Affiliate, a "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder), as
determined immediately prior to the initiation of the requisite stockholder
approval procedure under _Section 8.13(b)_, and who might otherwise have,
receive or have the right to entitlement to receive a parachute payment under
Section 280G of the Code in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

(b) As soon as practicable following the delivery by the Company to the
Purchaser of the Parachute Payment Waivers, the Company shall submit to the
stockholders of the Company for approval in accordance with Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code any payments and/or benefits that are subject to a
Parachute Payment Waiver, such that such payments and benefits shall not be
deemed to be "parachute payments" under Section 280G, and prior to the
Closing, the Company shall deliver to the Purchaser evidence reasonably
satisfactory to the Purchaser (i) that a Company stockholder vote was
solicited in conformance with Section 280G, and the requisite Company
stockholder approval was obtained with respect to any payments and/or
benefits that were subject to the Company stockholder vote (the " _Section
280G Approval_ ") or (ii) that the Section 280G Approval was not obtained and
as a consequence, pursuant to the Parachute Payment Waiver, such "parachute
payments" shall not be made or provided. The Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Section 280G Approval in a
manner which satisfies all applicable requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B)
of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

(c) The form of the Parachute Payment Waiver and any materials to
be submitted to the Companys stockholders in connection with the Section
280G Approval (the " _Section 280G Soliciting Materials_ ") shall be subject
to review and approval by the Purchaser, which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld. The Company will promptly advise the Purchaser in
writing if at any time prior to the Closing the Company shall obtain Knowledge
of any facts that might make it necessary or appropriate to amend or
supplement the Section 280G Soliciting Materials in order to make statements
contained or incorporated by reference therein not misleading or to comply
with applicable Law.

8.14 _Disclosure Schedules_. The Company and the Selling Stockholder may, at
their option, include in the Schedules items that are not material in order to
avoid any misunderstanding, and such inclusion, or any references to dollar
amounts, shall not be deemed to be an acknowledgement or representation that
such items are material, to establish any standard of materiality or to define
further the meaning of such terms for purposes of this Agreement.

 



69 8.15 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Tax Returns_.

(i) The Selling Stockholder shall file or cause to be filed when due (taking
into account any applicable extensions) all Tax Returns of the Company or any
of the Subsidiaries that are due on or prior to the Closing Date, and shall
pay all Taxes shown due on such Tax Returns. All such Tax Returns shall be
prepared in accordance with the past practice of the Company and the
Subsidiaries, except as otherwise required by applicable Law. At least
thirty (30) Business Days prior to the due date for the filing of any such
Tax Return, the Selling Stockholder shall submit a copy of such Tax Return to
Purchaser for Purchasers review and approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld. Such copy of such Tax Return shall be deemed approved
by Purchaser twenty (20) Business Days after Purchasers receipt of such Tax
Return unless the Purchaser gives written notice of its disagreement, which
notice shall specify in reasonable detail the nature and amount of any
disagreement (" _Notice of Tax Disagreement_ "), to the Selling Stockholder
prior to such date. Any such Notice of Tax Disagreement shall be handled in
the manner prescribed by Section 8.15(a)(viii). The Selling Stockholder shall
provide Purchaser with a complete copy of any such Tax Return filed.

(ii) Purchaser shall file or cause to be filed when due (taking into account
any applicable extensions) all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or
with respect to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries after the Closing Date
for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods, and with respect to each such Tax Return, an
amount equal to (x) all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns minus (y)
the portion of the Asset Sale Tax Amount attributable to each such Tax Return
not to exceed the Final Asset Sale Tax Amount (to the extent such Final Asset
Sale Tax Amount has not previously reduced payments due to the Purchaser from
the Escrow Account under _Sections 8.15(a)(ii)(y)_  or _8.15(a)(iii)(y)_ )
shall be paid out of the available funds (if any) in the Escrow Account in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and _Article X_. All such
Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice of
the Company and the Subsidiaries, except as otherwise required by applicable
Law. Purchaser shall provide the Selling Stockholder with copies of all such
Tax Returns at least thirty (30) Business Days prior to the due date
for filing thereof for the Selling Stockholders review and approval, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld; _provided_ , _however_ ,
Purchaser shall not be required to take a position on any such Tax Return if
such position does not have at least "more likely than not" authority based
upon the written advice of a nationally recognized law firm or an accounting
firm. Such copy of such Tax Return shall be deemed approved by the Selling
Stockholder twenty (20) Business Days after the Selling Stockholders receipt
of such Tax Return unless the Selling Stockholder gives a Notice of Tax
Disagreement to the Purchaser prior to such date. Any such Notice of Tax
Disagreement shall be handled in the manner prescribed by _Section
8.15(a)(viii)_. The Selling Stockholder will take all necessary action to
direct that the payment due to Purchaser under this _Section 8.15(a)(ii)_ be

with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and _Article X_.

 



70 (iii) Purchaser shall file or cause to be filed when due (taking into account
any applicable extensions) all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or
with respect to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries for all taxable periods
that begin on or before and end after the Closing Date (each, a "
_Straddle Period_ "), and with respect to each such Tax Return, an amount
equal to (x) the Selling Stockholders allocable share of Taxes due with
respect to such Tax Return, as determined in accordance with _Section
8.15(a)(iv)_, minus (y) the portion of the Asset Sale Tax Amount attributable
to each such Tax Return not to exceed the Final Asset Sale Tax Amount (to the
extent such Final Asset Sale Tax Amount has not previously reduced payments
due to the Purchaser from the Escrow Account under _Sections 8.15(a)(ii)(y)_
or _8.15(a)(iii)(y)_ ) shall be paid out of the available funds (if any) in
the Escrow Account in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and
_Article X_. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with past practice of the Company and the Subsidiaries, except as otherwise
required by applicable Law. Purchaser shall provide the Selling Stockholder
with copies of all such Tax Returns at least thirty (30) Business Days prior
to the due date for filing thereof for the Selling Stockholders review and
approval solely with respect to the treatment of items attributable to the
period beginning on the first day of the Straddle Period and ending at the
end of the Closing Date, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld;
_provided_ , _however_ , Purchaser shall not be required to take a position on
any such Tax Return if such position does not have at least "more likely than
not" authority based upon the written advice of a nationally recognized law
firm or an accounting firm. Such copy of such Tax Return shall be deemed
approved by the Selling Stockholder twenty (20) Business Days after the
Selling Stockholders receipt of such Tax Return unless the Selling
Stockholder gives a Notice of Tax Disagreement to the Purchaser prior to such
date. Any such Notice of Tax Disagreement shall be handled in the manner
prescribed by  _Section 8.15(a)(viii)_. The Selling Stockholder will take
all necessary action to direct that the payment due to Purchaser under this
_Section 8.15(a)(iii)_ be paid out of the available funds (if any) in the
Escrow Account in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and
_Article X._

(iv) For purposes of determining the Selling Stockholders allocable share of
Taxes attributable to a Straddle Period, Taxes shall be apportioned between
the portion of such period ending at the end of the Closing Date and the
portion beginning after the Closing Date (A) in the case of real property,
business personal property and _ad valorem_ Taxes, by apportioning such Taxes
on a per diem basis, and (B) in the case of all other Taxes, on a closing of
the books basis.

 

(v) For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of Section 8.15(a)(iv) all losses
and deductions relating to the MIP Payments shall be treated as being
allocated to the period ending at the end of the Closing Date.

 



71 (vi) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Selling
Stockholder shall not have review or approval rights over (1) any Tax Returns
filed by the consolidated group of which Mattel is the common parent or (2)
any other Tax Return filed by Mattel or any Affiliate of Mattel that was not
an Affiliate of the Company prior to the Closing Date.

(vii) In the event that (x) the Final Asset Sale Tax Amount exceeds (y) the
Asset Sale Tax Amount, as determined pursuant to this _Section 8.15(a)_, the
Purchaser shall pay to the Selling Stockholder the amount of such excess
within five (5) days of the filing of the final Tax Return relevant to the
determination of Asset Sale Tax Amount that is prepared pursuant to this
_Section 8.15._

(viii) Tax Returns Objection Procedures.

(1) In the event a Notice of Tax Disagreement is timely received by the
party responsible for filing the relevant Tax Return under this _Section
8.15(a)_ (the " _Responsible Party_ "), the Responsible Party and the party
providing the Notice of Tax Disagreement (the " _Objecting Party_ ") shall
work in good faith to resolve any dispute prior to the filing of such Tax
Return.

(2) If the Responsible Party and the Objecting Party are unable to resolve
such dispute before the due date for the filing of the relevant Tax Return,
the Responsible Party shall timely file such Tax Return in the manner it deems
appropriate. Any Taxes relating to such Tax Return that are not in dispute
shall be paid (a) in the case of a Tax Return described in _Section
8.15(a)(i)_, by the Selling Stockholder, and (b) in the case a Tax Return
described in _Sections 8.15(a)(ii)_ or 8.15(a)(iii), out of the Escrow
Account and in accordance with Article X. During the ten (10) days immediately
following the filing of such Tax Return, the Responsible Party and the
Objecting Party shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any
differences which they may have with respect to any matter specified in the
Notice of Tax Disagreement. If, at the end of such ten (10) day period, any
matter specified in the Notice of Tax Disagreement has not been resolved by
the Responsible Party and the Objecting Party, the Responsible Party and the
Objecting Party shall submit such matter to an Independent Auditor. The
Independent Auditor shall make a final determination of each such matter based
solely on presentations by the Responsible Party and the Objecting Party (and
not by independent review), which determination shall be binding on the
parties. The Independent Auditor (i) shall be bound by the principles set
forth in this  _Section 8.15_, (ii) shall limit its review to matters
specifically set forth in the Notice of Tax Disagreement, (iii) shall not
assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed
by either party and (iv) shall act as an auditor, not an arbitrator. The fees
and expenses of the Independent Auditor acting under this _Section
8.15(a)(viii)(2)_ shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by the Responsible Party
and fifty percent (50%) by the Objecting Party. The determination by the
Independent Auditor shall be final and binding on the Responsible Party and
the Objecting Party. Once all matters in the Notice of Tax Disagreement have
been resolved under this _Section 8.15(a)(viii)(2)_, whether by mutual
agreement or by the Independent Auditor (the " _Tax Resolution_ "), the
Responsible Party and the Objecting Party shall make all additional payments
that are necessary so that the net economic result, taking into account the
Tax Resolution, is consistent the parties obligations under _Sections
8.15(a)(i)_ , (ii) or (iii), as applicable, with respect to the filing of Tax
Returns and payment of Taxes.

 



72 (b) _Post-Closing Actions_. For so long as the Selling Stockholder has
an indemnification obligation for Taxes under this Agreement, except to the
extent required by applicable Law, Purchaser and its Affiliates will not,
without the prior written consent of the Selling Stockholder, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, amend any Tax Return filed by or with
respect to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period. Purchaser shall not cause the tax year of HiT Entertainment, Inc. to
end on the Closing Date. In addition, the Purchaser shall not make or cause
to be made an election under Section 338(g) of the Code for any United States
corporation which is a Subsidiary of the Company in connection with the
transactions described under this Agreement.

 

(c) _Cooperation_. The Selling Stockholder and Purchaser shall reasonably
cooperate, and shall cause their respective affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, auditors and representatives reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and
filing all Tax Returns, including maintaining and making available to each
other all records necessary in connection with Taxes and in resolving
all disputes and audits with respect to all taxable periods relating to
Taxes.

(d) _Tax Contests_.

 

(i) If notice of any action, suit, investigation or audit with respect to
Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be received by Purchaser or
any Affiliate, or any other circumstance or situation of which Purchaser or
Affiliate may become aware, for which the Selling Stockholder may reasonably
be expected to be liable pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_ (a " _Tax Claim_ "),
the notified party shall notify the Selling Stockholder in writing of such Tax
Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to give such notice as
provided herein shall not relieve the Selling Stockholder of its obligations
under _Section 10.2_, except to the extent that the Selling Stockholder is
actually and materially prejudiced thereby.

 



73 (ii) Except as provided in _Section 8.15(d)(iii)_, Purchaser shall have the

Selling Stockholder reasonably informed and consult seriously and in good
faith with the Selling Stockholder and its tax advisors with respect to any
issue relating to such audit or dispute; (iii) the Selling Stockholder shall
have the right to consent to the selection of counsel or other advisors in
connection with such Tax Claim which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld; (iv) Purchaser shall provide the Selling Stockholder with copies of
all correspondence, notices and other written materials received from any
Taxing Authorities and shall otherwise keep the Selling Stockholder and its
tax advisors advised of significant developments in the audit or dispute and

(within the meaning of the accuracy-related penalty provisions of Section 6662
of the Code) based upon the written advice of a nationally recognized law firm
or an accounting firm and (B) the adoption of such position could not

or portion thereof beginning after the Closing Date; (vi) Purchaser shall
provide the Selling Stockholder with a copy of any written submission to be
sent to a Taxing Authority prior to the submission thereof and shall give

that the Selling Stockholder or its tax advisors may have with respect
thereto; and (vii) there will be no settlement, resolution, or closing or
other agreement with respect thereto without the consent of the Selling
Stockholder, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. 

(iii) The Selling Stockholder shall have the sole right to control the conduct
of a Tax Claim to the extent such Tax Claim involves a court proceeding,
_provided_ that (i) the Selling Stockholder shall keep the Purchaser
reasonably informed and consult seriously and in good faith with the Purchaser
and its tax advisors with respect to any issue relating to such Tax Claim;
(ii) the Selling Stockholder shall provide the Purchaser with copies of all
correspondence, notices and other written materials received from any Taxing

advised of significant developments in the dispute and of significant
communications involving representatives of the Taxing Authorities; (iii) the
Selling Stockholder shall provide the Purchaser with a copy of any written

or other agreement with respect thereto that could reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the Tax liability of any of the Company, its Subsidiaries,
Purchaser or any of their Affiliates for any period or portion thereof
beginning after the Closing Date without the consent of the Purchaser, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld.

 



74 (iv) Any liability for Taxes for which the Selling Stockholder is
liable under Section 10.2(a) that arises as a result of a Tax Claim shall be
paid in accordance with _Article X_.

(v) The procedures set forth in this _Section 8.15(d)_, to the extent
applicable, will govern all claims for indemnification with respect to Taxes.

 

(e) _Indebtedness_.

(i) The Selling Stockholder shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to
Purchaser by October 21, 2011, or such date as otherwise agreed between the
Selling Stockholder and Purchaser, (the " _Plan Date_ ") a draft qualifying
plan which sets forth, in reasonable detail, the steps, tax commentary for all
relevant jurisdictions and timeline to eliminate all Intercompany Indebtedness
outstanding as of August 31, 2011, with the exception of (i) Intercompany
Indebtedness balances not exceeding $100,000.00, and (ii) any other
Intercompany Indebtedness balances as mutually agreed between the Selling
Stockholder and Purchaser (a " _Qualifying Plan_ "). In calculating any
Intercompany Indebtedness balance payable by one Person (the first Person) to
another Person (the second Person) under this paragraph for purposes of the
$100,000.00 threshold, the amount payable by the first Person to the second
Person (x) shall include the total gross amounts payable by the first Person
to the second Person, and (y) shall not be netted against any amount payable
by the second Person to the first. In the case of (1) Intercompany
Indebtedness payable by a debtor in one country to a creditor in another
country (" _Cross-Border Intercompany Indebtedness_ "), and (2) Intercompany
Indebtedness to be eliminated for less than arms length consideration, the
Qualifying Plan shall provide for the elimination of Intercompany Indebtedness
that was outstanding as of August 31, 2011 by a date that is no later than the
Closing Date. The Selling Stockholder shall provide Purchaser with a final
draft of the Qualifying Plan at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the
commencement of implementation of the Qualifying Plan for Purchasers review
and approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Following the approval and commencement of implementation of the Qualifying
Plan and prior to the Closing Date, the Selling Stockholder and the Company
shall keep Purchaser reasonably informed of progress on implementation of
the Qualifying Plan and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to complete
all steps under the Qualifying Plan scheduled to be completed prior to the
Closing Date, prior to such date.

 



75 (ii) Purchaser shall be liable for all fees, costs and expenses of
the Companys outside accountants and outside legal advisor (as set forth on
_Schedule 8.15(e)(ii)_ hereto) incurred in connection with the development and
implementation of the Qualifying Plan (the " _QP Expenses_ ") and shall pay
all such amounts within thirty days of receipt by Purchaser of reasonably
detailed documentation from such accountants and legal advisor evidencing such
QP Expenses. In the event that, following termination of this Agreement (other
than as a result of a breach of this Agreement by Purchaser), the Company
consummates an Alternative Transaction within twelve months of the date of
such termination, the Selling Stockholder shall be obligated to reimburse
Purchaser for fifty percent (50%) of such QP Expenses paid by Purchaser. In
the event that this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the terms
hereof as a result of a breach of this Agreement by the Company or the Selling
Stockholder, then within two (2) Business Days of such termination, the
Company shall reimburse and pay Purchaser for all QP Expenses paid by
Purchaser prior to such termination and Purchaser shall have no further
obligation to pay any QP Expenses. For purposes of this Agreement, none of
the QP Expenses shall be treated as Transaction Expenses.

(iii) The Selling Stockholder and the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to eliminate Intercompany Indebtedness of the Company or
any of the Subsidiaries to any shareholder of the Company or to any Affiliate
of any such shareholder which is not itself a direct or indirect Subsidiary
of the Company, at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. The
Selling Stockholder shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Purchaser, as
soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, but no later than five
(5) Business Days after the date hereof, a document evidencing the proposed
steps to be taken in order to eliminate all Intercompany Indebtedness payable
by the Company or the Subsidiaries to any shareholder of the Company or to
any Affiliate of any such shareholder which is not itself a Subsidiary (the "
_Debt Elimination_ "). At least thirty (30) Business Days prior to Closing,
the Selling Stockholder shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, drafts of
all agreements and ancillary documents necessary in order to implement the
Debt Elimination steps.

(f) _Check the Box Elections_. Prior to the Closing, the Purchaser may
request in writing that the Company shall make, or shall cause to be made, any
entity classification election under Treas. Reg. 301.7701-3 with respect to
any Subsidiary of the Company that is a "foreign eligible entity" within the
meaning of Treas. Reg. 301.7701-3; _provided_ , _however_ , Purchaser shall
only be required to make such elections following the satisfaction or waiver
of all conditions set forth in _Article IX_ and no such election shall be
required to be made with respect to the Company, SH2, SH2A, SH3, or any
Subsidiary of the Company that is a "controlled foreign corporation" within
the meaning of Section 957 of the Code or any entity set forth on _Schedule
8.15(f)_. The Selling Stockholder must approve such election, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld. All costs relating to such election shall
be borne by Purchaser and Purchaser shall pay such costs to the Company
within five (5) days of demand for payment thereof, and any Losses arising
from or relating to any such election shall not be treated as Transaction
Expenses or subject to indemnification under Section 10.2 of this Agreement.

(g) _Conflicts_. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this
_Section 8.15_ and _Article X_ , the provisions of this _Section 8.15_
shall govern.

 



76 (h) The Selling Stockholder shall provide computations and work papers
supporting its determination of the Estimated Asset Sale Tax Amount to the
Purchaser no later than two (2) Business Days before the Closing Date.

8.16 _Replacement LCs_. On or prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
arrange for replacement letters of credit, performance bonds or such other
sureties as are mutually agreed between the Selling Stockholder and Purchaser
to be in place from and after Closing with respect to the letters of credit
that are listed on _Schedule 8.16_ (the " _Replacement LCs_ "). Any costs or
expenses that are associated with the Replacement LCs shall be paid by
Purchaser and shall not be treated as Transaction Expenses.

8.17 _Excluded Assets and Obligations_. 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company will transfer one hundred percent (100%)
of its interest in the assets listed on  _Schedule 8.17(a)_ (the " _Excluded
Cable Assets_ ") to a third party in which neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has an ownership interest. If, after such transfer, the agreement
listed on _Schedule 8.17(a)_ the (" _Assigned Agreement_ ") will remain in
effect, then in connection with such transfer, the Company will, and will
cause each of the Subsidiaries to, assign to the transferee of the interest
any and all of their respective rights and obligations (including guarantees
of obligations) pursuant to the Assigned Agreement other than the Excluded
Obligations. At least ten (10) days prior to such transfer, the Company will
provide Purchaser with drafts of all documents related to such transfer so
that Purchaser can confirm that: (i) all such documents are in accordance with
the terms of this _Section 8.17_, (ii) if the Assigned Agreement will remain
in effect after such transfer, (A) the transferee assumes all Liabilities of
the Company and the Subsidiaries arising under the Assigned Agreement (other
than the Excluded Obligations) or (B) all such Liabilities are released to the
reasonable satisfaction of Purchaser, (iii) the Company and its Subsidiaries
do not have any continuing Liabilities, covenants or indemnity obligations
(other than related to due authorization or ownership of equity) to the
transferee, (iv) if the Assigned Agreement will remain in effect after
such transfer, such documents obligate the third party (and any transferees)
to provide the Company and its subsidiaries with the benefits of all rights
arising under the provisions of the Assigned Agreement listed on _Schedule
8.17(a)(v)_ and (v) if the Assigned Agreement will remain in effect after
such transfer, such documents contain either (A) a representation from the
transferee that the transferee can satisfy its obligations under the Assigned
Agreement without the assistance of or expense to the Purchaser, the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or (B) a release of such obligations reasonably
satisfactory to the Purchaser.

(b) During the term of the Excluded Obligations, Purchaser agrees to, and
agrees to cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to, perform all of their
respective obligations arising under the Excluded Obligations. During the
term of the Excluded Obligations, Purchaser agrees not to, and, after the
Closing agrees to cause the Company and its Subsidiaries not to, take any of
the actions described on _Schedule 8.17(b)_. The foregoing covenants do not
change or increase the Excluded Obligations or change or decrease any defenses
or reasons to not perform the Excluded Obligations.

 



77 (c) Prior to the Closing, the Company will transfer one hundred percent (100%)
of its interest in the assets listed on _Schedule 8.17(c)_ (the " _Excluded
MIP Assets_ ", and together with the Excluded Cable Assets, the " _Excluded
Assets_ ") to a third party in which neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has an ownership interest. The Company will cause such
transfer to be conducted in a manner consistent with the representations and
warranties provided under _Section 5.14(q)_.

certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the Closing and claims may
be asserted with respect thereto to the extent permitted by this  _Article
X_. Except as set forth in _Section 10.4(b)_, notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary Purchaser or the Selling Stockholder, as the case may be, must
give notice to the other party of any claim for indemnification under
_Sections 10.2(a)(i)_ and _10.3(a)(i)_ in writing setting forth the specific
claim and the basis therefor in reasonable detail prior to the First Escrow
Release Date, _provided_ that with respect to the
Fundamental Representations, and the representations and warranties set forth
in _Sections 5.9_ (Taxes), _5.12_ (Intellectual Property) and _5.18_
(Environmental Matters), notice of any claim with respect to such
representations and warranties must be given prior to the Second Escrow
Release Date. The parties agree that so long as written notice is given on or
prior to the expiration of the survival period set forth in the preceding
sentence with respect to such claim, the representations and warranties with
respect to such breach shall continue to survive, and the right to pursue such
claim shall continue, until such matter is finally resolved, subject to the
limitations on indemnification set forth in  _Section 10.5 _of this
Agreement. Any claim for indemnification with respect to breaches of
representations and warranties not made by Purchaser or the Selling
Stockholder, as applicable, on or prior to that date will be irrevocably
and unconditionally released and waived.

 



81 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, all of the covenants or other agreements of
the parties contained in this Agreement shall survive until fully performed
or fulfilled, unless and to the extent only that non-compliance with such
covenants or agreements is waived in writing by the party entitled to such
performance.

 

10.2 _Indemnification by the Selling Stockholder_.

(a) Subject to _Section 10.5_ hereof, the Selling Stockholder shall indemnify
and hold Purchaser, the Company, and their respective directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates, stockholders, agents, attorneys, representatives,
successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the " _Purchaser Indemnified
Parties_ ") harmless from and against, and pay to or reimburse the applicable
Purchaser Indemnified Party the amount of, any and all Losses:

(i) based upon or resulting from the failure of any of the representations or
warranties made by the Selling Stockholder or the Company in this Agreement
and in any certificate delivered by or on behalf of the Selling Stockholder or
the Company hereunder to be true and correct at and as of the Closing Date;
_provided_ , that for purposes of this _Article X_ , (A) the qualifications
as to materiality and Material Adverse Effect contained in such
representations and warranties shall not be given effect in determining
whether such representation or warranty was true and correct and the amount
of Losses suffered, and (B) the qualifications as to the Knowledge of the
Company contained in the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections
5.9(q)_ , _(r)_ , _(t)_ and  _(y)_ shall not be given effect in determining
whether such representation or warranty was true and correct and the amount of
Losses suffered;

(ii) based upon or resulting from the breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant
or agreement on the part of the Selling Stockholder or the Company;

 

(iii) to the extent the following items are not included in the calculation of
Net Working Capital or have not been taken into account in the calculation of
the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 3.1_: (A) based upon or resulting
from any unpaid Indebtedness incurred prior to the Closing and (B) based upon
or resulting from any unpaid Transaction Expenses;

 



82 (iv) without duplication, based upon or resulting from (A) any Taxes of the
Selling Stockholder (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include any
Taxes required to be paid or borne by the Selling Stockholder pursuant to
Section 11.1), (B) any Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect
to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or for any Straddle Period, to the extent
allocable (as determined pursuant to the last sentence of _Section
8.15(a)(iv)_) to the portion of such Straddle Period beginning before and
ending at the end of the Closing Date), but not including (x) any Taxes of
the Company and the Subsidiaries to which the Settlement Agreement dated as of
July 19, 2011 relates to the extent such Taxes have reduced Cash on Hand and
(y) Taxes relating to the transfer of Excluded Assets under _Section 8.17_,
but only to the extent such Taxes were taken into account in determining the
Final Asset Sale Tax Amount, and (C) the Taxes of any other Person (other than
the Company and its Subsidiaries) for which the Company or any Subsidiary is
liable under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision
of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or
otherwise; and

 

(v) based upon, resulting from or arising under the Assigned Agreement (other
than to the extent relating to the performance of the Excluded Obligations
after the Closing Date) or, without duplication, the transfers contemplated by
_Section 8.17_ of this Agreement (other than in respect of Taxes attributable
thereto which are the subject of  _Section 10.2(a)(iv)(B)_).

(b) Nothing herein shall modify any obligations under common law of Purchaser
or the Purchaser Indemnified Parties to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware
of any event which would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise
thereto.

10.3 _Indemnification by Purchaser_.

(a) Subject to  _Section 10.5_, Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify and
hold the Selling Stockholder and its respective general and limited partners,
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, stockholders, agents, attorneys,
representatives, successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the "
_Selling Stockholder Indemnified Parties_ ") harmless from and against, and
pay to or reimburse the applicable Selling Stockholder Indemnified Parties the
amount of, any and all Losses: 

(i) based upon or resulting from the failure of any of the representations or
warranties made by Purchaser in this Agreement and in any certificate
delivered by or on behalf of the Purchaser hereunder to be true and correct in
all respects when made; and

(ii) based upon or resulting from the breach or nonfulfillment of any
agreement or covenant on the part of Purchaser.

(b) Nothing herein shall modify any obligations under common law of the
Selling Stockholders or the Selling Stockholder Indemnified Parties to
mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be
expected to, or does, give rise thereto.

 



83 10.4 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a third party
claim may be asserted by notice to the party from whom indemnification is
sought.

(b) In the event that any Legal Proceedings shall be instituted, or that any
claim shall be asserted, by any third party in respect of which payment may
be sought under _Sections 10.2_ and _10.3_ hereof (regardless of the
limitations set forth in _Section 10.5_) (an " _Indemnification Claim_ "),
the indemnified party shall promptly cause written notice of the assertion of
any Indemnification Claim of which it has knowledge which is covered by this
indemnity to be forwarded to the indemnifying party. The failure of the
indemnified party to give reasonably prompt notice of any Indemnification
Claim shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the indemnifying partys
obligations with respect thereto except to the extent that the indemnifying
party is materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. The indemnifying
party shall have the right, at its sole option and expense, to be represented
by counsel of its choice, which must be reasonably satisfactory to the
indemnified party, and to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal
with any Indemnification Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against
by it hereunder. If the indemnifying party elects to defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Indemnification Claim which
relates to any Losses indemnified against it hereunder, it shall within 30
days (or sooner, if the nature of the Indemnification Claim so requires)
notify the indemnified party (i) of its intent to do so and (ii) that the
indemnifying party will indemnify the indemnified party from and to the
extent of any Losses the indemnified party may suffer arising out of the
Indemnification Claim; _provided_ that if the Selling Stockholder is the
indemnifying party that defends against, negotiates, settles or otherwise
deals with such Indemnification Claim, the attorneys fees and other Losses
incurred by the Selling Stockholder in connection with such defense,
negotiation, settlement or other dealings shall reduce (by the amount
thereof) the amount recoverable under the Cap by the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties. If the indemnifying party elects not to defend against, negotiate,
settle or otherwise deal with any Indemnification Claim which relates to any
Losses indemnified against hereunder, then the indemnified party may defend
against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Indemnification Claim
as it deems appropriate at the expense of the indemnifying party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall not have the
right to assume control of such defense, and shall pay the fees and expenses
of counsel retained by the indemnified party, if the Indemnification Claim
which the indemnifying party seeks to assume control (i) involves criminal or
quasi-criminal allegations, or (ii) involves a claim which, if adversely
determined, would be reasonably expected to establish a precedent, custom or
practice materially adverse to the continuing business interests or prospects
of the indemnified party or the Company (clauses (i) and (ii), the "
_Exception Claims_ "). If (i) the Indemnification Claim is an Exception Claim
or (ii) the indemnifying party elects not to defend against, negotiate,
settle or otherwise deal with any Indemnification Claim which relates to any
Losses indemnified against hereunder, then, in each case, the indemnified
party may defend against or negotiate such Indemnification Claim as it
deems appropriate at the expense of the indemnifying party. If the
indemnifying party shall assume the defense of any Indemnification Claim, the
indemnified party may participate, at his or its own expense, in the defense
of such Indemnification Claim;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such
indemnified party shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with
separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party if (i) so requested
by the indemnifying party to participate, or (ii) in the reasonable opinion
of outside counsel to the indemnified party, a conflict or potential conflict
exists between the indemnified party and the indemnifying party that would
make such separate representation advisable; and  _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the indemnifying party shall not be required to pay for more than one
such counsel (plus any appropriate local counsel) for all indemnified parties
in connection with any Indemnification Claim. The parties hereto agree to
cooperate fully with each other in connection with the defense, negotiation or
settlement of any such Indemnification Claim. Notwithstanding anything in this
_Section 10.4_ to the contrary, neither the indemnifying party nor the
indemnified party shall, without the written consent of the other party,
settle or compromise any Indemnification Claim or permit a default or consent
to entry of any judgment, other than a settlement solely for monetary damages
where the claimant and such party provide to such other party an unqualified
release from all Liability in respect of the Indemnification Claim.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a settlement offer solely for monetary
damages is made by the applicable third party claimant, and the indemnifying
party notifies the indemnified party in writing of the indemnifying partys
willingness to accept the settlement offer and, subject to the applicable
limitations of _Section 10.5_, pay the amount called for by such offer, and
the indemnified party declines to accept such offer, the indemnified party may
continue to contest such Indemnification Claim, free of any participation by
the indemnifying party, and the amount of any ultimate liability with respect
to such Indemnification Claim that the indemnifying party has an obligation to
pay hereunder shall be limited to the lesser of (A) the amount of the
settlement offer that the indemnified party declined to accept plus
the Losses of the indemnified party relating to such Indemnification Claim
through the date of its rejection of the settlement offer or (B) the aggregate
Losses of the indemnified party with respect to such Indemnification Claim. If
the indemnifying party makes any payment on any Indemnification Claim, the
indemnifying party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all
rights and remedies of the indemnified party to any insurance benefits or
other claims of the indemnified party with respect to such Indemnification
Claim.

 



84 (c) After any final decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a
Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the time in
which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall have been consummated, or the
indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall have arrived at a mutually
binding agreement with respect to an Indemnification Claim hereunder, the
indemnified party shall forward to the indemnifying party notice of any sums
due and owing by the indemnifying party pursuant to this Agreement with
respect to such matter.

 

10.5 _Certain Limitations on Indemnification_.

(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Article X_ , neither the Selling
Stockholder nor Purchaser shall have any indemnification obligations for
Losses under _Sections 10.2(a)(i)_ or  _10.3(a)(i)_ for any individual item,
or group of items arising out of the same event, where the Loss relating
thereto is less than $40,000.00 (the " _De Minimis Amount_ ") and in respect
of each individual item, or group of items arising out of the same event,
where the Loss relating thereto is equal to or greater than the De Minimis
Amount unless the aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds $3,500,000.00
(the " _Deductible_ "), and then only to the extent of such excess;
_provided_ that neither the De Minimis Amount nor the Deductible shall apply
to (x) inaccuracies in or breaches (i) of the Fundamental Representations,
(ii) of the representations or warranties contained in  _Sections 5.9_
(Taxes) and _5.20_ (Affiliated Transactions) or (iii) relating to fraud or
intentional misrepresentation, or (y) Losses under _Sections 10.2(a)(ii)_
through _Section 10.2(a)(v)_ or  _Section 10.3(a)(ii)_. The aggregate
indemnification that is payable by the Selling Stockholder or the Purchaser
pursuant to this _Article X_ shall not exceed the Escrow Amount and any
accrued interest and/or investment income thereon (less applicable Taxes on
such income) (the " _Cap_ ") and, notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, (A) the sole recourse of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties with
respect to the Selling Stockholders obligations under _Section 10.2_ shall
be limited to the funds that are on deposit in the Escrow Account from time to
time, except with respect to inaccuracies or breaches relating to fraud or
intentional misrepresentation, and (B) the Purchaser Indemnified Parties may
not make any claim pursuant to this _Article X_ after the Second Escrow
Release Date. For the avoidance of doubt, if the amount of a claim by any
Purchaser Indemnified Party exceeds the remaining available amount in the
Escrow Account, then such remaining amount shall be the sole recourse of the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties and, except with respect to inaccuracies or
breaches relating to fraud or intentional misrepresentation, the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover any remaining
excess from any other source. Subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement and
any paid or pending claims pursuant to this _Article X_ , (1) fifty percent
(50%) of the Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be released from the Escrow
Account on the First Escrow Release Date, and (2) the remainder of the
Indemnification Escrow Amount and any accrued interest and/or investment
income thereon (less Taxes, if any, required to be deducted under the Escrow
Agreement) shall be released from the Escrow Account on the Second Escrow
Release Date.

 



85 (b) In no event shall any party have any liability to the other (including
under this  _Article X_ ) for any special or punitive damages or diminution
in value of property or equity, other than any such damages actually awarded
to a third party in connection with an Indemnification Claim relating to a
pending or threatened claim, demand or proceeding asserted by a third party
against the indemnified party. The indemnified party shall not use "multiple
of profits" or "multiple of cash flow" or any similar valuation methodology in
calculating the amount of any Losses.

(c) The Selling Stockholder shall not have any liability pursuant to _Section
10.2(a)_ based upon or resulting from the capitalization of the Notes.

10.6 _Calculation of Losses_. The amount of any Losses for
which indemnification is provided under this _Article X_ shall be (i) net of
any amounts actually recovered by the indemnified party under insurance
policies or otherwise with respect to such Losses and (ii) calculated on an
After-Tax Basis.

 



86 10.7 _Special Rule for Fraud and Intentional Misrepresentation_.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Article X_ to the contrary, in the event of
any breach of a representation or warranty by any party hereto that results
from intentional misrepresentation or constitutes fraud, by or on behalf of
the Selling Stockholder (including, without limitation, any intentional
misrepresentation or fraudulent act committed by any officer, director,
employee or agent of the Selling Stockholder, the Company or any Subsidiary in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents), on the one hand, or Purchaser,
on the other hand, then (a) such representation or warranty will survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and will continue in full force and effect
for the period of the applicable statute of limitations without regard to any
survival period set forth in _Section 10.1(a)_ and  _(b)_ the limitations
set forth in _Section 10.5_ shall not apply to any Loss that the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties or the Selling Stockholder Indemnified Parties,
respectively, may suffer, sustain or become subject to, as a result of,
arising out of, relating to or in connection with any such breach, and (c)
none of such Losses shall count towards the satisfaction of the Cap.

10.8 _Manner of Payment_. Any indemnification pursuant to this _Article X_ to
be made to any Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be satisfied through the
funds (if any) that remain in the Escrow Account. The Selling Stockholder and
Purchaser shall, within three (3) business days after the determination of the
amount thereof, whether pursuant to a final judgment, settlement or agreement
among the parties hereto, deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow
Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release the appropriate portion of the
Escrow Amount to an account designated by Purchaser. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, with respect to each claim
for indemnification for matters relating to inaccuracies or breaches relating
to fraud or intentional misrepresentation, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
shall have the option to seek indemnification from (x) the Escrow Account or
(y) the Selling Stockholder.

10.9 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_.

 

(a) The Selling Stockholder and Purchaser agree to treat any payment made
pursuant to _Section 8.15_ or this _Article X_  as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for federal, state, local and foreign income and chargeable
gains tax purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

10.10 _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing, sole and exclusive
remedy for any breach or failure to be true and correct, or alleged breach or
failure to be true and correct, of any representation or warranty, covenant
or agreement in this Agreement, except for breaches and failures relating to
fraud and intentional misrepresentation, shall be indemnification in
accordance with this _Article X_ except for the Companys and the Selling
Stockholders rights as against the Guarantor with respect to a failure of
Purchaser to perform the Obligations as set forth in _Section 11.12_. In
furtherance of the foregoing, the parties hereby waive, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, any and all other rights, claims and causes of
action (including rights of contributions, if any) known or unknown, foreseen
or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future, that it may
have against the Selling Stockholder or Purchaser, as the case may be,
arising under or based upon any federal, state or local Law (including any
such Law relating to environmental matters or arising under or based upon any
securities Law, common Law or otherwise) other than in respect of fraud or
intentional misrepresentation.

 



87 ARTICLE XI

MISCELLANEOUS

11.1 _Payment of Sales, Use or Similar Taxes_. All sales, use, transfer,
intangible, recordation, documentary stamp or similar Taxes or charges, of any
nature whatsoever, applicable to, or resulting from, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne fifty per cent (50%) by
the Selling Stockholder and fifty per cent (50%) by Purchaser; _provided_ ,
_however_ , the Selling Stockholder shall bear all such Taxes based upon,
resulting from or arising from the transfer of the Excluded MIP Assets
contemplated by Section 8.17(c) of this Agreement. The Selling Stockholder
and the Purchaser undertake to each other not to execute any instrument of
transfer in respect of the Shares in the UK.

 

11.2 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each of the
Selling Stockholder, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other, shall bear
its own respective expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and each other agreement, document and instrument
contemplated by this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. If the transactions
contemplated hereby are not consummated, the Company shall pay all of its own
expenses (including attorneys and accountants fees and expenses) in
connection with the negotiation of this Agreement, and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by the Agreement.

11.3 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process_.

(a) THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMIT TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION
OF ANY FEDERAL OR STATE COURT LOCATED WITHIN THE BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN OF THE
CITY, COUNTY AND STATE OF NEW YORK OVER ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND EACH
PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF SUCH DISPUTE OR
ANY SUIT, ACTION PROCEEDING RELATED THERETO MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN
SUCH COURTS. THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY OBJECTION WHICH THEY MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER
HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUCH DISPUTE BROUGHT IN SUCH COURT OR ANY
DEFENSE OF INCONVENIENT FORUM FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF SUCH DISPUTE. EACH OF THE
PARTIES HERETO AGREES THAT A JUDGMENT IN ANY SUCH DISPUTE MAY BE ENFORCED IN
OTHER JURISDICTIONS BY SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER PROVIDED BY
LAW.

 



88 (b) Each of the parties hereto hereby consents to process being served by any
party to this Agreement in any suit, action or proceeding by the delivery of
a copy thereof in accordance with the provisions of _Section 11.7_.

11.4 _Specific Performance_. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that
the breach of this Agreement would cause irreparable damage to the other
parties hereto and that no party hereto will have an adequate remedy at law.
Therefore, prior to the Closing, the obligations off the parties hereto under
this Agreement shall be enforceable by a decree of specific performance issued
by any court of competent jurisdiction, and appropriate relief may be applied
for and granted in connection therewith. Such remedies shall, however, be
cumulative and not exclusive and shall be in addition to any other remedies
which any party may have under this Agreement or otherwise.

 

11.5 _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement (including the
schedules and exhibits hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement represent
the entire understanding and agreement between the parties hereto with respect
to the subject matter hereof and thereof. This Agreement can be amended,
supplemented or changed, and any provision hereof can be waived, only by
written instrument making specific reference to this Agreement signed by the
party against whom enforcement of any such amendment, supplement, modification
or waiver is sought. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement,
including any investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to
constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein. The waiver
by any party hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not
operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as
a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any
party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

11.6 _Governing Law_. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS, AND
ALL CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT) THAT MAY BE
BASED UPON, ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE NEGOTIATION,
EXECUTION, TERMINATION, PERFORMANCE OR NONPERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT
(INCLUDING ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED
TO ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY MADE IN OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT
OR AS AN INDUCEMENT TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT), SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE
INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS CONFLICTS OF
LAW PRINCIPLES.

11.8 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy,
all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 

11.9 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement shall create or be deemed to
create any third party beneficiary rights in any person or entity not a party
to this Agreement except as provided in _Section 8.9(b)_ or below.
No assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or obligations hereunder may
be made by either the Selling Stockholder or Purchaser, directly or indirectly
(by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto and any attempted assignment without the required
consents shall be void; _provided_ that, without such consent, Purchaser may
transfer or assign all or any portion of this Agreement, or any of the other
Transaction Documents, to (i) one or more of its Affiliates (a " _Purchaser
Assignee_ "), or (ii) any of its or any Purchaser Assignees lenders as
collateral security; _provided_ _further_ that no such transfer or assignment
will relieve Purchaser of any of its obligations hereunder. No assignment of
any obligations hereunder shall relieve the parties hereto of any such
obligations. Upon any such permitted assignment, the references in this
Agreement to Purchaser shall also apply to any such assignee unless the
context otherwise requires. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the rights,
interests or obligations of any of the Guarantor or the Company under _Section
11.2_ may not be assigned by either such party, except as otherwise set forth
therein.

 



91 11.10 _Non-Recourse_. No past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, controlling Person, Affiliate,
attorney or representative of the Selling Stockholder or the Company or any of
their respective Affiliates in their capacity as such shall have any liability
for any obligations or liabilities of the Selling Stockholder or the Company
under this Agreement of or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason
of, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

 

11.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this
Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute
one and the same agreement.

11.12  _Limited Guarantee of Mattel, Inc_.

(a) _Limited Guarantee_. To induce the Selling Stockholder to enter into
this Agreement, Mattel (the " _Guarantor_ ") absolutely, unconditionally and
irrevocably guarantees (the " _Guarantee_ ") to the Selling Stockholder, but
only up to the Guarantee Cap (as defined below), the obligations of Purchaser
to pay any amounts payable by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement (the "
_Obligations_ "), except that the Guarantor reserves the right to assert
defenses which Purchaser may have to payment of any Obligation. The
maximum amount payable by the Guarantor under this _Section 11.12_ shall not
exceed seven hundred and twenty million dollars ($720,000,000.00) (the "
_Guarantee Cap_ "), it being understood that this _Section 11.12_ may not be
enforced without giving effect to the Guarantee Cap. If Purchaser fails to pay
any Obligation when due, then all of Guarantors liabilities to the Selling
Stockholder hereunder with respect to such Obligation become immediately due
and payable and the Selling Stockholder may at any time and from time to time
take any and all actions available hereunder or under applicable Law to
collect such Obligation from the Guarantor. In furtherance of the foregoing,
the Guarantor acknowledges that the Selling Stockholder may, in its sole
discretion, bring and prosecute a separate action or actions against the
Guarantor for the full amount of the Obligations then due and payable (subject
to the Guarantee Cap) regardless of whether any action is brought against
Purchaser.

 



92 (b) _Nature of Guarantee_. The Selling Stockholder shall not be obligated to
file any claim relating to any Obligations in the event that Purchaser
becomes subject to a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, and the
failure of the Selling Stockholder to so file shall not affect the Guarantors
obligations hereunder;  _provided_ that if the Selling Stockholder fails to
file any such claim on or prior to ten (10) Business Days prior to the
deadline for filing such claims, the Selling Stockholder hereby authorizes the
Guarantor to file such claim on behalf of the Selling Stockholder. The
Guarantors liability hereunder is absolute, unconditional, irrevocable and
continuing irrespective of any modification, amendment or waiver of or any
consent to departure from any other provisions of this Agreement that may be
agreed to by Purchaser unless otherwise consented to by the Selling
Stockholder; _provided_ that no modification or amendment of any of the
Obligations shall be enforceable against the Guarantor unless consented to by
the Guarantor. In the event that any payment to the Selling Stockholder in
respect of the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any
reason whatsoever, the Guarantor shall remain liable hereunder with respect to
its Obligations as if such payment had not been made. This is an
unconditional guarantee of payment and not of collectibility.

(c) _Change in Obligations, Certain Waivers_. The Guarantor agrees that the
Selling Stockholder may at any time and from time to time, without notice to
or further consent of the Guarantor, extend the time of payment of any
Obligations, and may also make any agreement with Purchaser or with any other
Person interested in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Guarantor), for the extension, renewal, payment, compromise,
discharge or release thereof, in whole or in part, or for any modification of
the terms thereof or of any agreement between the Selling Stockholder and
Purchaser, or any such other Person without in any way impairing or affecting
any obligations under this Guarantee; _provided_ that no modification
or amendment of any of the Obligations shall be enforceable against the
Guarantor unless consented to by the Guarantor. The Guarantor agrees that its
obligations hereunder shall not be released or discharged, in whole or in
part, or otherwise affected by (i) the failure or delay of the Selling
Stockholder to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy
against Purchaser or any other Person interested in the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) any change in the time, place or manner
of payment of any Obligations or any rescission, waiver, compromise,
consolidation or other amendment or modification of any of the other terms of
this Agreement or any other agreement evidencing, securing or
otherwise executed by Purchaser and the Selling Stockholder in connection
with any Obligations ( _provided_ that no modification or amendment of any of
the Obligations shall be enforceable against the Guarantor unless consented to
by the Guarantor); (iii) the addition, substitution, discharge or release of
any entity or other Person now or hereafter liable with respect to the
Obligations or otherwise interested in the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (iv) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership
of Purchaser or any other Person now or hereafter liable with respect to the
Obligations or otherwise interested in the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Guarantor); (v) except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, the existence of any claim, set-off or other right which the
Guarantor may have at any time against Purchaser or the Selling Stockholder or
any of their respective Affiliates in connection with the Obligations; (vi)
the adequacy of any other means the Selling Stockholder may have of obtaining
payment related to the Obligations; or (vii) any insolvency, bankruptcy,
reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting Purchaser or any other
Person interested in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Guarantor). To the fullest extent permitted by Law and subject
to the express provisions of this Agreement, the Guarantor hereby
expressly waives any and all rights or defenses arising by reason of any Law
which would otherwise require any election of remedies by the Selling
Stockholder. The Guarantor waives promptness, diligence, notice of the
acceptance of this Guarantee and of its Obligations, presentment, demand for
payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor and protest, notice of
the incurrence of any Obligations and all other notices of any kind (other
than notices required pursuant to this Agreement), all defenses which may be
available by virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium Law or other similar
Law now or hereafter in effect, any right to require the marshalling of assets
of Purchaser or any Person interested in the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and all suretyship defenses generally (other than fraud by the
Selling Stockholder or any of its Affiliates, defenses to the payment of any
Obligations that are available to Purchaser under this Agreement or breach by
the Selling Stockholder of its obligations under this Agreement). The
Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and indirect
benefits from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that the
waivers set forth in this  _Section 11.12_ are knowingly made in
contemplation of such benefits.

 



93 (d) _Assignment_. Neither the Guarantor nor the Selling Stockholder may assign
its rights, interests or obligations hereunder to any other Person (except by
operation of law) without the prior written consent of the other parties
hereto.

(e) _Continuing Guarantee_. The provisions of this _Section 11.12_ shall
remain in full force and effect and shall be binding on the Guarantor, its
successors and assigns until all amounts payable under the provisions of this
_Section 11.12_ have been indefeasibly paid and satisfied in full, and shall
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by the Selling Stockholder and its
successors, transferees and assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
provisions of this _Section 11.12_ shall terminate and the Guarantor shall
have no further obligations under this _Section 11.12_ as of the earlier of
(i) the Closing and (ii) the date on which the Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms other than pursuant to _Section 4.2(d)_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Selling Stockholder or
any of its Affiliates asserts in any litigation or other proceeding that the
provisions of _Section 11.12(a)_ limiting the Guarantors liability to the
Cap or the provisions of _Section 11.12(f)_ are illegal, invalid or
unenforceable in whole or in part, or asserting any theory of liability
against any Affiliate of the Guarantor or Purchaser or, other than its right
to recover from the Guarantor for up to the amount of the Obligations (subject
to the Cap and the other limitations described herein), the Guarantor or
Purchaser, with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and such assertion is not immediately and irrevocably waived in writing and
withdrawn for all purposes (and, in no event later than five (5) Business Days
after receipt of written notice from Guarantor to the Selling Stockholder
expressly stating that this Guarantee shall terminate unless all such
assertions are waived and withdrawn in accordance with this _Section
11.12(e)_), then the obligations of the Guarantor under this _Section 11.12_
shall terminate _ab initio_ and be null and void.

 



94 (f) _No Recourse_.

 

(i) The Selling Stockholder acknowledges that the sole assets of Purchaser are
cash in a _de minimus_ amount and its rights under this Agreement, and that
no additional funds are expected to be contributed to Purchaser until
immediately prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding anything that may be
expressed or implied in this _Section 11.12_ or any document or instrument
delivered contemporaneously herewith, the Selling Stockholder acknowledges and
agrees that, except in the case of fraud, neither it nor any of its Affiliates
has any right of recovery against, and no liability shall attach to,
the former, current or future stockholders, directors, officers, employees,
agents, Affiliates or assignees of the Guarantor (collectively, the "
_Guarantor Affiliates_ "), or, other than its right to recover from the
Guarantor for up to the amount of the Obligations (subject to the Cap and the
other limitations described herein), the Guarantor or otherwise, whether by or
through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through a claim by or
on behalf of Purchaser against a Guarantor Affiliate or the Guarantor, by the
enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by
virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable law, or otherwise; _provided_
, _however_ , that in the event the Guarantor (i) consolidates with or merges
with any other person and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and other assets to any person such that the sum of the
Guarantors remaining net assets is less than the Cap, then, and in each such
case, the Selling Stockholder may seek recourse, whether by the enforcement of
any judgment or assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or by
virtue of any statute, regulation or other applicable law, against such
continuing or surviving entity or such person (in either case, a " _Successor
Entity_ "), as the case may be, but only to the extent of the liability of
the Guarantor hereunder and subject to the Cap. Subject to the immediately
following sentence, the Selling Stockholder hereby covenants and agrees that
it shall not institute, directly or indirectly, and shall cause its Affiliates
not to institute, any proceeding or bring any other claim arising under, or
in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
otherwise relating hereto, against a Guarantor Affiliate (other than
Purchaser) or, other than its right to recover from the Guarantor for up to
the amount of the Obligations (subject to the Cap and the other limitations
described herein), the Guarantor or a Successor Entity.

 

(ii) Recourse against the Guarantor under the provisions of this _Section
11.12_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Selling Stockholder and
its Affiliates against the Guarantor and any Guarantor Affiliate (other than
Purchaser) in respect of any liabilities or obligations arising under, or in
connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
otherwise relating hereto. Nothing set forth in this _Section 11.12_ shall
confer or give or shall be construed to confer or give to any Person other
than the Guarantor and the Selling Stockholder (including any Person acting
in a representative capacity) any rights or remedies against any Person other
than the Selling Stockholder and the Guarantor as expressly set forth herein.

 



95 (iii) For all purposes of this _Section 11.12_, pursuit of a claim against a
Person by the Selling Stockholder or any of its Affiliates shall be deemed to
be pursuit of a claim by the Selling Stockholder. A Person shall be deemed to
have pursued a claim against another Person if such first Person brings a
legal action against such Person, adds such other Person to an existing legal
proceeding, or otherwise asserts a legal claim of any nature against such
Person.

(iv) The Selling Stockholder acknowledges that the Guarantor is agreeing to
enter into this _Section 11.12_ in reliance on the provisions set forth in
this _Section 11.12(f)_. This  _Section 11.12(f)_ shall survive termination
of this Agreement.

11.13 _Release of the Company_. As a material inducement to the Purchasers
willingness to enter into and perform this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents and to purchase the Shares for the consideration to be paid or
provided to the Selling Stockholder in connection with such purchase, the
Selling Stockholder hereby releases and forever discharges the Company and
each of its individual, joint or mutual, past, present and future
representatives, affiliates, stockholders, controlling persons, Subsidiaries,
successors and assigns (individually, a " _Releasee_ " and collectively, "
_Releasees_ ") from any and all claims, demands, proceedings, causes of
action, orders, obligations, Contracts, debts and liabilities whatsoever,
whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, both at law and in
equity, which the Selling Stockholder now has, has ever had or may hereafter
have against the respective Releasees arising contemporaneously with or prior
to the Closing Date or on account of or arising out of any matter, cause or
event occurring contemporaneously with or prior to the Closing Date, but not
including any rights to indemnification or reimbursement from the Company for
their roles as directors and/or officers of the Company or the Subsidiaries,
whether pursuant to their respective charter, by-laws or any other charter
documents, Contract or otherwise and whether or not relating to claims pending
on, or asserted after, the Closing Date; and provided, that nothing
contained herein shall operate to release any obligation of (i) Purchaser or
Mattel arising under this Agreement or (ii) the Company arising under the
other Transaction Documents.
