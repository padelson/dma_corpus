indemnification is sought. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:8%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">(b) In the event that any Legal Proceedings shall be instituted, or that any claim shall be
asserted, by any third party in respect of which payment may be sought under <U>Sections&nbsp;10.2</U> and <U>10.3</U> hereof (regardless of the limitations set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;10.5</U>) (an &#147;<U>Indemnification Claim</U>&#148;), the
indemnified party shall promptly cause written notice of the assertion of any Indemnification Claim of which it has knowledge which is covered by this indemnity to be forwarded to the indemnifying party. The failure of the indemnified party to give
reasonably prompt notice of any Indemnification Claim shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the indemnifying party&#146;s obligations with respect thereto except to the extent that the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced as a result
of such failure. The indemnifying party shall have the right, at its sole option and expense, to be represented by counsel of its choice, which must be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, and to defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with any Indemnification Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against by it hereunder. If the indemnifying party elects to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Indemnification Claim which relates to
any Losses indemnified against it hereunder, it shall within 30 days (or sooner, if the nature of the Indemnification Claim so requires) notify the indemnified party (i)&nbsp;of its intent to do so and (ii)&nbsp;that the indemnifying party will
indemnify the indemnified party from and to the extent of any Losses the indemnified party may suffer arising out of the Indemnification Claim; <U>provided</U> that if the Selling Stockholder is the indemnifying party that defends against,
negotiates, settles or otherwise deals with such Indemnification Claim, the attorneys&#146; fees and other Losses incurred by the Selling Stockholder in connection with such defense, negotiation, settlement or other dealings shall reduce (by the
amount thereof) the amount recoverable under the Cap by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties. If the indemnifying party elects not to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Indemnification Claim which relates to any Losses
indemnified against hereunder, then the indemnified party may defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Indemnification Claim as it deems appropriate at the expense of the indemnifying party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume control of such defense, and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel retained by the indemnified party, if the Indemnification Claim which the indemnifying party seeks to assume control
(i)&nbsp;involves criminal or quasi-criminal allegations, or (ii)&nbsp;involves a claim which, if adversely determined, would be reasonably expected to establish a precedent, custom or practice materially adverse to the continuing business interests
or prospects of the indemnified party or the Company (clauses (i)&nbsp;and (ii), the &#147;<U>Exception Claims</U>&#148;). If (i)&nbsp;the Indemnification Claim is an Exception Claim or (ii)&nbsp;the indemnifying party elects not to defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Indemnification Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against hereunder, then, in each case, the indemnified party may defend against or negotiate such Indemnification Claim as it deems
appropriate at the expense of the indemnifying party. If the indemnifying party shall assume the defense of any Indemnification Claim, the indemnified party may participate, at his or its own expense, in the defense of such Indemnification Claim;
<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that such indemnified party shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party if (i)&nbsp;so requested by the indemnifying party to participate, or
(ii)&nbsp;in the reasonable opinion of outside counsel to the indemnified party, a conflict or potential conflict exists between the indemnified party and the indemnifying party that would make such separate representation advisable; and
<U>provided</U>, <U>further</U>, that the indemnifying party shall not be required to pay for more than one such counsel (plus any appropriate local counsel) for all indemnified parties in connection with any Indemnification Claim. The parties
hereto agree to cooperate fully with each other in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Indemnification Claim. Notwithstanding anything in this <U>Section&nbsp;10.4</U> to the contrary, neither the indemnifying party
nor the indemnified party shall, without the written consent of the other party, settle or compromise any Indemnification Claim or permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment, other than a settlement solely for monetary damages where the
claimant and such party provide to such other party an unqualified release from all Liability in respect of the Indemnification Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a settlement offer solely for monetary damages is made by the applicable third
party claimant, and the indemnifying party notifies the indemnified party in writing of the indemnifying party&#146;s willingness to accept the settlement offer and, subject to the applicable limitations of <U>Section&nbsp;10.5</U>, pay the amount
called for by such offer, and the indemnified party declines to accept such offer, the indemnified party may continue to contest such Indemnification Claim, free of any participation by the indemnifying party, and the amount of any ultimate
liability with respect to such Indemnification Claim that the indemnifying party has an obligation to pay hereunder shall be limited to the lesser of (A)&nbsp;the amount of the settlement offer that the indemnified party declined to accept plus the
Losses of the indemnified party relating to such Indemnification Claim through the date of its rejection of the settlement offer or (B)&nbsp;the aggregate Losses of the indemnified party with respect to such Indemnification Claim. If the
indemnifying party makes any payment on any Indemnification Claim, the indemnifying party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all rights and remedies of the indemnified party to any insurance benefits or other claims of the
indemnified party with respect to such Indemnification Claim. </FONT></P>

Purchaser to pay any amounts payable by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement (the &#147;<U>Obligations</U>&#148;), except that the Guarantor reserves the right to assert defenses which Purchaser may have to payment of any Obligation. The maximum

the amount of the Obligations (subject to the Cap and the other limitations described herein), the Guarantor or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of Purchaser against a
Guarantor Affiliate or the Guarantor, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable law, or otherwise; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that in the event the

person such that the sum of the Guarantor&#146;s remaining net assets is less than the Cap, then, and in each such case, the Selling Stockholder may seek recourse, whether by the enforcement of any judgment or assessment or by any legal or equitable
proceeding or by virtue of any statute, regulation or other applicable law, against such continuing or surviving entity or such person (in either case, a &#147;<U>Successor Entity</U>&#148;), as the case may be, but only to the extent of the
liability of the Guarantor hereunder and subject to the Cap. Subject to the immediately following sentence, the Selling Stockholder hereby covenants and agrees that it shall not institute, directly or indirectly, and shall cause its Affiliates not

right to recover from the Guarantor for up to the amount of the Obligations (subject to the Cap and the other limitations described herein), the Guarantor or a Successor Entity. </FONT></P>
