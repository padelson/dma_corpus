iii This MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT, dated as of July 18, 2014, is
made and entered into by and among Severstal Columbus Holdings, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (" _Seller_ "), Severstal Dearborn, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (the " _Company_ ") and AK Steel
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Purchaser_ "). Capitalized terms not
otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in _Section 9.01_
hereof.

 

WHEREAS, Seller owns all of the currently issued and outstanding Units of
Membership Interest of the Company (the " _Membership Interests_ ");

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Seller proposes to sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser desires to
purchase from Seller, the Membership Interests; and

WHEREAS, in order to induce Purchaser to enter into this Agreement, OAO
Severstal and its Affiliate, OOO Mining Holding Company, have delivered to
Purchaser, substantially concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, a duly executed guaranty of Sellers and, prior to the Closing,
the Companys obligations and performance in connection with this Agreement in
the form attached as _Annex A_ (the " _Guaranty_ ").

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

PURCHASE AND SALE OF MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS; CLOSING

1.01 _Purchase and Sale of Membership Interests_. Upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, Purchaser
shall purchase from Seller, and Seller shall sell, assign, transfer and
deliver to Purchaser, the Membership Interests free and clear of any
Encumbrances.

 

1.02 _Closing_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
the purchase and sale of the Membership Interests (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, 155
N. Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60606 or at such other place as Purchaser
and Seller mutually agree, commencing at 10:00 A.M. local time, on the later
of (i) the tenth (10th) Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of
each of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (excluding conditions that,
by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but the Closing shall
be subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) and (ii) the
fourteenth (14th) Business Day following the day on which Purchaser shall
have received (and its Financing Sources shall have had access to) the
Required Information, or at such other time or date as Purchaser and Seller
may mutually agree (the " _Closing Date_ "); provided, however, that if the
Closing Date would otherwise be (x) after August 15, 2014 but prior to
September 15, 2014, (y) after November 21, 2014 but prior to   December 12, 2014, or (z) after December 19, 2014 but prior to January 16,
2015, Purchaser may elect, by written notice delivered to Seller no later than
five (5) Business Days prior to the date that would otherwise be the Closing
Date, to delay the Closing to September 15, 2014, December 12, 2014 or January
16, 2015, respectively, or such earlier date as may be set forth in
such written notice, except that the Closing on such date shall be subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_
as of such date (excluding conditions that, by their terms, cannot be
satisfied until the Closing, but the Closing shall be subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions). Unless Purchaser and Seller agree
otherwise, the Closing shall be deemed to have occurred at 12:01 a.m. local
time in each applicable jurisdiction on the Closing Date; provided, however,
that for the purposes of _Article V_ the Closing shall occur on delivery of
the items listed in Section 1.02(b).

 

(b) At the Closing:

 

(i) Purchaser shall deliver (A) to Seller, the Initial Purchase Price, less
(x) the Intercompany Indebtedness Amount, (y) the Bank of America Credit
Agreement Amount and (z) the amount of Indebtedness at Closing, if any,
associated with the item set forth on _Schedule 2.06(c)_ , as determined by
the Company in concurrence with its independent public accountants or other
"Big 4" independent accounting firm, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, free and clear of any withholdings or deductions, to an account
designated by Seller by written notice delivered to Purchaser at least two
(2) Business Days before the Closing Date, (B) to the lenders under the Bank
of America Credit Agreement, the Bank of America Credit Agreement Amount, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, free and clear of
any withholdings or deductions, to an account designated pursuant to the
payoff letters contemplated by _Section 1.02(b)(ii)_, (C) to Seller (or
Sellers designee), the Intercompany Indebtedness Amount by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, free and clear of any withholdings or
deductions, to an account designated by Seller by written notice delivered to
Purchaser at least two (2) Business Days before the Closing Date and (D) to
Seller, such documents regarding the corporate organization, existence,
authorization and similar matters relating to Purchaser as Seller may
reasonably request; and

 

(ii) Seller shall deliver to Purchaser (A) a duly executed amendment to the
limited liability company agreement of the Company, evidencing the transfer
of the Membership Interests to Purchaser and any certificates evidencing the
Membership Interests duly endorsed in blank, or accompanied by stock powers
duly executed in blank, (B) written resignations from each director or member
of the board of managers of the Company and its Subsidiaries (except that, in
the case of Double Eagle, Seller shall only deliver to Purchaser resignations
for the members of the management committee designated by the Company)
as requested by the Purchaser not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, (C) such documents regarding the corporate organization,
existence, authorization and similar matters relating to Seller and the
Company and its Subsidiaries as Purchaser may reasonably request, (D) payoff
letters from Bank of America to the Company, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Purchaser, reflecting the payment in full of all obligations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries under the Bank of America Credit Agreement
and any necessary lien discharges, UCC termination statements or other
releases as may be reasonably required by Purchaser to

 



2  evidence the satisfaction of all obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries under the Bank of America Credit Agreement, (E) an affidavit of
non-foreign status satisfying the requirements of Section 1445 of the Code
from the Parent, in the form of _Annex B_ , (F) a written release from the
Seller, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, for the benefit of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, in the form of  _Annex C_ , including a statement of
the Intercompany Indebtedness Amount and certification of the satisfaction
thereof and (G) a permanent electronic copy of all documents, records,
agreements, statements, files or other information which Seller has made
available to Purchaser, effective as of the Closing Date, in the transaction
data room maintained by Merrill Corporation.

 

1.03 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(a) Initial Purchase Price.

 

(i) For purposes of determining the Initial Purchase Price payable by
Purchaser at the Closing, not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a statement
setting forth an estimate of Net Working Capital (determined in accordance
with _Section 1.03(b)(ii)_), including in reasonable detail the basis for
the computation thereof, as of 12:01 a.m. local time on the Closing Date (the
" _Effective Time_ "). Such statement shall be referred to as the " _Estimated
Closing Statement_ ". The Seller and the Company shall consider in good faith
any comments by the Purchaser on the Estimated Closing Statement.

(ii) The " _Initial Purchase Price_ ", as used in this Agreement, shall mean
an amount equal to $700,000,000, _plus_ the amount by which, if any, the Net
Working Capital set forth on the Estimated Closing Statement (the "
_Estimated Net Working Capital_ ") is greater than $300,000,000; or, as the
case may be, _minus_ the amount by which, if any, the Estimated Net Working
Capital is less than $300,000,000.

 

(b) Final Purchase Price Adjustments.

 

(i) As soon as practicable, but not later than sixty (60) days, after the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Seller a statement
setting forth the Net Working Capital (determined in accordance with _Section
1.03(b)(ii))_, including in reasonable detail the basis for the computation
thereof, as of the Effective Time (the " _Closing Statement_ "). During such
sixty (60) day period and any other periods of review, investigation or
dispute provided for in this _Section 1.03(b)_, Purchaser and Seller shall
reasonably cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Closing
Statement, the Protest Notice and the Final Closing Statement, comply with
their obligations under the last sentence of _Section 1.03(b)(iii)_, and, in
the case of Purchaser, comply with its obligations under  _Section 4.09(b)_,
and, during any period in which Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, is not so
cooperating or complying with such obligations, the other party may elect to
extend the sixty (60) day period or other period of review, investigation or
dispute, as applicable, for an amount of time equal to such period of non-
cooperation or non-compliance.

 



3 (ii) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Net Working Capital_ " means
the difference between the current assets (other than income tax receivables)
and current liabilities (other than (A) the current portion of outstanding
Indebtedness (excluding the current portion of capitalized leases), including
accrued interest, and (B) income tax payables) of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries, including MSC, determined in accordance with and
calculated in the manner set forth on _Annex D_ hereto. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, Net Working Capital shall not include any
cash and/or cash equivalents of the Company and/or MSC as of the Effective
Time that is subsequently "swept" or otherwise removed by Seller or any of its
Affiliates from the Company and/or MSC prior to the Closing.

(iii) Seller shall have sixty (60) days after delivery of the
Closing Statement by Purchaser to review the same and to deliver to Purchaser
a written statement thereon (the " _Protest Notice_ "). The Protest Notice
shall list those items included in the Closing Statement, if any, to which
Seller takes exception and Sellers proposed adjustment, including in
reasonable detail the basis for the computation thereof. The failure of Seller
to deliver such Protest Notice within such sixty (60) day period following
delivery of the Closing Statement will constitute Sellers acceptance of the
Closing Statement as prepared by Purchaser. If Seller timely delivers a
Protest Notice to Purchaser and Purchaser does not give Seller notice of its
objections to such Protest Notice within thirty (30) days following receipt
of such Protest Notice, Purchaser shall be deemed to have accepted the Closing
Statement as adjusted by Seller in the Protest Notice. If Purchaser objects to
the Protest Notice within said thirty (30) day period following delivery to
Purchaser of the Protest Notice (the adjustments to which Purchaser objects
being referred to herein as the " _Contested Adjustments_ "), Seller and
Purchaser shall attempt to resolve the dispute regarding the Contested
Adjustments. If a final resolution thereof is not reached within ten (10)
Business Days of Sellers receipt of Purchasers objections thereto, either
Seller or Purchaser shall thereafter be entitled to refer any remaining
Contested Adjustments to an Independent Accounting Firm acceptable to Seller
and Purchaser or, in the absence of agreement on the Independent Accounting
Firm within five (5) days of notice by either Seller or Purchaser of intent
to initiate such a referral, to PricewaterhouseCoopers (who will thereafter
be considered the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "). If there is such a
referral to an Independent Accounting Firm, each of Seller and Purchaser
agree, if requested by the Independent Accounting Firm, to execute a
reasonable engagement letter and shall submit to the Independent Accounting
Firm not later than ten (10) Business Days after its appointment, a written
statement summarizing its position on the Contested Adjustments, together
with such supporting documentation as it deems necessary. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall (i) act as an arbitrator to determine, based solely on
the materials submitted and presentations by Seller and Purchaser, and not by
independent review, only the Contested Adjustments that have not been settled
by negotiation, (ii) employ the terms and definitions of this Agreement when
making its decision, (iii) assign values to each Contested Adjustment no
higher than the highest amount, nor lower than the lowest amount, proposed by
either party with respect to such Contested Adjustment and (iv) be instructed
to render its decision within forty-five (45) days of its appointment or as
soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable. The decision of the Independent
Accounting Firm as to the Contested Adjustments shall be final and binding on,
and shall not be subject to 

 



4  appeal by, Seller or Purchaser and may be entered and enforced by any court
having jurisdiction. The Closing Statement shall be revised as necessary to
reflect the decision of the Independent Accounting Firm and the other
modifications thereto previously agreed by Seller and Purchaser. Each of
Seller and Purchaser shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection with
the resolution of the Closing Statement, and the fees and expenses of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be shared equally by Seller, on the one
hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand. The term " _Final Closing Statement_
," as used in this Agreement, shall mean the definitive Closing
Statement accepted by Purchaser or Seller or agreed to by Purchaser and
Seller or the definitive Closing Statement resulting from the determinations
made by the Independent Accounting Firm in accordance with this _Section
1.03(b)(iii)_ (in addition to those items theretofore accepted by Purchaser
or Seller or agreed to by Purchaser and Seller). Purchaser and Seller shall
furnish to each other and to the Independent Accounting Firm such work papers
and other documents and information relating to the Contested Adjustments as
the Independent Accounting Firm may request and are available to that party
(or its independent public accountants) and shall be afforded the opportunity
to present to the Independent Accounting Firm any material related to the
disputed items and to discuss the items with the Independent Accounting Firm.

(iv) Within seven (7) days of the determination of the Final Closing
Statement:

(1) if the Net Working Capital set forth on the Final Closing Statement (the
" _Final Net Working Capital_ ") is greater than the Estimated Net Working
Capital, Purchaser shall pay to Seller the amount of such excess; or

 

(2) if the Final Net Working Capital is less than the Estimated Net Working
Capital, Seller shall pay to Purchaser the amount of such shortfall.

(v) Any payments pursuant to this _Section 1.03(b)_ shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated
by Seller or Purchaser, as applicable.

1.04 _Purchase Price Allocation_.

(a) Within ninety (90) days following the determination of the Final Closing
Statement in accordance with  _Section 1.03(b)_, Purchaser shall provide
Seller with a statement containing an allocation (the " _Purchase Price
Allocation_ ") of the total consideration paid for the Membership Interests
among the assets of the Company (and, to the extent applicable, the assets of
its Subsidiaries). The Purchase Price Allocation shall be prepared in
accordance with the provisions of Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder.

 

(b) If, within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the Purchase Price
Allocation, Seller notifies Purchaser that it reasonably objects to the
Purchase Price Allocation, the parties shall attempt to resolve the dispute in
good faith. If Purchaser and Seller reach a written agreement within fifteen
(15) days after receipt of Sellers notice by Purchaser, the Purchase
Price Allocation, including any amendment thereto under such agreement, shall
be deemed to be

 



5  the final Purchase Price Allocation. If the parties are unable to reach a
written agreement within the period described in the preceding sentence, the
dispute shall be submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm and resolved by
the Independent Accounting Firm within fifteen (15) days after submission.

(c) The Purchase Price Allocation made pursuant to this _Section 1.04_ shall
be binding on Purchaser and Seller for all Tax purposes. The parties and their
respective Affiliates shall (i) timely file all Tax Returns required to be
filed in connection with the Purchase Price Allocation (including IRS Form
8594 and any supplemental filings to reflect any revisions to the Purchase
Price Allocation) and (ii) prepare and file all Tax Returns and determine all
Taxes in a manner consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation, except as
may otherwise be required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of
Section 1313(a) of the Code (or similar provision of state, local or foreign
Tax law). Each of the parties shall notify the other party if it (or any of
its Affiliates) receives notice that any Taxing Authority proposes any
allocation that differs from the Purchase Price Allocation.

 

(d) In the event that there is any adjustment to the total consideration paid
for the Membership Interests following the delivery of the Purchase Price
Allocation, Purchaser shall revise the Purchase Price Allocation to reflect
any such adjustment using the same methodology as used in the preparation of
the initial Purchase Price Allocation, consistent with the principles set
forth in this _Section 1.04_ and shall promptly deliver such revised
Purchase Price Allocation to Seller. Any dispute between the parties regarding
such revised Purchase Price Allocation shall be resolved in accordance with
the procedures of  _Section 1.04(b)_.

ARTICLE II

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY AND SELLER

 

Except as otherwise set forth in a disclosure schedule relating to any
particular representation and warranty (collectively, the " _Disclosure
Schedules_ "), the Company and Seller represent and warrant to Purchaser that
all of the statements contained in this _Article II_ are true. Each exception
set forth in the Disclosure Schedules is identified by reference to, or has
been grouped under a heading referring to, a specific individual section or
subsection of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the inclusion of
any item referenced in one section or subsection of the Disclosure Schedules
shall be deemed to refer to another section or subsection of the Disclosure
Schedules (and accordingly to the applicable sections or subsections of this
Agreement which contain references to the Disclosure Schedules), whether or
not an explicit cross-reference appears, if the applicability of such item to
such other section or subsection is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure. An exception set forth in the Disclosure Schedules identified by
reference to, or grouped under a heading referring to, a specific individual
section or subsection of this Agreement shall be deemed an exception to such

Purchaser hereby represents and warrants to Seller as follows:

 

3.01 _Organization and Authority of Purchaser_. Purchaser is a corporation
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State
of Delaware. Purchaser has all necessary corporate power and authority to own,
operate or lease the properties and assets now owned, operated or leased by it
and to carry on its business as conducted at the date of this Agreement.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Purchaser, the performance by
Purchaser of its obligations hereunder and the consummation by Purchaser of
the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all
requisite corporate action on the part of Purchaser. This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by Purchaser, and assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by Seller and the Company, this Agreement is a legal,
valid and binding obligation of Purchaser, enforceable against it in
accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance and other
similar laws of general application affecting enforcement of creditors
rights generally.

3.02 _No Conflicts_. Assuming that all Consents contemplated by _Section
3.03_ have been obtained, the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by Purchaser does not and shall not: (a) violate, conflict with or
result in the breach of the Organizational Documents of Purchaser; (b)
conflict with or violate any Law or Governmental Order applicable to
Purchaser; or (c) violate, conflict with or result in a breach of or default
under (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both), result in the
acceleration of obligations under, create in any party the right to terminate
or modify, or require any notice, consent or waiver under any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any Contract to which Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound except, in the
case of clauses (b) or (c), as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
materially and adversely affect the ability of Purchaser to carry out its
obligations under, and to consummate the transactions contemplated by, this
Agreement.

3.03 _Governmental Consents and Approvals_. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by Purchaser does not and shall not require any
Consent of any Governmental Authority, except: (a) pursuant to the
requirements of the HSR Act or under the antitrust or competition Laws of
applicable foreign jurisdictions; or (b) to the extent failure to obtain such
Consent would not prevent or materially delay the consummation by Purchaser of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



22 3.04 _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, no Action by or against Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates are pending or, to the Knowledge of the Purchaser,
threatened, challenging the legality, validity or enforceability of this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

3.05 _WARN Act_. To the extent that Purchaser may engage in a "plant closing"
or "mass layoff," as such terms are defined in the WARN Act or any similar
applicable state or local Law, the Purchaser will comply with the requirements
of the WARN Act or any similar applicable state or local Law.

 

3.06 _Permits_. To the Knowledge of Purchaser, Purchaser (or its successor or
permitted assigns) shall be as the owner of the Company qualified to hold any
permits necessary to operate the Company.

3.07 _Qualification to Purchase_.

 

(a) The Membership Interests are being acquired for investment purposes only
for Purchasers own account and not with a view to or in connection with any
distribution, reoffer, resale, or other disposition not in compliance with the

(b) Purchaser is an "Accredited Investor" as defined in the Securities Act and
Regulation D thereunder. Purchaser is experienced and sophisticated with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and has such
knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so as to be capable
of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the
Membership Interests. Purchaser is aware that it must bear the economic risk
of its investment in the Company for an indefinite period of time because the
Membership Interests have not been registered under the Securities Act or
under any applicable state securities laws and, therefore, cannot be sold
unless the Membership Interests are subsequently registered under the
Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws or pursuant to an
exemption thereunder. Purchaser recognizes the highly speculative nature and
risk of loss associated with an investment in the Company and that it could
suffer a complete loss of the investment and is capable of bearing the
economic risks of such loss.

 

3.08 _Union Matters_. Effective as of the Closing, Purchaser shall cause (a)
the Company to continue to honor, on and following the Closing, the terms and
conditions of employment set forth in the collective bargaining agreement

and conditions of employment were governed by the Dearborn CBA immediately
before the Closing (the " _Dearborn Union Employees_ "); and (b) Mountain
State Carbon, LLC (" _MSC_ ") to honor, on and following the Closing, the

Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International
Union (the " _USW_ "), with respect to employees of MSC who are represented by
the USW before the Closing (the "MSC Union Employees" and with the Dearborn
Union Employees, collectively, the " _Union Employees_ ").

expenses of any broker, finder or investment banker entitled to any
brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or

such of its affiliates or branches as it deems appropriate, including Credit

Lenders have committed to provide on the terms and conditions set forth
therein the amounts set forth therein to Purchaser for the purpose of funding
the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Bridge Financing_ "). Such

by Purchaser and (to the Knowledge of the Purchaser) the Lenders. There are no
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the

Commitment Letter.

shall be able to pay their respective debts as they become due and (ii) shall
own assets which have a fair saleable value (if sold as an entirety with
reasonable promptness in an arms length transaction under present conditions)
in excess of their Liabilities (whether liquidated, unliquidated,
fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured,
unsecured or otherwise). Immediately after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, the Purchaser and each of its Subsidiaries (including,
after Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) shall have adequate capital
to carry on their respective businesses. No transfer of property is being made
and no obligation is being incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud
either present or future creditors of the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries
(including, after Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries).

 

3.12 _Investigation by Purchaser_. Purchaser has conducted its own independent
review and analysis of the businesses, assets, condition, operations and
prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries and acknowledges that it has
been provided access to the properties, premises and records of the Company
and its Subsidiaries for this purpose. In entering into this Agreement,

employees, agents or advisors in any "data room" or otherwise, except as
expressly and specifically covered by a representation or warranty set forth
in _Article II_.

 

3.13 _Disclaimer_. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THIS _ARTICLE III_ , NONE OF
PURCHASER, ITS RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS,
DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES OR REPRESENTATIVES MAKE OR HAVE MADE ANY OTHER

26 (k) not enter into, assume, assign, cancel, terminate, renew, modify, release
or amend any Lease, Material Contract, or contract that would be a Material
Contract or a Lease if in effect on the date hereof, or assign, compromise,
release or waive any rights thereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
in this Agreement shall preclude MSC from finalizing a collective bargaining
agreement with the USW on terms and conditions no less favorable to MSC than
those set forth on _Schedule 3.08_ or preclude the Company or MSC from
satisfying any effects bargaining obligations as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement with respect to the Union Employees;

(l) not make any capital expenditures other than pursuant to the Companys

any Action (including any permit appeal, consent decree or modification or
amendment to a consent decree) involving an amount individually or in the
aggregate in excess of $2,000,000 or the imposition of injunctive or equitable
relief against the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, including those
Actions listed on _Schedule 4.01(m)(2)_ ; and

(n) not authorize any of, or commit or agree to take any of the foregoing
actions.

 

4.02 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing (or until the earlier termination
of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.01_), upon reasonable
notice, Seller shall, and shall cause the Company to: (i) afford Purchaser and
its authorized Representatives reasonable access to the properties and Books
and Records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including to the extent such
access is required for the Purchaser to secure insurance for the Company and
its Subsidiaries for the period after Closing; (ii) furnish to the officers,
directors, employees, and authorized Representatives of Purchaser such
additional financial and operating data and other information regarding the
business of the Company, including information concerning properties,
contracts and personnel (or copies thereof) as Purchaser may from time to time
reasonably request; and (iii) provide such cooperation as may be reasonably
requested by the Purchaser in order to facilitate the integration and
transition of ownership of the business and operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries at the Closing;  _provided_ , _however_ , that any such access
or furnishing of information shall be scheduled and coordinated through the
Person(s) set forth on _Schedule 4.02_ and shall be conducted at Purchasers
expense, during normal business hours and in such a manner as not to
unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the business of the
Company; _further_ _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries shall be required to disclose any information to
Purchaser if such disclosure would be reasonably likely to: (x) jeopardize any
attorney-client or other legal privilege; or (y) contravene any applicable
Laws, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date
hereof provided that the Company has used reasonable best efforts to seek a
waiver of any such restriction or otherwise seek to provide access to such
information in a manner that does not violate such restriction.

 



27 (b) Notwithstanding anything expressed or implied in this Agreement, Seller
shall not be required to disclose, to any Person, any Tax information or Tax
Return that does not relate solely and exclusively to the Company and its
Subsidiaries (it being understood that, in the case of any consolidated,
combined or unitary Tax Return that includes the Company and any other
Person, Seller shall provide Purchaser, at Purchasers request, with pro forma
Tax Returns relating solely to the Company and its Subsidiaries).

 

(c) The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of March 14, 2014,
between Purchaser and Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), shall
continue in full force and effect until the Closing, at which time such
Confidentiality Agreement and the obligations of Purchaser under this _Section
4.02(c)_ shall terminate (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
provisions that purport to survive termination of the Confidentiality
Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that, from and after the Closing, except
as would have been permitted under the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its officers, directors,
employees, authorized Representatives and Affiliates to, treat and hold as
confidential, and not disclose to any Person, information related to the
discussions and negotiations between the parties regarding this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby and all confidential information relating
to Seller. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall be permitted to use
such confidential information to the extent reasonably necessary in
connection with the Financing. If this Agreement is, for any reason,
terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue
in full force and effect.

 

(d) Nothing provided to Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement shall in any way
amend or diminish Purchasers obligations under the Confidentiality
Agreement. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that any information provided to
Purchaser by or on behalf of Seller or the Company or any of their respective
officers, directors, employees or authorized representatives shall be
subject to the terms and conditions of its Confidentiality Agreement.

(e) From and after the Closing, the Seller shall, and shall cause
its Representatives to, keep all documents, materials, records and other
information that it has or has obtained prior to or after the Closing
regarding the Purchaser or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries ("
_Confidential Information_ ") strictly confidential and will not disclose
such information without the Purchasers prior written consent. "Confidential
Information" shall not include information that (i) is or becomes publicly
available (other than as a result of a disclosure by Seller or its respective
Representatives in violation of this _Section 4.02(e)_), (ii) is or becomes
available to them from a source that, to their knowledge, is not prohibited
from disclosing such information to them by a legal, contractual or fiduciary
obligation or (iii) has been independently developed by them (other than by or
with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) without reference to
Confidential Information.

4.03 _Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Notices and Consents_.

 

(a) Each of Seller and Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain promptly all Consents of all Governmental Authorities that may be
or become necessary for the performance of its and the other parties
obligations pursuant to, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by, this Agreement. Seller, the Company and Purchaser shall cooperate in
promptly seeking to obtain all such Consents; _provided_ , _however_ ,

 



28  that Seller and the Company shall not be required to pay any fees or other
payments to any such Governmental Authorities in order to obtain any such
Consent (other than normal filing fees that are imposed by Law on the
Company). None of Seller, the Company or Purchaser shall knowingly enter into
any acquisition or other agreement or make any announcement with respect to
any transaction that could reasonably be expected to have the effect of
materially delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any Consents of any
Governmental Authority. Seller and Purchaser each agree to make, or to cause
to be made: (i) if required, an appropriate filing of a notification and
report form pursuant to the HSR Act; and (ii) any other filing or
notification required by any other antitrust or competition Laws of applicable
foreign jurisdictions, in each case, with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable after the date of
this Agreement, and to supply promptly any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or any
other antitrust or competition Laws of applicable foreign jurisdictions. If
any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby under the HSR Act or any other antitrust or competition Laws of
applicable foreign jurisdictions or if any suit or proceeding is instituted
or threatened by any Governmental Authority or any private party challenging
any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of the HSR Act or any
other antitrust or competition Laws of applicable foreign jurisdictions, each
of Seller and Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
promptly resolve such objections. In furtherance of the foregoing and provided
that nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates to take any action that, in Purchasers good faith judgment,
would adversely and materially affect (i) the strategic benefits sought by
Purchaser in effecting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii)
any material line of business or class of products of the Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) from and after the
Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to, take
all action, including agreeing to hold separate, divest, license, transfer or
otherwise dispose of any of the businesses or properties or assets of
Purchaser or any of its respective Affiliates, or to terminate any existing
relationships or contractual rights and obligations, as may be required by:
(i) the applicable Governmental Authority in order to resolve any such
objections as such Governmental Authority may have to such transactions under
applicable Law; or (ii) any domestic or foreign court or other tribunal, in an
Action brought by a private party or Governmental Authority challenging such
transactions as violative of any applicable Law, in order to avoid the entry
of, or to effect the dissolution, vacating, lifting, altering or reversal of,
any order that has the effect of restricting, preventing or prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Each party to this Agreement shall promptly notify the other parties of
any communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental
Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and
permit the other parties to review in advance any proposed communication by
such party to any Governmental Authority relating to the matters that are the
subject of this Agreement. Neither Seller nor Purchaser, as applicable, shall
agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any filings, investigation (including any settlement of the
investigation), litigation or other inquiry related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement unless it consults with the other parties
in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives
the other parties the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting.
Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the parties to this Agreement shall
coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in

 



29  exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the other party
may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and in seeking early
termination of any applicable waiting periods including under the HSR Act and
any other applicable antitrust or competition Laws of applicable foreign
jurisdictions. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the parties to this
Agreement shall provide each other party with copies of all correspondence,
filings or communications between them or any of their Representatives, on the
one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the other
hand, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

(c) At the Purchasers request and expense, the Seller agrees to take all
reasonable actions the Purchaser reasonably deems prudent in order to
reasonably assist the Purchaser in obtaining any actions, consents,
undertakings, approvals, waivers or authorizations by or from any Governmental
Authority for or in connection with, and to reasonably assist the
Purchaser in litigating or otherwise contesting any objections to or
proceedings or other actions challenging, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(d) The Seller shall cause the Company to give (and shall cause any applicable
Subsidiary to give) any notices to third Persons, and use (and shall cause
any applicable Subsidiary to use) commercially reasonable best efforts to
obtain any consents or approvals from third Persons required in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller and the Company shall not be required
to pay or commit to pay any amount to (or incur any obligation in favor of)
any Person from whom any such Consent or assignment may be required, except
where any such amount is advanced to Seller or the Company by Purchaser. If
the Company or any Subsidiary fails to obtain any such consent from a third
Person, then the Seller shall (and shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to) use commercially reasonable best efforts to limit the
adverse effect upon the Company and its Subsidiaries from the failure to
obtain such consent. The Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to assist the Company and its Subsidiaries in obtaining all such consents and
providing such notices, including providing any reasonable information or
executing any documents reasonably required in connection therewith.

 

4.04 _Fulfillment of Conditions_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement:

 

(a) Seller shall take all commercially reasonable steps necessary or desirable
and proceed diligently and in good faith to satisfy each condition to the
obligations of Purchaser contained in this Agreement.

(b) Purchaser shall take all commercially reasonable steps necessary or
desirable and proceed diligently and in good faith to satisfy each condition
to the obligations of Seller contained in this Agreement.

 

4.05 _Contact with Customers and Suppliers_. Until the Closing Date, Purchaser
and its Representatives shall contact or communicate with the customers,
suppliers, distributors and licensors of the Company and its Subsidiaries in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby only with the prior
written consent of Seller (which consent, following the satisfaction of the
closing condition set forth in _Section 6.01(b)_, shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



30 4.06 _Further Assurances; Post-Closing Cooperation_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at any time or from time to time after the
Closing, each of the parties hereto shall execute and deliver such other
documents and instruments, provide such materials and information and take
such other actions as may reasonably be necessary, proper or advisable, to
the extent permitted by Law, to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement
or to otherwise effect the transactions contemplated hereby. In the event of
any conflict between the terms of any such documents and this Agreement, the
terms of this Agreement shall control.

4.07 _Indemnification and Insurance_. For a period of six years following the
Closing, Purchaser shall cause the Company not to make any changes to its
limited liability agreement that would adversely affect the rights of persons
who are currently or who were officers or directors of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnitees_ ") to claim indemnification from such
entity under the terms of its limited liability agreement as in effect on the
Closing Date, except as required by applicable Law. Purchaser agrees that for
a period of six (6) years after the Closing, Purchaser shall maintain, or
cause to be maintained, for the benefit of the Indemnitees, an insurance and
indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring on or
before the Closing Date (the " _D andO Insurance_") on terms and conditions
substantially equivalent (in both amount and scope) to, and in any event not
less favorable in the aggregate than, the existing policy or policies
maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries or, if substantially
equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall not be required to pay an annual
premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of
the last annual premium paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the
date hereof, which last annual premium is set forth on _Schedule 4.07_ , but
in such case Purchaser shall purchase as much coverage as is available for
such amount. The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be
deemed to have been satisfied if Purchaser purchases prior to the Closing
extended reporting endorsements consistent with the requirements set forth
above, which provide such Indemnitees with coverage for an aggregate period
of six (6) years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
occurred on or before the Closing, including in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. If such prepaid policies have been obtained
prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall maintain, or cause to be maintained,
such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations
thereunder. To the extent that policies other than such prepaid policies are
in effect, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall cooperate with Purchaser to
obtain tail-based coverage on such other policies. The provisions of this
_Section 4.07_ are intended for the benefit of the current and former
officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and shall be
enforceable by such individuals and their heirs and representatives.

 

4.08 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) Effective as of the Closing and continuing through the first anniversary
thereof, Purchaser shall ensure that employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries who are not Union Employees and who remain in the employment of
Purchaser or its Affiliates at the Closing (the " _Continuing Employees"_ )
receive compensation and employee benefits that, in the aggregate,
are substantially comparable to those provided generally to similarly
situated employees of Purchaser (not taking into account the value of any
equity or equity related grants or transaction related compensation), but
solely to the extent such employees remain in employment during such period.
Effective as of the Closing, the Dearborn Union Employees

 



31  shall have the terms and conditions of employment as set forth in the
Dearborn CBA. Effective as of the Closing, the MSC Union Employees shall have
the terms and conditions of employment as set forth in any collective
bargaining agreement between MSC and the USW entered into in accordance with
this Agreement or, if MSC and the USW have not entered into a collective
bargaining agreement, the terms and conditions of employment that applied to
such MSC Union Employee immediately prior to the Closing. In addition (and
without limitation of _Section 4.08(e)_), for a period of one year following
the Closing, Purchaser shall or shall cause its Affiliates to provide to
the Continuing Employees who do not have an individual agreement that
contains a contractual severance obligation and who remain in the employment
of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) severance benefits, if any, which are substantially comparable
to the severance benefits that are provided generally to similarly situated
employees of Purchaser. Nothing in this _Section 4.08_ or otherwise in this
Agreement shall limit the right of Purchaser, the Company or its other
Affiliates to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee at any time.

(b) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Purchaser or its
Affiliates in which Continuing Employees will be eligible to participate after
the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company and its other
Affiliates to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and
exclusions with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable
to such employees to the extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied
or did not apply to such employees, prior to the Closing, under comparable
benefit plans that are welfare plans during the plan year that includes the
Closing Date, and (ii) provide each such employee with credit for any
deductibles and out-of-pocket requirements paid for the plan year that
includes the Closing Date under a benefit plan that is a welfare plan in
satisfying any comparable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the
extent applicable under any comparable plan following the Closing Date with
respect to the plan year that includes the Closing Date.

(c) Each Continuing Employee shall be given credit for all service with the
Company or its Subsidiaries (or service credited by the Company or its
Subsidiaries) under all employee benefit plans, programs, policies and
arrangements (other than any defined benefit pension plans) maintained by
Purchaser or its Affiliates in which they participate or in which they become
participants for purposes of eligibility and vesting, but solely to the extent
such employee was credited with service for such purposes under a comparable
benefit plan as of the Closing Date.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 4.08(b)_ or _4.08(c)_ to the
contrary, service shall not be included for any of the purposes described in
those Sections to the extent the inclusion of such service results in the
duplication of any benefit.

(e) From and after the Closing, Purchaser will cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with its terms, any written agreement
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that contains a contractual
severance obligation with respect to any Continuing Employees to the extent
set forth on _Schedule 2.10(a)_.

(f) It is expressly understood and agreed that the provisions of this
_Section 4.08_ are not intended to confer any third-party beneficiary rights
and no employees or other Person (excluding any party hereto) shall have any
rights or remedies, including rights of enforcement, with respect to this 
_Section 4.08_ and no employee or other Person is or is intended to be a
third-party beneficiary hereof.

 



32 4.09 _Books and Records; Access_.

 

(a) For a period of seven (7) years after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
preserve and retain, or cause the Company to preserve and retain, all
corporate, accounting, Tax, legal, auditing or other books and records of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (including any documents relating to any
governmental or non-governmental actions, suits, proceedings or
investigations) relating to the conduct of the business and operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, during such seven-year (7-year) period, Purchaser and the Company
may dispose of any such books and records which are offered to, but not
accepted by, Seller. Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit the Company or
its Subsidiaries to, dispose of any such books and records at any time after
such seven-year (7-year) period without first offering such books and records
to Seller.

(b) After the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company and
its Subsidiaries to, permit Seller and its authorized Representatives to have
reasonable access to, and to inspect and copy, all materials referred to in
_Section 4.09(a)_ and to meet with officers and employees of Purchaser and the
Company and its Subsidiaries on a mutually convenient basis in order to
obtain explanations with respect to such materials and to obtain additional
information to the extent necessary or useful in connection with any matters
referred to in _Section 1.03(b)_,  _Section 1.04_ and any audit,
investigation, dispute or litigation, _provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller
shall reimburse the Purchaser for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred in connection with any such request.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) any such access rights shall be exercised
in such manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the normal business
operations of the Purchaser or the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (ii) the
Purchaser may withhold any document (or portions thereof) or information to
the extent that (x) it may not be disclosed as such disclosure would
contravene any applicable Laws, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered
into prior to the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall
use reasonable efforts to obtain a waiver of such restriction or otherwise
seek to provide access to such information in a manner that does not violate
such restriction, or (y) the disclosure would cause the Purchaser or the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to jeopardize any attorney-client or other
legal privilege with respect to such information.

 

4.10 _Credit and Performance Support Obligations_. Purchaser agrees to use all
commercially reasonable efforts to cause Seller and its Affiliates (other
than the Company and its Subsidiaries) to be absolutely and unconditionally
relieved on or prior to the Closing of all Liabilities arising out of the
letters of credit, performance bonds, corporate guarantees and other
similar items issued and outstanding in connection with the Company and its
Subsidiaries that are (i) set forth on _Schedule 4.10_ or (ii) entered into
between the date hereof and the Closing Date in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice and, in each case which are
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing, and Purchaser shall
indemnify Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) against any Losses of any kind whatsoever with respect to such
Liabilities. Purchaser agrees to continue to use all commercially reasonable
efforts after the Closing to relieve Seller and its Affiliates (other than the
Company and its Subsidiaries) of all such Liabilities.

 



33 4.11 _Termination of Insurance Coverage_. Purchaser acknowledges that, except
to the extent provided in this _Section 4.11_, all insurance coverage for
the Company and its Subsidiaries under policies of Seller and its Affiliates
(collectively, " _Seller Insurance Policies_ ") shall terminate as of the
Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall remain entitled from and after the Closing to all coverage and other
rights under (i) Seller Insurance Policies with respect to any claim, act,
omission, event, circumstance, occurrence or loss that occurred or existed
prior to the Closing Date (and then only to the extent that such claim, act,
omission, event, circumstance, occurrence or loss occurred or existed on or
prior to the Closing Date) (a " _Pre-Closing Date Event_ ") and was reported
to the applicable insurer in accordance with the provisions of the applicable
Seller Insurance Policy prior to the Closing Date and (ii) occurrence-based
insurance coverage under Seller Insurance Policies (the " _Occurrence-Based
Coverage_ "), in respect of any loss or liability arising from a Pre-Closing
Date Event that is insured or potentially insured in whole or in part under
any Occurrence-Based Coverage. Seller and its Affiliates shall provide
reasonable cooperation, including to the extent necessary by naming Purchaser
as additional insured or pursuing claims on behalf of Purchaser, to the
Company and its Subsidiaries (at the sole expense of the Company) in the
pursuit of any such coverage and other rights (it being understood that such
cooperation does not include commencement or prosecution of litigation by
Seller against an insurer).

 

4.12 _Financing_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Purchasers obligations hereunder are
not conditioned in any matter upon Purchaser obtaining any financing. The
failure, for any reason, of Purchaser to deliver sufficient funds to pay the
Initial Purchase Price on the Closing Date shall constitute a willful and
material breach of this Agreement. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt,
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the existence of any conditions
contained in the Commitment Letters or the Financing shall not constitute, nor
be construed to constitute, a condition to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; it being acknowledged, however, that the
foregoing does not impact the rights of the Parties to rely on the conditions
to the Closing set forth in this Agreement.

(b) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) arrange the Bridge
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter, (ii)
to the extent the funding thereunder is required to finance the
transactions contemplated hereby, enter into a definitive agreement with
respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained in the Commitment Letter
in no event later than the Closing, and (iii) consummate the Bridge Financing
or other financing sufficient to permit the Company to pay the Initial
Purchase Price and such other amounts payable by it pursuant to this Agreement
(the " _Financing_ ") no later than the Closing. In the event that any portion
of the Bridge Financing becomes unavailable in the manner or from the sources
contemplated in the Commitment Letter, (A) Purchaser shall immediately notify
Seller and (B) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to
obtain any such portion from alternative sources, on terms that are not
materially more adverse to the Company or Seller, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event, including entering into definitive
agreements with respect thereto (such definitive agreements entered into
pursuant to the first or second sentence of this _Section 4.12(b)_ being
referred to as the " _Financing Agreements_ "). Purchaser shall (x) furnish to
Seller complete, correct and 

 



34  executed copies of the Financing Agreements promptly upon their execution,
(y) give Seller prompt notice of any material breach by any party of the
Commitment Letter, any alternative financing commitment or the Financing
Arrangements of which Purchaser becomes aware or any termination thereof and
(z) otherwise keep Seller reasonably informed of the status of Purchasers
efforts to arrange the Financing.

 

(c) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Seller and the Company and their
respective Affiliates and employees have no responsibility for any financing
that Purchaser may raise in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller has agreed to cooperate with
Purchaser as set forth in _Section 4.12(d)_.

 

(d) The Company and the Seller shall, and shall cause the Subsidiaries of the
Company to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their officers,
employees, representatives and advisors to, provide such cooperation as may be
reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection with the Financing and the
consummation thereof, including (i) participating in a reasonable number of
due diligence sessions (including without limitation accounting and legal
diligence sessions); (ii) assisting in reviewing prospectuses, confidential
bank memoranda, offering memoranda and similar documents; (iii) providing as
promptly as reasonably practicable to Purchaser and its financing sources the
information set forth on _Schedule 4.12(d)_ (the " _Required Information_ ")
and (iv) providing authorization letters to the Lenders authorizing
the distribution of information to other prospective lenders and containing a
customary representation to the arrangers of the Bridge Financing contemplated
by the Commitment Letter that the information concerning the Company and its
Subsidiaries contained in any confidential information memorandum
contemplated by the Commitment Letter does not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that the actions of the Company
in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv) do not (A) unreasonably interfere
with the ongoing operations of Seller or the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries of the Company or (B) require Seller or the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries of the Company to pay any out-of-pocket fees or expenses, or
incur any liability, prior to the Closing that are not simultaneously
reimbursed or indemnified by the Purchaser.

4.13 _Corporate Name_. Purchaser acknowledges that Seller and/or
its Affiliates have the absolute and exclusive proprietary right to all
names, tradenames, trademarks, service names and service marks incorporating
the word "Severstal". Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates
(including the Company and its Subsidiaries) not to use the word "Severstal"
or any derivation thereof and any corporate symbols or logos related thereto
in connection with the offer or sale of any goods or services or otherwise in
the conduct of its or their businesses; _provided_ , _however_ , that, the
Purchaser and its Affiliates may continue to use the Seller Marks and such
other Trademarks in connection with (x) products of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and all associated packaging or labeling and (y) to the extent
existing as of Closing, signage, invoices, purchase orders, letterhead,
business cards, stationery, promotional brochures, and other promotional
correspondence (not including domain names or websites), in each case for a
reasonable time after Closing, not to exceed twelve (12) months after Closing
in the case of the foregoing clause (x) and three (3) months after Closing in
the case of the foregoing clause (y). Within 60 days following the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall cause the Company and its

 



35  Subsidiaries to make all filings with the appropriate Governmental
Authorities and take such other actions as may be necessary to change the
corporate name of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries to a name which
does not include the word "Severstal" or any word confusingly similar thereto.

4.14 _Termination of Intercompany Agreements_.

(a) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.14(a)_ , prior to or concurrently with
the Closing, all contracts, arrangements or Liabilities between the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its
Affiliates (including Severstal Columbus, LLC and its Subsidiaries), on the
other hand, shall be terminated without any ongoing Liability of any party
thereto, and Seller shall take such action as may be necessary so that,
effective as of the Closing, there shall be no Liabilities owed to or from the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Seller or any of
its Affiliates (including Severstal Columbus, LLC and its Subsidiaries) on the
other hand.

(b) Prior to or concurrently with the Closing, any Indebtedness owed by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to Seller or any of its Affiliates, other
than Indebtedness related to the Intercompany Indebtedness Amount, shall be
cancelled, repaid or, to the extent permitted under the applicable loan
documents, converted into equity.

4.15 _[Intentionally Omitted.]_

 

4.16 _Provisions Respecting Representation of the Company_. Each of the
parties to this Agreement hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of
its Representatives, that Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP may serve
as counsel to Seller and its Affiliates (individually and collectively, the "
_Seller Group_ "), on the one hand, and the Company and its Subsidiaries, on
the other hand, in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and that, following consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom
LLP (or any successor) may serve as counsel to the Seller Group, in connection
with any Action, litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
notwithstanding such representation or any continued representation of the
Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries, and each of the parties hereto (on its
own behalf and on behalf of its Representatives) hereby consents thereto and
irrevocably waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom, and each of
such parties shall cause any Affiliate thereof to consent to irrevocably waive
any conflict of interest arising from such representation. The parties agree
to take the steps necessary to ensure that any privilege attaching as a result
of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP representing the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall remain in effect, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such privilege from and after the Closing shall be controlled
by Seller. As to any privileged attorney-client communications between
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP and the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date (collectively, the "
_Privileged Communications_ "), the Purchaser, the Company, and each of its
Subsidiaries together with any of their respective Affiliates, Subsidiaries,
successors or assigns, agree that no such party may use or rely on any of the
Privileged Communications in any action against or involving any of the
Seller Group after the Closing.

of, or reimburse Purchaser Indemnitees for, (without duplication) any and all
Losses suffered, incurred or sustained by a Purchaser Indemnitee by reason of
or resulting from:

 

(i) Any Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries (or for which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is liable) payable for any taxable year or taxable
period ending on or before the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
indemnity shall be provided by Seller for Taxes resulting from any transaction
undertaken by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries) after the Closing on the Closing Date;

(ii) With respect to any taxable year or taxable period beginning before the
Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the
portion of any Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries (or for which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is liable) attributable to that portion of
such Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date, as determined
under _Section 5.01(b)_ (together with any taxable years or taxable periods
ending on or prior to the Closing Date, a " _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that no indemnity shall be provided by Seller for any
Taxes resulting from any transaction undertaken by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including the Company and any of its Subsidiaries) after the
Closing on the Closing Date;

(iii) Taxes (A) imposed on any member (other than the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) of any affiliated group with which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries files or has filed a Tax Return on a consolidated, combined or
unitary basis for a taxable year beginning before the Closing Date and for
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is liable as a result of filing
such a Tax Return on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis or (B) of any
Person for which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is liable (i) under
any Contract to the extent such Contract was executed on or before the Closing
Date, (ii) as a transferee or successor, by assumption or by operation of Law
to the extent the event giving rise to such transfer, succession, assumption

before the Closing Date; provided, however, that no indemnity shall be
provided by Seller for Taxes resulting from any transaction undertaken
by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries) after the Closing on the Closing Date;

 



37 (iv) Taxes imposed on the Parent and for which the Company is liable as a
result of the Company being disregarded as an entity separate from the Parent
for income tax filing purposes; and

(v) Taxes imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of
(A) a breach of any representation or warranty set forth in _Section 2.09_ of
this Agreement or (B) any nonfulfillment of, or failure to perform, any
covenant or agreement on the part of Seller or, with respect to covenants or
agreements to be performed prior to the Closing, the Company, contained in
this Agreement with respect to Taxes (in the case of each of clauses (A) and
(B) above, determined without regard to any qualification related to
materiality contained therein).

(b) In order to apportion appropriately Taxes relating to any Straddle Period
between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and that portion of the Straddle Period
commencing after the Closing Date (a " _Post-Closing Tax Period_ "), the
parties shall apply the provisions of _Section 5.01(b)(i)_ and _5.01(b)(ii)_
below, as appropriate:

(i) In the case of Taxes that are either (1) based upon or related to income
or receipts, or (2) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), such Taxes
shall be allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax
Period based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of business
on the Closing Date ( _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) for purposes of
determining the marginal tax rate applicable to income or receipts during such
period in a jurisdiction in which such tax rate depends upon the level of
income or receipts, annualized income or receipts shall be taken into account,
if appropriate, for an equitable sharing of such Taxes and (B) exemptions,
allowances or deductions that are calculated on a time basis, such as the
deduction for depreciation, shall be apportioned on a time basis);

(ii) In the case of Taxes not described in subparagraph (i) above (including
those imposed on a periodic basis or measured by the level of any item), the
amount of such Taxes allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be the
amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case of such
Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the
immediately preceding Straddle Period) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of calendar days in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle
Period, and the amount of such Taxes allocated to the Post-Closing Tax Period
shall be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or, in the
case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes
for the immediately preceding Straddle Period) multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the Post-Closing
Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the
entire Straddle Period, in each case irrespective of the lien or assessment
date of such Taxes; and

 

(iii) All Taxes relating to actions outside the ordinary course of business
occurring after the Closing on the Closing Date shall be apportioned to the
period ending after the Closing Date.

 



38 5.02 _Purchaser s Indemnification_. Except as otherwise provided in this
_ARTICLE V_ , Purchaser shall be liable for, and shall indemnify and hold
Seller Indemnitees harmless from, and shall pay to Seller Indemnitees the

all Taxes imposed on or with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for any Post-Closing Tax Period or any taxable period beginning
after the Closing Date.

 

5.03 _Refunds or Credits_. Purchaser shall pay to Seller, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, any refunds or credits of Taxes of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (determined by
applying the provisions of _Sections 5.01(b)(i)_ - _(ii)_ ) (net of all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including Taxes, incurred in connection
with such refund or credit and without interest), within ten (10) days of
receipt of such refund or credit by Purchaser or the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Purchaser shall be entitled to all other refunds and credits of
Taxes.

 

5.04 _Tax Returns_.

(a) Seller shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed when due
all Pass-Through Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Seller shall request that each
Joint Venture make a valid election under Section 754 of the Code (and any
similar election under state or local law) to be made on any Pass-Through Tax
Return for the taxable year of the applicable Joint Venture that ends on or
includes the Closing Date.

 

(b) Seller shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed when due
all Tax Returns (other than any Pass-Through Tax Return described in _Section
5.04(a)_) that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries for taxable years or taxable periods ending on or
before the Closing Date, and shall timely remit all Taxes shown as due
on such Tax Returns (taking into account all extensions properly obtained).
All such Tax Returns shall, unless otherwise required by Law, be prepared and
filed in a manner consistent with past practice. To the extent that such Tax
Returns are filed after the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Purchaser or
cause Purchaser to be provided with a copy of each such Tax Return at least
twenty (20) days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return (or in any
event as soon as practicable), and shall permit Purchaser to review and
approve such Tax Return prior to filing (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 

(c) Purchaser shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed when
due all Tax Returns (other than any Pass-Through Tax Return described in
_Section 5.04(a)_) that are required to be filed by or with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date for Straddle
Periods, and shall timely remit all Taxes shown as due on such Tax
Returns (taking into account all extensions properly obtained). To the extent
that such Tax Returns relate to Pre-Closing Tax Periods, such Tax Returns
shall, unless otherwise required by Law, be prepared and filed in a manner
consistent with past practice. Purchaser shall provide Seller with a copy of
each such Tax Return at least twenty (20) days prior to the due date (taking
into account any proper extension thereof) for filing such Tax Return, and
shall permit Seller to review and approve such Tax Return prior to filing
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Seller
shall remit to Purchaser the amount of Taxes for which the Seller is
responsible pursuant to _Section 5.01_ not later than five (5) days prior to
the due date for the payment of Taxes with respect to such Tax Return (taking
into account all extensions properly obtained).

 



39 5.05 _Mutual Cooperation_. As soon as practicable, but in any event within
fifteen (15) days after either Sellers or Purchasers request, as the case
may be, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller or Seller shall deliver or cause to
be delivered to Purchaser, as the case may be, such information and other data
relating to the Tax Returns and Taxes of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and shall provide such other assistance as may reasonably be
requested, to cause the completion and filing of all Tax Returns or to respond
to audits by any Taxing Authorities with respect to any Tax Returns or
taxable periods or to otherwise enable Seller or Purchaser to satisfy their
accounting or Tax requirements; provided, however, that Seller shall not be
required to disclose, to any Person, any Tax information or Tax Return that
does not relate solely and exclusively to the Company and its Subsidiaries (it
being understood that, in the case of any consolidated, combined or unitary
Tax Return that includes the Company and any other Person, Seller
shall provide Purchaser, at Purchasers request, with pro forma Tax Returns
relating solely to the Company and its Subsidiaries).

5.06  _Contests_. Whenever any Taxing Authority asserts a claim, makes an
assessment, or otherwise disputes the amount of Taxes for which Seller may
reasonably be expected to be liable under this Agreement (a " _Tax Claim_ "),
Purchaser shall upon receipt of notice of such Tax Claim, promptly inform
Seller in writing; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such notice
as provided herein shall not relieve Seller of its obligations under this
_Article V_ except to the extent that Seller is materially prejudiced
thereby. Seller shall have the right to elect to control the defense of any
Tax Claim relating to taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date, or
otherwise relating to Taxes for which Seller may be liable under this
Agreement (other than with respect to a Straddle Period), at its sole cost and
expense by written notice to Purchaser within ten (10) days of receipt of
notice thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser may, at its sole cost
and expense, retain separate counsel of its choosing to participate in the
defense or settlement of such Tax Claim by Seller. If Seller timely elects to
control the defense of any such Tax Claim in accordance with this  _Section
5.06_, (i) Seller shall keep Purchaser reasonably apprised of the status of
the Tax Claim and the defense thereof and shall reasonably consider
recommendations made by Purchaser with respect thereto and (ii)
Purchaser shall have the right to consent, which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, to any settlement to the extent
such settlement would affect the amount of Taxes for which Purchaser or its
Affiliates may be liable for taxable periods ending after the Closing Date.
If Seller elects not to control the defense or thereafter fails or ceases to
defend any such Tax Claim, Purchaser shall have the right to control the
defense of such Tax Claims at its sole cost and expense, and Seller shall
have the right to consent, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, to any settlement thereof to the extent such
settlement would affect the amount of Taxes for which Seller may be liable
under this Agreement. Except as otherwise required by the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 5.06_, Purchaser shall have the right to control
any proceedings relating to Taxes of or with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, in the case of a Tax Claim
with respect to a Straddle Period, Seller shall be entitled to participate in
such proceeding (at its sole cost and expense) to the extent such Tax Claim is
related to the portion of such Straddle Period that is a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, and Purchaser shall not settle such portion of such Tax Claim without
the Sellers consent, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, if such settlement would affect the amount of Taxes
for which Seller may be liable under this Agreement.

 



40 5.07 _Transfer Taxes_. Purchaser shall be responsible for (and shall indemnify
Seller against) the timely payment of all sales (including bulk sales), use,
value added, documentary, stamp, gross receipts, registration, transfer,
conveyance, excise, recording, license and other similar taxes and fees ("
_Transfer Taxes_ "), arising out of or in connection with or attributable to
the transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement. Purchaser shall prepare
and in a timely manner file all returns in respect of Transfer Taxes;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that any such returns shall be subject to the
approval of Seller, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

5.08  _Survival of Obligations and Sole Remedy_. The obligations of the
parties set forth in this _Article V_ shall be unconditional and absolute, and
shall survive the Closing and remain in effect until ninety (90) days
following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. The rights
and obligations of the parties with respect to indemnification for any and all
matters relating to Taxes and Tax Returns shall be governed solely by this
_Article V_ and  _Sections 8.02(c)(xi) 8.02(f)_ , _8.04_ and _8.05_.

Third Party Claim (or sooner if the nature of the Third Party Claim so
requires) does not assume control of the defense or thereafter fails or ceases

entry of any judgment which (A) does not include as an unconditional term the
giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of an

(B) would adversely affect the ongoing operations of the Indemnified Party or
its Affiliates, or (C) would impose a judgment that provides relief other

without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (such consent not

to the Indemnifying Party of an unconditional release from all Liability in
respect of such Third Party Claim.

Claim, the Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver an Indemnity Notice to the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party may, within 30 days after receipt
by such Indemnifying Party of such an Indemnity Notice, deliver to the
Indemnified Party a written response disputing such claim. If the Indemnifying
Party in such written response contests the payment of the Claim Amount, then
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall use good faith efforts
to arrive at a mutually acceptable resolution of such dispute within the next
30 days.

participate equally in the defense and handling of any of the Special Matters,
which participation shall include the right to attend meetings and participate
in conference calls with Third Parties, review in advance and comment on any

meaningful input in how such Special Matter is being handled. The Purchaser
Indemnitees shall provide regular updates to the Seller regarding the Special
Matters, provide copies of all written documents and communications related
to the Special Matters with as sufficient time to allow the Seller to review
and comment on the response or preparation of such materials, and incorporate

pursuant to any insurance policy, title insurance policy, indemnity,
reimbursement arrangement or contract pursuant to which or under which such

rights (collectively, " _Alternative Arrangements_ ").

payment, be subrogated to all rights (if any) of the Indemnified Party
against any third party in connection with the Losses to which such payment

warranty or nonfulfillment or failure to be performed of any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the

MISCELLANEOUS

 

10.01 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. No
assignment shall be made by any party without the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that any party may, at any time
prior to the Closing, assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement
without such consent to an Affiliate of such party if such assignee delivers
an instrument in writing confirming that it is bound by and shall perform all
of the obligations of the assigning party under this Agreement as if it were
an original signatory and _provided_ _further_ that the assigning party shall
not be relieved of its obligations hereunder. In the event of an assignment as
contemplated above, any reference in this Agreement to the assigning party
shall be deemed to either (x) include the assignee or (y) in the case of a
substitution as contemplated by the foregoing sentence, be a reference to the
assignee. Any purported assignment in contravention of this _Section 10.01_
shall be null and void.

10.02 _Public Announcements_. No party hereto shall issue or make any public
announcement, press release or other public disclosure regarding this

case of any proposed disclosure by Purchaser or the Company, or without
Purchasers prior written consent, in the case of any proposed disclosure by
Seller, except for any such disclosure that is, in the opinion of the
disclosing partys counsel, required by applicable Law or the rules of any
applicable stock exchange. In the event a party is, in the opinion of
its counsel, required to make a public disclosure by applicable Law or the
rules of any applicable stock exchange, such party shall, to the extent
practicable, submit the proposed disclosure in writing to Seller, in the case
of any proposed disclosure by Purchaser, or the Purchaser, in the case of any
proposed disclosure by Seller, prior to the date of disclosure and provide
Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, a reasonable opportunity to comment
thereon.

 

10.03 _Expenses_. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, and except as otherwise specified herein, each party shall bear
its own expenses with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

10.04 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any
time. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed by the Purchaser, the Company and the Seller; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no amendment to this Agreement that would adversely affect the rights of
the Financing Sources (including the Lenders) under _Sections 10.06_ , _10.08_
and _10.09_ or this _Section 10.04_ shall be made without their consent.

 



59 10.05 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
illegal, invalid or unenforceable under present or future Laws effective
during the term hereof in a final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction, such provision shall be fully severable and this Agreement shall
be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision never comprised a part hereof; and the remaining provisions hereof
shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance
herefrom. Furthermore, in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision, there shall be added automatically as part of this Agreement, a
provision as similar in its terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision as may be possible and be legal, valid and enforceable.

10.06 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as set forth in _Section 4.07_,
this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their
permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or implied (including _Article
VIII_ ), shall give or be construed to give to any Person, other than the
parties hereto and such permitted assigns, any legal or equitable rights
hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Financing Sources (including the
Lenders under the Commitment Letter) shall be third party beneficiaries of,
and shall be entitled to enforce, the provisions of _Sections 10.04_ ,
_10.08_ and _10.09_.

10.07 _Waiver_. The failure of any party to enforce any condition or part
of this Agreement at any time shall not be construed as a waiver of that
condition or part, nor shall it forfeit any rights to future enforcement
thereof. Any waiver hereunder shall be effective only if delivered to the
other parties hereto in writing by the party making such waiver.

10.08 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and any claim, controversy or disputes
arising under or related in any way to this Agreement shall be construed and
enforced in accordance with and governed by the internal, substantive Laws of
the State of Delaware applicable to agreements entered into and to be
performed solely within such state without regard to the conflicts of Laws
provisions thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claim, controversy or
dispute arising under or related in any way to the Financing (including the
Commitment Letter) shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of law
rules of such State that would result in the application of the laws of any
other State.

 

10.09 _Arbitration and Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) The parties hereto agree that any dispute, controversy or claim arising
out of or relating to this Agreement, including any question regarding its
existence or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof shall be finally
settled by arbitration under the auspices of and pursuant to the Rules of
Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (" _ICC_ ") in effect at
the time of execution of this Agreement. The language of the arbitration
proceedings shall be English, and the seat of the arbitration shall be New
York, New York. The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted by three
arbitrators appointed in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the ICC.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither party shall be precluded at any

 



60  time from seeking equitable relief in any forum of competent jurisdiction,
and such action shall not be incompatible with the agreement to arbitrate
contained herein or the availability of interim measures of protection under
the ICC Rules of Arbitration. Any award rendered by an arbitral tribunal shall
be reasoned and in writing, final, and may be entered and enforced in any
court of competent jurisdiction. All matters and information relating to the
arbitration proceedings, including the existence thereof, shall be deemed
confidential. Confidentiality shall survive the termination of the arbitral
proceedings. The parties shall, during the course of such arbitration, share
the costs of such arbitration as assessed by the ICC. A final award issued by
the arbitral tribunal may allocate the costs of the arbitration proceedings,
including administration fees, fees of the arbitrators, and the
parties attorneys fees and expenses among the parties as the tribunal deems
appropriate. During the period when the dispute is being resolved, except for
the matters being disputed, the parties shall in all other respects continue
to perform their obligations hereunder.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the
parties further acknowledges and agrees that (i) the Financing Sources
(including the Lenders) shall not be subject to clause (a) above and (ii) it
will not bring or support any Action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim
of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract
or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources (including the Lenders)
in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including but not limited to any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Financing Sources (including the Commitment Letter)
or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the
State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan (and
appellate courts thereof). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, none of the Financing Sources (including the Lenders) will have
any liability to the Company or its Affiliates relating to or arising out of
this Agreement, the Financing (including the Commitment Letter) or otherwise,
whether at law, or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and neither the
Company nor any of its Affiliates will have any rights or claims against any
of the Financing Sources hereunder or thereunder. In no event shall the
Company be entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of this
Agreement against the Financing Sources.

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY
LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT
(INCLUDING AGAINST THE FINANCING SOURCES). EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY:
(A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 10.09(c)_.

 



61 10.10 _Specific Performance_. The parties acknowledge that, in view of the
uniqueness of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each party
would not have an adequate remedy at Law for money damages in the event that
this Agreement has not been performed in accordance with its terms, and
