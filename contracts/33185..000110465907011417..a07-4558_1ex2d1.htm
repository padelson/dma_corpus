 **EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK;**

  

 **EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES**

  

4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub,
Parent or any holder of any shares of the capital stock of the Company,
Merger Sub or Parent, the following shall occur:

  

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Subject to the allocation and election procedures
in _Section 4.2_ and _Section 4.3_ , each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company (each, a " _Company Share_ ", and together,
the " _Company Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Company Shares that are owned by Parent or by the
Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or the
Company and in each case not held on behalf of third parties and
****Dissenting Shares (each an " _Excluded Company Share_ ", and
collectively, " _Excluded Company Shares_ ")) shall be converted into the
right to receive and shall become exchangeable for, at the election of
the holder thereof: (i) for each Company Share with respect to which
an election to receive cash has been effectively made and not revoked or
lost pursuant to _Section 4.3_ (a " _Cash Election_ "), the right to
receive in cash from Parent, without interest, an amount equal to $35.50 (the
" _Cash Consideration_ ") (collectively, " _Cash Election Shares_ "); (ii)
for each Company Share with respect to which an election to receive common
stock, par value $1.25 per share, of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ ") has
been effectively made and not revoked or lost pursuant to _Section 4.3_ (a "
_Stock Election_ "), the right to receive from Parent a portion of a share
****of Parent Common Stock equal to 0.861 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") share of
Parent Common Stock (the " _Stock Consideration_ ") (collectively, the "
_Stock Election Shares_ "); and (iii) for each Company Share other than
shares as to which a Cash Election or a Stock Election has been effectively
made and not revoked or lost pursuant to _Section 4.3_ (" _Non-Election
Shares_ "), the right to receive from Parent such Stock Consideration and/or
Cash Consideration as is determined in accordance with _Section 4.2(b)_.  At
the Effective Time, all Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall
be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and (i) each certificate
(a " _Certificate_ ") formerly representing any of such Company Shares (other
than Excluded Company Shares) and (ii) each uncertificated Company Share (an

        

" _Uncertificated Company Share_ ") registered to a holder on the stock
transfer books of the Company (other than Excluded Company Shares), shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and
the right, if any, to receive pursuant to _Section 4.3(h)_ cash in lieu of
fractional shares otherwise receivable pursuant to this _Section 4.1(a)_ and
any distributions or dividends pursuant to _Section 4.3(j)_, in each
case without interest ****and ****any Dissenting Shares shall thereinafter
represent only the right to receive the payments set forth in _Section 4.4_.
 For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Merger Consideration_ " with
respect to a given Company Share shall mean either the Cash
Consideration (with respect to a Company Share representing the right to
receive the Cash Consideration) or the Stock Consideration (with respect to a
Company Share representing the right to receive the Stock Consideration).

  

(b) _Cancellation of Shares_. Each Company Share that is owned by Parent
or by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent
or the Company and, in each case, not held on behalf of third parties, shall,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and retired without
payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

  

(c) _Effect on Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall remain outstanding.

  

(d) _Associated Rights_. References in this Agreement to Parent Common Stock
shall include, unless the context otherwise requires, the associated Right to
purchase Common Shares (as defined in the Rights Agreement) issued pursuant
to the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement, dated as of October 14, 2005,
by and between Parent and SunTrust Bank, a Georgia banking corporation, as
the Rights Agent (the " _Rights Agreement_ ").

  

4.2. _Allocation of Merger Consideration_.

  

(a) _Allocation_. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this
Agreement, (i) the number of Company Shares to be converted into
Stock Consideration pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)_ (the " _Stock
Conversion Number_ ") shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(A) the number of Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time by (B) 0.75 and (ii) all of the other Company Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
Cash Consideration (in case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), excluding
Excluded Company Shares).

  

(b) _Effectuation of Allocation_. As soon as practicable after the
Election Deadline and in any event no more than five ****Business Days after
the Closing Date (or such other date as the Company and Parent shall agree),
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation among holders
of Company Shares (other than Excluded Company Shares) of rights to receive
the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration as follows:

  

(i) If the aggregate number of Company Shares with respect to which Stock
Elections shall have been made (the " _Stock Election Number_ ") exceeds the
Stock Conversion Number, then all Cash Election Shares and all Non-Election
Shares of each holder

        

thereof shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration,
and Stock Election Shares of each holder thereof will be converted into the
right to receive the Stock Consideration in respect of that number of Stock
Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number
of Stock Election Shares held by such holder by (B) a fraction, the numerator
of which is the Stock Conversion Number and the denominator of which is the
Stock Election Number, with the remaining number of such holders Stock
Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration; and

  

(ii) If the Stock Election Number is less than the Stock Conversion Number
(the amount by which the Stock Conversion Number exceeds the Stock Election
Number being referred to herein as the " _Shortfall Number_ "), then all
Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration and the Non-Election Shares and Cash Election Shares shall be
treated in the following manner: (A) if the Shortfall Number is less than or
equal to the number of Non-Election Shares, then all Cash Election Shares
shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and the
Non-Election Shares of each holder thereof shall be converted into the right
to receive the Stock Consideration in respect of that number of Non-Election
Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Non-
Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which
is the Shortfall Number and the denominator of which is the total number of
Non-Election Shares, with the remaining number of such holders Non-Election
Shares being converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration; or
(B) if the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then
all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Stock Consideration and Cash Election Shares of each holder thereof shall be
converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration in respect of
that number of Cash Election Shares equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by
(y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which the Shortfall
Number exceeds the total number of Non-Election Shares and the denominator of
which is the total number of Cash Election Shares, with the remaining number
of such holders Cash Election Shares being converted into the right to
receive the Cash Consideration.

  

4.3. _Election and Exchange Procedure_. Each holder of record of Company
Shares (other than Excluded Company Shares) (" _Holder_ ") shall have the
right, subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article IV_ , to submit
an election in accordance with the following procedures:

  

(a) _Election_. Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with
the provisions of this _Section 4.3_ (herein called an " _Election_ ") (i)
the number of Company Shares owned by such Holder with respect to which such
Holder desires to make a Stock Election and (ii) the number of Company Shares
owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder desires to make a Cash
Election.

  

(b) _Exchange Agent_. As of the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause
to be deposited, with an exchange agent selected by Parent with the Companys
prior approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Company Shares (other
than Excluded Company Shares), certificates representing the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be exchanged for Company

        

Shares (other than Excluded Company Shares) in respect of the Stock
Consideration to be paid in the Merger and any cash necessary to pay for the
aggregate Cash Consideration to be paid pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)_ and any
dividends or other distributions with respect to the Parent Common Stock to
be paid or to be issued pursuant to _Section 4.3(f)_ or _Section 4.3(h)_ in
exchange for Company Shares (other than Excluded Company Shares) (such cash
and such certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock, together with the
amount of any cash payable pursuant to _Section 4.3(h)_ in lieu of
fractional shares and dividends or other distributions payable with respect
thereto pursuant to _Section 4.3(f)_ being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ ," it being understood that any and all interest earned on
funds deposited therein shall be turned over to Parent). With respect to the
amount of cash to be deposited as of the Closing to satisfy its obligations
under this _Section 4.3(b)_ , Parent shall only be required to make a
reasonable estimate of the amount of such cash that will be necessary;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange
Agent, from time to time thereafter as needed and if necessary, additional
cash in amounts sufficient to satisfy its obligations hereunder.

  

(c) _Form of Election_. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to the
Companys shareholders entitled to vote at the Shareholders Meeting, at the
time that the Proxy Statement is provided to the shareholders of the Company,
a form reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Form of Election_
") pursuant to which the Companys shareholders shall be entitled to
exercise their right to make an Election prior to the Election Deadline, and
shall cause the Exchange Agent to use all reasonable efforts to make
available as promptly as possible a Form of Election to any shareholder of
the Company who requests such Form of Election following the initial mailing
of the Form of Election and prior to the Election Deadline. In no event
shall the initial mailing of the Form of Election to the
Companys shareholders be made less than twenty (20) days prior to the
Election Deadline.

  

(d) _Election Deadline_. Any Election shall have been made properly only if
the Person authorized to receive Elections and to act as Exchange Agent under
this Agreement, shall have received, by 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on the date of
the Election Deadline, a Form of Election properly completed and signed. As
used herein, " _Election Deadline_ " means 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on the date
that is the day prior to the date of the Shareholders Meeting (or at such
other date and time as the Company and Parent shall agree). Parent and the
Company shall cooperate to issue a press release announcing the date of the
Election Deadline not more than fifteen (15) Business Days before, and
at least five Business Days prior to, the Election Deadline (and, if the
Company and Parent shall agree to any extension thereof, the Company and
Parent shall make a public announcement of any such extension as far as
reasonably practicable prior to such new Election Deadline).

  

(e) _Other Exchange Procedures and Election Mechanics_. Prior to or promptly
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to send to
each holder of Company Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time
a letter of transmittal and instructions to be in such form and have
such provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree (which shall
specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Ownership Evidence to the Exchange
Agent) for use in the exchange of their Ownership Evidence for the Merger
Consideration and other amounts described herein. Each holder of Company
Shares that have been converted into the

        

right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive
promptly ****upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of the Ownership Evidence
from such holder, (i) a certificate representing the number of whole shares
of Parent Common Stock that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
this _Article IV_ in respect of all of the Company Shares evidenced by such
Ownership Evidence, (ii) a check in the amount (after giving effect to any
required tax withholdings) of (A) the Cash Consideration such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to this _Article IV_ in respect of all of the
Company Shares evidenced by such Ownership Evidence, plus (B) any cash
payable pursuant to _Section 4.3(h)_ in lieu of fractional shares in respect
of the Company Shares evidenced by such Ownership Evidence, plus (C) any
unpaid dividends or other distributions with respect to the Parent Common
Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 4.3(f)_
in respect of the Company Shares evidenced by such Ownership Evidence, and in
each case, the Certificate so surrendered, if any, shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of any Ownership Evidence. In the event of a transfer of ownership
of Company Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent
Common Stock, together with a check for the cash to be paid upon due
surrender of the Ownership Evidence and any other dividends or distributions
in respect thereof, may be issued and/or paid to such a transferee if the
Ownership Evidence formerly evidencing such Company Shares is presented to
the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required by the Exchange
Agent to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. If Parent shall determine in
its reasonable discretion that any Election is not properly made with respect
to any Company Shares, such Election shall be deemed to be not in effect, and
the Company Shares covered by such Election shall, for purposes hereof, be
deemed to be Non-Election Shares, unless a proper Election is thereafter
timely filed. Any Company shareholder may, at any time prior to the Election
Deadline, change his, her or its Election by written notice received by the
Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly
completed and signed, revised Form of Election. Any Company shareholder may,
at any time prior to the Election Deadline, revoke his, her or its Election
by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the
Election Deadline. All Elections shall be revoked automatically if the
Exchange Agent is notified in writing by Parent or the Company that this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_. If any
certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock is to be issued in a name other
than that in which the Ownership Evidence surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Person
requesting such exchange shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock in
a name other than that of the registered holder of the Ownership Evidence
surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of Parent or the Exchange
Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. For the purposes of
this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any individual,
corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, association,
organization, Governmental Entity or other entity or person of any kind or
nature, and the term " _Ownership Evidence_ " shall mean (x) a Certificate
(or affidavit of loss with respect to such Certificate and such other
documentation as is described in _Section 4.3(j)_ ), together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, or (y) receipt of an "agents message" by
the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer
of Uncertificated

        

Company Shares. Notwithstanding the provisions herein regarding the issuance
of certificates for Parent Common Stock, if at the time the Exchange Agent
sends to the holders of Company Shares a letter of transmittal and
instructions Parent shall have adopted and implemented procedures permitting
shareholders of Parent generally to hold uncertificated shares of Parent
Common Stock, such letter of transmittal and instructions may
include provisions reasonably acceptable to the Company, and Parent may adopt
and instruct the Exchange Agent to follow procedures reasonably acceptable to
the Company, for the issuance of Stock Consideration to holders of
uncertificated Company Shares, or other holders of Company Shares so
electing, in uncertificated shares of Parent Common Stock.

  

(f) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares; Voting_.

  

(i) Whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by Parent in
respect of Parent Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the
Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other
distributions in respect of all shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions in respect of
such Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered or
undelivered Ownership Evidence until such Ownership Evidence is provided to
the Exchange Agent or Parent in accordance with this _Article IV_. Subject to
the effect of applicable Laws, following surrender or delivery, as
applicable, of any such Ownership Evidence to the Exchange Agent or Parent in
accordance with this _Article IV_ , there shall be issued and/or paid to the
holder of the Ownership Evidence representing whole shares of Parent Common
Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (A) at the time of such
surrender or delivery, as the case may be, the dividends or other
distributions with a record date at or after the Effective Time and a payment
date on or prior to the date of issuance of such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock and not previously paid and (B) at the appropriate payment date,
the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date at or after the Effective
Time on the Closing Date but with a payment date subsequent to surrender or
delivery and not previously paid.

  

(ii) Registered holders of unsurrendered or undelivered Ownership Evidence
shall be entitled to vote after the Effective Time at any meeting of Parents
shareholders with a record date at or after the Effective Time the number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock evidenced by such Ownership Evidence,
regardless of whether such holders have surrendered or delivered, as
applicable, their Ownership Evidence.

  

(g) _Transfers_. At or after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers
on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Company Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

(h) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued
in respect of any Company Shares and any holder of Company Shares entitled
to receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock but for this _Section
4.3(h)_ shall be entitled to receive in lieu thereof an amount in cash
(without interest) determined by multiplying such fraction (rounded to the
nearest one-hundredth of a share) by the average of the closing price of a
share of Parent Common Stock as quoted on the New York Stock Exchange ("
_NYSE_ ") (as reported in the

        

New York City edition of The Wall Street Journal or, if not reported thereby,
another authoritative source), for each of the five consecutive trading days
ending on and including the last trading day prior to the Closing Date.

  

(i) _Termination of Exchange Fund; Unclaimed Merger Consideration_.
Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments
thereof and any shares of Parent Common Stock) that remains unclaimed by
the shareholders of the Company twelve (12) months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Parent at Parents option.  Any shareholders of the
Company who have not theretofore complied with this _Article IV_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of their shares of Parent Common
Stock and payment of cash in respect of the Cash Consideration and any other
cash, dividends and other distributions in respect thereof payable or
deliverable pursuant to _Section 4.1_, _Section 4.3(f)_ and _Section
4.3(h)_ upon due surrender of their Ownership Evidence, without any interest
thereon.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable
to any former holder of Company Shares for any amount properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws.

  

(j) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and the posting by such Person of a bond in the form customarily
required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, and the submission of such
other documentation as Parent customarily requires for the replacement of
lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, the Exchange Agent (or Parent
pursuant to _Section 4.3(i)_) will deliver a certificate evidencing the
ownership of such number of shares of Parent Common Stock and/or any cash,
dividends and other distributions in respect thereof issuable and/or payable
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate pursuant to this
Agreement.

  

4.4. _Dissenters  Rights_.

  

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary and to
the extent available under the MGBCL, Company Shares that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any shareholder
who is entitled to exercise, and properly exercises, dissenters rights with
respect to such Company Shares (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and
who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 351.455 and
Sections 351.870 _et seq_. of the MGBCL, shall not be converted into,
exchangeable for or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration.
 Any such shareholder shall instead be entitled to receive payment of
the fair value of such shareholders Dissenting Shares in accordance with
the provisions of the MGBCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that all
Dissenting Shares held by any shareholder who shall have failed to perfect or
who otherwise shall have withdrawn, in accordance with the MGBCL, or lost
such shareholders rights to demand an appraisal and payment in respect of
such Company Shares under the MGBCL, shall thereupon be deemed to have
been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective
Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon, upon surrender or delivery, as applicable, of the Ownership Evidence
that formerly evidenced such Company Shares.

by the Company for payment for Dissenting Shares, withdrawals of such demands
and any other instruments, notices or other documents served pursuant to the
MGBCL with respect thereto, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and

outstanding as a result of a distribution, reclassification, stock split
(including a reverse split), stock dividend or distribution,
recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or
other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted to eliminate the effects of such event on the Merger Consideration.

  

4.6. _Company Stock Based Plans_.

  

(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Company Shares
other than rights granted under the ESPP (a " _Company Option_ ") under the
Company Compensation and Benefit Plans identified in _Section 5.1(h)(i) of
the Company Disclosure Letter_ as being the only Company Compensation and
Benefit Plans pursuant to which Company Shares may be issued (the " _Company
Stock Plans_ "), whether vested or unvested, shall be converted into an
option to acquire a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (i) the number of
Company Shares subject to the Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per
Company Share of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the
exercise price and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable
pursuant to the Company Options shall be determined in a manner consistent
with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code; and _provided_ , _further_
, that in the case of any Company Option to which Section 422 of the Code
applies, the option price, the number of shares purchasable pursuant to such
option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be
determined in accordance with the foregoing, subject to such adjustments as
are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 424(a) of the
Code. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt such
amendments to the Company Stock Plans, the board of directors of the Company
shall adopt such resolutions, and the Company shall otherwise take all
actions, as are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this _Section
4.6(a)_. Parent shall take all actions as are necessary for the assumption of
the Company Stock Plans other than the ESPP pursuant to this _Section 4.6_,
including the issuance (subject to _Section 4.6(d)_) and listing of
Parent Common Stock as necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by
this _Section 4.6_.

  

(b) Each Company Share subject to a restricted stock agreement under the
Company Stock Plans (" _Company Restricted Stock_ ") and that was issued or
issuable as of the

        

date hereof shall be fully vested and no longer subject to forfeiture
immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall be converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 4.1(a)_. At the
Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to acquire or
receive Company Shares or benefits measured by the value of Company Shares,
and each award of any kind consisting of Company Shares that may be held,
awarded, outstanding, payable or reserved for issuance under the Company
Stock Plans other than Company Options, rights granted under the ESPP and
Company Restricted Stock (the " _Company Awards_ "), shall be deemed to be
converted into the right to acquire or receive benefits measured by the value
of the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (i)
the number of Company Shares subject to such Company Award immediately prior
to the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio, if any such Company Award
provided for an exercise price, such exercise price shall be adjusted as
provided in _Section 4.6(a)_ with respect to Company Options, and each such
right shall otherwise be subject to the terms and conditions applicable to
such right under the relevant Company Stock Plan. At or prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall adopt such amendments to the Company Stock Plans, the
board of directors of the Company shall adopt such resolutions, and the
Company shall otherwise take all actions, as are necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this _Section 4.6(b)_.

Directors of the Company, or, if appropriate, any committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company responsible for administering the Companys Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ "), shall adopt such resolutions or take
such other actions (including, if appropriate, amending the terms of the
ESPP) as may be required to provide that (i) participants may not increase
their payroll deductions or purchase elections from those in effect on the
date of this Agreement during the period commencing on the date hereof and
concluding on March 31, 2007; (ii) any outstanding rights to purchase shares
of Company Common Stock under the ESPP shall terminate on the close of
business on the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that immediately prior to the termination of such
rights, all amounts allocated to each participants account under the ESPP as
of such date shall thereupon be used to purchase whole shares of Company
Common Stock at a price to be determined in accordance with the terms of the
ESPP (with the closing price of Company Common Stock on the last trading day
immediately prior to the Closing Date being deemed to be the quarter-end
closing price of Company Common Stock for this purpose) and each participant
with any such outstanding rights shall be afforded with a reasonable
opportunity to make an Election with respect to such shares of Company Common
Stock; and (iii) the ESPP shall be terminated immediately following the
purchases of Company Common Stock on the Business Day immediately prior to
the Closing Date.  Except as set forth in this _Section 4.6(c)_ , each
current and/or future participant in the ESPP shall be entitled to
participate in accordance with its terms in effect on the date hereof (as
amended to the extent required by this _Section 4.6(c)_ ).

  

(d) If registration of any interests in the Company Stock Plans or the shares
of Parent Common Stock issuable thereunder is required under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), Parent shall file with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ "), as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time, a registration statement on Form
S-8 (or any successor form) with respect to such interests and Parent Common
Stock and shall use reasonable best efforts to have such
registration statement

        

declared effective as soon as practicable following such filing and to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement (and maintain the
current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so
long as the relevant Company Stock Plans remain in effect and such
registration of interests therein or the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable thereunder continues to be required.

  

(e) Without limiting the applicability of the preceding paragraph, the
Company shall take all necessary action to ensure that the Surviving
Corporation will not be bound at the Effective Time by any options, or other
rights, awards or arrangements under the Company Stock Plans that would
entitle any Person after the Effective Time to beneficially own any Company
Shares or to receive any payments in respect thereof, and at or prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall adopt such amendments to the Company Stock
Plans, the board of directors of the Company shall adopt such resolutions,
and the Company shall otherwise take all actions, as are necessary to
effectuate the provisions of this _Section 4.6(e)_.

group beneficially owns 5% or more of the Companys outstanding voting
securities, with the terms "group" and "beneficially owns" having the
meanings ascribed to them under Rule 13d-3 and Rule 13d-5 under the Exchange

The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken
all corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform
its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate, subject only to

directors of the Company, (i) has received from each of CIBC World Markets

Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of
Company

governmental entity (" _Governmental Entity_ "), in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and the
consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, except those that the failure to make or obtain would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, " _HSR Act_ " means
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended.

  

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
does not, and the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (A) a
breach or violation of, a termination (or right of termination) or a default
under, the Companys articles of incorporation or bylaws or the comparable
governing instruments of any of the Companys Subsidiaries, (B) a breach or
violation of, or a default or termination (or right of termination) under,

Company Disclosure Letter_ sets forth a correct and complete list of the
Contracts of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to which consents or
waivers are required as of the date hereof prior to consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement other than those where
the failure to obtain such consents or waivers would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

  

(e) _Company Reports; Financial Statements_.

  

(i) The Company has filed and furnished all forms, statements, reports and
documents required to be filed or furnished by it with or to the SEC pursuant
to applicable securities statutes, regulations, policies and rules since
March 31, 2005 (the " _Audit Date_ ") (collectively, such forms, statements,
reports and documents filed with or furnished to the SEC since the Audit
Date, and those filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of
this Agreement, and as amended, the " _Company Reports_ "). The Company
Reports were prepared in all material respects in accordance with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder. Each of the Company Reports, at the time of its
filing or being furnished complied, or if not yet filed or furnished, will
comply, in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as
amended (" _Sarbanes-Oxley_ "), and any rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder applicable to the Company Reports. As of their respective
dates (and, if amended, as of the date of such amendment) the Company Reports
did not, and any of the Company Reports filed with or furnished to the
SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement will not, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of
the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading.

  

(ii) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act). Such
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable
assurance that material information relating to the Company, including its
consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the Companys principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer by others within those entities,
particularly during the periods in which the periodic reports required under
the Exchange Act are being prepared. Such disclosure controls and procedures
are effective in providing reasonable assurance of alerting in a timely
manner the Companys principal executive officer and principal financial
officer to material information required to be included in the Companys
periodic and current reports required under the Exchange Act. The Company and
its Subsidiaries have established and maintained a system of internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act)
("internal controls"). Such internal controls are designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the

        

Companys financial reporting and the preparation of the Companys financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.  The Company has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of internal controls prior to
the date of this Agreement, to the Companys auditors and the audit committee
of the Companys board of directors (x) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (y) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Companys internal controls over
financial reporting. The Company has made available to Parent prior to the
date of this Agreement a summary of any such disclosure made by management to
the Companys auditors and audit committee since December 31, 2004.

  

(iii) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Company Reports (including the related notes and
schedules) fairly presents, or will fairly present, in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
its date and each of the consolidated statements of operations, cash flows
and of changes in shareholders equity included in or incorporated by
reference into the Company Reports (including any related notes and
schedules) fairly presents, or will fairly present, in all material respects
the results of operations, retained earnings and changes in financial
position, as the case may be, of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the
periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
the absence of notes and normal year-end audit adjustments), in each case in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_
") consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be
noted therein.

  

(f) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since March 31, 2006 and through the date
of this Agreement, (i) there has not been any event, occurrence, discovery
or development which has had or would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect, (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their
respective businesses only in, and have not engaged in any material
transaction other than in accordance with, the ordinary and usual course of
such businesses consistent with past practices, (iii) there has not been any

of services, termination of employment or the provision of services, or
failure to employ or retain any individual) pending or, to the Knowledge of

facts or circumstances that are reasonably likely to result in any claims
against or obligations or liabilities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, except for those that would not individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

(h) _Employee Benefits_.

  

(i) Each benefit and compensation plan, contract, policy or arrangement
maintained, sponsored or contributed to by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries covering current or former employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or any of them (" _Company Employees_ ") or current or former
directors, independent contractors or leased employees of the Company,
including, but not limited to, "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of
Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended (" _ERISA_ "), and incentive and bonus, severance, perquisites,
deferred compensation, stock purchase, restricted stock, stock option, stock
appreciation rights or stock based plans (the " _Company Compensation and
Benefit Plans_ ") is listed in _Section 5.1(h)(i) of the Company Disclosure
Letter_ and each such Company Compensation and Benefit Plan which has
received a favorable or unfavorable determination letter from the Internal
Revenue Service (" _IRS_ ") has been separately identified. True and complete
copies of each of the Company Compensation and Benefit Plans listed in
_Section 5.1(h)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter_, including, but not
limited to, any trust agreement, insurance contract, funding arrangement or
administrative services agreement forming a part of or relating to, any of
the Company Compensation and Benefit Plans, and all amendments thereto and
all summary plan descriptions or other summaries thereof, have been made
available to Parent.

  

(ii) Each of the Company Compensation and Benefit Plans, other than
"multiemployer plans" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA (each, a "
_Multiemployer Plan_ "), is in compliance with, to the extent applicable,
ERISA and, the Code, and other applicable Laws except for such failures as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Each Company

        

Compensation and Benefit Plan which is subject to ERISA (a " _Company ERISA
Plan_ ") that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of
Section 3(2) of ERISA (a " _Company Pension Plan_ ") and that is intended to
be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS covering all tax Law changes prior to the
Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 or has applied to
the IRS for such favorable determination letter within the applicable
remedial amendment period under Section 401(b) of the Code, and the Company
is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in the loss of the
qualification of such plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. Each Company
Pension Plan has been timely amended for all Tax Law changes subsequent to
and including the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001.
None of the Company Compensation and Benefit Plans is intended to be part of
a voluntary employees beneficiary association within the meaning of Section
501(c) (9) of the Code. There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened litigation relating to the Company Compensation
and Benefit Plans or any of them except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a
transaction with respect to any Company ERISA Plan that would subject the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to a tax or penalty imposed by either
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
incurred or reasonably expects to incur a tax or penalty imposed by Section
4980F of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA except as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

  

(iii) The Company and its Subsidiaries, and its ERISA Affiliates have not
incurred and do not expect to incur any withdrawal liability with respect to
a Multiemployer Plan under Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA (regardless of
whether based on contributions of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
ERISA Affiliates). Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates
maintains or contributes to or has ever maintained, contributed to, or had
any obligation to contribute to, any plans subject to Title IV of
ERISA, Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _ERISA Affiliate_ " means, as to a Person, any other Person
which is considered one employer with such Person under Section 4001 of ERISA
or Section 414 of the Code.

  

(iv) All contributions required to be made under each of the Company
Compensation and Benefit Plans have been timely made and all obligations in
respect of each of the Company Compensation and Benefit Plans have been
properly accrued and reflected on the most recent consolidated balance sheet
filed or incorporated by reference in the Company Reports prior to the date
of this Agreement to the extent required by GAAP.

  

(v) Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries have any obligations for retiree
health or life benefits under any Company ERISA Plans or collective
bargaining agreement, except as required by Section 4980B of the Code or
Section 601 of ERISA.

  

(vi) There has been no amendment to, announcement by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage
under, any of the Company Compensation and Benefit Plans that would increase

        

materially the expense of maintaining such plan above the level of the
expense incurred therefor for the most recently completed fiscal year of the
Company. None of the execution of this Agreement, shareholder approval of
this Agreement, receipt of approval or clearance from any one or more
Governmental Entities of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the termination of the employment of any of
the Company Employees within a specified time of the Effective Time will (A)
entitle any employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries to severance pay or
any increase in severance pay upon any termination of employment after the
date of this Agreement; (B) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or
result in any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of
compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or result in any
other material obligation pursuant to, any of the Company Compensation and
Benefit Plans; or (C) limit or restrict the right of the Company, or, after
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent,
to merge, amend or terminate any of the Company Compensation and Benefit
Plans.

  

(vii) Other than payments or benefits that may be made or provided to the
persons listed in _Section 5.1(h)(vii) of the Company Disclosure Letter_ ("
_Primary Company Executives_ "), no amount or other entitlement or economic
benefit that could be received (whether in cash or property or the vesting of
property) as a result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
obtaining of Shareholder Approval, the consummation of the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement (including as a result of
termination of employment on or following the Effective Time) by or for the
benefit of any director, officer, employee, independent contractor or
consultant of the Company or any of its Affiliates who is a "disqualified
individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section
1.280G-1), whether under any Company Compensation and Benefit Plan, agreement
with a Company Employee or otherwise, would be characterized as an "excess
parachute payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the
Code), and no such disqualified individual is entitled to receive any
Parachute Gross Up Payment. _Section 5.1(h)(vii) of the Company Disclosure
Letter_ sets forth, calculated as of the date of this Agreement, (i) the
"base amount" (as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) for
each Primary Company Executive and each other disqualified
individual (defined as set forth above) whose Company Options, Company
Restricted Stock or Company Awards will vest pursuant to their terms in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the obtaining
of Shareholder Approval, the consummation of the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement (including as a result of any
termination of employment on or following the Effective Time) and (ii) the
estimated maximum amount of "parachute payments" as defined in Section 280G
of the Code (including any "parachute payment" resulting from the vesting of
any Company Option, Company Restricted Stock or Company Awards) that could be
paid or provided to each Primary Company Executive and such other
disqualified individual as a result of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the obtaining of Shareholder Approval, the consummation of the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement (including as
a result of any termination of employment on or following the Effective
Time). For purposes of this Agreement, " _Parachute Gross Up Payment_ " means
any additional payment from the Company or Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, the Surviving Corporation or any other Person in the
event that the excise tax required by Section 4999(a) of the Code is imposed
on such disqualified individual.

outside of the United States or otherwise covers or is maintained for the
benefit of any Company Employees working outside of the United States or is
subject to the Laws of any country other than the United States.

  

(i) _Compliance with Laws; Licenses_. The businesses of each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries have not been conducted in violation of any law
(including common law), statute, ordinance, rule, regulation or similar
requirement of any Governmental Entity (other than any Order) (collectively,
" _Laws_ ") or any Order, including any Laws or Orders relating to (i) the
protection of human health, occupational safety, the environment or natural
resources or (ii) wages, hours, WARN or any similar state or local "mass
layoff" or "plant closing" Law, collective bargaining, discrimination, civil
rights, workers compensation or the collection and payment of withholding
and/or social security taxes or any similar tax, except for violations that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. No investigation or review by
any Governmental Entity with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, nor
has any Governmental Entity provided written notice to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries of its intention to conduct the same, except for those the
outcome of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.  The Company has not
received any notice or communication of any material noncompliance with any
such Laws that has not been cured as of the date of this Agreement, except
for such changes and noncompliance that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has obtained and is in substantial
compliance with all permits, licenses, certifications, approvals,
registrations, consents, authorizations, franchises, variances, exemptions
and orders issued or granted by a Governmental Entity (collectively, "
_Licenses_ ") necessary to conduct its business as presently conducted,
except for those the absence of which, or failure to be in compliance with
which, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

The Contracts described in clauses (A)  (O), together with all exhibits and

contractual obligation, and " _Indebtedness_ " shall mean, as to any Person,
such Persons liabilities for borrowed money, obligations under promissory

(including all exhibits and schedules thereto) as an exhibit to the Company

to confidentiality. Each such Contract is a valid and binding agreement of
the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, and is in full
force and effect, except where the failure to be in full force and effect
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any other party thereto is
in default or breach under the terms of any such Company Material Contract

likely to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect, and no written notice
to terminate, in whole or in part, has been served.

  

(iii) No Company Material Contract has been secured in violation of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977.

  

(iv) With respect to each Governmental Contract, except as would not,

Governmental Contract; and (C) no termination for convenience, termination

Governmental Contract; (y) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries

disclosure to the United States government with respect to any alleged
irregularity, misstatement or omission arising under or relating to a

constitutes approval of this Agreement and the Merger

        

for purposes of Sections 351.459 and 351.407 of the MGBCL and represents the
only action necessary to ensure that Sections 351.459 and 351.407 of the
MGBCL do not and will not apply to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. No "business combination," "fair price,"
"moratorium," "control share acquisition," or other similar anti-takeover
statute or regulation enacted under state or federal Laws in the United
States (each, a " _Takeover Statute_ ") as in effect on the date of this
Agreement (with the exception of Section 351.459 and 351.407 of the MGBCL) is

of the Company, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is in material
breach of or default under such lease or sublease, and, to the Knowledge of
the Company, no event has occurred which, with notice, lapse of time or both,
would constitute a material breach or default by any of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or permit termination, modification or acceleration by any third
party thereunder, or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. A correct
and complete copy of each lease or sublease for Leased Real Property which is
a Company Material Contract has previously been made available to Parent.

  

(iii) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has good and valid title to or

or in the aggregate have not materially interfered with, and would not
reasonably be expected to materially interfere with, its ability to conduct
its business as currently conducted.

  

(m) _Tax Matters_. As of the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor
any of its Affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action, nor do the
executive officers of the Company have any knowledge of any fact

this Agreement (it being agreed that any changes, circumstances, effects,
events or occurrences giving rise or contributing to any such change or

whether there has been or would reasonably be likely to be, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect) or (z) the execution , announcement or performance of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (provided that this clause
(z) shall not apply for purposes of _Section 5.2(d)_ or any determination
hereunder based thereon), unless, in the case of the foregoing clauses (v),
(w) and (x)(II), such changes referred to therein primarily relate only to

rights, options,

        



  

warrants, conversion rights, stock appreciation rights, redemption rights,
repurchase rights, agreements, arrangements, calls, commitments or rights of
any kind that obligate Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to issue or sell any

(c) _Corporate Authority; Approval and Financial Advisor Opinion_.
Parent and Merger Sub each have all requisite corporate power and authority
and each has taken all corporate action necessary in order to execute,
deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate
the Merger. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and
Merger Sub and is a valid and binding agreement of Parent and Merger Sub,
enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its
terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. The shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger, when issued pursuant
to this Agreement, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, and no shareholder of Parent will have any preemptive right of

or (C) to comply with state securities or "blue-sky" laws, no filings,
notices and/or reports are required to be made by Parent or Merger Sub with,
nor are any consents, registrations, approvals, permits or authorizations
required to be obtained by Parent or Merger Sub from, any Governmental
Entity, in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation by Parent and Merger
Sub of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, except
those that the failure to make or obtain would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not, constitute or
result in (A) a breach or violation of, or a default or termination (or right
of termination) under, Parents articles of incorporation or bylaws or the
comparable governing instruments of any of its " _Significant Subsidiaries_ "
(as defined in Rule 1.02(w) of Regulation S-X promulgated pursuant to the
Exchange Act), (B) a breach or violation of, or a default or termination (or
right of termination) under, the acceleration of any obligations or the

of any party under any of its Contracts, except, in the case of clauses (B),
(C) or (D) above, for any breach, violation, termination, default,
acceleration, creation or change that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The
Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth a correct and complete list of the
Contracts pursuant to which consents or waivers are required prior to
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement other than
those where the failure to obtain such consents or waivers would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

  

(e) _Parent Reports; Financial Statements_.

  

(i) Parent has filed and furnished all forms, statements, reports and
documents required to be filed or furnished by it with or to the SEC pursuant
to applicable securities statutes, regulations, policies and rules since

(as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act). Such disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that
material information relating to Parent, including its consolidated
Subsidiaries, is made known to Parents principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer by others within those entities, particularly
during the periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange
Act are being prepared. Such disclosure controls and procedures are
effective in providing reasonable assurance of alerting in a timely manner
Parents principal executive officer and principal financial officer to
material information required to be included in Parents periodic and current
reports required under the Exchange Act. Parent and its Subsidiaries have
established and maintained a system of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) ("internal
controls"). Such internal controls are designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of Parents financial reporting and the
preparation of Parents financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP. Parent has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation of internal controls prior to the date of this Agreement, to
Parents auditors and the audit committee of Parents board of directors (x)
any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal controls which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect Parents ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in
Parents internal controls over financial reporting.  Parent has made
available to the Company prior to the date of this Agreement a summary of any
such disclosure made by management to Parents auditors and audit committee
since December 31, 2004.

  

(iii) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Parent Reports (including the related notes and schedules)
fairly presents, or will fairly present, in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of Parent and its Subsidiaries as of its
date, and each of the consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and
of changes in shareholders equity included in or incorporated by reference
into the Parent Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly
presents, or will fairly present, in all material respects the results of
operations, retained earnings and changes in financial position, as the case
may be, of Parent and its Subsidiaries for the periods

        



  

set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to the
absence of notes and normal year-end audit adjustments), in each case in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except
as may be noted therein.

  

(f) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since December 31, 2005 and through the
date of this Agreement, (i) there has not been any event, occurrence,
discovery or development which has had or would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to result in a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, (ii) Parent and its Subsidiaries have conducted their
respective businesses only in, and have not engaged in any material
transaction other than in accordance with, the ordinary and usual course of
such businesses consistent with past practices and (iii) except for regular
quarterly cash dividends, Parent and its Subsidiaries have not declared, set
aside or paid any dividend or distribution payable in cash, stock or property
in respect of any capital stock or other securities or ownership interests.

  

(g) _Litigation and Liabilities_. There are no (i) Actions (including
any Actions brought or filed with any Governmental Entity based on, arising
out of, in connection with or otherwise relating to employment or the
provision of services, termination of employment or the provision of
services, or failure to employ or retain any individual) pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
except for those that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (ii) obligations or
liabilities, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether or
not required to be disclosed, or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other facts
or circumstances that are reasonably likely to result in any claims against
or obligations or liabilities of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except
for those that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

(h) _Employee Benefits_.

  

(i) Each material benefit and compensation plan, contract, policy or
arrangement maintained, sponsored or contributed to by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries covering current or former employees of Parent or its
Subsidiaries or any of them (" _Parent Employees_ ") or current or former
directors, independent contractors or leased employees of Parent, including,
but not limited to, material "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of
Section 3(3) of ERISA, and material incentive and bonus, perquisites,
severance, deferred compensation, stock purchase, restricted stock, stock
option, stock appreciation rights or stock based plans (the "
_Parent Compensation and Benefit Plans_ ") is listed in _Section 5.2(h)(i) of
the Parent Disclosure Letter_. Parent has made available to the Company
copies or summaries of the material terms of all Parent Compensation and
Benefit Plans that are subject to ERISA (" _Parent ERISA Plans_ "). Parent
and each of its Subsidiaries and each ERISA Affiliate of Parent is in
compliance with all applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and the
regulations and published interpretations thereunder and other applicable
Laws with respect to all Parent ERISA Plans, except where any such
noncompliance would not reasonably be likely to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Each Parent ERISA Plan that is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has been determined by the
Internal Revenue Service to be so qualified, and each trust related to such
plan has been determined to be exempt under Section 501(a) of the Code, and
Parent has no Knowledge of any circumstances

        



  

likely to result in the loss of such qualification. No liability that would
reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect has been
incurred by the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate of
Parent which remains unsatisfied with respect to any Parent ERISA Plan (other
than for benefits payable or accrued in the ordinary course under any Parent
ERISA Plan);

  

(ii) No accumulated funding deficiency (as defined in Section 412 of the
Code) has been incurred (without regard to any waiver granted under Section
412 of the Code), nor has any funding waiver from the Internal Revenue
Service been received or requested with respect to any Parent ERISA Plan that
is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of
ERISA except for any accumulated funding deficiency or funding waiver that
would not reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect; and
neither Parent nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has any liability either
directly or indirectly, that would be reasonably likely to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect with respect to a plan which is a multiemployer plan
within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA;

  

(iii) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of Parents ERISA
Affiliates has: (A) engaged in a nonexempt prohibited transaction described
in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, (B) incurred any
liability to the PBGC which remains outstanding other than the payment of
premiums and there are no premium payments which are due and unpaid, (C)
failed to make a required contribution or payment to a Multiemployer Plan, or
(D) failed to make a required installment or other required payment under
Section 412 of the Code, except where any of the foregoing individually or in
the aggregate would not reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect;

  

(iv) All contributions required to be made under each of the Parent
Compensation and Benefit Plans have been timely made and all obligations in
respect of each of the Parent Compensation and Benefit Plans have been
properly accrued and reflected on the most recent consolidated balance sheet
filed or incorporated by reference in the Parent Reports prior to the date of
this Agreement to the extent required by GAAP, except where such failure
would not reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect; and

  

(v) No amount or other entitlement or economic benefit that could be received
(whether in cash or property or the vesting of property) as a result of the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger or
any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement (including as a result
of termination of employment on or following the Effective Time) by or for
the benefit of any director, officer, employee, independent contractor or
consultant of Parent or any of its Affiliates who is a "disqualified
individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section
1.280G-1), whether under any Parent Compensation and Benefit Plan, agreement
with a Parent Employee or otherwise, would be characterized as an "excess
parachute payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the
Code).

  

(i) _Compliance with Laws; Licenses_.  The businesses of each of Parent and
its Subsidiaries have not been conducted in violation of any Law or any
Order, including any Laws or Orders relating to (i) the protection of human
health, occupational safety, the

        



  

environment or natural resources or (ii) wages, hours, WARN or any similar
state or local "mass layoff" or "plant closing" Law, collective bargaining,
discrimination, civil rights, workers compensation or the collection and
payment of withholding and/or social security taxes or any similar tax,
except for violations that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No
investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity provided written notice to Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries of its intention to conduct the same, except for
those the outcome of which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent has
not received any notice or communication of any material noncompliance with
any such Laws that has not been cured as of the date of this Agreement,
except for such changes and noncompliance that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has obtained, and is in substantial
compliance with, all Licenses necessary to conduct its business as presently
conducted, except for those the absence of which, or failure to be in
compliance with which, would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

payment mechanism; or

  

(I) any Contract regarding any disposition of assets or a business by Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries to which there may be any future obligation on the
part of Parent to make additional payments or as to which there is any
continuing liability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, if such additional

immediately prior to such transaction.

the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries have been collected and
maintained in compliance with applicable Privacy Statements and other

use of such data in the conduct of the business of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, as currently conducted and as proposed by Parent to be
conducted, does not violate in any material respect any applicable Privacy
Statement or other Contract, except for violations that, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

(iii) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall merge, consolidate or

6.2. _Acquisition Proposals_.

  

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. The Company agrees that neither it nor
any of its Subsidiaries nor any of its or its Subsidiaries directors or
officers shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its and its Subsidiaries employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants and other agents, advisors or representatives (such directors,
officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other
agents, advisors or representatives, collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not
to, directly or indirectly:

  

(i) initiate, solicit, or knowingly facilitate or encourage, any inquiries or
the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal;

  

(ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or provide any non-public information or non-public
data to any Person in connection with or in response to, or otherwise
knowingly facilitate or encourage, any Acquisition Proposal;

  

(iii) modify, amend, terminate, waive or release any standstill or similar
agreement to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party applicable to any
Acquisition Proposal; or

  

(iv) take any action to render any Takeover Statute inapplicable to an

exclude any person from the applicability of any Takeover Statute in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal.

  

Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, at any time prior
to the time, but not after, this Agreement is approved by the Companys
shareholders at the Shareholders Meeting, the Company may (A) provide
information in response to a request therefor by a Person who has made an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if the board of directors
of the Company receives from the Person so requesting such information an
executed confidentiality agreement on terms with respect to confidentiality
of information substantially similar to those contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement; or (B) engage in discussions or
negotiations with any Person who has made such an unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal, if (x) in each such case referred to in clause
(A) or (B) above, the board of directors of the Company determines in good
faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that the

        

failure to take such action is inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; and (y) in each such case referred to in clause (A) or
(B), if the board of directors of the Company has determined in good
faith based on all the information then available and after consultation with
the Companys financial advisors and legal counsel that such Acquisition
Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to
result in a Superior Proposal. In the event that the Company shall enter
into any such confidentiality agreement containing a standstill provision
which is applicable for a period which is shorter than the period of the
standstill applicable to Parent (or in the event such confidentiality
agreement shall contain no standstill provision), the period of the
standstill applicable to Parent shall automatically be reduced to the
period of the standstill applicable to such Person (or be eliminated in the
event such confidentiality agreement shall contain no standstill provision).

  

(b) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

  

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means (i) any proposal or offer with respect to a
merger, joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation,
tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange, business
combination or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries whose assets individually or in the aggregate, constitute more
than 20% of the consolidated assets of the Company or (ii) any proposal or
offer to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of any
class of the Companys equity securities or those of any of its Subsidiaries
whose assets individually or in the aggregate constitute more than 20% of the
consolidated assets of the Company or of the Companys consolidated assets
(including equity securities of its Subsidiaries); _provided_ that in no
event shall the Merger or any proposal or offer made by or on behalf of
Parent pursuant to _Section 6.2(c)(ii)_ hereof be deemed to constitute an
"Acquisition Proposal."

  

" _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal
involving more than 50% of the consolidated assets of the Company or more
than 50% of the total voting power of the equity securities of the Company
that the Companys board of directors has determined in its good faith
judgment is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms,
taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the
proposal and the Person making the proposal, and if consummated, would result
in a transaction more favorable to the Companys shareholders from a
financial point of view than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement
(after taking into account any written revisions to the terms of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement agreed to by Parent pursuant to
_Section 6.2(c)_).

  

(c) _No Change in Recommendation_. The board of directors of the Company,
and each committee thereof shall not:

withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company
Recommendation, or approve or recommend to the Companys shareholders any
Acquisition Proposal; or

  

(B) cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, indication of interest, agreement in principle,

        

acquisition agreement, merger agreement, joint venture agreement, option
agreement or similar document or Contract (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to in _Section 6.2(a)_ entered into in the circumstances
referred to in _Section 6.2(a)_) relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

  

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the time, but not after, this Agreement is approved by the
Companys shareholders at the Shareholders Meeting, the Companys board of
directors may withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify the Company
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent, or approve, recommend or
otherwise declare advisable any Superior Proposal made after the date hereof
and not solicited, encouraged or initiated in breach of this Agreement, if,
subject to compliance with this _Section 6.2_, the Companys board of
directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law in connection with a Superior Proposal (a "
_Company Change of Recommendation_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that no
Company Change of Recommendation may be made until after at least
three Business Days following Parents receipt of written notice from the
Company advising that the Companys board of directors intends to take such
action and the basis therefor. The Company agrees (A) that during the three-
Business Day period prior to its taking any action referred to in this
_Section 6.2(c)(ii)_, the Company and its Representatives shall, if
requested by Parent, negotiate in good faith with Parent and its
Representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent and (B) the Company may
take any such action with respect to an Acquisition Proposal that was a
Superior Proposal only if such Acquisition Proposal continues to be
a Superior Proposal in light of any revisions to the terms of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent and any other information
provided by Parent.

  

(d) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this _Section
6.2_ shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from complying with its
disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state law with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its shareholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communication to shareholders); _provided_ ,
that such disclosure is consistent with this _Section 6.2_ , _provided_ ,
_further_ , that such obligations will in no way eliminate or modify the
effect that any action pursuant to such disclosure would otherwise have under
this Agreement.

  

(e) _Existing Discussions_. The Company agrees that it will immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions
or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it will take the necessary
steps to promptly inform the individuals or entities referred to in the first
sentence hereof of the obligations undertaken in this _Section 6.2_.
The Company also agrees that it will promptly request any Person that
has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with
its consideration of acquiring it or any of its Subsidiaries or making
an Acquisition Proposal to return or destroy all confidential
information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of it or any
of its Subsidiaries.

        

(f) _Notice_. The board of directors of the Company shall not take any of the
actions referred to in clauses (A) or (B) of _Section 6.2 (a)_ unless the
Company shall have delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent

offers (including all material terms and conditions of any material
amendments thereto). The Company also agrees to provide any information to
Parent (to the extent that such information has not been previously provided
or made available to Parent) that it is providing to another Person pursuant
to this _Section 6.2_ promptly following the time it provides such
information to such other Person.

  

6.3. _Proxy Statement and Registration Statement; Information Supplied_.

  

(a) The Company and Parent shall cooperate in preparing and the Company shall
cause to be filed with the SEC, as promptly as practicable after the

Meeting, and Parent shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC, as promptly
as practicable, a Registration Statement on Form S-4, in which the Proxy
Statement will be included as a prospectus, pursuant to which shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable in the Merger will be registered with the SEC
(including the Proxy Statement, the " _S-4 Registration Statement_ "). Parent

Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after such filing, and to keep the S-4 Registration

and prepare written responses with respect to any written comments received
from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and the S-4 Registration
Statement and advise one another of any oral comments received from the SEC.

contemplated by this Agreement and will pay all expenses incident thereto.
The Company will cause the Proxy Statement, and Parent will cause the S-4
Registration Statement, to comply as to form in all material respects with
the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder. Each party will advise the other, promptly
after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the S-4 Registration
Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed,

Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering

        

or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the
Proxy Statement or the S-4 Registration Statement or comments thereon and
responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information.  No
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or the S-4 Registration
Statement shall be filed without the approval of both parties hereto, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

(b) The Company and Parent each agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries,
that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it or its
Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the S-4
Registration Statement will, at the time the S-4 Registration Statement is
filed, at any time it is amended or supplemented, or at the time it becomes
effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and (ii)
the Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date
of mailing to shareholders and at the time of the Shareholders

material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

by the Company with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference
therein based on information supplied by Parent for inclusion or incorporated
by reference in the Proxy Statement or the S-4 Registration Statement and

event with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or with respect
to other information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporated by
reference in the Proxy Statement or the S-4 Registration Statement or (ii)
any event with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or with respect
to other information supplied by Parent for inclusion or incorporated by
reference in the Proxy Statement or the S-4 Registration Statement, in any
case which event is required to be described in an amendment of, or a
supplement to, the Proxy Statement or S-4 Registration Statement, the Company
or Parent, as the case may be, will promptly inform the other of such
occurrence and cooperate in promptly filing with the SEC or its staff and, as
required by law, disseminating to shareholders of the Company such amendment
or supplement.

  

6.4. _Shareholders Meeting_.

  

(a) The Company will take, in accordance with applicable Law and its articles
of incorporation and bylaws, all action necessary to convene and hold a
meeting of holders of Company Shares to consider and vote upon the approval
of this Agreement (the " _Shareholders Meeting_ ") as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the S-4 Registration Statement is declared effective and in
any event will use its reasonable best efforts to convene the Shareholders
Meeting not later than 90 days after the date of this Agreement (or, if
later, not more than 30 days after the date the S-4 Registration Statement is
declared effective).

        

Subject to the provisions of _Section 6.2_ hereof, the Companys board of
directors shall recommend in the Proxy Statement and at any other time to the
extent necessary to comply with applicable Law that the holders of Company
Shares approve this Agreement and shall take all reasonable lawful action to
solicit the Company Requisite Vote.

  

(b) Notwithstanding any Company Change of Recommendation, unless this
Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with its terms pursuant to
_Article VIII_ , the Company shall nonetheless submit this Agreement to the
holders of Company Shares for approval at the Shareholders Meeting.

  

(c) If requested by Parent, the Company shall promptly take all actions
necessary to permit Parent to solicit holders of the Company Shares to
approve a transaction contemplated by _Section 6.1(b)(ii)(B)_ as promptly as
practicable after such request, including by making available to Parent all
information necessary to solicit the vote of shareholders of the Company in
connection with such proposal.

  

6.5. _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_.

  

(a) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to
Parent and its directors a letter of its independent auditors, dated (i) the
date on which the S-4 Registration Statement shall become effective and (ii)
the Closing Date, and addressed to Parent and its directors, in form and
substance customary for "comfort" letters delivered by independent public
accountants in connection with registration statements similar to the S-4
Registration Statement.

  

(b) Parent and the Company shall, subject to _Section 6.2_, cooperate with
each other and use, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use
reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly
as reasonably practicable, including:

  

(i) preparing and filing, as promptly as reasonably practicable, all
documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings and
to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, registrations, approvals,
permits and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any
third party and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  

(ii) making, as promptly as practicable, and in any event within 10 Business
Days following the date of this Agreement, an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  

(iii) defending, in oral and written communications with appropriate
Governmental Entities or private third parties, the merits and competitive
efficiencies of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in order to resolve any antitrust concerns, whether federal, state,
foreign or private; and

        

(iv) subject to first having used reasonable best efforts to negotiate a
resolution of any objections underlying such lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, defending, contesting and resisting any lawsuits, other legal
proceedings, decisions, determinations or rulings, whether judicial or
administrative, initiated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (" _FTC_ ") or
the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (" _Antitrust
Division_ ") or any state Attorney General, challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (" _Competition Challenge_ "), including seeking to have vacated,
lifted, reversed, or overturned any statute, rule, regulation, decree,
judgment, injunction, or other Order, whether temporary, preliminary, or
permanent, entered by any Governmental Entity that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to have such statute, rule,
regulation, decree, judgment, injunction, or other Order repealed, rescinded,
or made inapplicable so as to permit consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  

 _provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall require, or
be construed to require, Parent to proffer to, or agree to, sell, divest,
lease, license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise hold separate or encumber,
before or after the Effective Time (except pursuant to the Merger), any
assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interest
therein of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates (or to
consent to any sale, divestiture, lease, license, transfer, disposition or
other encumbrance by Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation
****of any of their assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines,
businesses or interest therein or to consent to any agreement to take any of
the foregoing actions) or to agree to any material changes (including through
a licensing arrangement) or restriction on, or other impairment of Parent s
ability to own or operate, any such assets, licenses, operations, rights,
product lines, businesses or interests therein or Parents ability to vote,
transfer, receive dividends or otherwise exercise full ownership rights with
respect to the stock of the Surviving Corporation. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall require the Company, in connection with any resolution,
settlement or defense of a Competition Challenge, to agree to or effect any
divestiture, hold separate any business or take any other action that is not
conditioned on the consummation of the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby or that would cause a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. The Company and Parent will each request early termination of
the waiting period with respect to the Merger under the HSR Act, and will not
extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or any other antitrust or
competition Law or enter into any agreement with any Governmental Entity not
to consummate the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the other party hereto.
Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, Parent,
with the advice and participation of the Company, shall have the right to
direct all matters pertaining to the Merger with any Governmental Entity
consistent with its obligations hereunder; _provided_ that Parent and the
Company and their respective outside antitrust counsel shall have the right
to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult with
the other on and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection
with, any proposed substantive written communication with any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the S-4 Registration
Statement and the Proxy Statement). Parent and the Company will provide
counsel for the other party with copies of all filings and submissions made
by such party and all correspondence between such party (and its advisors) 

        

with any Governmental Entity and any other information supplied by such party
and such partys Affiliates to a Governmental Entity or received from such a
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the material may be redacted (A) as
necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, (B) as necessary to
address good faith legal privilege concerns, and (C) to preserve the
confidentiality of any information relating to any valuation of the Company.
 Each of Parent and the Company will promptly inform the other party
upon receipt of any material communication from the FTC, the Antitrust
Division or any other Governmental Entity regarding the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If Parent or the Company (or
any of their respective Affiliates) receives a request for additional
information or documentary material from any such Governmental Entity that is
related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such party
will endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be made, as soon as
reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party, an
appropriate response to such request.  Each party agrees not to participate
in any substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless, to
the extent feasible, it consults with antitrust counsel to the other party in
advance and, to the extent feasible, provides such antitrust counsel the
opportunity to attend and to participate. To preserve claims of attorney-
client privilege and attorney work product and to enable
confidential exchanges of documents and information pursuant to this _Section
6.5_ , each of the Company and Parent agree if reasonably requested to enter
into a joint defense agreement on reasonable terms.  In exercising the
foregoing rights, each of the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as
promptly as practicable.

  

(c) The Company and Parent each shall, upon request by the other, furnish the
other with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors,
officers and shareholders, and such other matters as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement, the S-4
Registration Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application
made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

(d) Subject to applicable Law and the instructions of any Governmental
Entity, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other apprised of the
status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or
other communications received by Parent or the Company, as the case may be,
or any of their respective Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of any
change, fact or condition that is reasonably expected to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect or of any failure of any condition to Parents
obligations to effect the Merger or a Parent Material Adverse Effect or of
any failure of any condition to the Companys obligations to effect the
Merger, respectively.

  

6.6. _Access; Consultation_. Upon reasonable notice, and except as
may otherwise be required by applicable Law, each party hereto shall (and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford the Representatives of the other
party hereto reasonable access, during normal business hours

        

throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its properties, books,
contracts and records and, during such period, shall (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the other party all information
concerning its or any of its Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel
as may reasonably be requested; _provided_ that no investigation pursuant to
this _Section 6.6_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty made by the Company or Parent hereunder; and _provided_ _further_
that the foregoing shall not require the Company or Parent to permit any
inspection, or to disclose any information, that such party has been advised
by counsel may not be provided under applicable Law or that, in the
reasonable judgment of such party, would result in the disclosure of any
trade secrets of third parties, result in the loss of a legal privilege with
respect to a material issue or violate any of its obligations with respect to
confidentiality if such party shall have used reasonable best efforts to
obtain any consent of any third party to such inspection or disclosure or
otherwise to make reasonable provision for the required inspection or
disclosure, by entry into a joint defense agreement on reasonable terms or
otherwise. All requests for information made pursuant to this _Section 6.6_
shall be directed to the General Counsel of the Company or Parent or such
Person as may be designated by such General Counsel. All such information
shall be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

6.7 _Affiliates_. _Section 6.7 of the Company Disclosure Letter_ contains a
list of those Persons who, as of the date of this Agreement, may be deemed as
of the date of the Shareholders Meeting to be affiliates of the Company for
purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act. Prior to the date of the
Shareholders Meeting, the Company shall update _Section 6.7 of the Company
Disclosure Letter_ as necessary to reflect changes from the date hereof. The
Company shall provide to Parent such information and documents as Parent
shall reasonably request for purposes of reviewing such list. The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each person identified on such
list to deliver to Parent, not later than five business days prior to
Closing, a written agreement substantially in the form attached as **Exhibit
A** hereto.

  

6.8. _Stock Exchange Listing and De-listing_. Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to
official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing Date.  The Company shall
take all actions necessary to permit the Company Shares to be de-listed from
the NASDAQ National Market (" _NASDAQ_ ") and de-registered under the
Exchange Act within ten days following the Effective Time.

  

6.9. _Publicity_. The initial press release with respect to the Merger shall
be a joint press release and thereafter the Company and Parent shall consult
with each other prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise making
public announcements with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and prior to making any filings with any third
party and/or any Governmental Entity (including any national securities
exchange) with respect thereto, except as may be required by Law,
by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any
national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service, or by the
request of any Governmental Entity.

6.10. _Employee Benefits; Employee Matters_.

  

(a) _Company Compensation and Benefit Plans_. Through December 31, 2007,
Parent shall continue, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to continue,
each of the Company plans set forth on _Section 6.10(a)(1) of the Company
Disclosure Letter_ (" _12/31/07 Plans_ ").  After December 31, 2007, the
Parent may terminate some or all of the 12/31/07 Plans and provide benefits
to employees of Surviving Corporation under Parents benefit plans. Through
December 31, 2009, Parent shall continue, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to continue, each of the Company plans set forth on _Section
6.10(a)(2) of the Company Disclosure Letter_ (" _12/31/09 Plans_ "). For
those individuals (i.e., officers and directors) who prior to Closing receive
at no cost the benefits set forth on _Section 6.10(a)(3) of the Company
Disclosure Letter_  (which the Company represents and warrants is an accurate
list of individuals and benefit costs), Parent shall increase base pay (or,
if an individual does not receive base pay, compensation) by the applicable
"base pay adjustment amount" set forth on _Section 6.10(a)(3) of the Company
Disclosure Letter_ , and such individuals will no longer be provided such
benefits at no cost after Closing. Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a
guarantee of employment for any employee, or to restrict the right of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary to terminate any employee.
Further, nothing herein shall restrict the right of Parent, Surviving
Corporation or any Subsidiary to amend the 12/31/07 Plans or the 12/31/09
Plans in accordance with the terms and conditions of such benefit plans;
_provided_ , _however_ , any amendment to the 12/31/07 Plans effective prior
to 12/31/07 and any amendment to the 12/31/09 Plans effective prior to
12/31/09 shall be approved by (i) the Parents Compensation and Benefits
Committee and (ii) by the Plan Amendment Officer, if any is then serving,
which approval by the Plan Amendment Officer shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed . As used herein, " _Plan Amendment Officer_ " means
William W. Canfield for so long as he is an active employee of the Company,
and if he is not an active employee of the Company, then any successor Plan
Amendment Officer designated by him (or if he is deceased or disabled,
designated by any previously designated and serving successor Plan Amendment
Officer) from among the senior executive employees of the Company, any such
designation requiring Parents prior written consent thereto, which will not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. No individual will be qualified to be
designated as successor Plan Amendment Officer or to serve as successor Plan
Amendment Officer unless (i) such individual is at all relevant times a
senior executive employee of the Company and (ii) prior to such service has
provided Parent with a written undertaking, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent, agreeing to serve in such capacity and not
to unreasonably withhold or delay any approval under this _Section 6.10(a)_
 requested by Parent or Parents Compensation and Benefits Committee.

  

(b) _Company Annual Incentive Plans_. Notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary in the Fiscal Year 2007 Incentive Bonus Plan Policy, the requirement
that an employee be actively employed on the date bonuses become payable in
order to be eligible for an incentive award for that period shall be deemed
satisfied so long as the employee is employed with the Company, its
Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation on March 31, 2007 and, if bonuses
have not yet been paid as of the Closing Date, as long as the employee is
employed on the Closing Date. The Company, its Subsidiaries, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall sponsor an incentive bonus plan
and an incentive commission plan for the period commencing April 1, 2007 and
ending December 31, 2008, which are

        



  

generally comparable to the Fiscal Year 2007 Incentive Bonus Plan Policy and
the TALX Corporation Incentive Commission Plan, respectively, with such
changes as it may determine are necessary or appropriate to reflect any
shorter performance period, the effect of the Merger on various performance
measures, and any other changes that would be typical when reviewing and
revising bonus plans and setting individual targets and performance criteria
from year to year. For the year beginning January 1, 2009, the Company, its
Subsidiaries, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, may replace
such incentive bonus plan and incentive commission plan with comparable
programs with no material loss of economic value.

  

(c) _Company Long-Term Incentive Plan_. As of the Closing Date, each
participants benefits under the 2006-2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan for
Selected Key Executives and the 2007-2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan for
Selected _pan_ Management Employees shall be paid out in a single lump sum
benefit, the amount of which shall be determined in the sole and
absolute discretion of the Companys Compensation Committee taking into
account the relevant performance factors as of such date relative to the
performance targets established pursuant to the terms of such plan, and
prorated based on the portion of the performance period completed as of the
Closing Date relative to the entire performance period.

  

(d) _Company Deferred Compensation Plan_. As of the Closing Date and through
December 31, 2007, Parent shall assume, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to continue, the TALX Corporation Nonqualified Savings and
Retirement Plan with the eligibility and benefit provisions of such plan as
of the date hereof (assuming such eligibility provisions continue to meet the
requirements for the plan to be exempt from certain provisions of ERISA as a
"top hat" plan) and in a manner consistent with the requirements of, and so
as to avoid triggering tax liabilities under, Section 409A of the Code.
 Effective January 1, 2008, employees of the Surviving Corporation shall be
eligible to participate in the Parent deferred compensation plan
in accordance with the eligibility provisions of such plan.

  

(e) _Company Employment Agreements_. As of the Closing Date, Parent shall
assume, or cause the Surviving Corporation to continue to honor, all duties
and obligations of the Company or its Subsidiaries under the employment
agreements (subject to the employees obligation under such agreements) that
the Company or its Subsidiaries has in effect at the Effective Time and that
are specified on _Section 6.10(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter_ (the "
_Continuing Employment Agreements_ ").

  

(f) _Service_. At such time as Company employees cease being covered by a
Company Compensation and Benefit Plan and commence participation in a
corresponding Parent Compensation and Benefit Plan, all service with
the Company and its ERISA Affiliates shall be counted as service with Parent
and the Surviving Corporation for purposes of eligibility and vesting under
such Parent Compensation and Benefit Plan other than Parents pension plan
and retiree medical plan. With respect to Parents pension plan and retiree
medical plan, if Company employees become eligible to participate in either
or both of such plans, all service with the Company and its ERISA Affiliates
shall be counted as service with Parent and the Surviving Corporation for
purposes of eligibility to participate in and vesting under such plan(s), but
not for purposes of benefit accrual or eligibility for any grandfathered

        



  

benefit, right or feature which requires a commencement of employment or
participation date prior to the Closing Date. In addition, service with the
Company and its ERISA affiliates shall be counted as service with Parent and
the Surviving Corporation for employment purposes, including
seniority, vacation, sick leave and paid time off entitlements pursuant to
any such employment policy applicable to the employee from time to time. This
Section 6.10(f) is not intended to provide any duplicate benefits or to make
Company employees eligible to participate in any Parent Compensation and
Benefit Plan prior to the date provided by the Parent.

  

(g) _COBRA_. Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be responsible for any
legally mandated continuation of health care coverage for the employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and/or their dependents who have a loss of
health care coverage due to a qualifying event before, at, or after the
Closing Date. _Section 6.10(g) of the Company s Disclosure Letter_ lists for
each individual who incurred a qualifying event prior to the date of this
Agreement and who has elected or is still within the time period for electing
continued health care coverage, the type of qualifying event, date of such
qualifying event, and period for which such individual and any eligible
dependents is eligible to continue health care coverage.

  

6.11. _Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, subject to
_Section 8.5 (b)_ , all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such expense, except that (a)
Parent and the Company shall each bear and pay one half of the filing fee for
filing the S-4 Registration Statement with the SEC, and the costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of the
Proxy Statement and the S-4 Registration Statement (other than attorneys and
accountants fees and expenses, which shall be paid by the party incurring
such expense), and (b) Parent shall pay the filing fees for the Notification
and Report Forms filed with the FTC and the Antitrust Division under the HSR
Act and any premerger notification and reports formed under similar
applicable antitrust law of any non-United States governmental antitrust
authority.

  

6.12. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each present and former
director and officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries (when acting in such
capacity), determined as of the Effective Time (the " _Indemnified Parties_
"), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities (collectively, "
_Costs_ "), as incurred, in connection with any claim, action (whether
threatened, pending or contemplated), suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether arising before or after the Effective Time and whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to
matters existing or acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including, for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the
approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, (i) without limitation of subclause (ii), to the same extent
such individuals are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses
as of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to its articles of
incorporation and bylaws

        



  

and indemnification agreements, if any, ****with, or for the benefit of, any
such individuals (and subject to the terms and conditions otherwise
applicable to such existing rights to indemnification and advancement) and
(ii) without regard to the limitations in subclause (i) above, to the fullest
extent permitted to be provided by the Surviving Corporation under applicable
Law (and Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly
advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent so permitted under
applicable Law, provided the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking in accordance with applicable Law to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification);
_provided_ , _however_ , that (x) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a
court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such
determination shall have become final and nonappealable, that the
indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby
is prohibited by applicable Law, and (y) with respect to any Action pending
against such Indemnified Party prior to the Effective Time, or threatened
against such Indemnified Party prior to the Effective Time (to the knowledge
of the Indemnified Party), or with respect to which such Indemnified Party
made a claim for indemnification or advancement from the Company prior to the
Effective Time, the provisions of any settlement agreement, undertaking
or other Contract or Order in effect prior to the Effective Time relating to
such pending or threatened Action or such claim shall continue to be
effective and any limitations or conditions on the entitlement to or scope of
the Indemnified Partys rights to indemnification or advancement applicable
pursuant to any such Contract or Order shall continue to apply to such
Indemnified Partys rights hereunder after the Effective Time.

  

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph
(a) of this _Section 6.12_, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent and the Surviving
Corporation thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent
and the Surviving Corporation of any liability they may have to such
Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure materially prejudices
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be.

  

(c) For a period of six years following the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to and the Surviving Corporation shall
provide a policy of officers and directors liability insurance that serves
to reimburse, and covers, the Indemnified Parties and any other employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries who are covered by the Companys officers
and directors liability insurance, if any, at the Effective Time, with
respect to claims against such Indemnified Parties or such employees arising
from facts or events occurring prior to the Effective Time (including, for
acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) (" _D andO
Insurance_"), which insurance shall contain at least the same coverage and
amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous to the
Indemnified Parties and any such other employees, as the coverage provided
under the Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance
coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in satisfying the foregoing
obligations the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an
aggregate premium (on an annualized basis) for the DandO Insurance in excess of
250% of the last annual premium paid by the Company (or its Subsidiaries)
prior to the date of this Agreement (all such amounts, as stated in _Section
6.12(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter_, the " _Current Premium_ "); if the
existing or any replacement DandO Insurance expires, is

        



  

terminated or cancelled, or if the annual premium therefor is increased to an
amount in excess of 250% of the Current Premium during such six year period,
the Surviving Corporation will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain DandO
Insurance in an amount and scope as great as can be obtained for the
remainder of such period for a premium not in excess (on an annualized basis)
of 250% of the Current Premium; and _provided_ , _further_ that in lieu of
such coverage, Parent may substitute a prepaid "tail" policy for such
coverage, which it may cause the Company to obtain prior to the Closing.
 Prior to the Effective Time the Company shall assist Parent as reasonably
requested in determining the manner in which Parent will comply with the
obligations of this _Section 6.12(c)_ , but the Company shall not modify,
increase, or, except in the ordinary course consistent with past practice at
the normal time for renewal, extend its DandO Insurance for any period beyond
the current policy period, obtain any "tail" policy or obtain new DandO
Insurance or prepay any DandO Insurance, without Parents prior consent.

  

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual,
corporation or other entity, then and in each such case, proper provisions
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.12_.

  

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this _Section 6.12_ shall be
in addition to any rights such Indemnified Party may have under the articles
of incorporation and bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
under Missouri Law or any other applicable Law or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Party with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

(f) The provisions of this _Section 6.12_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs
and their representatives and shall survive the consummation of the Merger,
notwithstanding any release executed by any Indemnified Party in connection
with his or her departure from the Company or its Subsidiaries unless a
release of the provisions of this Section is expressly provided for in such
release.

  

6.13. _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may
become applicable to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company and their respective boards
of directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement or by the Merger and
otherwise use reasonable best efforts to act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions.

  

6.14. _Control of the Company s or Parents Operations_. Nothing contained
in this Agreement shall give Parent or the Company, directly or indirectly,
rights to control or direct the operations of the other prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company
shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision of its operations.

        



  

6.15. _Section 16(b)_. The board of directors of each of the Company and
Parent shall, prior to the Effective Time, take all such actions as may
be necessary or appropriate pursuant to Rule 16b-3(d) and Rule 16b-3(e) under
the Exchange Act to exempt any dispositions of Company Shares (including
derivative securities with respect to Company Shares) or acquisitions of
Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Parent
Common Stock) pursuant to the terms of this Agreement by officers and
directors of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act (the " _Company Insiders_ ") or by officers,
directors or employees of the Company who may become an officer or director
of Parent subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act (the " _Parent Insiders_ "). In furtherance of the foregoing,
prior to the Effective Time, the board of directors of the Company, with

parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. The parties hereto further
agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries under  _Section 6.12_
shall not arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs.

  

9.9. _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this
Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such
requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent
to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such requirement
shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause
such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the
part of the Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such
action.

  

9.10. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability or the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not,
subject to clause (a), be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability,
except as a result of such substitution, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

  

9.11. _Interpretation_.

  

(a) The table of contents and headings therein and herein are for convenience
of reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be
deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where
a reference in this Agreement is made to an Article, Section, Schedule
or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of, or Schedule
or Exhibit to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words
"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall
be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The words
"hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in
this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not any
particular provision of this Agreement. The words "date hereof" shall refer
to the date of this Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive. The word
"extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a
subject or thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if." The
definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as
well as the plural forms of such terms. References to "the Agreement" shall
include the Company Disclosure Letter and Parent Disclosure Letter.
References to a person are also to its permitted successors and assigns.

is defined in the Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term.

  

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any provision of this Agreement.

convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and
shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions
hereof.

  

9.13. _Specific Performance_. The parties acknowledge and agree that
any breach of this Agreement would give rise to irreparable harm for which
monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy.  The parties accordingly
agree that, in addition to other remedies, the parties shall be entitled to
enforce the terms of this Agreement by decree of specific performance without
the necessity of proving the inadequacy of monetary damages as a remedy and
to obtain injunctive relief against any breach or threatened breach hereof.

  

9.14. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of
law or otherwise. Any assignment in contravention of the preceding sentence

 **EXHIBIT A 
 FORM OF AFFILIATE LETTER**

  



  

Equifax Inc.

  

1550 Peachtree Street, N.W.

  

Atlanta, Georgia 30309

  



  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  

I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an
"affiliate" of TALX Corporation (the " _Company_ "), as the term "affiliate"
is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 (" _Rule 145_
") of the rules and regulations (the " _Rules and Regulations_ ") of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the " _Act_ ").

  

I have been further advised that, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and
Plan of Merger, dated as of February 14, 2007 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "),
by and among the Company, Equifax Inc. (" _Parent_ ") and Chipper Corporation
(" _Merger Sub_ "), the Company will be merged with and into Merger Sub (the
" _Merger_ "), and I may be eligible to receive shares of common stock of
Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ ") in exchange in part for shares of common
stock of the Company owned by me. Capitalized terms used herein and not
otherwise defined have the meanings assigned to them in the Merger Agreement.

  

I hereby represent, warrant and covenant to Parent that, in the event I
receive any Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger:

  

1. I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of the Parent Common Stock in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations.

  

2. I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and discussed their requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Parent Common Stock to the extent I believed necessary with my counsel or with counsel for the Company.

  

3. I have been advised that any issuance of Parent Common Stock to me pursuant to the Merger Agreement will be registered with the SEC on a registration statement on Form S-4 (the " _Parent S-4_ "). However, I have also been advised that, since at the time the Merger is submitted to the shareholders of the Company for approval, I may be an "affiliate" of the Company, any sale or disposition by me of any of the Parent Common Stock may only be made, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d) of Rule 145 under the Act, pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act or pursuant to an exemption thereunder. I agree that I will not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Parent Common Stock issued to me in the Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under the Act for resale (and that the Parent S-4 will not provide such registration); (ii) I provide evidence of compliance with Rule 145(d)(1), in a letter in the form of _Annex I_ hereto, or such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145 promulgated by the SEC under the Act; or (iii) in the written opinion of counsel, which opinion 

        

and counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent, such sale, transfer or
other disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the Act.

  

4. I understand that Parent is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer or other disposition of the Parent Common Stock by me or on my behalf.

  

5. I understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to Parents transfer agent with respect to Parent Common Stock and that there will be placed on any certificates for the Parent Common Stock issued to me, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance:

  

"The shares represented by this certificate were issued in a transaction to
which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 applies. The
shares represented by this certificate may only be sold or otherwise
transferred in accordance with the terms of a letter agreement between the
registered holder hereof and Equifax Inc., a copy of which agreement is on
file at the principal offices of Equifax Inc."

  

6. I also understand that, unless the transfer by me of my Parent Common Stock has been registered under the Act or is a sale made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d), Parent reserves the right to put the following legend on the certificates issued to my transferee:

  

"The sale of the shares represented by this certificate has not been
registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities
Act"), and the shares were acquired from a person who received such shares in
a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act applies.
The shares have been acquired by the holder not with a view to, or for resale
in connection with, any distribution thereof within the meaning of the
Securities Act and may not be sold, pledged or otherwise transferred except
in accordance with an exemption from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act."

  

It is understood and agreed that this letter agreement shall terminate and be
of no further force or effect and the legends set forth in paragraphs (5) or
(6), as the case may be, above shall be removed by delivery of substitute
certificates without such legend, and the related stop transfer restrictions
shall be lifted forthwith, if (i) any such shares of Parent Common Stock
shall have been registered under the Act for sale, transfer or other
disposition by me or on my behalf and are sold, transferred or otherwise
disposed of, or (ii) if I provide evidence that any such shares of Parent
Common Stock are sold in accordance with the provisions of Rule 145(d)(1)
promulgated under the Act in the form of a letter in the form of _Annex I_
hereto, or (iii) if I provide a letter to the effect I am not at the time an
affiliate of Parent and have been the beneficial owner of the Parent Common
Stock for at least one year (or such other period as may be prescribed by the
Act and the Rules and Regulations), or (iv) if I provide a letter that I am
not and have not been for at least three months an affiliate of Parent and
have been the beneficial owner of the Parent Common Stock for at least two
years (or such other period as may be prescribed by the Act and the Rules and
Regulations), or (v) Parent shall have received a letter from the staff of
the SEC, or a written opinion of counsel, which opinion and counsel shall be
reasonably acceptable to Parent, or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to
Parent, to the effect that the stock transfer restrictions and the legend are
not required.

        

7. By its acceptance hereof, Parent agrees, for a period of two years after the Effective Time, that it will file on a timely basis all reports required to be filed by it pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, so that the public information provisions of Rule 144(c) promulgated under the Securities Act are satisfied and the resale provisions of Rule 145(d)(1) and (2) promulgated under the Securities Act are therefore available to me in the event I desire to transfer any Parent Common Stock issued to me in the Merger.

  

My execution of this letter should not be considered an admission on my part
that I am an "affiliate" of the Company as described in the first paragraph
of this letter or as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to any claim
that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.

On , the undersigned sold the securities of TALX Corporation

with the merger of TALX Corporation with and into Chipper Corporation.
