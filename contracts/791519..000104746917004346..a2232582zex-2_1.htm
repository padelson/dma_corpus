 WHEREAS, the Company Board has as of the date hereof unanimously (a) determined and declared that it is in the best interests of the Company and the stockholders of the Company that the Company enter into this Agreement and consummate the Merger and the other Transactions on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, (b) adopted, approved and declared the advisability of this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions, (c) declared that the terms of the Merger are fair to the Company and the Company\'s stockholders and (d) directed that this Agreement be submitted to the Company\'s stockholders at the Company Stockholders Meeting for their adoption and recommended that the Company\'s stockholders adopt this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, the respective board of directors of the Parent and the Merger Sub have adopted, approved and declared it advisable for the Parent and the Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and 

   

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to the Company\'s willingness to enter into this Agreement, investment funds or accounts managed or advised by each of Sycamore Partners II, L.P., and the other investment funds or managed accounts party to a Limited Guarantee dated as of the date hereof and delivered to the Company concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (each, a " _Guarantor_ " and together, the " _Guarantors_ ") are entering into the Limited Guarantees with respect to certain obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement; 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the Parent, the Merger Sub and the Company, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:     

    
ARTICLE I 

THE MERGER 

   

 1.1 _ The Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, the Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company at the Effective Time. 

  

 1.2 _ Effective Time of the Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause a certificate of merger or other appropriate documents (in any such case, the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be duly prepared, executed and acknowledged in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and filed with the Secretary of State. The Merger shall become effective upon the due filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State or at such subsequent time or date as the Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

 1.3 _ Closing._ Subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted herein and by applicable law) of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_, the Closing shall take place at the offices of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, 60 State Street, Boston, MA 02109 as soon as practicable (but in any event no later than the third Business Day) following the day on which the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of such conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement, or at such other date, time or place as the parties hereto shall agree in writing; _provided_ that, if the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time), then, subject to the continued satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ at such time, the Closing shall occur instead on the earliest of (a) any Business Day during the Marketing Period as may be specified by Parent on no less than three Business Days\' prior written notice to the Company, (b) the third (3rd) Business Day following the final day of the Marketing Period or (c) such other date, time or place as agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. 

  

 1.4 _ Effects of the Merger._ At the Effective Time (a) the separate existence of the Merger Sub shall cease, the Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and the Company shall continue as the Surviving Corporation in the Merger and (b) the certificate of incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read as set forth on _Exhibit A_, and as so amended and restated shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter further amended in accordance with the DGCL. In addition, subject to _Section 6.6(b)_ hereof, the Parent shall cause the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to be amended and restated in their entirety so that, immediately following the Effective Time, they are identical to the bylaws of the Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that all references to the name of the Merger Sub therein shall be changed to refer to the name of the Company, and, as so amended and restated, such bylaws shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until further amended in accordance with the DGCL. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL and in this Agreement. 

  

 1.5 _ Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation._ The directors of the Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case to hold office in accordance with the term of office set forth in certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and until their successors are duly elected and qualified. 

       

    
ARTICLE II 

TREATMENT OF COMPANY SECURITIES 

   

 2.1 _ Conversion of Capital Stock._ As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, the Merger Sub, the Parent or the holder of any shares of the capital stock of the Company or capital stock of the Merger Sub: 

  

  

 (a) _ Capital Stock of the Merger Sub._ Each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b) _ Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock._ All shares of Company Common Stock that are held in the treasury of the Company and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by any Subsidiary of the Company, the Parent, the Merger Sub or any other Affiliate of the Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be paid or delivered in exchange therefor. 

  

 (c) _ Merger Consideration for Company Common Stock._ Except as otherwise agreed in writing between the holder and Parent, subject to _Section 2.2_, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b) _and Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive $10.25, without interest thereon (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.1(c) _in accordance with the provisions of _Section 2.2_. 

  

 (d) _ Adjustments to Merger Consideration._ The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring (or for which a record date is established) after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. 

  

  

 2.2 _ Surrender of Certificates._ 

  

  

 (a) _ Paying Agent._ At or prior to the Effective Time, the Parent shall (i) enter into an agreement (in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company) with the Paying Agent for the Paying Agent to act as paying agent for the Merger and (ii) deposit, or cause to be deposited (including by directing that available cash of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries (including, if requested by Parent no later than three (3) Business Days prior to Closing, any cash proceeds received upon liquidating any investments held in highly liquid short-term interest-bearing investments in the United States) be deposited with the Paying Agent at the Effective Time), with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, for payment through the Paying Agent in accordance with this _Section 2.2_, the Payment Fund. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody\'s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker\'s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available); _provided_ , _however_ , that no gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable 

  

      

  

hereunder and the Parent shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the
Payment Fund includes at all times cash sufficient to satisfy the Parent\'s
obligation to pay the Merger Consideration under this Agreement. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments (net of any losses) shall be
paid to the Parent pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_. In the event the Payment
Fund is diminished below the level required for the Paying Agent to make
prompt cash payments as required under _Section 2.2(b)_, including any such
diminishment as a result of investment losses, the Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, immediately deposit additional cash into
the Payment Fund in an amount equal to the deficiency in the amount required
to make such payments.

  

 (b) _ Exchange Procedures._ 

    

 (i) Promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) after the Effective Time, the Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall (1) be prepared prior to the Closing, (2) specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 2.2(g)_) to the Paying Agent, and (3) otherwise be in such form and have such provisions as may be reasonably acceptable to the Parent and the Company), and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 2.2(g)_) in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 2.2(g)_) to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be promptly paid in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 2.2(g)_) multiplied by (2) the Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. 

   

 (ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder of Uncertificated Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this _Article II_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Uncertificated Shares shall, upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agent\'s message" in customary form with respect to any Uncertificated Share (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), be promptly paid the Merger Consideration in respect of such Uncertificated Share, and such Uncertificated Share shall forthwith be cancelled. 

    

 (c) _ Interest; Transfers; Rights Following the Effective Time._ No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated Shares is registered, if, in the case of a Certificate, such Certificate is presented to the Paying Agent, and in each case the transferor provides to Paying Agent (i) all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and (ii) evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_, each Certificate and all Uncertificated Shares (other than Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration as contemplated by _Section 2.1(c)_. 

  

 (d) _ No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates and cancellation of Uncertificated Shares in accordance 

  

      

  

with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares, and from and
after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of
Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
_Article II_, subject to _Section 2.2(e)_.

  

 (e) _ Termination of Payment Fund._ Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates and Uncertificated Shares for one year after the Effective Time (including all interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to it) shall be delivered to the Parent, upon demand, and any holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares who has not previously complied with this _Section 2.2_ shall be entitled to receive only from the Parent or the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) payment of its claim for Merger Consideration, without interest. 

  

 (f) _ No Liability._ To the extent permitted by applicable law, none of the Parent, the Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount required to be delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificates or Uncertificated Shares shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on which the related Merger Consideration would escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, immediately prior to such time become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (g) _ Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if reasonably required by the Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable and customary amount as the Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

  

 2.3 _ Company Stock Plans._ 

  

  

 (a) Except as otherwise agreed upon in writing between the holder and Parent, effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-outstanding and unexercised Company Stock Option shall automatically be canceled and converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount of cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock then underlying such Company Stock Option multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option, without any interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the aggregate amount payable by the Surviving Corporation to the holders of such Company Stock Options pursuant to the preceding sentence, without any interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding, upon the later of (A) five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date and (B) the date of the Company\'s first regularly scheduled payroll after the Closing Date. In the event that the exercise price of any Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be canceled, without any consideration being payable in respect thereof, and have no further force or effect. 

  

      

  

 (b) Except as otherwise agreed upon in writing between the holder and Parent, effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time: 

    

 (i) each Company RSU that will become vested, by its terms, as a result of the Closing of the Merger shall automatically be canceled and converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount of cash equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock then underlying such Company RSU multiplied by (B) the Merger Consideration. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the aggregate amount payable by the Surviving Corporation to the holders of such Company RSUs pursuant to the preceding sentence, without any interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding, upon the later of (I) five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date and (II) the date of the Company\'s first regularly scheduled payroll after the Closing Date;

parties to the Financing Letters will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis
any term or condition of the Financing Letters required to be satisfied by
it, that the conditions thereof will not otherwise be satisfied or that the
full amount of the Financing will not be available on the Closing Date. The
only conditions precedent or other contingencies (including market "flex"
provisions) related to the obligations of the Guarantor to fund the full
amount of the Equity Financing and the lenders to fund the full amount of the
Debt Financing are those expressly set forth in the Equity Funding Letters
and the Debt Commitment Letter, respectively. As of the date of this
Agreement, there are no side letters or other Contracts or arrangements to
which Parent or any of its Affiliates are a party related to the Financing
other than as expressly contained in the Financing Letters and delivered to
the Company prior to the date hereof (other than any customary engagement
letter or any side letter solely with respect to the payment of de minimis
fees, credits, and/or appointment of roles and/or titles, in each case that
does not impact the conditionality or amount of the Financing and would not
reasonably be expected to prevent, impair or delay the consummation of the
Financing).

  

 4.6 _ Limited Guarantees._ Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company a duly executed limited guarantee of each Guarantor, dated as of the date of this Agreement, in favor of the Company in respect of Parent\'s obligation to pay the Parent Termination Fee and certain of Parent\'s and Merger Sub\'s other payment or reimbursement obligations arising under, or in connection with, this Agreement and the Transactions, up to the aggregate amount set forth therein (the " _Limited Guarantee_ "), subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein. Each Limited Guarantee is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor party thereto, enforceable against such Guarantor in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception and no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of the Guarantor under such Limited Guarantee. 

   

 4.7 _ Solvency._ None of Parent, Merger Sub or the Guarantor is entering into this Agreement with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the Company or any 

        

of its Subsidiaries. Assuming (a) satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to
Parent\'s and Merger Sub\'s obligation to consummate the Merger, (b) any
estimates, projections or forecasts prepared by the Company or its
Representatives and made available to Parent, Merger Sub or their
Representatives prior to the date hereof have been prepared in good faith
based upon reasonable assumptions (it being understood that the Company is
not making any representation and warranty with respect thereto as a result of
such assumption in this clause (b)) and (c) the accuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in _Article III_ hereof (for such
purposes, such representations and warranties shall be true and correct in
all material respects without giving any effect to any "knowledge",
"materiality" or "Company Material Adverse Effect" qualification or
exception), including the representations and warranties set forth in _Section
3.5_, and after giving effect to the Transactions, any alternative financing
incurred in accordance with _Section 6.11_ and the payment of the aggregate
Merger Consideration, any other repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated
in this Agreement or the Financing Letters, payment of all amounts required to
be paid in connection with the consummation of the Transactions, and payment
of all related fees and expenses of Parent and Merger Sub, each of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent as of the Effective Time and
immediately after the consummation of the Transactions and in the event
either the USR ABL Borrower (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter) or CAR
ABL Borrower (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter) have borrowed funds
under the Debt Financing on the Closing Date to finance the Transactions, each
of such CAR ABL Borrower and such USR ABL Borrower will be Solvent as of the
Effective Time and immediately after the consummation of the Transactions.
For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ ", when used with
respect to any Person, means that, as of any date of determination, (a) the
fair value of the assets of such Person and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis, at a fair valuation, will exceed the debts and liabilities,
direct, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, of such Person and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, (b) the present fair saleable value of
the property of such Person and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis will
be greater than the amount that will be required to pay the probable liability
of such Person and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis on their debts and
other liabilities, direct, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such
debts and other liabilities become absolute and matured, (c) such Person and
its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis will not have unreasonably small
capital with which to conduct the businesses in which they are engaged as such
businesses are now conducted and are proposed to be conducted following the
Closing Date and (d) such Person and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis
will be able to pay their debts and liabilities, direct, subordinated,
contingent or otherwise, as such debts and liabilities become absolute and
matured.

  

 4.8 _ Section 203 of the DGCL._ As of the date of this Agreement, neither the Parent nor the Merger Sub, nor any of their respective "Affiliates" or "Associates" (as those terms are defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) (a) directly or indirectly "owns" or, within the three (3) years prior to the date hereof, has "owned," beneficially or otherwise, any shares of Company Common Stock, any other securities of the Company or any options, warrants or other rights to acquire shares of Company Common Stock or other securities of the Company, or any other economic interest (through derivative securities or otherwise) in the Company, or (b) has been an "Affiliate" or "Associate" (as those terms are defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) of the Company at any time during the three (3) years prior to the date hereof. Assuming the accuracy of the Company\'s representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.2(a)_ and the second sentence of _Section 3.4(a)_, the restrictions contained in Section 203 of the DGCL do not apply to the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger or the other Transactions. 

       

                                    

    

 4.9 _ Litigation._ As of the date of this Agreement, there is no action, suit, proceeding, claim, arbitration or investigation pending and of which the Parent has been notified or, to the Parent\'s knowledge, threatened against the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case that, individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no judgments, orders or decrees outstanding against the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 4.10 _ Other Agreements or Understandings._ There are no contracts, agreements or other arrangements or understandings (whether oral or written) or commitments to enter into contracts, agreements or other arrangements or understandings (whether oral or written) (a) between Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantor or any of their Affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of the Company\'s management or the Company Board, on the other hand or (b) pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company would be entitled to receive consideration of a different amount or nature than the Merger Consideration or pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company agrees to vote to adopt this Agreement or approve the Merger or agrees to vote against any Superior Proposal. 

  

 4.11 _ Brokers._ No agent, broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other firm or Person is or shall be entitled, as a result of any action or agreement of the Parent or any of its Affiliates, to any broker\'s, finder\'s, financial advisor\'s or other similar fee or commission in connection with any of the Transactions for which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries would have any obligations or liabilities prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 4.12 _ Independent Investigation._ Each of the Parent and the Merger Sub acknowledges that it has conducted to its satisfaction its own independent investigation and analysis of the business, operations, assets, liabilities, results of operations, condition (financial or otherwise) and prospects of the Company and the Company\'s Subsidiaries and that each of the Parent and the Merger Sub and its Representatives have received access to certain books and records, facilities, equipment, contracts and other assets of the Company and the Company\'s Subsidiaries that it and its Representatives have requested to review for such purpose, and that it and its Representatives have had a full opportunity to meet with the management of the Company and the Company\'s Subsidiaries and to discuss the business, operations, assets, liabilities, results of operations, condition (financial or otherwise) and prospects of the Company and the Company\'s Subsidiaries. 

  

 4.13 _ No Other Company Representations or Warranties._ The Parent and the Merger Sub hereby acknowledge and agree that, except for the representations and warranties set forth in _Article III_ (in each case as qualified and limited by the Company Disclosure Schedule) and in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective Affiliates, stockholders or Representatives, or any other Person acting on behalf of the Company, has made or is making any express or implied representation or warranty with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective business or operations, including with respect to any information provided or made available to the Parent, the Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, stockholders or Representatives, or any other Person acting on behalf of the Parent, or, except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement, had or has any duty or obligation to provide any information to the Parent, the Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, stockholders or Representatives, or any other Person acting on behalf of Parent, in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise. 

  

 4.14 _ Non-Reliance on Company Estimates, Projections, Forecasts, Forward-Looking Statements and Business Plans._ In connection with the due diligence investigation of the Company by the Parent and the Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates, stockholders and Representatives, the Parent and the Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates, stockholders and Representatives have received and may continue to receive after the date hereof (including pursuant to _Section 6.3(b) _) from the Company and 

        

its Affiliates, stockholders and Representatives certain estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as
certain business plan information, regarding the Company and its business and
operations. The Parent and the Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking statements, as well as in such business
plans, with which the Parent and the Merger Sub are familiar, that the Parent
and the Merger Sub are taking responsibility for making their own evaluation
of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts and
other forward-looking information, as well as such business plans, so
furnished to them (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking information or
business plans), and that the Parent and the Merger Sub will have no claim

respect to such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements
or business plans (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements or business
plans), in each case, other than the express representations and warranties
set forth in this Agreement or any certificate delivered in connection with
this Agreement.

a Company Board Recommendation Change or termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_, describing in reasonable detail the reasons for
such intended Company Board Recommendation Change or termination (a "
_Recommendation Change Notice_ ") (it being understood that the Recommendation
Change Notice shall not, in and of itself, constitute a Company Board
Recommendation Change for purposes of this Agreement so long as such notice
clearly states that it is not a Company Board Recommendation Change and that
the Company Board has not otherwise effected a Company Board Recommendation
Change); (iii) if requested by the Parent, the Company shall

  

      

  

have made itself and its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives available and the Company shall have and shall have caused its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to discuss and
negotiate with the Parent\'s Representatives any proposed modifications to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement (in a manner that would obviate the
need to effect such Company Board Recommendation Change) during the four (4)
Business Day period following delivery by the Company to the Parent of such
Recommendation Change Notice (it being understood that if there are any
material amendments, revisions or changes to the terms of any such Superior
Proposal (including any revision to the amount, form or mix of consideration
the Company\'s stockholders would receive as a result of the Superior
Proposal, whether or not material), the Company shall notify the Parent of
each such amendment, revision or change in compliance with _Section 6.1(c)_
and the applicable four (4) Business Day period described above shall be
extended for until at least two (2) Business Days from the date of such
notice) (any such notice period, the " _Notice Period_ "); and (iv) at the end
of such Notice Period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel), after considering any
modified terms and conditions proposed by or on behalf of the Parent,
that the failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law and, with respect to a Company Board Recommendation Change in
response to a Superior Proposal, the Company Board has determined in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) that such initial or revised (as applicable) Superior Proposal
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal.

  

 (c) _ Notices to the Parent._ The Company shall promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day) advise the Parent orally and in writing of the Company\'s or any of its Subsidiaries\' or any of their respective Representatives\' receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or request for material non-public information or access to the Company or its Representatives by any third party that the Company reasonably believes is related to an Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal, including the material terms and conditions of any such request for information or access or Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the Person making any such Acquisition Proposal. Thereafter, the Company shall keep Parent informed on a reasonably prompt basis of any material developments with respect to any such request for information or access or Acquisition Proposal, including with respect to the terms and status thereof and whether any such Acquisition Proposal has been withdrawn or rejected and shall provide Parent written notice of any such withdrawal or rejection and copies of any written request for information or access or Acquisition Proposal within 48 hours. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall enter into any confidentiality agreement subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the Company from providing to the Parent the information or access required to be provided to the Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.1(c)_. 

  

 (d) _ Certain Permitted Disclosure._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position with respect to a tender offer contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder (none of which, in and of itself, shall be deemed to constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change), or (ii) making any disclosure to the Company\'s stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with outside counsel, failure to so disclose would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided that this _Section 6.1(d) _shall not permit the Company Board to make a Company Board Recommendation Change except to the extent expressly permitted by, and in accordance with, _Section 6.1(b)_. For the avoidance of doubt, this _ Section 6.1(d) _shall not be deemed to modify the definition of "Company Board Recommendation Change," and if any public disclosure in accordance with this

  

      

  

 _Section 6.1(d) _has the effect of a Company Board Recommendation Change,
Parent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement to the extent set
forth in _Section 8.1(e)_.

  

 (e) _ Cessation of Ongoing Discussions._ The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall direct their respective Representatives to, except with respect to the Parent and the Merger Sub, (i) cease immediately all solicitations, discussions and negotiations that commenced prior to the date of this Agreement regarding any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential or non-public information or access previously furnished to any Person within the last twelve (12) months for the purpose of evaluating a possible Acquisition Proposal and (iii) terminate access to any physical or electronic data rooms relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal; _provided, however_ , that the foregoing shall not in any way limit or modify any of the Company\'s rights under the other provisions of this _Section 6.1_. 

   

 (f) _ Representatives._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.1_, the Company agrees that in the event any Subsidiary or Representative of the Company takes any action which, if taken by the Company, would constitute a breach by the Company of this _Section 6.1_, then the Company shall be deemed to have so breached this _Section 6.1_. 

  

  

 6.2 _ Nasdaq Listing._ Until the Effective Time, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to continue the listing of the Company Common Stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 

  

 6.3 _ Confidentiality; Access to Information._ 

  

  

 (a) Except as expressly modified herein, the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. 

   

 (b) During the Pre-Closing Period, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford to the Parent and the Parent\'s Representatives (including any Financing Sources), reasonable access, upon reasonable notice, during normal business hours and in a manner that does not unreasonably disrupt or interfere with business operations, to all of its properties, books, Contracts and records as the Parent shall reasonably request, and, during such period, the Company shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) promptly make available to the Parent (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities laws (without limitation of the Company\'s obligations set forth in _Section 6.5_ and _6.14_ ) and (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and assets as the Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to permit any inspection or other access, or to disclose any information, (A) to the extent related to an Acquisition Proposal, Company Board Recommendation Change or Recommendation Change Notice (except as otherwise required by the terms of this Agreement) or (B) that in the reasonable judgment of the Company (after consultation with outside legal counsel) would: (1) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of any third party, (2) violate any legal requirement or Contract or any obligation of the Company with respect to confidentiality or privacy, including under any privacy policy, or (3) jeopardize protections afforded the Company under the attorney-client privilege or the attorney work product doctrine (provided that in connection with this clause (B), the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements (including a joint defense agreement) to permit reasonable disclosure, to the extent permitted by applicable law and practicable under the circumstances). Any such information shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. Prior to the Closing, neither the Parent nor the Merger Sub shall (and each shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives not to) contact or communicate with any of the employees, customers, licensors or suppliers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, without the prior written consent of the Company. 

  

      

                                    

  

 6.4 _ Legal Conditions to the Merger._ 

  

  

 (a) Subject to the terms hereof, including _Section 6.1_, _Section 6.4(b)_, _Section 6.4(c)_ and _Section 6.4(d)_, each party hereto shall each use its reasonable best efforts to:  

    

 (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties hereto in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable; 

  

 (ii) as promptly as practicable, obtain any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations, or orders required to be obtained by such party (or any of its Subsidiaries) from any Governmental Entity or third party in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries be required to pay any monies (except for filings or similar fees) or (except, in the case of the Parent or its Subsidiaries, as contemplated by _Section 6.4(d)_) agree to any material undertaking in connection with any of the foregoing; 

  

 (iii) as promptly as practicable, make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger required under (A) the Exchange Act, and any other applicable federal or state securities laws, (B) the HSR Act, any other applicable Antitrust Laws and any related governmental request thereunder and (C) any other applicable law; 

  

 (iv) contest and resist any action, including any administrative or judicial action, and seek to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) (a " _Restrictive Order_ ") which has the effect of making the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger or the other Transactions; and 

  

 (v) execute or deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. 

    

The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other in connection with the
making of all such filings and submissions contemplated by the foregoing
clauses (ii) or (iii), including providing copies of all such documents to
the non-filing Person and its advisors prior to filing (to the extent
permitted under applicable law) and, if requested, accepting reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith. Each party
hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to each other all
information required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant
to any applicable law in connection with the Transactions. For the avoidance
of doubt, nothing contained in this _Section 6.4(a)_ shall limit any
obligation under any other provision in this _Section 6.4_.

   

 (b) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section 6.4_, each of the Parent and the Company shall (i) as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event within ten (10) Business Days following the date of this Agreement, if required, make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act (including seeking early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act) with respect to the Transactions and (ii) promptly make all filings as may be required under any other applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions (to the extent required). None of the Parent, the Merger Sub or the Company shall commit to or agree with any Governmental Entity to stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws or enter into a timing agreement with any Governmental Entity, without the prior written consent of the other parties. 

  

      

  

 (c) Subject to the terms hereof, and without limiting the Parent\'s obligations under _Section 6.4(d)_, the parties hereto shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain any government clearances or approvals required for the Closing under any Antitrust Law, to respond to any government requests for information under any Antitrust Law, to cause any waiting periods under any applicable Antitrust Laws to expire or be terminated, and to contest and resist any action, including any legislative, administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Restrictive Order. The parties hereto shall consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with, and provide to the other parties in advance, any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law, _provided_ , _however_ , that materials provided according to this _Section 6.4(c)_ or _Section 6.4(a)_ may be redacted: (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company and its Subsidiaries; (ii) as necessary to comply with applicable laws; and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege concerns. To the extent permitted by law or Governmental Entities reviewing the Transactions, the parties will provide each other the opportunity to participate in meetings and other substantive conversations with any such Governmental Entities. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Parent shall propose, negotiate, offer to commit and effect (and if such offer is accepted, commit to and effect), by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses of the Parent or, effective as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation, or their respective Subsidiaries, or otherwise offer to take or offer to commit to take any action which it is capable of taking and if the offer is accepted, take or commit to take such action that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the businesses, services or assets of the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries, in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any Restrictive Order, which would have the effect of preventing or delaying the Closing beyond the Outside Date, provided that Parent shall not be obligated to take any such action unless the taking of such action is expressly conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parent shall take any and all actions necessary in order to ensure that (i) no requirement for a waiver, consent, approval or termination of applicable waiting periods of the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, any State Attorney General or other Governmental Entity, (ii) no decree, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or any other order in any suit or proceeding, and (iii) no other matter relating to any Antitrust Law, would preclude consummation of the Merger by the Outside Date. 

  

  

 6.5 _ Public Disclosure._ Except as may be required by law or stock market regulations, (a) the press release announcing the execution of this Agreement shall be issued only in such form as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company and the Parent, (b) Parent and the Company shall mutually agree upon the form and substance of any (i) widespread internal written communications (including scripts, QandA materials, talking points and similar written materials) that may be made by the Company to its officers, employees, independent contractors, consultants, directors, suppliers, customers, contract counterparties and/or other business relations of the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger, this Agreement, the Transactions, the Financing and/or the Carveout Transactions and/or (ii) any other press release or other public statement with respect to the Merger, this Agreement, the Transactions, the Financing and/or the Carveout Transactions, in the case of clause (b) that is not limited to or consistent with previous mutually agreed upon public statements and (c) the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to consult with Parent prior to making any widespread internal oral communications to its employees (it being agreed this clause (c) shall not restrict the ability of members of the Company\'s management team from responding to questions from employees, 

        

whether in connection with "town hall" meetings or similar formats or
otherwise); _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to compliance with
_Section 6.1_, these restrictions shall not apply to any Company
communications (or the Parent\'s or the Merger Sub\'s response thereto) in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal, Company Board Recommendation Change
or Recommendation Change Notice.

   

 6.6 _ Indemnification._ 

  

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, each of the Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Indemnified Party against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys\' fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director or manager of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, while a director, manager or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, is or was serving at the request of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries as an officer, director or manager of another Person, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would have been permitted to do so by law. Each Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses (including attorneys\' fees) incurred in the defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from each of the Parent and the Surviving Corporation within 10 Business Days of receipt by the Parent or the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor; _provided_ that any Indemnified Party to whom expenses are to be advanced provides prior to any receipt of such advances an undertaking, to the extent required by the DGCL or other applicable law, to repay such advances if it is determined by a final determination of a court of competent jurisdiction (which determination is not subject to appeal) that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification under applicable law. Without limitation of the foregoing or any other provision of this _Section 6.6_, until the six-year anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, the Parent and the Company agree that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party, whether provided in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or in any indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date hereof, shall survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect, and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party. 

  

 (b) From the Effective Time through the six-year anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and the Parent shall cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to so contain, provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time than are set forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement. 

  

 (c) Subject to the next sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall either (i) maintain, and the Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for six (6) years from the Effective Time the Current DandO Insurance with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the Transactions), so long as the annual premium therefor would not exceed the Maximum Premium, or (ii) purchase a Reporting Tail Endorsement for an annual cost not to exceed the Maximum Premium and maintain such endorsement in full force and effect for its full term. If the Company\'s or the Surviving Corporation\'s existing insurance expires, is terminated or canceled during such six-year 

  

      

  

period or exceeds the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall
obtain, and the Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain, as
much directors\' and officers\' liability insurance as can be obtained for
the remainder of such period for an annualized premium not in excess of the
Maximum Premium, on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the
Indemnified Parties than the Current DandO Insurance. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may, prior to the Effective
Time and using a nationally recognized broker selected by Parent
in consultation with the Company (whose consent to using such broker shall
not be unreasonably withheld), purchase a Reporting Tail Endorsement, provided
that the Company does not pay more than the Maximum Premium for such
Reporting Tail Endorsement. If a Reporting Tail Endorsement has been purchased
by the Company prior to the Effective Time, the Parent shall cause such
Reporting Tail Endorsement to be maintained in full force and effect for its
full term and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving
Corporation and in such case it will be deemed to satisfy all obligations to
obtain insurance pursuant to this _Section 6.6(c)_.

   

 (d) In the event the Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume and succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.6_. 

  

 (e) If any Indemnified Party makes any claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses under this _Section 6.6_ that is denied by the Parent and/or the Company or the Surviving Corporation, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Indemnified Party is entitled to such indemnification or advancement of expenses, then the Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall pay the Indemnified Party\'s costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with pursuing his or her claims to the fullest extent permitted by law. 

  

 (f) The provisions of this _Section 6.6_ are intended to be in addition to the rights otherwise available to any Indemnified Party by law, charter, statute, bylaw or agreement, and shall operate for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their representatives. 

  

  

 6.7 _ Notification of Certain Matters._ Prior to the Effective Time, the Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to the Parent, of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure to occur is reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty of such Person (or, in case of the Parent\'s obligation to provide notice, any representation or warranty of the Merger Sub) contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate (i) in the case of any representation or warranty of the Company, in any manner that would result in the failure of the condition set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ or (ii) in the case of any representation or warranty of the Parent or the Merger Sub, in any manner that would result in the failure of the condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or (b) any material breach by such Person (or (x) in case of the Parent\'s obligation to provide notice, any material breach by the Merger Sub or (y) in the case of the Company\'s obligations under _Section 6.1_, any material breach by any Representative attributed to the Company pursuant to _Section 6.1(f)_) of any covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement, (c) any written notice or other written communication from any Governmental Entity or counterparty to a Company Material Contract alleging that the consent of such Governmental Entity or such counterparty, as applicable, is required in connection with the Transactions, or (d) any actions, suits claims or proceedings commenced or, to its knowledge (in the case of the Company, the Company\'s Knowledge), threatened in writing against such Person or any of its Subsidiaries that relate to the consummation of the Transactions. The parties hereto agree that (i) the Company\'s compliance or 

        

failure to comply with this _Section 6.7_ shall not be taken into account
for purposes of determining whether the condition referred to in _Section
7.3(b)_ has been satisfied and (ii) the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this _Section 6.7_ shall not, in and of itself, affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty in this Agreement or the conditions to
the obligations of the parties to consummate the Transactions or the remedies
available to the parties hereunder.

  

 6.8 _ Employee Benefits Matters._ 

  

  

 (a) Subject to the foregoing, for a period of one year following the Effective Time (or, if shorter, the period of employment of the relevant Company Employee), the Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, (i) to each Company Employee a total compensation package no less favorable in the aggregate than the total compensation package (including base salary or wage rates, commissions and target annual cash bonus opportunities but excluding the value of annual equity awards and cash payments in lieu of equity awards) provided to such Company Employee immediately before the Effective Time and (ii) to all Company Employees in the aggregate other employee benefits (other than the Company ESPP, long-term incentive or defined benefit pension or equity awards or cash payments in lieu thereof) that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the other benefits provided to such Company Employees immediately before the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) For purposes of vesting and eligibility to participate (but not for accrual or level of benefits) under the New Plans, each Company Employee shall, subject to applicable law and applicable tax qualification requirements, be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company Employee Plan in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is of the same type as the Company Employee Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii)(A) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Company Employee, the Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the Old Plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employee\'s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. 

   

 (c) If any Company Employee (who is not otherwise a party to an employment agreement, offer letter or similar agreement or arrangement or any amendment or supplement of any of the foregoing, in each case that provides for a different treatment with respect to severance) whose employment is terminated on or prior to the first anniversary of the Effective Time under circumstances under which such Company Employee would have received severance benefits under the Company Severance Policy, the Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to provide that such Company Employee shall be entitled to severance benefits from the Surviving Corporation that are no less favorable than the severance benefits that would have been granted under the Company Severance Policy as in existence on the date of this Agreement and shall notify such Company Employee of such benefits in a manner consistent with the Company\'s past practices prior to the date of this Agreement. 

  

      

                                    

   

  

 (d) From and after the Effective Time, the Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to assume, in accordance with their terms, all obligations of the Company under contracts, agreements, arrangements, policies, plans and commitments of the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the date hereof and in the form provided to Parent prior to the date hereof that are applicable to any current or former employees or directors of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, including any employment, severance, and termination plans and agreements. 

  

 (e) All provisions contained in this Agreement with respect to employee benefit plans or employee compensation are included for the sole benefit of the respective Parties and shall not create any right (including any third party beneficiary rights) in any other Person, including any employee or former employee of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any participant or beneficiary in any Company Employee Plan. Nothing in this Agreement (i) shall require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their subsidiaries to continue to employ any particular Company Employee following the Effective Time or to provide any right to a particular term or condition of employment, (ii) shall, for a period of one year following the Effective Time, permit the reduction of the existing severance or acceleration benefits in effect on the date of this Agreement for any Company Employee, or (iii) except as provided in the foregoing clause (ii), shall be construed to prohibit Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their subsidiaries from amending or terminating any Employee Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms or to amend or create any Employee Benefit Plan or any similar plan or agreement from Parent or its Affiliates. The provisions of _Sections 6.8(a)_ through _6.8(c)_ shall not apply to persons employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries outside the United States or covered by collective bargaining or other labor agreements, it being agreed that such persons shall be treated in accordance with applicable law and the terms of any contracts covering them. 

  

  

 6.9 _ State Takeover Laws._ The Company and the Company Board shall not take any action that would cause any anti-takeover or other similar law to become applicable to restrict or prohibit the Merger or any other Transactions. If any "fair price," "business combination" or "control share acquisition" statute or other similar statute or regulation is or may become applicable to any of the Transactions, the parties hereto shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to (a) take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereunder may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and (b) otherwise take all such actions as are reasonably necessary to eliminate or, if unable to be eliminated, minimize the effects of any such statute or regulation on such transactions; provided that, the Parent and the Merger Sub shall only be required to take any action pursuant to this _Section 6.9_ if they have received written notice from the Company regarding the applicability of such statute or regulation and the Company has requested in such written notice that the Parent and the Merger Sub take specified actions to render such statute or regulation inapplicable. 

  

 6.10 _ Rule 16b-3._ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all reasonable steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company and who would otherwise be subject to Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act to be exempt under such rule to the extent permitted by applicable law. 

  

 6.11 _ Financing._ (a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to use, reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms and subject only to the conditions (including the market flex provisions set forth in the Redacted Fee Letter) set forth in the Financing Letters, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect and comply with the Financing Letters, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms and subject only to the conditions (including the market 

        

flex provisions) set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, (iii) satisfy (and
cause its Affiliates to satisfy) on a timely (taking into account the
Marketing Period) basis all conditions applicable to Parent and its
Affiliates in the Financing Letters and the definitive agreements related
thereto (or, if necessary or deemed advisable by Parent, seek the waiver of
conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub contained in such Financing
Letter or such definitive agreements related thereto), (iv) consummate the
Financing at or prior to the Closing Date, (v) enforce its rights under the
Financing Letters and the definitive agreements relating to the Financing and
(vi) comply with its covenants and other obligations under the Financing
Letters and the definitive agreements relating to the Financing. Parent shall
not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, take any action not
otherwise required under this Agreement that is a breach of, or would result
in termination of, any of the Financing Letters. Parent, Merger Sub and the
Guarantors shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, agree
to or permit any termination of or amendment, supplement or modification to
be made to, or grant any waiver of any provision under, the Financing Letters
or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing if such
termination, amendment, supplement, modification or waiver would be
reasonably likely to (A)(1) reduce (or could have the effect of reducing) the
aggregate amount of any portion of the Debt Financing (including
by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue
discount) unless an alternative source of the Equity Financing or other
financing is increased by a corresponding amount, so long as in the case of
such alternative source of Equity Financing or other financing, the terms
thereof are not of the type that would consitute a Prohibited Amendment under
clauses (B) or (C) below, is then made available, including by increasing the
amount of the Equity Financing or (2) reduce the amount of Equity Financing
unless the Debt Financing or alternative financing is increased by a
corresponding amount, so long as in the case of any alternative financing,
the terms thereof are of the type that would not constitute a Prohibited
Amendment under clauses (B) or (C) below, (B) adversely impact the ability
of Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, to enforce its rights against other
parties to the Financing Letters or the definitive agreements with respect to
the Financing or (C) impose new or additional conditions precedent to the
availability of the Financing or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the
conditions precedent to the Financing, or otherwise expand, amend or modify
any other provision of the Financing Letters in a manner that could
reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent or make less likely to
occur the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the
Financing) on the Closing Date (taking into account the Marketing Period) (the
amendments described in the foregoing clauses (A), (B) and (C), the "
_Prohibited Amendments_ "). Parent shall deliver to the Company true and
complete copies of any amendment, modification, supplement, consent or waiver
to or under any Financing Letter or the definitive agreements relating to the
Financing promptly upon execution thereof other than (1) amendments or
modifications solely for the purpose of joining additional arrangers or
financing sources following the date hereof to the extent effected pursuant to
the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter or (2) any amendments or modifications
to the terms that have been redacted under the Redacted Fee Letter. In
addition to and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent shall not permit
the consummation of the Carveout Transactions prior to the payment in full of
the Merger Consideration unless the net cash proceeds of the Carveout
Transactions payable to the Company on the Closing Date equal or exceed the
sum of (i) the amounts permitted to be borrowed on the Closing Date under
each of the CAR ABL Facility (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter) and
the USR ABL Facility (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter) and (ii) any
reduction in the NAD ABL Closing Amount (as defined in the Debt Commitment
Letter) as a result of the consummation of the Carveout Transactions on the
Closing Date, in each case in order to finance the Transaction.

  

  

 (b) Parent shall keep the Company informed on a current basis and in reasonable detail, upon reasonable request by the Company, of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and provide to the Company drafts (reasonably in advance of execution) and thereafter complete, correct and executed copies of the material definitive documents for the Debt Financing. Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt notice (i) of any actual breach, default (or any 

  

      

  

event that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably
be expected to give rise to any default or breach), termination, cancellation
or repudiation by any party to any of the Financing Letters or definitive
documents related to the Financing of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes
aware, (ii) of the receipt of any written notice or other written
communication from any Financing Source with respect to any (A) actual or
potential breach, default, termination, cancellation or repudiation by any
party to any of the Financing Letters or any definitive document related
to the Financing of any provisions of the Financing Letters or any definitive
document related to the Financing or (B) material dispute or disagreement
between or among any parties to any of the Financing Letters or any
definitive document related to the Financing with respect to the
conditionality or amount of the Financing or the obligation to fund the
Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded at the Closing (but
excluding ordinary course negotiations) and (iii) of the occurrence of an
event or development that could reasonably be expected to adversely
impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to obtain all or any portion of
the Financing contemplated by the Financing Letters in an amount sufficient to
consummate the Transactions. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any
event within two Business Days of the date the Company delivers to Parent or
Merger Sub a written request, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide any
information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance
referred to in the immediately preceding sentence. If any portion of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any
applicable market flex provisions) contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter
and alternative financing (so long as the terms thereof are of the type that
would not constitute a Prohibited Amendment) or an increase in the Equity
Financing is not then made available in an amount equal to such portion, and
such portion is required to fund the Merger Consideration and all fees,
expenses and other amounts contemplated to be paid by Parent pursuant to this
Agreement, Parent shall promptly notify the Company in writing and Parent and
Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain in
replacement thereof, and negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with
respect to, alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount
sufficient to consummate the Transactions with terms and conditions
(including market flex provisions) not materially less favorable, taken as a
whole, to Parent and Merger Sub (or their respective Affiliates) than the
terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event but no later than the final
day of the Marketing Period; _provided_ , that in no event will the
reasonable best efforts of Parent be deemed or construed to require Parent to
(A) pay fees materially in excess of those contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter (including the market flex provisions) or agree to "market flex" terms,
materially less favorable to Parent than the corresponding market flex terms
contained in or contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or (B) enter into
any alternative financing terms the terms of which are materially less
favorable to Parent than the terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter on
the date hereof (taken as a whole). In furtherance of and not in limitation of
the foregoing, in the event that (1) any portion of the Debt
Financing anticipated under the Debt Commitment Letter to be structured as a
high yield bond financing is unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor,
and such amount is not funded through a securities demand under the Debt
Commitment Letter, (2) all conditions contained in _Section 7.1_ and
_Section 7.3_ have been satisfied or waived (other than (x) any such
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing,
and (y) those conditions the failure of which to be satisfied is attributable
to a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of their representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement) and (3) a bridge facility
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (or an alternative bridge
facility or other financing obtained in accordance with this _Section
6.11(b)_) is available on the terms described in the Debt Commitment Letter,
then Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the applicable Financing Sources to
fund such bridge financing in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment
Letter and the proceeds shall be used in lieu of the affected portion of the
high yield bond financing. Parent shall deliver to

  

      

  

the Company true and complete copies of all contracts, agreements or other
arrangements (including Redacted Fee Letters) pursuant to which any such
alternative source shall have committed to provide any portion of the Debt
Financing. For purposes of this _Section 6.11_, (x) references to the
"Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the Financing Letters
as permitted to be amended, modified, supplemented or replaced by this
_Section 6.11_, (y) references to the "Debt Commitment Letter" shall include
such documents as permitted to be amended, modified, supplemented or replaced
by this _Section 6.11_ and (z) references to "Debt Financing" shall include
the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as permitted to
be amended, modified, supplemented or replaced by this _Section 6.11_.

  

 (c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide, and to cause its Subsidiaries to provide, to Parent and Merger Sub, in each case at Parent\'s sole cost and expense, such reasonable cooperation as is customary and reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement, syndication and consummation of the Debt Financing, including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) furnish Parent and Merger Sub and their Debt Financing Sources, as promptly as reasonably practicable, all Required Financial Information, (ii) have the Company designate members of senior management of the Company to execute customary authorization letters with respect to Company information included in a customary confidential information memorandum for a syndicated bank financing and cause management of the Company to participate in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows, sessions (upon reasonable request) with rating agencies, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions between senior management and the sources of the Debt Financing, (iii) provide reasonable and customary assistance with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, road shows, bank information memoranda, private placement memoranda and other customary marketing materials and provide reasonable cooperation with the due diligence efforts of the Debt Financing Sources to the extent reasonable and customary (and, to the extent applicable, subject to the limitations contained in _Section 6.3_ hereof and customary authorization letters with respect to Company information included in a customary confidential information memorandum for a syndicated bank financing), (iv) request the Company\'s independent auditors to cooperate with Parent to obtain the Agreed Upon Form Comfort Letter, (v) to the extent timely requested by Parent and required under the Debt Commitment Letter, to (A) obtain documents reasonably requested by Parent or its Debt Financing Sources relating to the repayment of the existing indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including the Company\'s senior notes to the extent required under _Section 6.17_) and the release of related liens and related guarantees, including a customary payoff letter for the Credit Facility and (B) provide all documentation and other information required by U.S. bank regulatory authorities under applicable "know-your-customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including without limitation the USA PATRIOT Act, relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case as reasonably requested by Parent at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, (vi) assist in the preparation, executing and delivering of definitive financing documents, including guarantee and collateral documents and customary closing certificates as may be required by the Debt Financing (including a solvency certificate from the chief financial officer or other officer of equivalent duties (on the terms and of the type in the form attached to the Debt Commitment Letter) so long as (I) such certificate is not effective prior to the Closing, (II) such certificate shall not be required to be provided in the case of any financing borrowed by the CAR ABL Borrower or the USR ABL Borrower (unless either of the CAR ABL Borrower or USR ABL Borrower constitute existing subsidiaries of the Company in which case this clause (II) shall not apply) and (III) such certificate shall only address the solvency of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis); and other customary documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent and cooperate to facilitate the pledging of, granting of security interests in and obtaining perfection of any liens on, collateral in connection with the Debt Financing, but in no event shall any of the 

  

      

  

foregoing be effective until as of or after the Closing, (vii) cooperate with
Parent, and taking all corporate actions or other similar actions reasonably
necessary to permit the consummation of the Financing, including customary
resolutions, consents or approvals, (viii) use reasonable best efforts to
assist Parent in obtaining legal opinions from local outside counsel
as reasonably requested by Parent for financings similar to the Financing,
(ix) use reasonable best efforts to (A) subject to _Section 6.3_, permit the
prospective lenders involved in the Financing to evaluate the Company and its
Subsidiaries\' current assets, cash management and accounting systems,
policies and procedures relating thereto for the purpose of establishing
collateral arrangements, (B) cooperate with Parent to establish bank and
other accounts and blocked account agreements and lock box arrangements in
connection with the foregoing and (C) permit representatives of the
prospective lenders to conduct commercial field examinations, inventory and
intellectual property appraisals, Phase I environmental assessments and an
appraisal of the owned real property, and make audits and appraisals delivered
for the purposes of any credit facility available to Parent for purposes of
its Financing, (x) provide monthly financial statements (excluding footnotes)
of the Company and its Subsidiaries or business units to the extent the
Company customarily prepares (and has prepared) such financial statements and
(xi) use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Parent in benefiting from
the existing lending relationships of the Companies and the Companies\'
Subsidiaries. Such requested cooperation shall not, in the Company\'s
reasonable judgment, unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business
or operations of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries. In no event shall
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be required to bear any cost or
expense, pay any commitment or other fee, enter into any definitive
agreement, incur any other liability or obligation, make any other payment or
agree to provide any indemnity in connection with the Financing or any of the
foregoing prior to the Effective Time. In addition, nothing in this _Section
6.11_ shall require any action that would conflict with or violate the
Company\'s or any of its Subsidiaries\' organizational documents or any laws
or result in, prior to the Effective Time, the contravention of, or that would
reasonably be expected to result in, prior to the Effective Time, a violation
or breach of, or default under, any contract to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party. In addition, if, in connection with a marketing
effort contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent reasonably requests
the Company to file a Current Report on Form 8-K pursuant to the Exchange Act
that contains material non-public information with respect to the Company,
which Parent reasonably desires to include in a customary offering memorandum
for the Debt Financing, then the Company shall discuss in good faith whether
or not the Company shall file a Current Report on Form 8-K or similar
document containing such material non-public information. For the avoidance of
doubt, none of the Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective officers,
directors (with respect to any Subsidiary of the Company) or employees shall
be required to execute or enter into or perform any agreement with respect to
the Financing contemplated by the Financing Letters that is not contingent
upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to the Closing and no
directors of the Company that will not be continuing directors, acting in such
capacity, shall be required to execute or enter into or perform any
agreement, or to pass any resolutions or consents, with respect to the
Financing, except for any customary authorization letters pursuant to clauses
(ii) or (iii) of the first sentence of this _Section 6.11(c) _. Parent
shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including (A) reasonable
attorneys\' fees and (B) fees and expenses of the Company\'s accounting firms
engaged to assist in connection with the Financing) incurred by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives in
connection with the Financing, including the cooperation of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives contemplated
by this _Section 6.11_ and the compliance by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives with its obligations
under this _Section 6.11_, and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company,
its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any
and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any
of them in connection with

  

      

  

the arrangement of the Financing and any information used in connection
therewith, including compliance by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Representatives with its obligations under this
_Section 6.11_. Nothing contained in this _Section 6.11_ or otherwise shall
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to be an issuer or obligor with
respect to the Debt Financing prior to the Effective Time.

  

 (d) Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, refrain from taking, directly or indirectly, any action that could reasonably be expected to result in the failure of any of the conditions contained in the Financing Letters or in any definitive agreement relating to the Financing. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding the Company\'s obligations under _Section 6.11(c)_, none of the obtaining of the Financing or any permitted alternative financing, the completion of any issuance of securities contemplated by the Financing, or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries having or maintaining any available cash balances is a condition to the Closing, and reaffirm their obligation to consummate the Transactions irrespective and independently of the availability of the Financing or any permitted alternative financing, the completion of any such issuance, or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries having or maintaining any available cash balances subject to the applicable conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.3_. 

  

 (e) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company obtained by Parent or its Representatives pursuant to clause (c) above shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that, upon notice to the Company, Parent may provide such information to potential sources of capital and to rating agencies and prospective lenders and investors during syndication and marketing of the Debt Financing (including any permitted alternative financing) subject to customary confidentiality arrangements with such Persons regarding such information. 

  

  

 6.12 _ Control of Operations._ Without in any way limiting any party\'s rights or obligations under this Agreement, (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the Parent or the Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Company\'s operations prior to the Effective Time and (b) prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries\' operations. 

  

 6.13 _ Security Holder Litigation._ In the event that any litigation related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby is brought by any stockholder of the Company or any holder of the Company\'s other securities against the Company and/or its directors or officers, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of such litigation and shall keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein (but subject to the following sentence), the Company shall have the right to control the defense and settlement of any litigation related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions brought by any stockholder of the Company or any holder of the Company\'s other securities against the Company and/or its directors or officers, provided that the Company shall give the Parent the opportunity to participate, at the Parent\'s expense, in the defense of any such litigation and the Company shall consider in good faith the Parent\'s advice with respect to such litigation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall not settle any such litigation without the prior written consent of Parent. 

   

 6.14 _ Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholders\' Meeting._ 

  

  

 (a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall (i) prepare (with the Parent\'s reasonable cooperation) and file with the SEC within twenty (20) Business Days after the date hereof (subject to Parent\'s reasonable cooperation in connection therewith) a proxy statement (as amended or supplemented from time to time, including the form of proxy card, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") to be sent to the stockholders of the Company relating to the special meeting of the Company\'s stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") to be held to 

  

      

  

consider, among other matters, the adoption of this Agreement and (ii) set a
record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote
at the Company Stockholders Meeting and commence a broker search pursuant to
Section 14a-13 of the Exchange Act in connection therewith. No filing of, or
amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be made by the
Company without providing the Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon which comments the Company will consider for inclusion in good
faith. The Company will advise the Parent promptly after it receives any oral
or written request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement or comments
thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional
information, and will promptly provide the Parent with copies of any written
communication from the SEC or any state securities commission and a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the responses thereto. If, at any time prior to
the Effective Time, any information relating to the Company or the Parent, or
any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be
discovered by the Company or the Parent that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement
would not contain any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
promptly be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required under applicable
law, disseminated to stockholders of the Company; _provided_ that the
delivery of such notice and the filing of any such amendment or supplement
shall not affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made
by any party hereunder or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to
any party.

  

 (b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Company\'s receipt of notice from the SEC that the SEC has completed its review of the Proxy Statement (or, if the SEC does not inform the Company that it intends to review the Proxy Statement on or before the 10th calendar day following the filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement pursuant to Rule 14a-6 under the Exchange Act, as promptly as reasonably practicable following such 10th calendar day), the Company, acting through the Company Board, shall duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and, if applicable, the advisory vote required by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act in connection therewith; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board shall be permitted to adjourn, delay or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting in accordance with applicable law (but not beyond the Outside Date) (i) to the extent necessary to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Company Board has determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel is reasonably likely to be necessary or appropriate under applicable law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Company\'s stockholders prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, (ii) if there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meetings or (iii) on one occasion to allow reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies to the extent the Company Board or any committee thereof reasonably believes necessary in order to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval. Except to the extent that the Company Board shall have effected a Company Board Recommendation Change in accordance with _Section 6.1(b)_, the Company, through the Company Board, shall (A) recommend to its stockholders that they adopt this Agreement and (B) include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement. 

  

  

 6.15 _ Carveout Transaction Matters._ If requested by the Parent, at the Parent\'s sole expense, the Company shall (i) provide commercially reasonable cooperation to the Parent and the Merger Sub\'s review of and planning for the Carveout Transactions, which such cooperation shall be limited to cooperation with Parent and Merger Sub in connection with both parties taking the actions set forth on 

        

 _Section 6.15_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (ii) without
limitation or modification to the restrictions set forth in _Section
5.1_, refrain from taking actions to effect any internal reorganization to
implement the Carveout Transactions without the prior written consent of the
Parent; provided that nothing set forth in this _Section 6.15_ shall require
the Company to take any corporate action, to execute any document or other
instrument, or to incur any liability that is not conditioned upon or that
would be effective prior to the Effective Time. Without limitation of the
Company\'s obligations set forth in _Section 6.11_, the Parties agree and
acknowledge that (i) the Company\'s compliance or failure to comply with this
_Section 6.15_ shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining
whether the condition referred to in _Section 7.3(b)_ shall have been
satisfied with respect to performance in all material respects with this 
_Section 6.15_, (ii) upon satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth
in _Article VII_ and completion of the Marketing Period, the Closing will
proceed in accordance with _Section 1.3_ notwithstanding the status of the
review, planning, preparation or implementation of any Carveout Transaction,
(iii) Parent and Merger Sub\'s sole remedy for the Company\'s breach of this
_Section 6.15_ shall be specific performance (and the Company acknowledges
and agrees that such remedy shall be available against it) and (iv) no action
taken by the Company prior to Closing at the request of the Parent pursuant to
a Carveout Transaction shall be a breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant included in this Agreement.

  

 6.16 _ Repatriation._ Parent may periodically request from the Company, and the Company will provide (but not more often than monthly), an estimate of the amount of cash that it believes could be repatriated by the Company as of a Closing Date estimated by Parent in good faith, understanding that such amounts are only an estimate, that actual amounts may vary from such estimates and that the Company shall not be liable for any such variances. Not less than fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the Closing, Parent may request in writing to the Company (the " _Repatriation Notice_ ") that the Company and its wholly owned Subsidiaries use their reasonable best efforts to cooperate to transfer in any jurisdiction located outside of the United States (the " _Repatriation Jurisdictions_ ") legally or contractually unrestricted cash balances held in commercial bank accounts in the name of the Company or such wholly owned Subsidiary to accounts in the name of the Company or a wholly owned Subsidiary located in the United States (the " _Repatriation_ "; and " _Repatriate_ " shall have a correlative meaning) effective as of the Effective Time. The Repatriation Notice shall specify the Repatriation Jurisdictions that Parent would like the Company to repatriate cash from and Parent\'s good faith estimate of the Closing Date. The Company will review the Repatriation Notice and send to Parent, as promptly as practicable after the receipt thereof (and in any event within five (5) Business Days), a written response setting forth the following information with respect each Repatriation Jurisdiction (the " _Repatriation Response_ "): (a) the amount of cash in each Repatriation Jurisdiction that the Company believes could be reasonably Repatriated, taking into account (i) Parent\'s estimate of the Closing Date, (ii) the amount of cash reasonably needed in such Repatriation Jurisdiction to operate the business in the ordinary course and meet working capital requirements in such Repatriation Jurisdiction, (iii) applicable law, including those relating to solvency, adequate surplus, similar capital adequacy tests, corporate benefit, financial assistance, distributable reserves and directors\' duties, and (iv) any estimated Taxes or fees and expenses to be paid in such Repatriation Jurisdiction in connection with the Repatriation, (b) the estimated costs and expenses that would be incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the Repatriation, including estimated Taxes that would be payable on such Repatriated amount and the estimated fees and expenses of counsel and accountants in connection with any such Repatriation (collectively, the " _Estimated Costs_ ") and (c) the amount of time that the Company estimates it would take for the Repatriation to be completed in each such Repatriation Jurisdiction identified in the Repatriation Notice; provided that, in each case it is understood that such amounts and other information in any Repatriation Response are only estimates, that actual amounts and timing may vary from such estimates and that the Company shall not be liable for any such variances. The Company shall not unreasonably deny a request for repatriation set forth in a Repatriation Notice. Within five (5) Business Days following delivery of the Repatriation Response, 

        

Parent shall notify the Company in writing whether or not Parent wishes for
the Company to consummate as of the Effective Time any or all of the
Repatriations set forth in the Repatriation Response (including the amount of
any such Repatriation, subject to increases or decreases of such amounts by
the Company as may be reasonable at the time of Repatriation based on the
amount of unrestricted cash actually available at such time) (the "
_Repatriation Confirmation_ ") and if it requests any such Repatriation,
confirming with respect to each such Repatriation, (x) that it approves of
the Company and its Subsidiaries taking the actions reasonably necessary in
the Company\'s sole judgment to effect such Repatriation and (y) that
it approves of the Company incurring the Estimated Costs (and any additional
costs as may be reasonably incurred in connection with the Repatriation).
Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and
its and their Representatives from and against any and all liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments, Taxes
(including loss of tax attributes) and penalties suffered or incurred by them
in connection with the Repatriation, including any action taken in accordance
with this _Section 6.16_ and including the Estimated Costs (and any
additional costs). Without limiting the generality of the immediately
preceding sentence, Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company,
reimburse the Company for all Estimated Costs (and any additional costs)
actually incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with this
_Section 6.16_. Without limitation of the Company\'s obligations set forth in
_Section 6.11_, the Parties agree and acknowledge that (1) the Company\'s
compliance or failure to comply with this _Section 6.16_ shall not be taken
into account for purposes of determining whether the condition referred to in
_Section 7.3(b)_ shall have been satisfied with respect to performance in all
material respects with this  _Section 6.16_, (2) upon satisfaction or waiver
of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ and completion of the Marketing
Period, the Closing will proceed in accordance with _Section 1.3_
notwithstanding the status of any Repatriation and (3) Parent and Merger
Sub\'s sole remedy for the Company\'s breach of this _Section 6.16_ shall be
specific performance (and the Company acknowledges and agrees that such remedy
shall be available against it). Nothing in this _Section 6.16_ shall require
any action that would conflict with or violate the Company\'s or any of its
Subsidiaries\' organizational documents or any applicable laws or result in,
prior to the Effective Time, the contravention of, or that would reasonably be
expected to result in, prior to the Effective Time, a violation or breach of,
or default under, any contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party.

  

 6.17 _ Treatment of Certain Notes._ 

  

  

 (a) Reference is made to each of (i) the 2.750% Senior Notes Due 2018 issued by the Company (the " _2018 Notes_ ") and (ii) the 4.375% Senior Notes Due 2023 issued by the Company (the " _2023 Notes_ and, collectively with the 2018 Notes, the " _Notes_ "; the indenture governing the Notes being the " _Indenture_ "). 

  

 (b) At the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation under any of the then outstanding Notes to comply with all of the terms and conditions of the then outstanding Notes and the Indenture, including, to the extent required by the terms and conditions of any of the then outstanding Notes or the Indenture, causing the Surviving Corporation under any series of Notes to obtain and deliver officers\' certificates and opinions of counsel stating that the Merger and the other Transactions comply with the Indenture. 

   

 (c) At the request and expense of Parent, the Company shall promptly at a time reasonably requested by Parent, commence an offer to purchase for any and all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes on price terms that are acceptable to Parent and such other customary terms and conditions as are reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent to be consummated substantially simultaneously with the Closing using funds provided by Parent (the " _Debt Tender Offer_ ") and Parent shall assist the Company in connection therewith. The Company shall adopt any corporate authorizations that are reasonable and necessary for the Debt Tender Offer. The Company shall and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to, 

  

      

  

provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the
Debt Tender Offer. The closing of the Debt Tender Offer shall be conditioned
on the occurrence of the Closing, and the parties shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause the Debt Tender Offer to close on the Closing Date;
_provided_ that the consummation of the Debt Tender Offer with respect to any
series of Notes shall not be a condition to Closing. Concurrent with the
Effective Time, and in accordance with the terms of the Debt Tender Offer, the
Surviving Corporation shall accept for purchase and purchase each series of
Notes properly tendered and not properly withdrawn in the Debt Tender Offer
using funds provided by or at the direction of Parent. Parent
hereby covenants and agrees to provide (or to cause to be provided)
immediately available funds to the Company for the full payment at the
Effective Time of all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn to the extent
required pursuant to the terms of the Debt Tender Offer.

contrary in this _Section 6.17(f)_, the Company shall comply with the
requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other applicable law
to the extent such laws are applicable in connection with the any change of
control offer for the 2023 Notes or any Debt Tender Offer and such compliance
will not be deemed a breach hereof.

  

 (g) So long as the Company has sufficient immediately available funds for the full payment of the 2023 Notes validly tendered, the Company shall waive any of the conditions to any Debt Tender Offer (other than that the Merger shall have been consummated and that there shall be no final order, decree, judgment, injunction, ruling or other non-appealable action prohibiting consummation of any Debt Tender Offer) as may be reasonably requested by Parent in writing and shall not, without the written consent of Parent, waive any condition to any Debt Tender Offer or make any changes to any Debt Tender Offer or such change of control offer other than as agreed between Parent and the Company. 

  

 (h) In connection with the change of control offer for the 2023 Notes or any Debt Tender Offer, Parent may select one or more dealer managers, information agents, depositaries and other agents, in each case as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, to provide assistance in connection therewith and the Company shall enter into customary agreements (including indemnities) with such parties so selected; provided that the Company shall not be responsible for the delivery of any legal opinions with respect thereto. Parent shall pay the fees and out-of-pocket expenses of any dealer manager, information agent, depositary or other agent retained in connection with any Debt Tender Offer or such change of control offer upon the incurrence of such fees and out-of-pocket expenses. 

  

 (i) Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Company in connection with the Company\'s compliance with its obligations under this _Section 6.17_, including all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Company in connection with any Debt Tender Offer, Discharge or change of control offer made in respect of any series of Notes (including any out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation or distribution of any Offer Documents or other documents related thereto). Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or liabilities incurred by any of them in connection with any action taken by them pursuant to this _Section 6.17_ with respect to any Debt Tender Offer, Discharge or change of control offer (in each case other than as a result of the Company\'s fraud or willful misconduct); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parent shall not have any obligation to indemnify and hold harmless any such party or person to the extent such damages suffered or incurred are directly attributable to the information provided by the Company for use in connection with such Debt Tender Offer, Discharge or change of control offer that is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have contained a material misstatement or omission. 

  

      

  

 (j) Without limitation of the Company\'s obligations set forth in _Section 6.11_, the Parties agree and acknowledge that (i) the Company\'s compliance or failure to comply with this _Section 6.17_ shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining whether the condition referred to in _Section 7.3(b)_ shall have been satisfied with respect to performance in all material respects with this _Section 6.17_, (ii) upon satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ and completion of the Marketing Period, the Closing will proceed in accordance with _Section 1.3_ notwithstanding the status of any Debt Tender Offer, Discharge or change of control offer and (iii) no action taken by the Company prior to Closing at the request or direction of the Parent pursuant to any Debt Tender Offer, Discharge or change of control offer shall be a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant included in this Agreement.

 10.4 _ Third Party Beneficiaries; No Recourse._

 (b) This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or the Transactions may only be made against the entities that are expressly identified as signatories hereto and no Parent Related Party (other than each Guarantor to the extent set forth in such Guarantor\'s Limited Guarantee or such Guarantor\'s Equity Funding Letter) shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the parties to this Agreement or for any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith. Without limiting the rights of the Company against Parent or Merger Sub hereunder, in no event shall the Company or any of its Affiliates, and the Company agrees not to and to cause its Affiliates not to, seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, any Parent Related Party (other than Parent or Merger Sub or any payment from a Guarantor to the extent set forth in the applicable Limited Guarantee). 

  

  

 10.5 _ Assignment._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void; _provided_ , _however_ , that each of the Parent and the Merger Sub (i) any or all of its rights (but not its obligations) hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates controlled by Sycamore Partners Management, L.P. that was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions, has engaged in no other business activities and has conducted its operations only as contemplated by this Agreement (provided that no such assignment shall (x) affect the obligations of any such Affiliate who has committed to provide Equity Financing under the applicable Equity Funding Letter or the Guarantors under the Limited Guarantees, (y) impede or delay the consummation of the Transactions or (z) relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of its 

        

obligations under this Agreement), and (ii) may, from and after the Closing,
assign in whole or in part, this Agreement or any or all of its rights and
obligations hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates or for collateral

be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

   

 10.6 _ Severability._ Any term or provision (or part thereof) of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions (or parts thereof) hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision (or part thereof) in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision (or part thereof) hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the court making such determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision (or part thereof), to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision (or part thereof) with a term or provision (or part thereof) that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision (or part thereof), and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto shall replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision (or part thereof) with a valid and enforceable term or provision (or part thereof) that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term (or part thereof).

 10.9 _ Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware; _provided_ that, except as specifically set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters, all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the Debt Financing Sources in any way relating to the Debt Commitment Letters or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to principles or rules or conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require or permit the application of laws of another jurisdiction. 

  

 10.10 _ Remedies._ 

  

  

 (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Person will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such Person, and the exercise by a Person of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. 

  

 (b) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary relief (including any fees payable pursuant to _Section 8.3_), even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached, including if the parties hereto fail to take any action required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement. Subject to the following sentence and _Section 10.10(c)_, the parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts described in _Section 10.11_ without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, (b) the provisions set forth in _Section 8.3_ and _10.10(c)_ (i) are not intended to and do not adequately compensate for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement and (ii) shall not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any party\'s right to specific enforcement and (c) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the contrary herein, it is explicitly agreed that the right of the Company to obtain an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection with enforcing Parent\'s obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable Equity Funding Letter and to effect the Closing in accordance with _Section 1.3_ (but not the right of the Company to such injunctions, specific performance or other equitable remedies for any other reason) shall be subject in all events to the requirements that (i) the Marketing Period has ended and the satisfaction, or express written waiver by Parent of all conditions precedent to the obligations of Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby set forth in in _Sections 7.1_ and _7.3_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to such conditions being satisfied at the Closing) at the time when the Closing would have been required to occur pursuant to _Section 1.3_, but for the failure of the Equity Financing to be funded, (ii) the Debt Financing (including any alternative financing that has been obtained in accordance with _Section 6.11(b)_) has been funded or will be funded in accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing if the Equity Financing is or were to be funded at the Closing, and (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that (x) if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing were funded, then it would take such actions required of it by this Agreement to cause the Closing to occur and (y) it stands ready, willing and able to consummate the Merger. The parties hereto agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, and not to assert 

  

      

  

that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy or that
the parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section 10.10(b)_
shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection
with any such order or injunction.

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary: 

    

 (i) in the event that the Company shall terminate this Agreement in circumstances where the Parent Termination Fee is owed pursuant to _Section 8.3(c)_, then, the Company\'s right to receive payment of the Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.3(c)_ shall, together with any indemnification for or reimbursement of any applicable expenses pursuant to _Section 6.11(c) _, _6.15_ , _6.16_ , _6.17_ or _8.3(e)_ , be the sole and exclusive remedy for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by the Company, the Company Related Parties or any other Person arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the Financing Letters or the Limited Guarantee, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (and the abandonment or termination hereof or thereof), any breach (including any Willful Breach) or failure to perform hereunder or thereunder, the failure of the Merger or the other Transactions to be consummated, or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and, upon payment of such amount, neither the Company, any Company Related Party nor any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against Parent, Merger Sub, any Guarantor, the Financing Sources or any of their respective representatives (including any investment banker, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other advisors) or any of their respective Affiliates or any of their or their Affiliates\' respective direct or indirect, former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, equityholders, securityholders, financing sources, managers, members, directors, officers, representatives, employees, controlling persons, agents or assignees (collectively, the " _Parent Related Parties_ ") for any loss or damage arising out of or in connection with any breach (including any Willful Breach) or failure to perform under this Agreement, the Financing Letters or the Limited Guarantee, any of the Transactions (or the abandonment or termination thereof), the failure of the Merger or the other Transactions to be consummated or any matters forming the basis for such termination (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Confidentiality Agreement); _provided_ that nothing in this  _Section 10.10(c)_ shall limit the rights of the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives under the Confidentiality Agreement or to be indemnified and reimbursed for expenses in accordance with _Section 6.11(c)_, _6.15_ , _6.16_ , _6.17_ or _8.3(e)_. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence, upon payment to the Company of such Parent Termination Fee, none of Parent or the Parent Related Parties or any of their representatives, including any investment banker, financial advisor, any Debt Financing Source, attorney, accountant or other advisor, agent, representative or affiliate shall have any further liability or obligation to the Company or any Company Related Party relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; 

  

 (ii) in the event that Parent or its designee shall become entitled to receive full payment of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_, then Parent\'s right to receive payment of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_ shall, together with any reimbursement of applicable expenses pursuant to _Section 8.3(e)_, be the sole and exclusive remedy for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, the Parent Related Parties or any other Person arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the Transactions (and the abandonment or termination thereof) any breach (including any Willful Breach) or failure to perform hereunder, the failure of the Merger or 

   

      

   

the other Transactions to be consummated, or any matter forming the basis for
such termination, and, upon payment of such amount, none of Parent, Merger
Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled
to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the Company and
its Subsidiaries and any of their respective direct or indirect, former,
current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers,
members, financing sources, representatives, employees, controlling persons,
agents or Affiliates or any other Person claiming by, through or for the
benefit of the Company (collectively, " _Company Related Parties_ ") arising
out of or in connection with this Agreement (including any Willful
Breach), any of the Transactions, the failure of the Merger or the other
Transactions to be consummated or any matters forming the basis for such
termination; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section 10.10(c)_ shall limit
the rights of the Parent and any of its applicable Representatives under the
Confidentiality Agreement or to be indemnified and reimbursed for expenses in
accordance with _Section 8.3(e)_; and

  

 (iii) in connection with any loss suffered by the Company or any Company Related Party arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the Financing Letters or the Limited Guarantees and the Transactions, including as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby to be consummated or for a breach (including Willful Breach) or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise (other than in the circumstances in which the Company is entitled to receive the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.3(c)_) the Company agrees, on behalf of itself and the Company Related Parties, that the maximum aggregate monetary liability of Parent and the Parent Related Parties, if any, shall be limited to the amount of the Parent Termination Fee, and in no event shall the Company or any Company Related Party seek or be entitled to recover from Parent or any Parent Related Parties, and the Company on behalf of itself and the Company Related Parties hereby irrevocably waives and relinquishes any right to seek or recover, any monetary damages in excess of such amount, including through Parent, Merger Sub, any Parent Related Party or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any applicable law, through a claim based in tort, contract or otherwise (except that Parent shall be obligated to the Company under the Confidentiality Agreement, _Section 8.3(e)_ and for any of its expense reimbursement and indemnification obligations contained in _Sections 6.11(c) _, _6.15_ , _6.16_ and _6.17_ ). 

  

 (iv) In connection with any loss suffered by any Parent Related Party as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, other than in the circumstances in which Parent is entitled to receive the Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_, Parent agrees, on behalf of itself and the Parent Related Parties, that the maximum aggregate monetary liability of the Company and the Company Related Parties, if any, shall be limited to the amount of the Company Termination Fee, and in no event shall Parent or any Parent Related Party seek or be entitled to recover from the Company or any Company Related Parties, and Parent on behalf of itself and the Parent Related Parties hereby irrevocably waives and relinquishes any right to seek or recover, any monetary damages in excess of such amount (except that the Company shall be obligated to the Parent under the Confidentiality Agreement and _Section 8.3(e)_). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent acknowledges and agress that it shall not be entitled to monetary damages for any breach of _Section 6.15_ or _Section 6.16_ by the Company and that its sole and exclusive remedy for any breach of _Section 6.15_ or _Section 6.16_ by the Company shall be specific performance (and the Company acknowledges and agrees that such remedy shall be available against it). 

   

       

For the avoidance of doubt, while each of the Company and Parent may pursue
both a grant of specific performance in accordance with _Section 10.10(b)_
and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee or the Company Termination Fee,
as applicable, under _Section 8.3(b)_ or _Section 8.3(c)_, respectively, or
the recovery of monetary damages subject to the limitations set forth in
_Section 10.10(c)(iii)_ or _Section 10.10(c)(iv)_, under no circumstances
shall the Company or Parent be permitted or entitled to receive both (1) a
grant of specific performance of the Equity Financing to be funded and/or that
results in a Closing and consummation of the Transactions and (2) any money
damages, including monetary damages in lieu of specific performance and all or
any portion of the Parent Termination Fee or the Company Termination Fee, as
applicable, and in no event shall the Company Related Parties or the Parent
Related Parties be entitled to receive any damages whatsoever if the Parent
Termination Fee or the Company Termination Fee, as applicable, is paid
(except for any obligations arising under the Confidentiality Agreement,
_Section 8.3(e)_, _Section 6.11(c) _, _Section 6.15_, _Section 6.16_
and _Section 6.17_). The parties acknowledge and agree that the fact that
the parties have agreed to this _Section 10.10(c)_ shall not be deemed to
affect any party\'s right to specific performance under _Section
10.10(b)_ (subject to the limitations set forth therein). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no Debt Financing Source shall be liable for any indirect,
special, punitive or consequential damages (including, without limitation, any
loss of profits, business or anticipated savings) in connection with the Debt
Commitment Letter, this Agreement, the Transactions, or with respect to any
activities related to the Debt Financing.

  

 10.11 _ Submission to Jurisdiction._ Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, New Castle County, or, if that court does not have jurisdiction, a federal court sitting in the State of Delaware in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in any such court, (c) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and (d) agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement in any other court. Each of the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be required of any other Person with respect thereto.

 10.12 _ WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL._ EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN 

        

RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING

OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY AND FOR ANY LITIGATION
(WHETHER IN LAW OR IN EQUITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT OR OTHERWISE)
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE DEBT
COMMITMENT LETTERS, THE TRANSACTIONS AND FINANCINGS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY OR
THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF, INCLUDING ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM

The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such information is required by the terms hereof to be disclosed, is material, has resulted in or would result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or is outside the Ordinary Course of Business. 

  

 10.14 _ Parent Guarantee._ The Parent agrees to take all action necessary to cause the Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to perform all of its agreements, covenants and obligations under this Agreement.
