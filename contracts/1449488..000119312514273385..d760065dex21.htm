conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, the Shareholder will sell,

ARTICLE III

 

PURCHASE PRICE; ADJUSTMENTS

 

Section 3.1. _Purchase Price_. The aggregate cash amount to be paid for the
Shares by the Purchaser at Closing (the " _Closing Payment_ ") shall be an
amount equal to (a) $825,000,000 (the " _Purchase Price_ "), plus (b) the
Estimated Working Capital Surplus, if any, minus (c) the Estimated Working
Capital Deficit, if any. At the time of Closing, the Company shall have no
Indebtedness; _provided_ that, to the extent that, at the time of Closing, the
Company has any Indebtedness, the Purchase Price shall be subject to a
downward adjustment in the amount of such Indebtedness. 

Section 3.2. _Closing Date Statement_. Not less than two (2) Business Days
before the Closing Date, the Shareholder shall deliver to the Purchaser a
statement (the " _Closing Date Statement_ "), signed by the Vice President of
Finance of the Shareholder, which sets forth the Shareholders good faith best
estimate of (A) the Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Working Capital_
"), and (B) the Estimated Working Capital Surplus, if any, or the Estimated
Working Capital Deficit, if any. The Closing Date Statement shall be prepared
in good faith in accordance with GAAP, except as otherwise provided in the
definition of Net Working Capital. The Closing Date Statement shall be
accompanied by supporting or back-up schedules and documentation. If Purchaser
has any disagreements regarding whether the Closing Date Statement was
prepared in accordance with this _Section 3.2_, the Purchaser shall contact
the Shareholder at least one Business Day before the Closing Date, and in such
case the Shareholder and the Purchaser shall attempt in

 



-16-  good faith to resolve any disagreements. If the Purchaser and the
Shareholder agree on changes to the Shareholders proposed Closing Date
Statement, then the Closing Date Statement will be revised by the Shareholder
to give effect to such changes (and the Closing Date Statement, as so revised,
shall be deemed to be the Closing Date Statement for all purposes herein). If
the Purchaser and the Shareholder do not agree on changes to the Closing Date
Statement, then the Closing Date Statement initially delivered by the
Shareholder shall be deemed to be the Closing Date Statement for purposes of
this Agreement.

 

Section 3.3. _Payment of Purchase Price_. On the Closing Date, the Purchaser
shall pay the Shareholder an aggregate amount equal to the Closing Payment.
All payments required under this _Section 3.3_ or any other provision of this
Agreement shall be made in cash by the wire transfer of immediately available
funds to such bank account as shall be designated in writing by the
recipient, at least three (3) Business Days before the applicable payment
date.

Section 3.4. _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

(a) No later than ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, the Purchaser
shall prepare and deliver to the Shareholder a statement (the " _Preliminary
Working Capital Schedule_ "), which sets forth the Purchasers calculation of
(i) the Net Working Capital and (ii) the Working Capital Surplus, if any, or
the Working Capital Deficit, if any. The Preliminary Working Capital Schedule
shall be prepared in good faith in accordance with GAAP, except as otherwise
provided in the definition of Net Working Capital. Purchaser may only make a
claim for an adjustment to Net Working Capital on the Preliminary Working
Capital Schedule in respect of inventory if, and to the extent, that (1) such
inventory is listed or reflected as inventory owned by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date Statement as of the Closing Date, but is
not owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date,
(2) such inventory was assigned a book value in preparing the Closing Date
Statement in excess of the value that should have been assigned in accordance
with GAAP, except as otherwise provided on _Exhibit 1.1(c)_.

(b) The Shareholder shall have thirty (30) days following receipt of the
Preliminary Working Capital Schedule during which to notify the Purchaser of
any dispute of any item contained in the Preliminary Working Capital Schedule,
which notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") shall set forth in reasonable detail
the basis for such dispute. If the Shareholder fails to notify the Purchaser
of any such dispute within such thirty (30) day period, the Preliminary
Working Capital Schedule shall be deemed to be the Final Working Capital
Schedule, and any items or components of the Preliminary Working Capital
Schedule with respect to which the Shareholder does not deliver a Dispute
Notice within such 30-day period shall be deemed accepted and agreed to by
the Shareholder, and shall be final and binding on the parties to this
Agreement.

(c) If the Shareholder timely delivers a Dispute Notice to the Purchaser, the
Purchaser and the Shareholder shall cooperate in good faith to reach agreement
on the disputed item(s) on the Preliminary Working Capital Schedule as
promptly as possible. Upon any resolution and agreement, the Final Working
Capital Schedule shall be prepared in accordance with the agreement of the
Purchaser and the Shareholder.

 



-17- (d) If the Purchaser and the Shareholder are unable to resolve any
dispute regarding the Preliminary Working Capital Schedule and reach
agreement within thirty (30) days (or such longer period as the Purchaser and
the Shareholder shall mutually agree in writing), following delivery of the
Dispute Notice, the Purchaser and the Shareholder shall (i) appoint the
Houston office of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited or (ii) if such accounting
firm is unable or unwilling to take such assignment, appoint an accounting
firm mutually agreed upon by the Purchaser and the Shareholder (such
identified accounting firm or, if applicable, the firm so selected, the "
_Arbitrator_ ") and submit such disputed matters to the Arbitrator for
resolution. Such resolution shall be final and binding on the Parties. The
Purchaser and the Shareholder shall instruct the Arbitrator to make a final
determination of Net Working Capital and the Working Capital Deficit, if any,
or the Working Capital Surplus, if any, based solely on the items that are
in dispute and that, in resolving such items in dispute and in determining
Net Working Capital and the Working Capital Deficit, if any, or the Working
Capital Surplus, if any, the Arbitrator shall not assign to any item in
dispute a value that is (A) greater than the greatest value for such item
assigned by the Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Shareholder, on the other
hand, or (B) less than the smallest value for such item assigned by the
Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Shareholder, on the other hand. In
addition, the Arbitrators review shall be limited to the items or amounts
that have been identified as items or amounts as to which the Purchaser and
the Shareholder have been unable to agree, and the Arbitrator shall consider
only the written materials submitted by the Purchaser and the Shareholder and
the applicable provisions of this Agreement (i.e., the Arbitrator will not
conduct an independent review). The Arbitrator shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to complete its work within sixty (60) days
following its engagement. The fees, costs and expenses of the Arbitrator (1)
shall be borne by the Purchaser in the proportion that the aggregate dollar
amount of all such disputed items so submitted that are unsuccessfully
disputed by the Purchaser (as finally determined by the Arbitrator) bears to
the aggregate dollar amount of such items so submitted and (2) shall be borne
by the Shareholder in the proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of such
disputed items so submitted that are successfully disputed by the Purchaser
(as finally determined by the Arbitrator) bears to the aggregate dollar amount
of all such items so submitted. If any disputes are submitted to the
Arbitrator pursuant to this _Section 3.4(d)_, the Final Working Capital
Schedule shall be prepared in accordance with the decision of the Arbitrator
and, to the extent applicable, the agreement of the Purchaser and
the Shareholder.

(e) Within five (5) Business Days following the determination of the Final
Working Capital Schedule in accordance with this _Section 3.4_:

(i) To the extent that there is a Working Capital Deficit on the
Final Working Capital Schedule, the Shareholder shall be obligated to pay to
the Purchaser in cash an aggregate amount equal to the Working Capital Deficit
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
the Purchaser;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Shareholder shall not be
obligated to make any payments under this Section 3.4(e)(i) to the extent that
such Working Capital Deficit was already subtracted from the Purchase Price
pursuant to  _Section 3.1_ as an Estimated Working Capital Deficit.

 



-18- (ii) To the extent there is a Working Capital Surplus on the Final
Working Capital Schedule, the Purchaser shall pay to the Shareholder in cash
an aggregate amount equal to the Working Capital Surplus by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the Shareholder;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that Purchaser shall not be obligated to make any
payments under this Section 3.4(e)(ii) to the extent that such Working Capital
surplus was already added to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 3.1_ as
an Estimated Working Capital Surplus.

(f) For Tax purposes, any payment by the Purchaser or the Shareholder under
this  _Section 3.4_, shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price
unless a contrary treatment is required by Law.

assets or agree to any restriction in connection with such efforts), and shall
cooperate fully with the other Party and its Representatives in connection
with any step required to be taken as a part of its obligations hereunder,

and the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to prepare and file as
promptly as possible (but in no event more than five (5) Business Days after

information requested by such Governmental Entity in connection with the HSR

request. Each Party shall cooperate with the other in promptly filing any
other necessary applications, reports or other documents with
any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction with respect to this Agreement

consultation with and prompt favorable action by such Governmental Entity.
Without 

 



-42-  limiting the generality of the Purchasers undertaking pursuant to this
_Section 6.3(a)_, the Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to take the steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment
under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law that may be asserted

possible, including proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of the assets, properties or businesses to be acquired by it
pursuant to this Agreement as are required to be divested in order to avoid
the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding, which will
otherwise have the effect of materially delaying or preventing the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the Purchaser be obligated to (i) sell,
divest or dispose of more than ten percent (10%) of the assets, properties or
businesses to be acquired by it pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) complete

than ten percent (10%) of its assets, properties or businesses; and,

temporary, preliminary or permanent) that will prevent the Closing.

memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals made by or on behalf of
either Party before any Governmental Entity or the staff or regulators of any
Governmental Entity, in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereunder (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not including any interactions
between the Shareholder or the Company with Governmental Entities in the
ordinary course of business, any disclosure which is not permitted by Law or
any disclosure containing confidential information) shall be disclosed to the
other Party hereunder in advance of any filing, submission or attendance, it
being the intent that the Parties will consult and cooperate with one another,
and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any
such analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals. Each Party shall give notice to the
other Party with respect to any meeting, discussion, appearance or contact
with any Governmental Entity or the staff or regulators of any Governmental
Entity, with such notice being sufficient to provide the other Party with the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting, discussion, appearance
or contact. The Purchaser, after consultation with the Shareholder, shall take
the lead in determining strategy for conducting such meetings, discussions,
appearances and contacts. Further, the Purchaser shall take the lead
in coordinating any filings, obtaining any necessary approvals and resolving
any investigation or other inquiry of any Governmental Entity.

 

(c) If any claim, action, suit, investigation or other proceeding by any
Governmental Entity or other Person is commenced that questions the validity
or legality of the Acquisition or any other transaction contemplated hereby or
seeks damages in

 



-43-  connection therewith, the Parties shall (i) cooperate and use all
commercially reasonable efforts to defend against such claim, action, suit,
investigation or other proceeding, (ii) in the event an injunction or other
order is issued in any such action, suit or other proceeding, use all
commercially reasonable efforts to have such injunction or other order lifted,
and (iii) cooperate reasonably regarding any other impediment to the Closing.

parties and use its commercially reasonable best efforts (in consultation
with the Purchaser) to obtain all third-party consents (i) necessary, proper
or advisable to the Closing; (ii) required to be given or obtained, including
those required to be given or obtained on  _Schedule 4.13_ and the other
Schedules; (iii) required to avoid a breach of or default under any Company
Contract in connection with the Closing or (iv) required to prevent a Material
Adverse Effect, whether before, on or following the Closing Date.

be obligated to pay any consideration to any third party for any requested
consent or approval.

 

(e) The Shareholder, on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand,
shall give prompt notice to the other Party of (i) the occurrence, or failure
to occur, of any event, the occurrence or failure of which is likely to cause
any representation or warranty of the Shareholder or the Purchaser, as the
case may be, contained herein to be untrue or inaccurate at any time from the
date hereof to the Closing Date or that results in the failure to satisfy any
condition specified in _Article VIII_ and (ii) any failure of the Shareholder
or the Purchaser, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by any of them
hereunder. The Shareholder hereby acknowledges that the Purchaser does not and
shall not waive any right it may have hereunder as a result of such
notifications.

of either thereof to do all things required by the Company or any Subsidiary
pursuant to this Agreement.

with the requirements of any applicable Laws, the rules and regulations of
each stock exchange upon which the securities of such Party are listed, if any

public announcement shall consult in good faith with the other Party before
issuing any such press release or making any such public announcement and
shall allow the other Party reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance), or in connection with the
Financing, no filing, press release or similar public announcement or
communication shall be made by it or caused to be made by it concerning the
execution or performance of this Agreement unless it shall have consulted the
other Party in advance with respect thereto and such other Party consents in
writing (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) to such filing, release, announcement or communication;
_provided_ , _however_ , each Party and its Affiliates may make internal
announcements regarding this Agreement to its directors, officers and
employees without the consent of the other Party. If either Party determines
that any of this Agreement, the Shareholder Ancillary Agreements or the
Purchaser Ancillary Agreements must be filed pursuant to applicable Law, then
before making such filing, such Party shall provide 

 



-44-  the other Party with a version of any document it intends to file with any
necessary redactions, and shall give due consideration to the other Partys
comments regarding the redacted version and use commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure confidential treatment by the applicable authority of any
sections specified by such Party.

 

Section 6.5. _Supplements to Schedules_. From time to time up to the Closing,
the Shareholder may supplement or amend the Schedules hereto with respect to
any matter hereafter-arising or of which it becomes aware after the date

shall be deemed to be incorporated into and to supplement and amend the
Schedules as of the Closing Date. The Shareholder shall be considered in
breach of this Agreement for purposes of _Article VII_ , _Article IX_ and

pursuant to  _Section 9.1(c)_ as a result of the event, action, development
or occurrence which is the subject of the disclosure in a Schedule Supplement,

together with each WAC Employee Offeree who accepts his/her Offer, the "
_Company Continuing Employees_ ") with a base salary or hourly wages which are
no less than the base salary or hourly wages provided by the Company or one of
its Subsidiaries, as applicable, immediately before the Closing.

(c) _Incentive Compensation_. Following the Closing, each Company Continuing
Employee shall be eligible to participate in the Purchasers (or, as
applicable, its parents) incentive compensation plans (the " _Purchaser
Incentive Plans_ ") applicable to an employee of equivalent level
and experience. Not later than March 1, 2015, any CSI Employee still employed
as of December 31, 2014 by the Company or an Affiliate of the Purchaser shall
receive from the Company or one of its Affiliates incentive compensation in an
amount equal to the amount accrued by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries,
as applicable, as of the Closing Date for such CSI Employee under the
Incentive Compensation Plan (which amount will be set forth on the Incentive
Compensation Accrual Schedule (defined below)) in addition to any
compensation that such CSI Employee is eligible to receive under the Purchaser
Incentive Plans.

 



-45- (d) _Profit Sharing Bonus_. Prior to or at the Closing, the Shareholder
or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company or its Subsidiaries) shall
pay the Profit Sharing Bonus Accrual to the CSI Employees. Not later than
March 1, 2015, any CSI Employee still employed by the Company or an Affiliate
of the Purchaser as of December 31, 2014 shall receive from the Company or
one of its Affiliates a payment calculated by annualizing the amount set forth
on the Profit Sharing Bonus Accrual Schedule (defined below) across from such
CSI Employees name and pro rating such amount for the period beginning on
the Closing Date to and ending on December 31, 2014.

(e) _401(k) Plan_. During the period commencing at the Closing and ending on
December 31, 2014 (or if earlier, the date of the employees termination of
employment with the Company), the Purchaser shall and shall cause the Company
or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to (i) continue to match each CSI
Employee salary deferral contribution at a rate of fifty cents for every
dollar contributed up to six percent (6%) of such CSI Employees compensation
and (ii) at or near the end of the calendar year make an additional fifty
cent contribution for every dollar contributed by such CSI Employee for salary
deferral, up to six percent (6%) of such Company Continuing Employees
compensation; _provided_ , that, with respect to payments required under this
subsection (ii), neither the Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary shall be
required to make aggregate contributions under this _Section 6.6(e)_ in
excess of the 401(k) Plan Accrual. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event
shall the Purchaser, the Company or its Subsidiaries be obligated to make the
matching contribution contemplated by this _Section 6.6(e)_ if, in the
judgment of the Purchaser, it would have any adverse affect on any 401(k)
plan of the Purchaser or one of its Affiliates and the ability to comply with
the Code or ERISA. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the
Purchaser cannot make the contribution under subclause (ii) above, the
Purchaser shall determine an alternative method to provide substantially the
same benefit of the remaining amount of the 401(k) Plan Accrual to such CSI
Employees.

 

(f) _Accrual Amounts_. Not less than two (2) Business Days before the Closing
Date, the Shareholder shall deliver (i) a statement that sets forth the
amount of the Profit Sharing Bonus Accrual to be paid to each CSI Employee
pursuant to _Section 6.6(d)_ (the " _Profit Sharing Bonus Accrual Schedule_
"), (ii) a statement that sets forth the CSI Incentive Compensation Plan
Accrual as of the Closing Date and the allocation to each CSI Employee (the "
_Incentive Compensation Accrual Schedule_ ") and (iii) a statement that sets
forth the 401(k) Plan Accrual as of the Closing Date and the allocation to
each CSI Employee (the " _401(k) Accrual Schedule_ " and, together with the
Profit Sharing Bonus Accrual Schedule and the Inventive Compensation Accrual
Schedule, the " _Accrual Schedules_ ").

(g) As soon as practicable (but in no event more than sixty (60) days)
following the Closing, the Shareholder shall cause to be transferred from the
trustee of the 401(k) Plan to the trustee of the 401(k) plan of the Purchaser
or one of its Affiliates as identified by the Purchaser (the "Purchaser 401(k)
Plan") an amount equal to the aggregate account balances under the 401(k)
Plan (determined as of the transfer date) of the Company Continuing Employee
then employed by either the Company or an Affiliate of the Purchaser. Such
transfer shall be made in cash (except for any outstanding loan notes,

 



-46-  which shall be transferred in-kind) and conducted in accordance with
Sections 401(a)(12) and 414(l) of the Code, Treasury Regulation Section
1.414(l)-1 and Section 208 of ERISA. The Shareholder and the Purchaser shall
cooperate in making all appropriate arrangements and filings, if any, in
connection with such transfer. Further, until the date of the Shareholder no
longer provides payroll services under the Transition Services Agreement, the
Shareholder shall take reasonable steps to collect loan repayments from each
Company Continuing Employee who has an outstanding and undefaulted loan under
the 401(k) Plan and remit such loan repayments to such plan. The Shareholder
covenants and agrees that, with respect to the Purchaser 401(k) Plan, and the
Purchaser covenants and agrees that, with respect to the Purchaser 401(k)
Plan, that, as of the date of the transfer described in this paragraph, the
401(k) Plan or the Purchaser 401(k) Plan, as applicable, will satisfy the
requirements of Sections 401(a), (k), and (m) of the Code to the extent
applicable to such plan.

 

(h) This _Section 6.6_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of the Parties, and nothing in this  _Section 6.6_, express or implied,
shall confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 6.6_. Nothing contained herein,
express or implied, shall be construed to establish, amend or modify any
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that the terms set forth in this _Section 6.6_ shall not create any
right in any Employee or any other Person to any continued employment with
the Company, a Subsidiary, the Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates
or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever.

 

Section 6.7. _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) Before the Closing Date, the Shareholder shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates, the Company and the Subsidiaries to, make all required
contributions and pay all premiums required under each Company Benefit Plan,
including any employer matching and profit sharing contributions, which are
due on or before the Closing Date.

 

(b) Before the Closing Date, the Shareholder shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates, the Company and the Subsidiaries to, take all action required (i)
to make any amendments to any Company Benefit Plan required to comply with Law
for periods on or before the Closing Date, and (ii) to file or furnish all
documentation related to the Company Benefit Plans that are required to be
filed with or furnished to any participant or Governmental Entity to comply
with Laws for periods on or before the Closing Date, and (iii) terminate the
Companys and the Subsidiaries participation in any Company Benefit Plan
described in Section 401(k) of the Code. Before the Closing Date, the
Shareholder shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, the Company and the
Subsidiaries to, provide the Purchaser all documentation reasonably requested
by the Purchaser related to all Company Benefit Plans.

(c) Following the Closing Date, an Employee Benefit Plan of the Shareholder
or an Affiliate of the Shareholder shall be responsible for providing
continuation coverage required under Section 4980B of the Code and Part 6 of
Title I of ERISA to those individuals who are "MandA qualified beneficiaries"
as described in Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9, QandA-4 with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



-47- (d) The Purchaser acknowledges that the Shareholder has informed the
Purchaser that, except as otherwise specifically provided in _Section
6.7(c)_ above or set forth in the Transition Services Agreement, following the
Closing Date, the employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries, and their
spouses, dependents and beneficiaries, shall cease to be covered by, or to be
eligible for any benefits under, any Employee Benefit Plans sponsored by the
Shareholder or any Affiliate of the Shareholder, including any such Employee
Benefit Plans that, before the Closing Date, were Company Benefit Plans, and
that following the Closing Date, the employees of the Company and the
Subsidiaries, and their spouses, dependents and beneficiaries, shall be
covered by, and eligible for benefits under (if they are covered by, or
eligible for benefits under any Employee Benefit Plans) Employee Benefit Plans
of the Purchaser and Affiliates of the Purchaser, or by Employee Benefit Plans
of the Company or a Subsidiary first effective after the Closing Date.

 

Section 6.8. _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _§ 338(h)(10) Election_. The Parties shall join in making an election
under Code §338(h)(10) (and any corresponding elections under state, local,
or non-U.S. tax law) (collectively, a  _§ 338(h)(10) Election_) with
respect to the purchase and sale of the stock of the Company and its
Subsidiaries hereunder.

 

(i) The Purchaser shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of all
Section 338 Forms in accordance with applicable Tax Laws and the terms of
this Agreement. The Shareholder agrees to provide the Purchaser with such
information as the Purchaser reasonably requests in order to prepare the
Section 338 Forms within thirty (30) days after the Purchasers request for
such information.

(ii) The Purchaser shall determine the amount of the "aggregate deemed sales
price" (as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.338-4, but excluding
selling costs) and prepare, and provide to the Shareholder within ninety (90)
days after the Closing Date, an allocation of such amount among the assets of
the Company (the " _Allocation_ ") in a manner consistent with Section 338 of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. The Allocation shall be
binding upon the Purchaser, the Company and the Shareholder unless
the Shareholder shall, within thirty (30) days of delivery of the Allocation
to the Shareholder, provide to the Purchaser written notice of its objection
to the Allocation and the reasons therefor, in which event the Parties shall
endeavor in good faith to agree upon an Allocation. If the Parties cannot
resolve such objection, the item in question shall be resolved by the
Arbitrator. The fees and expenses of the Arbitrator shall be borne equally by
the Parties. The Parties shall, except as otherwise required by Law, (i) file
all Tax Returns that are affected by a §338(h)(10) Election in a manner
consistent with the Allocation, as finally agreed upon by the Parties, and
(ii) not take any position before any Governmental Entity that is
inconsistent with such Allocation.

 



-48- (iii) " _Section 338 Forms_ " means all returns, documents, statements, and
other forms that are required to be submitted to any federal, state, county or
other local Tax Authority in connection with a §338(h)(10) Election. Section
338 Forms shall include any "statement of Section 338 election" (together
with any schedules or attachments thereto) that are required pursuant to
Treasury Regulations Section 1.338-2 or any successor provisions.

 

(b) _Tax Returns for Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date_. The
Shareholder shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns of the Company and its respective Subsidiaries for all
periods ending on or before the Closing Date which are filed after the Closing
Date. The Purchaser shall be reimbursed by the Shareholder for Taxes of the
Company and its respective Subsidiaries with respect to all Tax periods ending
on or before the Closing Date within fifteen (15) days after payment by the
Purchaser or the Company or any Subsidiary of such Taxes. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Shareholder shall include the income of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (including the effects of the §338(h)(10) Election, any deferred
items triggered into income by Reg. §1.1502-13, and any excess loss account
taken into income under Reg. §1.1502-19) on the Shareholders consolidated
U.S. federal income Tax Returns for all periods through the end of the Closing
Date and pay any U.S. federal income Taxes attributable to such income. The
Company and its Subsidiaries shall furnish Tax information to the Shareholder
for inclusion in the Shareholders U.S. federal consolidated income Tax Return
for the period that includes the Closing Date in accordance with the Companys
past custom and practice. The income of the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall be apportioned to the period up to and including the Closing Date and
the period after the Closing Date by closing the books of Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the end of the Closing Date. The Shareholder shall provide
the Purchaser with copies of any Tax Returns to be filed by the Shareholder
pursuant to this _Section 6.8(b)._ at least ten (10) days before the due date
thereof (giving effect to any extensions thereto), _provided_ that for any
unitary Tax Returns only that portion related to the Company shall be provided
to the Purchaser. The Purchaser shall have the right but not the obligation to
review and comment on such Tax Returns before the filing of such Tax Returns.

(c) _Tax Returns for Straddle Periods_. The Purchaser shall prepare or
cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed any Tax Returns of the
Company and each Subsidiary for Tax periods which begin before the Closing
Date and end after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "). The Purchaser
shall be reimbursed by the Shareholder for an amount equal to the portion of
such Taxes which relates to the portion of such Tax period ending on and
including the Closing Date within fifteen (15) days after filing the
applicable Tax Return and providing proof of payment by the Purchaser or the
Company or any Subsidiary of such Taxes. For purposes of this Agreement, in
the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for
a Tax period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, the
portion of such Tax that relates to the portion of such Tax period ending on
the Closing Date shall (y) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based
upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax
for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of days in the Tax period ending on and including the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Tax period,
and (z) in the case of any Tax based upon or

 



-49-  related to income or receipts, be deemed equal to the amount which is
payable if the relevant Tax period ended on the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that any franchise Tax or other Tax providing the right to do
business shall be allocated to the period during which the income, operations,
assets or capital comprising the base of such Tax is measured, regardless of
whether the right to do business for another period is obtained by the
payment of such Tax. All determinations necessary to give effect to the
foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior practice
of the Company. The Purchaser shall provide the Shareholder with copies of any
Tax Returns to be filed by the Purchaser pursuant to this _Section 6.8(c)_
at least ten (10) days before the due date thereof (giving effect to any
extensions thereto). The Shareholder shall have the right but not the
obligation to review and comment on such Tax Returns before the filing of
such Tax Returns.

(d) _Tax Benefits_. Any Tax Benefit realized by the Purchaser or the Company
and its Subsidiaries with respect to any Post-Closing Tax Period ending prior
to January 1, 2015 that relates to the Taxes of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be for the account of the
Shareholder, and the Purchaser shall pay over to the Shareholder any such Tax
Benefit within fifteen (15) days after receipt thereof. Any Tax Benefit
realized with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period that is attributable to
any carryback of any tax attribute arising in any Post-Closing Tax Period
shall be for the Purchasers account, _provided_ that for purposes of
determining the extent to which any Tax Benefit is attributable to a carryback
from a Post-Closing Tax Period, all tax items arising in all Pre-Closing Tax
Periods shall be taken into account before any tax attributes carried back
from any Post-Closing Tax Period. The Shareholder shall pay over to the
Purchaser any such Tax Benefit within fifteen (15) days after receipt
thereof. Any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, any Transaction Tax Deductions shall be treated, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, as attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, and any Tax Benefit attributable to such Transaction Tax Deductions,
regardless of the Tax period in which such Tax Benefit is realized, shall be
for the Shareholders account according to this _Section 6.8(d)_. Except as
otherwise required by applicable Law, the Purchaser shall prepare and file
all applicable Tax Returns in a manner that maximizes the Tax Benefits
available to the Shareholder as a result of the Transaction Tax Deductions.
The calculation of the Tax Benefit relating to any taxable period shall take
into account any corresponding increase in Taxes due for any taxable period.
For example, the Tax Benefit attributable to any reduction in state Taxes will
be calculated net of any corresponding increase in federal income Tax. Any
Tax Benefit for any Straddle Period shall be prorated between the Shareholder
and the Purchaser in accordance with the principles of _Section 6.8(c)_.

 

(e) _Post-Closing Elections_. At the Shareholders request, the Purchaser
shall cause any of the Company and its Subsidiaries to make or join with the
Shareholder in making any tax elections after Closing if the making of such
election does not have a material adverse impact on the Purchaser (or any of
the Company and its Subsidiaries) for any Tax period ending after the Closing
Date.

 



-50- (f) _Post-Closing Transactions Not in Ordinary Course_. The Parties agree
to report all transactions not in the Ordinary Course, other than those
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, occurring on the Closing Date
after the Purchasers purchase of the Shares on the Purchasers U.S. federal
income Tax Return to the extent permitted by Reg. §1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B).

(g) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. The Company, each Subsidiary, the
Shareholder and the Purchaser shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns pursuant to this _Section 6.8_ and any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon the other Partys request) the provision of records and information
which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other
proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. The Shareholder agrees (i) to retain all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and any Subsidiary relating
to any Pre-Closing Tax Period until the expiration of the statute of
limitations (and, to the extent notified by the Purchaser, any extensions
thereof) of the respective Tax periods, and to abide by all record retention
agreements entered into with any Governmental Entity (if any), and (ii) if the
Purchaser so requests within sixty (60) days before the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations, the Shareholder shall allow the Purchaser
to take possession of such books and records before the Shareholder
transferring or discarding any such books and records. The Purchaser and the
Shareholder agree, upon request, to use their commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental Entity or
any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax
that may be imposed (including with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby).

 

(h) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Any tax sharing agreement with respect to or
involving the Company or any Subsidiary shall be terminated as of the Closing
Date and shall have no further effect for any taxable year (whether the
current year, a future year, or a past year).

 

(i) _Certain Taxes_. The Purchaser shall bear all transfer, documentary,
sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement ("
_Transfer Taxes_ "); _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, any Taxes
referenced in _Section 6.8(b)_ or  _Section 6.8(c)_ shall not be Transfer
Taxes and shall not subject to this _Section 6.8(i)_. Such Taxes shall be
paid by the Purchaser on behalf of the parties when due, and the Purchaser
will file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to
all such transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other
Taxes and fees, and, if required by applicable Law, the Shareholder will, and
will cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns
and other documentation.

Section 6.9. _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) For a period from the Closing Date until the third anniversary of the
Closing Date, the Shareholder shall not, and shall cause each of its
Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, own any interest in, manage,
operate, control or participate in the ownership, management, operation or
control of any business, whether in corporate, proprietorship or 

 



-51-  partnership form or otherwise, engaged in the manufacture, sale, rental,
distribution or marketing of any Competing Products in the Territory or the
provision of a Competing Service in the Territory (each, a " _Restricted
Business_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the restrictions contained in this
_Section 6.9(a)_ shall not restrict (i) the acquisition by the Shareholder
and its Affiliates, directly or indirectly, of less than five percent (5%) in
the aggregate of any class or series of the outstanding capital stock or other
equity or economic interest of any publicly-traded entity engaged in a
Restricted Business or (ii) the acquisition and operation by the Shareholder
and its Affiliates of businesses engaged in a Restricted Business so long as
(x) the revenues from such Restricted Business constitute less than twenty
percent (20%) of the total revenues of any business acquired by the
Shareholder and its Affiliates (measured for the four calendar quarters before
the execution of the purchase agreement) and (y) the Shareholder and its
Affiliates divest such Restricted Business within twelve (12) months of the
closing of the acquisition. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and for the
avoidance of doubt, the Parties hereby agree that to the extent Shareholder or
its Affiliates, as applicable, engages in the activities set forth on 
_Schedule 6.9(a)_ , it shall not be deemed a violation of this _Section
6.9(a)_.

(b) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, the Shareholder shall
not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates and each of their respective
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, cause, solicit, induce or
encourage any Employees to discontinue such Employees current employment
with the Company or its Subsidiaries, or transfer, hire, employ or otherwise
engage any such individual outside the Company or its Subsidiaries.

 

(c) From the Closing until the third anniversary of the Closing Date, the
Shareholder shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates and each of
their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, solicit or
encourage any Employees to discontinue employment by the Company or its
Subsidiaries or hire, employ or otherwise engage any such individual,
it being understood that this _Section 6.9(c)_ shall not restrict the
Shareholder or its Affiliates from hiring individuals who (i) respond to
notices of general solicitation of employment placed by the Shareholder or its
Affiliates or (ii) on his or her own initiative without any solicitation by
the Shareholder or its Affiliates, contact the Shareholder or its Affiliates,
_provided_ _,_ _however_ , that individuals to be hired pursuant to (ii) shall
have not been employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries for at least
ninety (90) days, or shall have been terminated by the Company or its
Subsidiaries without cause prior to contacting the Shareholder or its
Affiliates.

 

(d) From the Closing until the third anniversary of the Closing Date, the
Purchaser shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates (including the
Company and its Subsidiaries) and each of their respective Representatives not
to, directly or indirectly, solicit or encourage any employee of Shareholder
or a Subsidiary of Shareholder to discontinue employment by the Shareholder
or its Subsidiaries or hire, employ or otherwise engage any such individual,
it being understood that this _Section 6.9(d)_ shall not restrict the
Purchaser or its Affiliates from hiring individuals who (i) respond
to notices of general solicitation of employment placed by the Purchaser or
its Affiliates or (ii) on his or her own initiative without any solicitation
by the Shareholder or its Affiliates, contact the Purchaser or its
Affiliates,  _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that individuals to be hired pursuant
to (ii)

 



-52-  shall have not been employees of the Shareholder or its Subsidiaries for at
least ninety (90) days, or shall have been terminated by the Shareholder or
its Subsidiaries without cause prior to contacting the Purchaser or its
Affiliates.

(e) From and after the date hereof, the Shareholder shall not, and
shall cause each of its Affiliates and each of their respective
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, disclose, reveal, divulge or
communicate to any Person, other than the Purchaser and its Representatives,
or use or otherwise exploit for their own benefit or for the benefit of
anyone other than the Purchaser and its Representatives, any Confidential
Information. The Shareholder, its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives shall not have any obligation to keep confidential any
Confidential Information if and to the extent disclosure thereof is, in the
reasonable opinion of the Shareholders counsel, required by Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, prior to any disclosure required by applicable Law,
the Shareholder shall have, to the extent permitted by Law, provided the
Purchaser with prompt written notice of such requirement before making any
disclosure so that the Purchaser may waive compliance with the provisions of
this  _Section 6.9(e)_ or seek an appropriate protective order, and the
Shareholder and the Company shall reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser in
connection with obtaining such protective order.

 

(f) The covenants and undertakings contained in this _Section 6.9_ relate to
matters which are of a special, unique and extraordinary character, and a
violation of any of the terms of this _Section 6.9_ will cause irreparable
injury to the Purchaser or Shareholder, as applicable, the amount of which
will be impossible to estimate or determine and which cannot be adequately
compensated. Accordingly, the remedy at law for any breach of this _Section
6.9_ will be inadequate. Therefore, the Purchaser or Shareholder, as
applicable, will be entitled to an injunction, restraining order or
other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction in the event
of any breach of this _Section 6.9_ without the necessity of proving actual
damages or posting any bond whatsoever. The rights and remedies provided by
this  _Section 6.9_ are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and
remedies which the Purchaser or Shareholder, as applicable, may have hereunder
or at law or in equity.

 

(g) If any court of competent jurisdiction in a final, nonappealable judgment
determines that a specified time period, a specified geographical area, a
specified business limitation or any other relevant feature of this _Section
6.9_ is unreasonable, arbitrary or against public policy, then a lesser time
period, geographical area, business limitation or other relevant feature
which is determined by such court to be reasonable, not arbitrary and not
against public policy, may be enforced against the Shareholder and its
Affiliates or the Purchaser and its Affiliates, as applicable.

 

Section 6.10. _Director and Officer Indemnification_. The Purchaser agrees
that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation
by the Company or any Subsidiary now existing in favor of each Person who is
now, or was at any time before the date hereof or who becomes before the
Closing Date, an officer or director of the Company or any Subsidiary,
as provided in the certificate of incorporation, bylaws, company agreement or
other governing document of the Company or such Subsidiary, in each case as in
effect on the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Closing Date and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms
to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 



-53- Section 6.11. _Confidentiality_. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that
the Confidentiality Agreement remains in full force and effect and, in
addition, covenants and agrees to keep confidential, in accordance with the
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, information provided to the
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement. If this Agreement is, for any reason,
terminated before the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement and the
provisions of this _Section 6.11_ shall nonetheless continue in full force
and effect. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary or the
Confidentiality Agreement, nothing in this Agreement or the Confidentiality
Agreement shall prevent Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from disclosing any
information, including Financing Deliverables and Financing Documents, (a) to
any Financing Source in connection with any Financing, (b) in an offering
circular, prospectus, bank book or private placement memorandum in connection
with any Financing, (c) for the purposes of establishing a "due diligence"
defense in connection with any Financing, (d) with the Shareholders consent,
as applicable, or (e) in connection with Parents reporting obligations under
the Exchange Act and its obligations under the Securities Act. In addition
to, and not in limitation of, the above, in furtherance of the Shareholders
obligations under _Section 6.15_, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries may
disclose any information to any Financing Source involved in the preparation
of the Financing Deliverables to the extent reasonably necessary to perform
any diligence with respect to, or confirm the accuracy of, the Financing
Deliverables.

 

Section 6.12. _Plant Closings and Mass Layoffs_. The Purchaser shall not, and
shall cause the Company and each of the Subsidiaries not to, take any action
following the Closing that may result in WARN Act liability.

Section 6.13. _Repayment of Debt; Release of Liens_. Before the Closing, the
Shareholder shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries, to take
all actions necessary to repay or release the Company and its Subsidiaries
from any obligations with respect to any Indebtedness of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, if any, and to deliver to the Purchaser appropriate
documentation relating to such repayment, if applicable, and evidencing the
release of all Liens related thereto (the " _Release Documents_ ").

 

Section 6.14. _Financing_. The Shareholder and the Company agree to provide
such assistance (and to cause the Companys Subsidiaries and their respective
personnel and advisors to provide such assistance) with the Financing as is
reasonably requested by the Purchaser. Such assistance shall include, but not
be limited to, the following: (i) participation in, and assistance with, the
Marketing Efforts related to the Financing; (ii) participation by senior
management of the Company in, and assistance with, the preparation of rating
agency presentations and meetings with rating agencies; (iii) timely delivery
to the Purchaser and its Financing Sources of the Financing Information and
Financing Deliverables; (iv) participation by senior management of the Company
in the negotiation of, and the execution and delivery of, the
Financing Documents; (v) taking such actions as are reasonably requested by
Purchaser or its Financing Sources to facilitate the satisfaction on a timely
basis of all conditions precedent to obtaining the Financing; and (vi) using

such audit, investigation, action or proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the
Indemnifying Party from liability hereunder with respect to such claim only
if, and only to the extent that, such failure to so notify the Indemnifying
Party results in harm to the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party may,
upon written notice delivered to the Indemnified Party within twenty (20) days
thereafter assuming full responsibility for any Purchaser Losses or
Shareholder Losses (as the case may be) resulting from such audit,
investigation, action or proceeding, assume the defense of such audit,
investigation, action or proceeding, to the extent such audit, investigation,
action or proceeding involves solely monetary damages, including the
employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the
payment of the fees and disbursements of such counsel; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that an Indemnifying Party will not be entitled to assume the
defense of any audit, investigation, action or proceeding if (i) such claim
may result in criminal liability of, or equitable remedies against, the
Indemnified Party; or (ii) the Indemnified Party reasonably believes that the
interests of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party with respect to
such claim are in conflict with one another, and as a result, the Indemnifying
Party may not adequately represent the interests of the Indemnified Party in
such claim. If, however, the Indemnifying Party declines or fails to assume,
or is not permitted to assume, the defense of the audit, investigation, action
or proceeding on the terms provided above or to employ counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, in either case within such twenty (20)
day period, or if the Indemnifying Party is not entitled to assume the defense
of the 

 



-65-  audit, investigation, action or proceeding in accordance with the preceding
sentence, then such Indemnified Party may employ counsel to represent or
defend it in any such audit, investigation, action or proceeding and the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such
counsel for the Indemnified Party as incurred; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Indemnifying Party shall not be required to pay the fees and
disbursements of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any
jurisdiction in any single audit, investigation, action or proceeding. If the
Indemnifying Party fails to diligently prosecute the defense of any audit,
investigation, action or proceeding, the Indemnified Party may pay,
compromise, and defend such audit, investigation, action or proceeding and
seek indemnification for any and all claims, liabilities, losses, damages,
costs, expenses, penalties, fines, judgments and fees based upon, arising
from or relating to such audit, investigation, action or proceeding. In any
audit, investigation, action or proceeding for which indemnification is being
sought hereunder the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party, whichever
is not assuming the defense of such action, may participate in such matter and
to retain its own counsel at such Partys own expense. The Indemnifying Party
or the Indemnified Party (as the case may be) shall at all times
use reasonable efforts to keep the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified
Party (as the case may be) reasonably apprised of the status of the defense of
any matter the defense of which it is maintaining and to cooperate in good
faith with each other with respect to the defense of any such matter.

(b) No Indemnified Party may settle or compromise any audit,
investigation, action or proceeding or consent to the entry of any judgment
with respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, unless (i) the Indemnifying
Party fails to assume, or is not permitted to assume, and maintain the
defense of such claim pursuant to _Section 10.3(a)_ or (ii) such settlement,
compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of the Indemnifying
Party and its officers, directors, managers, employees and Affiliates from
all liability arising out of such claim. An Indemnifying Party may not,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle or
compromise any claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to
which indemnification is being sought hereunder unless such settlement,
compromise or consent (x) includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified
Party and its officers, directors, managers, employees and Affiliates from
all liability arising out of such claim, (y) does not contain any admission
or statement suggesting any wrongdoing or liability on behalf of the
Indemnified Party and (z) does not contain any equitable order, judgment or
term that in any manner affects, restrains or interferes with the business of
the Indemnified Party or any of the Indemnified Partys Affiliates.

 

(c) If an Indemnified Party claims a right to payment pursuant to this
Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall send written notice of such claim to
the Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall specify the basis for such claim. If
the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within thirty
(30) days following its receipt of such notice that the Indemnifying Party
disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party under this _Article X_ or the
amount thereof, the claim specified by the Indemnified Party in such notice
shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party under this
_Article X_ , and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount

 



-66-  of such liability to the Indemnified Party on demand or, in the case of any
notice in which the amount of the claim (or any portion of the claim) is
estimated, on such later date when the amount of such claim (or such portion
of such claim) becomes finally determined. If the Indemnifying Party has
timely disputed its liability with respect to such claim as provided above, as
promptly as possible, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall
establish the merits and amount of such claim (by mutual agreement,
litigation, arbitration or otherwise) and, within five (5) Business Days
following the final determination of the merits and amount of such claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party in immediately
available funds in an amount equal to such claim as determined hereunder.

 

Section 10.4. _Claims Period_. The Claims Period hereunder for shall begin on
the date hereof and terminate eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date;
_provided_ that the Claims Period for any claim for indemnification asserted
relating to a breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty set forth
in _Section 4.1_,  _Section 4.2_, _Section 4.3_, _Section 4.4_, _Section
4.14_, _Section 4.25_, _Section 5.1_, _Section 5.2, Section 5.8_ or in
_Section 10.1(c)_,  _Section 10.1(d)_ or _Section 10.1(f)_ shall begin on
the date hereof and terminate ninety (90) days after the expiration of the
applicable statutory periods of limitation (including any waivers or
extensions thereof); and,  _provided_ , _further_ , that the covenants and
agreements that by their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in
part after the Closing Date shall survive for the period provided in such
covenants and agreements, if any, or until fully performed. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if, before the close of business on the last day of the
applicable Claims Period, the Indemnifying Party is properly notified of a
claim for indemnity hereunder and such claim is not finally resolved or
disposed of at such date, such claim shall continue to survive and shall
remain a basis for indemnity hereunder until such claim is finally resolved or
disposed of in accordance with the terms hereof.

 

Section 10.5. _Liability Limits_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth herein, no Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be indemnified by the
Shareholder under this _Article X_ for any Purchaser Losses (i) with respect
to any claim unless such claim involves Purchaser Losses in excess of $75,000
(the " _Single Claim Amount_ ") and (ii) unless and until the aggregate
amount of such Purchaser Losses exceeds three-fourths of one percent (0.75%)
of the Purchase Price (the " _Deductible_ "), but only if such Purchaser
Losses also meet the requirements of clause (i) of this  _Section 10.5(a)_,
after which the Shareholder shall only be obligated for such aggregate
Purchaser Losses in excess of the Deductible.

 

(a) The total aggregate amount of the liability of the Shareholder for
Purchaser Losses shall be limited to ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price
(the " _Cap_ ").

(b) Neither the Single Claim Amount nor the Deductible shall apply to any
Purchaser Losses (i) pursuant to _Section 10.1(b)_, _Section 10.1(c)_,
_Section 10.1(d)_, _Section 10.1(e)_ or _Section 10.1(f)_, or (ii) in
respect of any fraud claim or any claim related to a breach of _Section
4.1_, _Section 4.2_, _Section 4.3_, _Section 4.4_, _Section 4.14_ or
_Section 4.25_. The Cap shall not apply to any Purchaser Losses (i) pursuant
to _Section 10.1(b)_, _Section 10.1(c)_, or _Section 10.1(d)_ or (ii) in
respect of any fraud claim or any claim related to a breach of _Section 4.1_,
_Section 4.2_,  _Section 4.3_, _Section 4.4_, _Section 4.14_ or _Section
4.25_.

 



-67- (c) Payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to _Section 10.1_ or 
_Section 10.2_ in respect of any Purchaser Loss or Shareholder Loss shall be
limited to the amount of any liability or damage that remains after deducting
therefrom any insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other
similar payment received by the Indemnified Party (or the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries) in respect of any such claim. The Indemnified Party shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to recover under insurance policies or
indemnity, contribution or other similar agreements for any Losses before
seeking indemnification under this Agreement.

(d) In no event shall any Indemnifying Party be liable to any Indemnified
Party for any punitive, incidental, exemplary, consequential, special or
indirect damages, including loss of future revenue or income, loss of business
reputation or opportunity relating to the breach or alleged breach of this
Agreement, or diminution of value or any damages based on any type of multiple
(except to the extent such types of damages constitute losses to a third party
as a result of any claim).

 

Section 10.6. _Exclusive Remedy_. The Parties agree that, excluding (a) any
claim for injunctive or other equitable relief or (b) any claim related to
fraud by the Shareholder, the Company or the Purchaser in connection with the
transactions related to this Agreement, the indemnification provisions of this
_Article X_ are intended to provide the sole and exclusive remedy as to all
claims either the Shareholder, on the one hand, or the Purchaser, on the other
hand, may incur arising under, from, out of or relating to this Agreement or
to the purchase and sale of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Neither Party
nor any other Person will have any other entitlement, remedy or recourse,
whether in contract or tort, by law or equity. All such other entitlements,
remedies and recourse are expressly waived and released by the Parties, to
the fullest extent permitted by law. Except as otherwise set out in the first
sentence in this _Section 10.6_, the Parties agree that neither Party shall
have any remedies or cause of action (whether in contract or in tort) for any
statements, communications, disclosures, failures to disclose,
representations or warranties not set forth in this Agreement.

Shareholder on or before the Closing Date, any Legal Dispute shall be
resolved in accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Section 11.5_

Section 11.6.  _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF TRIAL BY

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in
accordance with the internal Laws of the State of Texas without reference to

such Legal Dispute shall be brought only to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
courts of the State of Texas or the federal courts located in the State of
Texas. In that context, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) consents to the

subject thereto, (b) such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is
not maintainable in such court, (c) such Partys property is exempt or immune
from execution, (d) such action, suit or proceeding is brought in an
inconvenient forum or (e) the venue of such action, suit or proceeding is
improper. A final judgment in any action, suit or proceeding described in this

OTHER TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR
THEREBY. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY

right, remedy, obligation or liability under or by reason of this Agreement,
or result in such Person being deemed a third-party beneficiary hereof.

 



-71- Section 11.11. _Waiver_. Any agreement on the part of either Party to any
extension or waiver of any provision hereof shall be valid only if set forth
in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. A waiver by either
Party of the performance of any covenant, agreement, obligation, condition,
representation or warranty shall not be construed as a waiver of any other
covenant, agreement, obligation, condition, representation or warranty. A
waiver by either Party of the performance of any act shall not constitute a
waiver of the performance of any other act or an identical act required to be

Inventory Valuation Methodology

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. For raw materials,
cost is determined using average cost. Generally, purchase costs for raw
materials are recorded in BAAN once a 3-way match process is complete. The
match process compares the invoice, receipt report and purchase order for raw
materials received into inventory.

For work-in-process ("WIP"), cost is determined using the
specific identification method. Raw materials, are recorded (at unit level)
when costs are incurred during the build process. Costs are applied using a
standard costing system. Standard costs are reviewed and/or adjusted annually.
For purposes of inventory valuation at Transaction Close, the standard costs
in affect for fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 will not be adjusted for
purposes of inventory valuation. Standard costing variances are reviewed at
period end and directly applied to units if identified.

Indirect costs are recorded individually as described below:



     |  |  | Freight/Hardware  Charges are recorded at period close
and determined using standard rates based on unit size. These rates are then
pro-rated based on stage of manufacturing milestone using the
"Production Tracking (CSI NEW)" report. 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | Overhead  Charges are calculated and applied
systematically by BAAN based on service/production order. The standard
overhead rates are reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, on an annual basis.
For purposes of inventory valuation at Transaction Close, the overhead rates
in affect for fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 will not be adjusted for
purposes of inventory valuation. 
---|---|---|--- 
 

At period close, the reserve for obsolete inventory is calculated based on the
BAAN report "Print Usage by Business Unit/Department/Warehouse (CSI) NEW".
This report shows the age of inventory and the most recent usage date. The
reserve is calculated based on 50% of items between 13-24 months old and no
usage in the last 13-24 months and 100% for all items greater than 24 months
old.

ii TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT

 

This TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") dated as of [ ],
2014, by and among Compressco Partners Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
" _Purchaser_ "), Compressor Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "
_Company_ "), and Warren Equipment Company, a Delaware corporation (the "
_Seller_ ").

 

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the Purchaser and the Seller have entered into that certain Stock
Purchase Agreement, dated as of July 20, 2014 (the " _Purchase Agreement_ "),
pursuant to which the Seller has agreed to sell to the Purchaser, and the
Purchaser has agreed to purchase from the Seller, all of the Shares of the
Company, all as more fully described therein;

WHEREAS, the Companys business (the " _Transferred Business_ ") is currently
supported utilizing certain assets and services of the Seller and its
Affiliates;

 

WHEREAS, in order to ensure an orderly transition of the Company and the
Transferred Business, the parties are agreeing to enter into this Agreement,
pursuant to which, from and after the Closing the Seller will provide, or
cause its Affiliates to provide, the Company with certain Services (as defined
herein), in each case on a transitional basis subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein; and

WHEREAS, capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have
the meaning ascribed to such terms in the Purchase Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the above premises, the mutual
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Seller, the Purchaser and the Company agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

SERVICES 

Section 1.1. Provision of Services.

 

(a) The Seller agrees to provide, or to cause its Affiliates to provide, the
services (the " _Services_ ") set forth on the exhibit(s) attached hereto (as
such exhibit(s) may be amended or supplemented pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, collectively, the " _Service Exhibits_ ") to the Company for the
respective periods and on the other terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement and in the respective Service Exhibits.

(b) The parties hereto acknowledge the transitional nature of the Services.
Accordingly, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the execution of
this Agreement, the Purchaser and the Company agree to use commercially
reasonable efforts to make a transition of each Service to its own
internal organization or to obtain alternate third-party sources to provide
the Services. (c) Subject to _Section 2.03_, _Section 2.04_ and _Section 3.05_ of this
Agreement, the obligations of the Seller under this Agreement to provide
Services shall, unless otherwise specified in the applicable Service Exhibit,
terminate with respect to each Service on [], 20[],1 which is the date four
(4) months from the Closing Date (the " _End Date_ "); _provided_ that the
Purchaser and the Company may extend the End Date for any or all Services on
a month-to-month basis for up to an additional two (2) months from the
original End Date by providing notice to the Seller. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the parties acknowledge and agree that the Company may determine
from time to time that it does not require all the Services set out on one or
more of the Service Exhibits or that it does not require such Services for the
entire period up to the applicable End Date. Accordingly, the Company may
terminate any Service, in whole or in part, upon notification to the Seller
in writing of any such determination.

Section 1.2. Additional Services. Until the termination of this Agreement as
provided in _Section 3.01_, if the Purchaser or the Company identifies a
service that the Seller or its Affiliates provided to the Transferred Business
prior to the Closing Date that the Company or the Purchaser needs in order
for the Transferred Business to continue to operate in substantially the same
manner in which it operated before the Closing Date, and such service was not
included on any Service Exhibit, then the Purchaser and the Seller shall
negotiate in good faith the terms under which the Seller will provide such
requested service (each such service, an " _Additional Service_ "). If the
parties reach an agreement with respect to providing any Additional Service,
the parties shall amend the appropriate Service Exhibit in writing to include
such Additional Service (including the incremental fees and End Date with
respect to such Additional Service) and such Additional Service shall be
deemed a "Service" hereunder and, accordingly, the provision of such
Additional Service shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement that related to Services.

 

Section 1.3. Standard of Service.

 

(a) The Seller shall provide the Services in good faith, in accordance with
applicable Law and (i) in substantially the same manner (including quality,
standard of care and service level and volume) as such Services were provided
to the Company with respect to the Transferred Business preceding the date
hereof and (ii) exercising the same or similar degree of care and diligence
as it exercises in performing the same or similar services for itself and its
Affiliates, and, in any event, not exercising less than a commercially
reasonable degree of care. Subject to _Section 1.04_ of this Agreement,
the Seller agrees to assign sufficient resources and qualified personnel as
are reasonably required to perform the Services in accordance with the
standards set forth in the preceding sentence.

 

(b) Except as set forth in this Agreement (including any such Service Exhibit)
or in any contract entered into hereunder, the Seller makes
no representations or warranties of any kind, implied or expressed, with
respect to the Services, including, without limitation, no warranties of

 



   1  | To insert date that is four months from the Closing Date. 
---|--- 
 



2  merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, which are specifically
disclaimed. Each of the Purchaser and the Seller acknowledges and agrees that
this Agreement does not, and any course of dealing contemplated by the
Services hereunder will not, create a fiduciary relationship, partnership,
joint venture or relationship of trust or agency between the parties and that
all Services are provided by the Seller or its Affiliate as an independent
contractor.

(c) To the extent that the Seller is permitted to arrange for contracts with
third parties for goods and services in connection with the provision of the
Services, the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts (i) to obtain
such goods and services at rates competitive with those otherwise generally
available in the area in which services or materials are to be furnished, and
(ii) to obtain from such third parties such customary warranties and
guarantees as may be reasonably required with respect to the goods and
services so furnished.

 

Section 1.4. Third-Party Service Providers. It is understood and agreed that
the Seller has been retaining, and will continue to retain, third-party
service providers to provide some of the Services to the Company. In addition,
the Seller may hire other third-party subcontractors to provide part of any
Service hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such subcontracting is
inconsistent with past practices, the Seller shall obtain the prior written
consent of the Company to hire such subcontractor, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld; and, _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall
this provision result in the renegotiation or material increase of the Fee of
any Service.

Section 1.5. Access to Premises.

(a) In order to enable the provision of the Services by the Seller, the
Purchaser and the Company each agree to provide to the Sellers and its
Affiliates employees and any third-party service providers or subcontractors
who provide Services, at no cost to the Seller, access to the facilities,
assets and books and records of the Company, in all cases to the extent
necessary for the Seller to fulfil its obligations under this Agreement.

(b) The Seller agrees that all of its and its Affiliates employees and any
third-party service providers and subcontractors, when on the property of the
Company or when given access to any equipment, computer, software, network or
files owned or controlled by the Company, shall conform to the policies and
procedures of the Company concerning health, safety and security which are
made known to the Seller in advance in writing.

 

ARTICLE II

COMPENSATION 

Section 2.1. Responsibility for Wages and Fees. For such time as any employees
of the Seller or any of its Affiliates are providing the Services to the
Company under this Agreement, (a) such employees will remain employees of the
Seller or such Affiliate, as applicable, and shall not be deemed to be
employees of the Company for any purpose, and shall remain subject to the
sole control, direction and supervision of the Seller or Affiliate, as
applicable, and (b) the Seller or such Affiliate, as applicable, shall be
solely responsible for the payment and provision of all wages, bonuses
and commissions, employee benefits, including severance and workers
compensation, and the withholding and payment of applicable Taxes relating to
such employment.

 



3 Section 2.2. Terms of Payment and Related Matters.

 

(a) As consideration for the provision of the Services, the Purchaser shall
pay the Seller the amount specified for each Service on such Services
respective Service Exhibit (the " _Fees_ ").

(b) As more fully provided in the Service Exhibits and subject to the terms
and conditions therein:

(i) The Seller shall provide the Purchaser, in accordance with _Section
7.01_, with monthly invoices (" _Invoices_ "), which shall set forth in
reasonable detail, with such supporting documentation as the Purchaser may
reasonably request; and

 

(ii) Payments pursuant to this Agreement shall be made within thirty (30) days
after the date of receipt of an Invoice by the Purchaser from the Seller.

Section 2.3. Extension of Services. The parties agree that the Seller shall
not be obligated to perform any of the Services after the applicable End
Date; _provided, however_ , that if the Purchaser and the Company desire and
the Seller agrees to continue to perform any of the Services after the
applicable End Date, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to determine
an amount that compensates the Seller for all of its costs for such
performance, including the time of its employees. The Services so performed by
the Seller after the applicable End Date shall continue to constitute
Services under this Agreement and be subject in all respects to the
provisions of this Agreement for the duration of the agreed-upon extension
period.

 

Section 2.4. Terminated Services. Upon termination or expiration of any or all
Services pursuant to this Agreement, or upon the termination of this
Agreement in its entirety, the Seller and its Affiliates shall have no further
obligation to provide the applicable Services.

 

Section 2.5. Invoice Disputes. In the event of an Invoice dispute, the
Purchaser shall deliver a written statement to the Seller no later than ten
(10) days before the date payment is due on the disputed Invoice listing all
disputed items and providing a reasonably detailed description of each
disputed item. Amounts not so disputed shall be deemed accepted and shall
be paid, notwithstanding disputes on other items, within the time set forth
in _Section 2.02(b)_. The parties shall seek to resolve all such disputes
expeditiously and in good faith. The Seller shall continue performing the
Services in accordance with this Agreement pending resolution of any dispute.

Section 2.6. No Right of Setoff. Each of the parties hereby acknowledges that
it shall have no right under this Agreement to offset any amounts owed (or to
become due and owing) to the other party, whether under this Agreement, the
Purchase Agreement or otherwise, against any other amount owed (or to
become due and owing) to it by the other party.

 



4 Section 2.7. Taxes. The consideration payable to the Seller pursuant to
this Agreement shall exclude any and all taxes imposed on the Fees or
provision of the Services hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Purchaser shall be responsible for all sales or use Taxes imposed or assessed
as a result of the provision of Services by the Seller. The Seller shall
properly and timely seek to collect from the Purchaser any such sales or use
Taxes and shall timely remit any such Taxes collected from the Purchaser to
the applicable taxing authority, in each case in accordance with applicable
Law. If the Purchaser submits to the Shareholder a timely and valid resale or
other exemption certificate reasonably acceptable to the Shareholder and
sufficient to support the exemption from tax, then such tax will not be added
to the fee for Services hereunder; provided, however, that if the Shareholder
is ever required to pay such tax, the Purchaser will promptly reimburse the
Purchaser for such tax, including any interest, penalties and attorneys fees
related thereto. The Shareholder agrees, at the sole expense of the Purchaser,
to provide the Purchaser with such information and data as reasonably
requested from time to time, and to reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser,
in connection with (a) the reporting of any sales or use Taxes, (b) any audit
relating to such Taxes or (c) any assessment, refund, claim or proceeding
relating to any such Taxes.

 

ARTICLE III

TERMINATION 

Section 3.1. Termination of Agreement. Subject to _Section 3.04_ of this
Agreement, this Agreement shall terminate in its entirety (a) on the date
upon which the Seller or its Affiliates shall have no continuing obligation to
perform any Services as a result of each of their expiration or termination in
accordance with _Section 1.01(c)_ or _Section 3.02_ of this Agreement or
(b) in accordance with _Section 3.03_ of this Agreement.

 

Section 3.2. Breach. Any party (the " _Non-Breaching Party_ ") may terminate
this Agreement, with respect to any Service, at any time upon prior written
notice to the other party (the " _Breaching Party_ ") if the Breaching Party
has failed (other than pursuant to _Section 3.05_ of this Agreement) to
perform any of its material obligations under this Agreement relating to such
Service, and such failure shall have continued without cure for a period of
fifteen (15) days after receipt by the Breaching Party of a written notice of
such failure from the Non-Breaching party seeking to terminate such service.
For the avoidance of doubt, non-payment by the Purchaser for a Service
provided by the Seller in accordance with this Agreement and not the subject
of a good faith dispute shall be deemed a breach for purposes of this
_Section 3.02_.

Section 3.3. Insolvency. If any party hereto shall (a) file a petition
in bankruptcy, (b) become or be declared insolvent, or become the subject of
any proceedings (not dismissed within sixty (60) days) related to its
liquidation, insolvency or the appointment of a receiver, (c) make an
assignment on behalf of all or substantially all of its creditors or (d) take
any corporate action for its winding up or dissolution, then the other parties
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by providing written notice
in accordance with  _Section 7.01_ of this Agreement.

 



5 Section 3.4. Effect of Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement in
its entirety pursuant to _Section 3.01_ of this Agreement, all obligations
of the parties hereto shall terminate, except for the provisions of _Section
2.01_, _Section 2.04_, _Section 2.06_,  _Section 2.07_, _Article V_ ,
_Article VI_ and _Article VII_ of this Agreement, which shall survive any
termination or expiration of this Agreement.

 

Section 3.5. Force Majeure. The obligations of the Seller under this Agreement
with respect to any Service shall be suspended or modified during the period
and to the extent that the Seller is prevented or hindered, respectively, from
providing such Service, or the Company is prevented or hindered from receiving
such Service, due to any of the following causes beyond such partys
reasonable control (such causes, " _Force Majeure Events_ "): (a) acts of God,
(b) flood, fire or explosion, (c) war, invasion, riot or other civil unrest,
(d) applicable Law, (e) actions, embargoes or blockades in effect on or after
the date of this Agreement, (f) action by any Governmental Entity, (g)
national or regional emergency, (h) strikes, labor stoppages or slowdowns or
other industrial disturbances, (i) shortage of adequate power or
transportation facilities, or (j) any other event which is beyond the
reasonable control of such party. The party suffering a Force Majeure Event
shall give notice of suspension as soon as reasonably practicable to the
other party stating the date and extent of such suspension and the cause
thereof, and the Seller shall resume the performance of its obligations as
soon as reasonably practicable after the removal of the cause. Neither the
Purchaser, the Company nor the Seller shall be liable for the nonperformance
or delay in performance of its respective obligations under this Agreement
when such failure is due to a Force Majeure Event. The applicable End Date for
any Service so suspended shall be automatically extended for a period of time
equal to the time lost by reason of the suspension. Upon the occurrence of a
Force Majeure Event, if requested by the Purchaser, the parties shall
cooperate to find alternative means and methods for the Purchaser to receive
the affected Services, at the sole cost of the Purchaser.

ARTICLE IV

Agreement may be downloaded/copied and used by the Company and its Affiliates
in connection with the Transferred Business until the applicable End Date.

 

(c) The Purchaser may create materials based on the HSE Materials for

such materials in the operation of the Transferred Business. It is understood
and agreed that the Seller makes no representation or warranty, express or
implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the HSE Materials or as to the
suitability of the HSE Materials for use by the Company in respect of the
Transferred Business or otherwise.

 



6 (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the text of any materials related to or
based upon the HSE Materials created by the Company or its Affiliates on
behalf of the Transferred Business may not contain any references to the
Seller or any of its Affiliates (or any use of their trademarks, trade names,
trade dress, logos, or other identifiers), the Sellers or any of its
Affiliates publications, the Sellers or any of its Affiliates personnel.

 

Section 4.2. Limitations on Rights and Obligations with Respect to the HSE
Materials. The Seller shall have no obligation: (a) to notify the Purchaser
or the Company of any changes or proposed changes to any of the HSE Materials;
or (b) to provide the Purchaser or the Company with any updated materials
relating to any of the HSE Materials. The Purchaser and the Company
acknowledge and agree that, except as express set forth above, the Seller
reserves all rights in, to and under the HSE Materials and no rights with
respect to ownership or use, except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
shall vest in the Purchaser or the Company.

ARTICLE V

 

CONFIDENTIALITY

 

Section 5.1. Confidentiality.

 

(a) During the term of this Agreement and thereafter, the parties hereto
shall, and shall instruct their respective Representatives to, maintain in
confidence and not disclose the other partys financial, technical, sales,
marketing, development, personnel, and other information, records, or data,
including, without limitation, customer lists, supplier lists, trade
secrets, designs, product formulations, product specifications or any other
proprietary or confidential information, however recorded or preserved,
whether written or oral (any such information, " _Confidential Information_
"). Each party shall use the same degree of care, but no less than reasonable
care, to protect the other partys Confidential Information as it uses to
protect its own Confidential Information of like nature. Unless otherwise
authorized in any other agreement between the parties, any party receiving
any Confidential Information of the other party (the " _Receiving Party_ ")
may use Confidential Information only for the purposes of fulfilling its
obligations under this Agreement (the " _Permitted Purpose_ "). Any Receiving
Party may disclose such Confidential Information only to its Representatives
who have a need to know such information for the Permitted Purpose and who
have been advised of the terms of this  _Section 5.01_, and the Receiving
Party shall be liable for any breach of these confidentiality provisions by
such Persons; _provided_ , that any Receiving Party may disclose such
Confidential Information to the extent such Confidential Information is
required to be disclosed by applicable Law, in which case the Receiving Party
shall promptly notify, to the extent possible, the disclosing party (the "
_Disclosing Party_ "), so that the Disclosing Party may seek an appropriate
protective order; _provided_ , _further_ , that to the extent any disclosure
is permitted under the Purchase Agreement, such disclosure is also permitted
hereunder. If the Disclosing Party cannot obtain a protective order for all
or part of the Confidential Information required to be disclosed by applicable
Law, the Receiving Party shall only disclose such Confidential Information
that its counsel reasonably believes it is legally bound to disclose under
such applicable Law.

 



7 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, "Confidential Information" shall not
include any information that: (i) was publicly known at the time of
disclosure to the Receiving Party, or has become publicly known through no act
of the Receiving Party or its Representatives in breach of this _Section
5.01_; (ii) was rightfully received by the Receiving Party from a third party
without a duty of confidentiality; or (iii) was developed by the Receiving
Party independently without any reliance on any Confidential Information.

 

 __(c) Upon demand by the Disclosing Party at any time, or upon expiration or
termination of this Agreement with respect to any Service, the Receiving
Party agrees promptly to return or destroy, at the Disclosing Party s option,
all of the Disclosing Partys Confidential Information in the Receiving
Partys possession or control. If such Confidential Information is destroyed,
an authorized officer of the Receiving Party shall certify to such destruction
in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party shall not be
required to destroy copies of the Confidential Information which may
be electronically archived in connection with its automatic backup storage or
document retention policies; _provided_ , _however_ , that all such material
shall remain subject to the confidentiality obligations of this Agreement. __

all Liabilities, incurred by, imposed upon or rendered against one or more of
the Seller Indemnified Parties, whether based on contract, or tort, or

ANOTHER PARTY.

WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS OR SUITABILITY FOR
ANY PURPOSE (WHETHER THE SELLER KNOWS, HAS REASON TO KNOW, HAS BEEN ADVISED,
OR IS OTHERWISE IN FACT AWARE OF ANY SUCH PURPOSE) WHETHER ALLEGED TO ARISE BY
LAW, BY REASON OF CUSTOM OR USAGE IN THE TRADE OR BY COURSE OF DEALING.

TRANSFERRED BUSINESS, IF THE THIRD-PARTY PROVIDER OF SUCH SERVICES MAKES AN
EXPRESS WARRANTY TO THE SELLER, THE PURCHASER, THE COMPANY OR AFFILIATE
THEREOF, THE PURCHASER AND THE COMPANY ARE ENTITLED TO CAUSE THE SELLER TO
RELY ON AND TO ENFORCE SUCH WARRANTY.

Section 7.2. Headings. The titles and headings of articles and sections herein
are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be a
part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The
Service Exhibits referred to herein shall be construed with and as an integral
part of this Agreement to the same extent as if they were set forth verbatim
herein.

 



11 Section 7.3. Severability. If any one or more of the provisions contained in
this Agreement shall be declared illegal, invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect, and such invalid, void or unenforceable provision shall be interpreted
as closely as possible to the manner in which it was written. Furthermore, in
lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there shall be added
automatically as a part hereof a provision as similar in terms to such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible and be legal,
valid and enforceable, and the parties hereby agree to such provision.

Section 7.4. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including all Service
Exhibits) and the Purchase Agreement constitute the sole and entire agreement
of the parties to this Agreement with respect to the subject matter contained
herein and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings and
agreements, both written and oral, with respect to such subject matter. If and
to the extent that there is a conflict between (a) the provisions of this
Agreement and the provisions of the Purchase Agreement as it relates to the
Services hereunder, the provisions of this Agreement shall control (b) this
Agreement (excluding all Service Exhibits) and the Service Exhibits, the
provisions of this Agreement shall control.

 

Section 7.5. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Neither party may assign its rights or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Company may, without the prior
written consent of the Seller, assign all or any portion of its right to
receive Services to any of its Affiliates that participate in the operation of
the Transferred Business; _provided_ , that such Affiliate shall receive such
Services from the Seller in the same place and manner as described in the
respective Service Exhibit as the Company would have received such Service. No
assignment shall relieve the assigning party of any of its obligations
hereunder.

 

Section 7.6. No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Nothing expressed or implied in
this Agreement is intended, or shall be construed, to confer upon or give any
Person, other than the parties hereto and their respective Affiliates,
successors and permitted assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of
this Agreement.

 

Section 7.7. Amendment and Modification; Waiver. Any representation, warranty,
covenant, term or condition of this Agreement which may be waived or the time
of performance thereof extended may be so waived or extended at any time by
the party hereto entitled to the benefit thereof, and any term, condition or
covenant hereto, may be amended by the parties hereto at any time. Any such
waiver, extension or amendment shall be evidenced by an instrument in writing
executed on behalf of the appropriate party by a Person who has been
authorized by such party to execute waivers, extensions or amendments on its
behalf. No waiver by any party hereto, whether express or implied, of its
rights under any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of such
partys rights under such provisions at any other time or a waiver of such
partys rights under any other provision of this Agreement. No failure by any
party hereto to take any action against any breach of this Agreement or
default by another party shall constitute a waiver of the former partys right
to enforce any provision of this Agreement or to take action against such
breach or default or any subsequent breach or default by such other party.

 



12 Section 7.8. Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HERETO SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND
CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SUBSTANTIVE LAWS OF THE STATE OF
TEXAS WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY CONFLICTS OF LAW PROVISIONS THEREOF THAT WOULD
RESULT IN THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION. THE PARTIES
AGREE THAT JURISDICTION AND VENUE IN ANY ACTION BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY PURSUANT
TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL PROPERLY (BUT NOT EXCLUSIVELY) LIE IN ANY FEDERAL OR
STATE COURT LOCATED IN MIDLAND COUNTY, TEXAS. BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF
THIS AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH
COURTS FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY WITH RESPECT TO SUCH ACTION.
THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AGREE THAT VENUE WOULD BE PROPER IN SUCH COURT, AND
HEREBY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION THAT SUCH COURT IS AN IMPROPER OR INCONVENIENT
FORUM FOR THE RESOLUTION OF SUCH ACTION.

 

Section 7.9. Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party irrevocably and unconditionally
waives any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any legal
action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each party to this Agreement certifies and acknowledges
that (a) no representative of any other party has represented, expressly or
otherwise, that such other party would not seek to enforce the foregoing
waiver in the event of a legal action, (b) such party has considered the
implications of this waiver, (c) such party makes this waiver voluntarily,
and (d) such party has been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among
other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this _Section 7.09_.

 

Section 7.10. Specific Performance. Each party hereby acknowledges that the
rights of each party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are
special, unique and of extraordinary character and that, if any party violates
or fails or refuses to perform any covenant or agreement made by it herein,
the other parties may be without an adequate remedy at law. If a
party violates or fails or refuses to perform any covenant or agreement made
by it herein, the other parties may, subject to the terms hereof and in
addition to any remedy at law for damages or other relief, institute and
prosecute an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce
specific performance of such covenant or agreement or seek any other equitable
relief.

 

Section 7.11. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which
taken together shall constitute a single agreement.

 



13 Section 7.12. Further Assurances. In connection with this Agreement and
all transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each party agrees to execute
and deliver such additional documents and instruments and to perform such
additional acts as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate, carry out
and perform all of the terms, provisions and conditions of this Agreement and
all such transactions.
