the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent and Merger Sub hereby agree that, in the event that a
dispute arises under this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby after the Closing between Parent and its Subsidiaries on the one
hand, and the Shareholders&#146; Representative and/or any Common Equity Holder on the other hand,
Proskauer may represent the Shareholders&#146; Representative and any or all Common Equity Holders in
such dispute even though the interests of the Common Equity Holders may be directly adverse to
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries, and even though Proskauer may
have represented the Company or its Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to such dispute,
or may be handling ongoing matters for the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries. Parent and
Merger Sub further agree that, as to all communications among Proskauer, the Company, its
Subsidiaries, the Shareholders&#146; Representative and/or any Common Equity Holder that relate in any
way to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, the
attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to the Shareholders&#146;
Representative and the Common Equity Holders and may be controlled by the Shareholders&#146;

the other hand, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries may assert the
attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of such confidential communications to such third
party; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that neither Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries may waive such privilege without the prior written consent of the Shareholders&#146;

hereto acknowledge that any attorney-client privilege attaching as a result of legal counsel
representing the Company prior to the Closing shall survive the Closing and continue to be a
