 (d) Until surrendered in accordance with _Section 3.1(c)_, each such Certificate (other than Certificates representing shares of Company Capital Stock to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and Dissenting Shares) shall represent solely the right to receive the Merger Consideration relating thereto. If the Merger Consideration (or any portion thereof) is to be delivered to any Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate formerly representing shares of Company Capital Stock surrendered therefor is registered, it shall be a condition to such right to receive such Merger Consideration that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person surrendering such shares of Company Capital Stock shall pay to the Exchange Agent any Transfer Taxes or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that any such Transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

   ##### 

  

   

value of such shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with the Appraisal
Rights Provisions; _provided_ , _however_ , that all shares of Company
Capital Stock held by Shareholders that shall have failed to perfect or that
effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such
shares of Company Capital Stock under the Appraisal Rights Provisions shall
thereupon be deemed to have been cancelled and retired and to have been
converted, as of the Effective Time, into the right to receive the applicable
portion of the Merger Consideration, without interest, in the manner provided
in  _Section 2.1_ and _3.1_. Any Person that has perfected statutory rights
with respect to Dissenting Shares shall not be paid by the Surviving
Corporation as provided in this Agreement and shall have only such rights as
are provided by the Appraisal Rights Provisions with respect to such
Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Parent and Merger Sub prompt notice

with respect to shares of Company Capital Stock, withdrawals of such demands,
and any other instruments served pursuant to the NYBCL and received by
the Company, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all

Each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby covenants and agrees to use its best efforts to secure termination of any waiting periods under the HSR Act or any other applicable law and to obtain the approval of the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other Governmental Authority, as applicable, for the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly entering into a consent decree or other arrangement with the FTC, DOJ or other Governmental Authority as may be necessary to secure termination of such waiting periods or obtain such approval as may be necessary to secure such termination. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 8.5. _Press Releases_. The Company and Parent will, and will cause each of their Affiliates and representatives to, maintain the confidentiality of this Agreement and will not, and will cause each of their Affiliates not to, issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of Parent or the Company, as applicable, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that each of the Company and Parent may, without the prior consent of the other parties hereto, issue or cause publication of any such press release or public announcement to the extent that such party reasonably determines, after consultation with outside legal counsel, such action to be required by law, by the rules of any applicable self-regulatory organization or by the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, in which event such party will use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow Parent or the Company, as applicable, reasonable time to comment on such press release or public announcement in advance of its issuance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the Closing, the parties hereto shall release a mutually agreed upon joint press release. 

  

 Section 8.6. _Officers  and Directors Indemnification_. 

   

 (a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification or exculpation existing in favor of, and all limitations on the personal liability of, each present and former director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries as contained in the Certificate of Incorporation and the By-Laws as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any claims asserted or made within such six-year period shall continue until the disposition of such claim. From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation also agree to indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time to the extent provided in the Certificate of Incorporation and the By-Laws as in effect on the date hereof as well as in any Indemnification Agreements. In the event that any acts or omissions that require indemnification under any Indemnification Agreement constitute a breach of any of the Companys representations and warranties contained in _Article IV_, Parent shall still be entitled to any rights to indemnification that it may have under _Article X_. 

   

 (b) At the Effective Time, Parent shall purchase or cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase directors and officers liability insurance coverage for the Companys and its Subsidiaries directors and officers currently covered by the Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance policy that shall provide such directors and officers with coverage for six years following the Effective Time of not less than the existing coverage on the date hereof and have other terms not materially less favorable to, the insured Persons than the directors and officers liability insurance coverage presently maintained by the Company to the extent such liability insurance can be maintained at a cost to Parent not greater than the cost of 150% of the cost of the most recent annualized premium for the current directors and officers 

   ##### 

  

    

liability insurance on the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such
insurance cannot be maintained or obtained at such cost, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to maintain or obtain the maximum amount of
insurance coverage that can be maintained or obtained (not to exceed six
years following the Effective Time) at a cost equal to 150% of the cost of
the most recent annualized premium for such insurance. 

   

 (c) The obligations under this _Section 8.6_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Person that is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or that becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") to whom this _Section 8.6_ applies without the consent of such Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section 8.6_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 8.6_ and shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained herein). 

   

 (d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 8.6_. 

  

 Section 8.7. _Employees_. 

   

 (a) For a period of one year from and after the Closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to any employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who remains in the active employment of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") (who is not party to an employment agreement) and who is terminated during such one-year period without cause (a " _Terminated Employee_ "), severance benefits in amounts and on terms and conditions no less favorable than the severance benefits that would have been provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Terminated Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time under the severance policies of the Company and its Subsidiaries described on _Schedule 8.7(a)_ (the " _Severance Policies_ "). For a period of one year from and after the Closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay any Continuing Employee who terminates his employment during such one-year period as a result of a reduction in salary (an " _Involuntarily Terminating Employee_ ") severance benefits in accordance with the Severance Policies as if such Involuntarily Terminating Employee had been terminated without cause. In addition to any amounts payable to any Terminated Employee or Involuntarily Terminating Employee in accordance with the first two sentences of this  _Section 8.7(a)_, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay each Terminated Employee and Involuntarily Terminating Employee the pro rata portion (based on the number of days such Terminated Employee or Involuntarily Terminating Employee, as applicable, was employed during the fiscal year ending April 30, 2011) of any bonus that would have been payable with respect to the fiscal year ending April 30, 2011, if such Terminated Employee or Involuntarily 

   ##### 

  

    

Terminating Employee, as applicable, had been employed by the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries at the time such bonus became payable,
any such bonus to be determined as if the Surviving Corporation and the
Subsidiaries of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time were
operated on a stand-alone basis. 

   

 (b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain the current bonus policies, including with respect to accrual of bonuses, of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including the bonus plan described on _Schedule 8.7(b)_, for the benefit of the Continuing Employees from and after the Closing through April 30, 2011 and thereafter until all bonus payments relating to the fiscal year ending April 30, 2011 have been paid to such Continuing Employees. Any bonus payable to a Continuing Employee pursuant to the bonus plan described on _Schedule 8.7(b)_ shall be determined as if the Surviving Corporation and Subsidiaries of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time were operated on a stand-alone basis. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that nothing in the immediately preceding sentence shall obligate the Surviving Corporation to make any bonus payments that would be accrued or earned under such bonus policies after April 30, 2011. 

   

 (c) Each Continuing Employee shall be given credit for service with the Company or its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors under any employee benefit plans or arrangements of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries for all purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not with respect to benefit accruals) solely to the extent past service was recognized for such Continuing Employees under the comparable Company Plans immediately prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 8.7(c)_ shall be construed to require crediting of service for purposes of the calculation of benefits or that would result in (i) duplication of benefits or (ii) service credit for any purposes under a defined benefit pension plan or any post-employment health or post-employment welfare plan. 

   

 (d) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries (including, following the Effective Date, the Surviving Corporation) to (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees to the extent such conditions and exclusions and waiting periods were satisfied or did not apply to such employees under the welfare plans maintained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the extent applicable under any such plan, to the extent credited under the welfare plans maintained by the Company prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (e) From and after the Closing through December 31, 2011, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain a management incentive compensation plan, medical insurance and an employee benefit plan intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code available to eligible Continuing Employees. 

   ##### 

  

    

Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 8.7_ to the contrary,
nothing contained herein, whether express or implied, shall be treated as an
amendment or other modification of any employee benefit plan maintained by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or
on or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries, or shall limit the right of Parent to amend, terminate or
otherwise modify any Company Plan or any employee benefit plan maintained by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time.
Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company
shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to continue any specific employee benefit plans or to
continue the employment of any specific Person. 

  

 Section 8.8. _Tax Matters_. 

   

 (a) _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns_. Parent shall prepare and file, or shall cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are due after the Closing Date and shall have sole discretion to determine the positions taken on all such Tax Returns; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not take any position on any Tax Return that adversely affects the amount of any Identified Tax Refund unless required to do so to comply with applicable law. 

   

 (b) _Closing Date Course of Business_. For the portion of the Closing Date after the Effective Time, other than transactions expressly contemplated in this Agreement, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to carry on its business only in the ordinary course in the same manner as heretofore conducted. Parent shall not make, and shall cause not to be made, any election under Section 338 of the Code (or any comparable provision of state, local or foreign law) with respect to the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (c) _Tax Refunds_. The Common Equity Holders shall be entitled to the anticipated Tax refunds reflected on _Schedule 8.8(c)(i)_ (the " _Identified Tax Refunds_ "), whether paid or credited against other Taxes, and whether pursuant to an original filed Tax Return, an amended Tax Return, a claim for refund, IRS From 4466 or otherwise. At the Common Equity Holders expense, Parent shall pursue, or cause to be pursued, diligently and in good faith, the Identified Tax Refunds which the Common Equity Holders are entitled to receive hereunder. Parent shall consult with the Shareholders Representative regarding prosecution of the Identified Tax Refunds and shall keep the Shareholders Representative reasonably informed regarding such prosecution. Promptly upon receipt of any Identified Tax Refund or the actual utilization by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates of the credit of any Identified Tax Refund against other Taxes, and in no event later than ten Business Days after receipt by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates or the credit against other Taxes, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, deliver and pay over, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, such Identified Tax Refunds to the Shareholders Representative (on behalf of the Common Equity Holders for payment to each Common Equity Holder of its Pro Rata Portion of such amounts) to the bank account designated on _Schedule 8.1(c)(ii)_. The Shareholders 

   ##### 

  

    

Representative shall have the right to remit a portion of such Identified Tax
Refunds to the Surviving Corporation in each case where a Common Equity
Holder is subject to withholding of Taxes on such payment, and in each such
case the Surviving Corporation (or Parent) shall cause withholding and
remittance of required Taxes to be made with respect to such amounts and the
net payments to be promptly paid to the applicable Common Equity Holders.
Without limiting the general provisions of _Section 8.8(a)_, at the
Common Equity Holders expense, Parent will, and will cause the Surviving
Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, execute such
documents, take reasonable additional actions and otherwise reasonably
cooperate as may be necessary for Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their
respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to perfect their rights in and to
obtain the Identified Tax Refunds contemplated by this _Section 8.8_. 

   

 (d) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Shareholders Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by any of such parties, with respect to Taxes, including, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to the filing of any IRS Form 4466 (or any similar state Tax form) that is required to claim any Identified Tax Refund and the filing of any amended Tax Return or other refund claim for a period prior to (or including) the Closing Date that affects the amount of any Identified Tax Refund. 

   

 (e) _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, value added, excise, stock transfer, stamp, recording, registration and any similar Taxes (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") that become payable in connection with the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne by the Common Equity Holders and paid when due. 

  

 Section 8.9. _Books and Records; Insurance_. Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of the Companys Subsidiaries to, in accordance with the current document retention practices of Parent, retain all books, records and other documents pertaining to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries in existence on the Closing Date and to make the same available for inspection and copying by the Shareholders or any of the representatives of such Shareholders at the expense of such Shareholders during the normal business hours of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or such Subsidiary, as applicable, upon reasonable request and upon reasonable notice. 

  

 Section 8.10. _Company Dividend_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may declare dividends to the Common Equity Holders equal to the aggregate amount of the Companys and each of its Subsidiaries Cash and Cash Equivalents; any such dividends shall be paid to the Common Equity Holders immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 8.11. _Additional Merger Consideration_. If (i) the Closing does not occur on or prior to December 31, 2010 and (ii) the conditions set forth in _Sections 9.1_ and _9.2 _ (other than _Section 9.2(l)_) have been satisfied as of December 31, 2010, except for those conditions that by their terms would be satisfied on the Closing Date, the Merger Consideration shall be increased by an amount equal to $5,000,000. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 8.12. _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation_. 

   

 (a) _Non-Competition_. During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the third year anniversary thereof (the " _Non-Compete Period_ "), Mr. Richard D. Katzman, Mr. John Katzman, Ms. Julie Katzman and Mr. Lawrence Katzman (each, a " _Subject Shareholder_ ") shall not, directly or indirectly, engage (whether as an owner, manager, employee, officer, director or consultant), in any business that competes with the business or products of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as conducted as of immediately prior to the Closing Date or as contemplated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 8.12(a)_ shall preclude a Subject Shareholders ownership of less than 5% of the outstanding stock or other securities of any publicly-traded company. 

   

 (b) _Non-Solicitation_. During the Non-Compete Period, without the prior written consent of Parent, each Subject Shareholder shall not, directly or indirectly: 

   

 (i) contact or solicit for the purpose of offering employment to or hiring any Continuing Employees; _provided_ , _however_ , that a general advertisement or solicitation that is not directed specifically to Continuing Employees shall not violate this _Section 8.12_; 

   

 (ii) induce or attempt to induce any customer or other Person that has a business relationship with the Surviving Corporation as of the Closing Date into any business relationship that would materially harm the Surviving Corporation; or 

   

 (iii) disparage the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (c) _Enforcement_. Each Subject Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that the restrictions imposed by this _Section 8.12_ are reasonable with respect to subject matter, time period and geographic area. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any provision of _Section 8.12(a)_ is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of  _Section 8.12(a)_ shall not be affected or impaired in any way and the parties agree that the court making such determination will have the power to limit the provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision with a provision that is valid, legal and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision, and this Agreement will be enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to replace such invalid, illegal and unenforceable provision with a valid, legal and enforceable provision that achieves, to the greatest lawful extent under this Agreement, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 8.13. _Financing_. Parent shall, at Parents expense, use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable to secure the financing required by _Section 9.2(l)_, including those things reasonably necessary to fully satisfy, on a timely basis, each of the conditions precedent set forth in the Commitment Letter. Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the Shareholders Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), waive any of Parents rights under or amend, or agree to waive any of Parents rights under or amend, the Commitment Letter if such waiver or amendment is reasonably likely to impair, delay or prevent Parents ability to consummate the Closing as contemplated by this Agreement. If any portion of the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter becomes unavailable (including upon the expiration of the Commitment Letter) or Parent becomes aware of any event or circumstance that would make any portion of the funds unavailable pursuant to the Commitment Letter so that Parent would be unable to consummate the Closing as contemplated by this Agreement, then Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain alternative financing (" _Alternative Financing_ ") to secure the financing required by  _Section 9.2(l)_ on terms and conditions no less favorable in any material respect to Parent and its Subsidiaries than those contained in the Commitment Letter as promptly as reasonably practicable. Parent shall keep the Shareholders Representative informed on a current basis with respect to all material activity concerning the status of the financings contemplated by the Commitment Letter, or if necessary, the Alternative Financing, and shall give the Shareholders Representative prompt (and in any event, within 48 hours) notice of any material change with respect to such financing. The Company shall provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide, all reasonable cooperation (including with respect to timeliness) in connection with the arrangement of the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter or any Alternative Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent (provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries). 

  

 Section 8.14. _Further Action_. Each of the parties hereto shall use its respective commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all appropriate action, do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable and execute and deliver such documents and other papers, as may be required to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 Section 8.15. _Financial Statements_. 

   

 (a) The Company shall commence preparation of, promptly following the execution of this Agreement, and the Company will use its reasonable efforts to provide to Parent within 60 days after the Closing Date, financial statements of the Companys and its Subsidiaries business and related documents that meet the requirements of Item 9.01(a) of Securities and Exchange Commission Form 8-K (" _Form 8-K_"), as may be limited as set forth below, including the following documents: 

   

 (i) financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the periods specified in Rule 3-05(b) of Regulation S-X, which shall be prepared pursuant to Regulation S-X (the " _Form 8-K Financial Statements_"), except that supporting schedules need not be prepared; 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) a manually signed consent of Deloitte and Touche LLP meeting the requirements of Section 2-02 of Regulation S-X; and 

   

 (iii) a manually signed consent of Deloitte and Touche LLP to the inclusion of all financial statements pursuant to _Section 8.15(a)(i)_ and Deloitte and Touche LLPs report thereon referred to in _Section 8.15(a)(ii)_. 

   

Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to take any actions the Company may
reasonably request to reduce the scope and content of the Form 8-K Financial
Statements and other information required to be provided by the Parent to the
Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (b) The Company shall cooperate with, and provide all information and documents reasonably requested by, Parent regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries in order to assist Parent in the preparation of the pro forma financial information required by Item 9.01(b) of Form 8-K. 

   

 (c) Parent shall bear up to $100,000 of the costs and expenses incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection solely with the preparation, in accordance with this  _Section 8.15_, of financial statements and related documents that meet the requirements of Item 9.01(a) of Form 8-K; _provided_ , _however_ that if the assumptions regarding the scope of work required by Deloitte and Touche LLP set forth on  _Schedule 8.15_ change, Parent shall bear all such costs and expenses, including any and all costs and expenses in excess of $100,000. 

  

 Section 8.16. _Termination of Certain Related Party Transactions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company will amend or terminate each of the agreements set forth in  _Schedule 8.16_ without any liability to, or fees or payments by, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries resulting from such termination (other than payments made pursuant to the express terms of the agreements related to periods or services provided prior to the termination date of such agreements) except as expressly set forth in _Schedule 8.16_, and so that as of and after the Effective Time, none of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries will have any liability or obligations thereunder. 

  

 Section 8.17. _Termination of Benefit Plans_. Effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Company shall terminate the Kaz, Inc. 401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan (the " _401(k) Plan_ ") (unless Parent provides written notice to the Company no later than 15 Business Days prior to the Closing Date that such 401(k) Plan shall not be terminated). Unless Parent provides such written notice to the Company, no later than 15 Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such 401(k) Plan has been terminated (effective no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of Parents counsel. The Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating the 401(k) Plan as Parent may reasonably require. Parent agrees to cause a 401(k) plan of Parent or its Affiliates to accept a "direct rollover" to such 401(k) plan of the account balances (including promissory notes evidencing all 

   ##### 

  

    

outstanding loans) of all participants in the 401(k) Plan if such rollover is
elected in accordance with applicable Laws by such participants. 

  

 Section 8.18. _Conflicts and Privilege_. It is acknowledged by each of the parties hereto that the Shareholders Representative and some or all of the other Common Equity Holders have retained Proskauer Rose LLP (" _Proskauer_ ") to act as their counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent and Merger Sub hereby agree that, in the event that a dispute arises under this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby after the Closing between Parent and its Subsidiaries on the one hand, and the Shareholders Representative and/or any Common Equity Holder on the other hand, Proskauer may represent the Shareholders Representative and any or all Common Equity Holders in such dispute even though the interests of the Common Equity Holders may be directly adverse to Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries, and even though Proskauer may have represented the Company or its Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to such dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries. Parent and Merger Sub further agree that, as to all communications among Proskauer, the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Shareholders Representative and/or any Common Equity Holder that relate in any way to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to the Shareholders Representative and the Common Equity Holders and may be controlled by the Shareholders Representative and Common Equity Holders and shall not pass to or be claimed by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries on the one hand and a third party other than the Shareholders Representative or a Common Equity Holder, on the other hand, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of such confidential communications to such third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries may waive such privilege without the prior written consent of the Shareholders Representative. Other than as explicitly set forth in this _Section 8.18_, the parties hereto acknowledge that any attorney-client privilege attaching as a result of legal counsel representing the Company prior to the Closing shall survive the Closing and continue to be a privilege of the Surviving Corporation, and not the Shareholders Representative and the Common Equity Holders, after Closing. 

  

 Section 8.19. _Hudson Facility_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall have the right to sell, transfer, spin off or otherwise dispose of the Hudson Facility and to distribute the net proceeds to the Shareholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) any such sale, transfer, spinoff or other disposition shall be effected without the Company or any of its Subsidiaries incurring any costs, Taxes or other Liabilities that are not discharged prior to the Effective Time and Parent and Surviving Corporation shall be indemnified with respect thereto, (b) any documents or agreements executed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection therewith shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, (c) any such sale, transfer, spinoff or other disposition shall be on a quitclaim or equivalent basis in which no warranties are provided with respect thereto and (d) in the event such sale, transfer, spinoff or other disposition occurs prior to the Closing, the purchaser of the Hudson Facility shall have agreed to lease the property to the Company, and following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation, rent free for a period of one year, pursuant to the terms of a lease, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the 

   ##### 

  

    

Parent (the premises subject to such lease, the " _Leased Premises_ ");
_provided_ ,  _further_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall bear all costs
and expenses in connection with the operation of the Hudson Facility,
including those relating to maintenance and utilities during such one-year
period ( _i.e._ , a "triple net lease"), and such lease shall be terminable
by the Surviving Corporation upon 30 days prior written notice.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that (i) if any of the items
constituting monthly costs and expenses for maintenance, real estate taxes,
utilities and operation allocable to the Leased Premises subject to such
lease (" _Monthly Expenses_ ") are costs and expenses that are shared among
the properties comprising the Hudson Facility such that the specific costs
and expenses allocable to such leased premises cannot be definitively
determined, then the Company shall pay an amount equal to its Proportionate
Share of such expenses and (ii) such lease shall contain customary
provisions relating to (A) carve-outs for certain maintenance, real estate
tax, insurance and utility costs and expenses that should not constitute
Monthly Expenses and (B) the manner of estimating certain costs and expenses
that may not be determinable as of the date that payment of Monthly Expenses
are due. As used herein, " _Proportionate Share_ " shall mean a percentage
expressed as a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the rentable square
footage of the Lease Premises and the denominator of which shall be the
rentable square footage of all buildings comprising the Hudson Facility.

The guarantee in this _Section 8.20_ is a guarantee of payment and performance and not of collection and is a continuing guarantee and shall apply to all Guaranteed Obligations whenever arising.

 Section 10.2. _Parent and Merger Sub General Indemnification_. 

    

 (a) From and after the Closing, subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub (each a " _Parent Indemnified Party_ ") shall be held harmless and indemnified to the extent of any Loss resulting from (i) the breach of any representation or warranty of the Company contained in _Article IV_;  _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to the representations and warranties contained in _Section 4.8(a)(i)_ or _Section 4.8(a)(x)(B)_ , an indemnifiable Loss shall only be a Loss relating to a Pre-Closing Period; (B) in connection with any Tax Return (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any amended Tax Return or refund claim) of the Company and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries for, or that includes, a Pre-Closing Period filed after the Closing Date, the Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be held harmless and indemnified for any Loss resulting from the amount of Taxes for a Pre-Closing Period shown or reflected on such Tax Return (as filed by Parent or permitted by Parent to be filed) exceeding the amount of Taxes paid prior to the Closing or provided for in accordance with Section 4.8(a)(ii) with respect to such period to the extent that such Loss arises from, or is reasonably related to, (x) the shifting of income of the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries from a Post-Closing Period to a Pre-Closing Period or the shifting of a deduction or Tax credit of the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries from a Pre-Closing Period to a Post-Closing Period or (y) any other position or election taken or made with respect to 

   ##### 

  

    

the preparation of such Tax Return, provided, however, that clauses (x) and
(y) shall not apply with respect to a Tax Return if such Tax Return has been
provided to the Shareholders Representative, at least 15 Business Days prior
to its due date (including extensions), for the Shareholders
Representatives review and consent to filing and the Shareholders
Representative consents to the filing of such Tax Return, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, it being understood and agreed by the parties,
by way of example and not limitation, that it would be unreasonable for the
Shareholders Representative to withhold its consent with respect to a
position or election required by applicable law; provided, further that if
after receiving such Tax Return as set forth above the Shareholders
Representative has not responded to Parent regarding its consent or
objection to such Tax Return prior to its due date (including extensions),
the Shareholders Representative shall be deemed to have consented to the
filing of such Tax Return, (ii) the breach of any pre-Closing covenant or
agreement of the Company contained in this Agreement, (iii) any exercise by
any holder of Company Capital Stock of appraisal rights in accordance with
the NYBCL (it being understood that such Losses shall be (A) the excess, if
any, of the appraised value of the Dissenting Shares over the Merger
Consideration that would otherwise have been applicable to such shares _plus_
(B) any other reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection
therewith), (iv) the Company Expenses and (v) the Companys transfer, use or
operation of, or interest in, the real property described in Item 3 of
_Schedule 4.6_. 

   

 (b) From and after the Closing, subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Principal Shareholders shall, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Parent Indemnified Parties to the extent of any Loss resulting from the breach of any representation or warranty of the Principal Shareholders contained in _Article V_ or any breach of any covenant or agreement of the Principal Shareholders contained in this Agreement. 

   

 (c) From and after the Closing, subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, the holders of Company Capital Stock shall, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Parent Indemnified Parties to the extent of any Loss resulting from the breach of any Fundamental Representations.

 (e) The Parent Indemnified Parties indemnification rights pursuant to _Sections 10.2(a)_ , _10.2(b)_ , _10.2(c)_ and _10.2(d)_ shall be limited as follows: 

   

 (i) The Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to any indemnification until the aggregate dollar amount of all Losses that would 

   ##### 

  

    

otherwise be indemnifiable pursuant to _Sections 10.2(a)_,  _10.2(b)_ ,
_10.2(c)_ and/or _10.2(d)_ exceeds 1% of the Merger Consideration (the "
_Deductible_ ") and then only to the extent such aggregate amount exceeds
such Deductible; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Parent Indemnified Party
may make a claim for any Loss and no Loss shall be included in calculating
the aggregate amount of Losses for purposes of determining whether
the Deductible has been exhausted other than those Losses in excess of
$25,000 resulting from any single claim or aggregated claims arising out of
the same facts, events or circumstances (the " _De Minimus Claim Threshold_
"); _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the Deductible and the De Minimus Claim
Threshold shall not apply to claims made under (A) _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ with
respect to the Fundamental Representations and the Tax Representations, (B)
_Section 10.2(a)(ii)_ with respect to the Tax Covenants, (C) _Section
10.2(b)_ with respect to the representations and warranties contained in
_Article V_, (D)  _Section 10.2(c)_ with respect to the Fundamental
Representations, (E)  _Section 10.2(d)_ with respect to the Tax
Representations and the Tax Covenants, (F) _Section 10.2(a)(iii)_, (G)
_Section 10.2(a)(iv)_, (H)  _Section 10.2(a)(v)_ or (I) actual fraud. 

   

 (ii) The Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to any indemnification under this _Section 10.2_ for any Losses (individually or in the aggregate) in excess of the amount of the Indemnity Escrow Fund and the right to recover for such indemnifiable Losses shall be limited solely to funds in the Indemnity Escrow Fund; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to  _Section 10.2(e)(iii)_, (x) if any claim by the Parent Indemnified Parties is asserted with respect to any Fundamental Representations after the Closing and prior to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to seek indemnification under _Section 10.2(c)_ for such Losses, and (y) if any claim by the Parent Indemnified Parties is asserted with respect to any Tax Representations, Tax Covenants and/or Environmental Representations after the Release Date and prior to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to seek indemnification under _Section 10.2(d)_ for such Losses; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that, subject to _Section 10.2(e)(iii)_, (1) the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses based on claims relating to the Fundamental Representations brought after the Closing and prior to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration actually received by the Common Equity Holders, (2) the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses based on claims relating to the Tax Representations, the Tax Covenants and the Environmental Representations brought after the Release Date and prior to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations shall not exceed an amount equal to (A) the sum of $17,700,000 and the Excess Claims, if any, _less_ (B) any portion of the Indemnity Escrow Fund released and delivered to Parent and/or any other Parent Indemnified Parties,  _less_ (C) any portion of the Indemnity Escrow Fund that is held by the Escrow Agent in respect of one or more unresolved claims at any time after the Release Date, and (3) the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses based upon any claims for indemnification under _Section 10.2(a)(iv)_, _Section 10.2(a)(v)_, or allegations of actual fraud in connection with 

   ##### 

  

    

representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement or in any exhibit to this Agreement (including the Schedules)
shall not be limited to funds in the Indemnity Escrow Fund. 

   

 (iii) The maximum aggregate liability of any holder of Company Capital Stock for any indemnification for Losses in connection with claims made under _Sections 10.2(b)_ , _10.2(c)_ and _10.2(d)_ shall not exceed the portion of the Merger Consideration actually received by such holder of Company Capital Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, any amounts contributed by a holder of Company Capital Stock to the Indemnity Escrow Fund shall not be deemed to have been "actually received" by such holder of Company Capital Stock until the release and delivery of such amounts to such holder of Company Capital Stock. 

   

 (iv) All claims for indemnification by a Parent Indemnified Party under  _Sections 10.2(a)_, _10.2(b)_ , _10.2(c)_ and _10.2(d)_ must be made (A) with respect to all claims, other than claims made with respect to breaches of the representations and warranties of the Principal Shareholders contained in _Article V_, on or before the Representations and Warranties Termination Date or the applicable survival period set forth in _Section 10.1_ and (B) with respect to claims for breaches of the representations and warranties of the Principal Shareholders contained in _Article V_, on or before the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (each, as applicable, the " _Indemnification by Company Cut-Off Date_ "). No indemnification shall be payable to a Parent Indemnified Party with respect to claims asserted by such Parent Indemnified Party after the applicable Indemnification by Company Cut-Off Date, regardless of when the claim accrued or the circumstances that resulted in the claim being asserted after the applicable Indemnification by Company Cut-Off Date. In the event a claim has been properly made on or prior to the applicable Indemnification by Company Cut-Off Date, and such claim is unresolved as of the applicable Indemnification by Company Cut-Off Date, then the right to indemnification with respect to such claim shall remain in effect until such matter shall have been finally determined. 

   

 (f) The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification under this _Section 10.2_ shall be calculated net of (i) any insurance proceeds received by the Parent Indemnified Party on account of such Loss and (ii) any indemnification payments made by any third party less all expenses and fees incurred by Parent Indemnified Party to recover such insurance proceeds. The Parent Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery under all insurance policies covering any Loss to the same extent as they would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder. In the event that an insurance or other recovery is received by any Parent Indemnified Party with respect to any Loss for which any such Person has been indemnified hereunder in full, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery less expenses of securing such recovery shall be made promptly to the Person or Persons that provided such indemnity payments to such Parent Indemnified Party. The indemnifying party shall be subrogated to all rights of the Parent Indemnified Party in respect of any Loss borne by the indemnifying party. For purposes of this _Article X_, except for the Qualified Representations and Warranties, the representations and warranties of the 

   ##### 

  

    

Company contained in _Article IV_, the representations and warranties of
the Principal Shareholders contained in _Article V_ and the representations
and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained in _Article VI_ shall not
be deemed qualified by any references to materiality or to Company Material
Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as applicable. 

   

 (g) A Parent Indemnified Party shall give the Shareholders Representative written notice of any claim, assertion, event or proceeding as to which such Parent Indemnified Party may request indemnification hereunder as soon as is practicable after the time that such Parent Indemnified Party first learns of such claim, assertion, event or proceeding. Such notice shall state all the information then available regarding the amount and nature of such claim, assertion, event or proceeding and shall specify the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement under which the liability or obligation is asserted, and shall include copies of all correspondence received from any third party in connection with any such claim. The failure of a Parent Indemnified Party to deliver such written notice shall not impair such Parent Indemnified Partys rights hereunder except to the extent that the Shareholders Representative demonstrates that it has been prejudiced thereby. 

   

 (h) With respect to any third party claim for which indemnification is sought under  _Section 10.2_, Parent shall have the right to direct, through counsel selected by it and subject to the reasonable approval of the Shareholders Representative, the defense of any such Proceeding at the Common Equity Holders expense, such expense to be paid out of the Indemnity Escrow Fund. If Parent elects to assume the defense of any such Proceeding pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall consult with the Shareholders Representative for the purpose of allowing the Shareholders Representative to participate in such defense at the sole expense of the Shareholders Representative and shall keep the Shareholders Representative reasonably informed regarding such defense. In the event Parent assumes the defense of a third party claim, Parent shall not have the right to settle such claim without the prior written consent of the Shareholders Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and the Shareholders Representative shall have the right to participate in the settlement of such Proceeding at the sole expense of the Shareholders Representative. If Parent fails to defend or if, after commencing or undertaking any such defense, Parent fails to prosecute or withdraws from such defense, the Shareholders Representative shall have the right to undertake the defense or settlement thereof. If Parent elects to direct the defense of any such Proceeding, each Parent Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, cooperate fully with the Shareholders Representative and to provide the Shareholders Representative and its counsel with access to all records and personnel relating to any such Proceeding during normal business hours and shall otherwise cooperate with the Shareholders Representative in the defense or settlement thereof as set forth in this _Section 10.2(h)_. If the Shareholders Representative assumes the defense of any such Proceeding and proposes to settle such Proceeding, then the Shareholders Representative shall give Parent prompt written notice thereof, and Parent shall have the right to participate in the settlement of such Proceeding or assume or reassume the defense of such Proceeding at the sole expense of Parent. In the event the 

   ##### 

  

    

Shareholders Representative assumes the defense of any such Proceeding,
the Shareholders Representative shall cooperate fully with Parent and
provide Parent and its counsel with access to all records and personnel
relating to any such Proceeding during normal business hours and shall
otherwise cooperate with Parent in the defense or settlement thereof. In the
event the Shareholders Representative assumes the defense of any such
Proceeding, the Shareholders Representative shall not have the right to
settle such Proceeding without the prior written consent of Parent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Except as provided herein, in the
event Parent assumes the defense of a third party claim pursuant to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement (other than a third party claim relating to
a breach of any of the representations and warranties of the Principal
Shareholders contained in _Article V_), any and all Losses paid
in connection with such claim shall be borne solely out of the Escrow Fund,
and nothing herein shall be construed as an assumption of liability of any
such claim by the Common Equity Holders beyond the Escrow Fund or by the
Shareholders Representative. In all circumstances, the Parent Indemnified
Parties and the Shareholders Representative shall cooperate fully and in
good faith with each other with respect to any claims subject to this
_Article X_. For the avoidance of doubt, all references to "Proceedings"
in this _Section 10.2(h)_ shall include "Tax Proceedings". 

   

 (i) No Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder for any Loss arising from a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant set forth herein (and the amount of any Loss incurred in respect of such breach shall not be included in the calculation of any limitations on indemnification set forth herein) to the extent that such liability is included in the calculation of the Closing Working Capital. 

   

 (j) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein shall give rise to any right on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or a Parent Indemnified Party, after the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 (k) Any liability for indemnification under this _Section 10.2_ shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty or covenant. 

  

 Section 10.3. _Indemnification by Parent and Merger Sub_. 

    

 (a) From and after the Closing, subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Common Equity Holders and their respective officers and directors (each a " _Company Indemnified Party_ ") shall be held harmless and indemnified by Parent and Merger Sub to the extent of any Losses resulting from (i) the breach of any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub contained in  _Article VI_ and (ii) any breach of any covenant of Parent or Merger Sub contained herein. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (b) All claims for indemnification by a Company Indemnified Party under _Section 10.3(a)_ must be made on or before May 15, 2012 (the " _Indemnification by Parent Cut-Off Date_ "). No indemnification shall be payable to a Company Indemnified Party with respect to claims asserted by such Company Indemnified Party after the applicable Indemnification by Parent Cut-Off Date. In the event a claim has been properly made on or prior to the applicable Indemnification by Parent Cut-Off Date, and such claim is unresolved as of the applicable Indemnification by Parent Cut-Off Date, then the right to indemnification with respect to such claim shall remain in effect until such matter shall have been finally determined. 

   

 (c) The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification under this _Section 10.3_ shall be calculated net of any insurance proceeds received by the Company Indemnified Party on account of such Loss less all expenses and fees incurred by Company Indemnified Party to recover such insurance proceeds. The Company Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery under all insurance policies covering any Loss to the same extent as they would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder. In the event that an insurance or other recovery is made by any Company Indemnified Party with respect to any Loss for which any such Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery shall be made promptly to the Person or Persons that provided such indemnity payments to such Company Indemnified Party. The indemnifying party shall be subrogated to all rights of the Company Indemnified Party in respect of any Loss borne by the indemnifying party. 

   

 (d) A Company Indemnified Party shall give Parent written notice of any claim, assertion, event or proceeding as to which such Company Indemnified Party may request indemnification hereunder as soon as is practicable after the time that such Company Indemnified Party first learns of such claim, assertion, event or proceeding. 

   

 (e) With respect to third party claims, Parent shall have the right to direct, through counsel of its own choosing, the defense or settlement of any such claim or proceeding at its own expense. If Parent elects to assume the defense of any such claim or proceeding, Parent shall consult with the Company Indemnified Party for the purpose of allowing the Company Indemnified Party to participate in such defense, but in such case the expenses of the Company Indemnified Party shall be paid for by the Company Indemnified Party and shall not be recoverable as part of any indemnification claim.

 (c) _Indemnification of Shareholders  Representative_.

This indemnification shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. To the extent that the Shareholders Representative is entitled to direct the defense or settlement of any Proceeding pursuant to the terms and conditions of  _Section 10.2(h)_, then the reasonable attorneys fees for the defense or settlement of such Proceeding shall be paid from the Escrow Fund, but only at the expiration date of such Escrow Fund and only to the extent that all claims required to be paid out of the Escrow Fund have been paid to Parent and there are no claims pending with respect to the Escrow Fund. The Common Equity Holders agree that the Shareholders Representative may, in all questions arising under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, rely on the advice of counsel and for anything done, omitted or suffered in good faith by the Shareholders Representative in accordance with such advice of counsel, the Shareholders Representative shall not be liable to the Common Equity Holders, the Company, the Surviving Company, the Escrow Agent or any other Person. The Common Equity Holders, by approval, of this Agreement pursuant to the Company Shareholder Approval agree that in no event shall the Shareholders Representative be liable under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents for (i) any indirect, punitive, special or consequential damages, or (ii) any amounts other than those that are satisfied out of the Indemnity Escrow Fund. 

   

 (d) _Actions of the Shareholders  Representative_. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholders Representative relating to this Agreement shall constitute a decision of all the Principal Shareholders, and by approval of this Agreement pursuant to the Company Shareholder Approval, all the Common Equity Holders, and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon all such Common Equity Holders. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Escrow Agent may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholders Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each of the Common Equity Holders. In the absence of bad faith by Parent or Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Escrow Agent are hereby relieved from any liability to any Person
