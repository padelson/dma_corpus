 **ARTICLE I**

  

 **THE MERGER**

  

Section 1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time,
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the
Company shall continue as the surviving corporation following the Merger (the
"Surviving Corporation"). The corporate existence of the Company, with all
its purposes, rights, privileges, franchises, powers and objects, shall
continue unaffected and unimpaired by the Merger and, as the Surviving
Corporation, it shall be governed by the DGCL.

  

Section 1.2. _Effective Time; Closing_. As promptly as practicable (and
in any event within five business days) after the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions which by
their terms can only be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), the parties shall
cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the
"Certificate of Merger"), with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware

       

and by making all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL in
connection with the Merger, in such form as is required by, and executed in
accordance with the relevant provisions of, the DGCL; _provided_ , that if
the consents set forth in Section 1.2 of the Company Disclosure Letter have
not been obtained by such time, Parent may defer the Closing until
the earlier of the date on which such consents are obtained and July 31,
2006. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of
Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or
at such other time (but not earlier than the time that the Certificate of
Merger is filed) as the parties agree shall be specified in the Certificate
of Merger (the date and time the Merger becomes effective, the "Effective
Time"). On the date of such filing, a closing (the "Closing") shall be held
at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time, at the offices of King and Spalding LLP, 1180
Peachtree Street, Atlanta, Georgia 30309-3521, or at such other time and
location as the parties shall otherwise agree.

  

Section 1.3. _Effect of the Merger. _At the Effective Time, the effect
of the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

  

Section 1.4. _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any of the securities described in this Section 1.4:

  

(a) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares canceled pursuant to Section
1.4(b) and Dissenting Shares, if any) shall be canceled and, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall be
converted automatically into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to
$10.35 **** payable, less any required withholding taxes as described in
Section 1.8(e) and without interest, to the holder of such share of Company
Common Stock, upon surrender of any certificate that formerly evidenced such
share of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in Section 1.8 (the
"Merger Consideration");

  

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that is owned by Parent or Merger Sub and each
share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company as treasury stock
shall be canceled and retired and cease to exist and no payment or
distribution shall be made with respect thereto;

  

(c) At the Effective Time, all shares of the Company Common Stock converted
pursuant to Section 1.4(a) shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and cease to exist, and each holder of
a certificate ("Certificate") representing any such shares of Company Common
Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 1.4(a); and

  

(d) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock
of the Surviving Corporation.

  

Section 1.5. _Dissenting Shares_.

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by the Company Stockholders who have
demanded and perfected their demands for appraisal of such

       

shares of Company Common Stock in the time and manner provided in Section 262
of the DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, have neither effectively withdrawn
nor lost their rights to such appraisal and payment under the DGCL (the
"Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted as described in Section 1.4(a)
but shall, by virtue of the Merger, be entitled to only such rights as are
granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such
holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost his, her or its right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, such
holderÂ’s shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have
been converted, at the Effective Time, as described in Section 1.4(a)
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration set forth in such
provisions, without any interest thereon.

  

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL received by the Company,
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL with respect to demands for appraisal and received by the Company and
(ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent or as otherwise required by applicable
Law, make any payment with respect to any such demands for appraisal or offer
to settle or settle any such demands.

  

Section 1.6. _Stock Options and Warrants_.

  

(a) The Company shall ensure that all outstanding options to acquire Company
Common Stock (the "Company Options") granted under the Amended and Restated
2000 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Company Stock Option Plan") or the
Employment Agreement, dated as of November 29, 1999 (the "Harris Employment
Agreement"), between the Company and Donald A. Harris that are not exercised
prior to the Effective Time shall terminate and expire immediately after
Effective Time. In addition, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
pay such holder, immediately after the Effective Time, in exchange for the
cancellation of such holderÂ’s Company Options (regardless of exercise price
or whether or not such Company Options are vested and exercisable), an amount
in cash determined by multiplying (a) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the applicable exercise price per share of the Company
Option by (b) the number of shares of Company Common Stock such holder could
have purchased had such holder exercised such Company Option in full
immediately after the Effective Time (assuming such Company Option was fully
vested), less any withholding taxes as described in Section 1.8(e) and
without interest.

  

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Company Warrants will be
automatically exercisable, upon payment of the exercise price, for the Merger
Consideration to which the holder of the Company Warrant would have received
immediately after the Effective Time if the holder had exercised the Company
Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

Section 1.7. _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. The "Offering Period" (as
defined in the ESPP) that started on April 1, 2006 under the CompanyÂ’s
Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") may continue
through June 30, 2006 or, if earlier, the end of the last business day before
the Effective Time; provided, (a) no person shall be allowed to elect to
increase his or her payroll deductions or other contributions to purchase
Company Common Stock for such Offering Period after the date hereof; (b) the
Company shall not commence any new Offering Periods under the ESPP on or
after the date hereof; and (c) if any whole shares of Company Common Stock
purchased in such Offering Period by a participant have not been issued
before the Effective Time to such participant, in lieu of the issuance of
such shares, the Surviving Corporation shall pay such participant,
immediately after the Effective Time, a cash payment determined by
multiplying (i) such number of whole shares by (ii) the Merger Consideration,
plus a cash payment equal to the balance, if any, in his or her account in
the ESPP after the purchase of such whole shares of Company Common Stock,
less any withholding taxes as described in Section 1.8(e) and without
interest. Effective as of the Effective Time, the ESPP shall be terminated.

       

Section 1.8. _Surrender of Shares of Company Common Stock; Stock Transfer
Books_.

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement with a
bank or trust company, reasonably acceptable to the Company, to act as agent
(the "Paying Agent") for the Company Stockholders to receive the funds
necessary to make the payments to the Company Stockholders pursuant to
Section 1.4 upon surrender of the Company StockholdersÂ’ Certificates and
pursuant to Section 1.6 in the case of holders who exercise Company Warrants.
Parent shall, at or prior to the Effective Time, deposit with the Paying
Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares
of Company Common Stock (the "Fund"). The Fund shall be invested by the
Paying Agent as directed by Parent. Any net profit resulting from, or
interest or income produced by, such investments, shall be payable to Parent.
Parent shall replace any monies lost through any investment made pursuant to
this Section 1.8(a). The Paying Agent shall make the payments provided in
Section 1.4.

  

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be mailed to
each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of shares of
Company Common Stock entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 1.4 a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the
Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive, in exchange
therefor, the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock
formerly evidenced by such Certificate, and such Certificate shall then be
canceled. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall, at and after the
Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive Merger
Consideration. No interest shall accrue or be paid to any beneficial owner of
shares of Company Common Stock or any holder of any Certificate with respect
to the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificate. If
payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the
person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered on the stock
transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed in blank or to the Paying Agent
or otherwise be in proper form for transfer, in the sole discretion of the
Paying Agent, and that the person requesting such payment shall have paid all
transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such
taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon making of an affidavit of that fact
by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond, in
such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the applicable Merger Consideration such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 1.4.

  

(c) At any time following the date that is six months after the Effective
Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it
any portion of the Fund that had been made available to the Paying Agent and
not disbursed to the Company Stockholders (including all interest and other
income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all amounts held in the
Fund or other funds made available to it), and thereafter each such holder
shall be entitled to look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property,
escheat and other similar Laws), and only as general creditors thereof, with
respect to any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of
the Certificates held by such holder. If any Certificates representing shares
of Company Common Stock shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to
such date on which the Merger Consideration in

       

respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Entity, any such cash, shares, dividends or distributions
payable in respect of such Certificate shall become the property of Parent,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled
thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation,
Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Company
Stockholder for any Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such share
of Company Common Stock to a public official pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Law.

  

(d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
shares of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company. From and after
the Effective Time, except for Parent and Merger Sub, the Company
Stockholders holding shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such shares of Company Common Stock except as otherwise provided herein or by
applicable Law, and the Merger Consideration paid pursuant to this Article I
upon the surrender or exchange of Certificates shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company
Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificates.

  

(e) Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as
the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration and any other amount otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Company Stockholder, any holder of Company Options or
Company Warrants and any participant in the ESPP (each, a "Payee") such
amounts that Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"), the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax Law. Any amounts so withheld shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to Payee.

  

(f) Upon the surrender to the Paying Agent of an original copy of a Company
Warrant together with the applicable exercise price of $11.37 per share of
Company Common Stock, the Paying Agent shall pay to such holder the Merger
Consideration of $10.35 for each share of Company Common Stock represented by
such Company Warrant. The procedures set forth in this Section 1.8 shall
apply to any surrender of a Company Warrant.

 **THE SURVIVING CORPORATION**

  

Section 2.1. _Certificate of Incorporation_. The certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended as of the

be altered, amended or repealed in accordance with applicable Law or such
certificate of incorporation.

mean, (i) a material adverse effect on the business, operations or financial
condition of the Company and the Subsidiaries taken as a whole ( _provided,
however_ , that with respect to this clause (i), Material Adverse Effect will

Section 3.8. _Reports; Financial Statements; Internal Controls._

  

(a) The Company and each of the Subsidiaries have timely filed all reports,
registrations, schedules, forms, statements and other documents, together
with any amendments required to be made with respect thereto (each, a
"Report"), that they were required to file since January 1, 2003 with (i)
the FCC, (ii) the SEC, (iii) any state or other federal regulatory authority
(other than any taxing authority, which is covered by Section 3.10) and (iv)
any foreign regulatory authority (other than any taxing authority, which is
covered by Section 3.10), and have paid all fees and assessments due and
payable in connection therewith, except in each case where the failure to
file such Report, or to pay such fees and assessments, has not had, and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. No Report of the Company made with the SEC, as of
the date of such Report, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of
the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except that
information as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) shall
be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. Since January 1, 2003,
as of their respective dates, all Reports of the Company made with the SEC
complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the
"SOX Act") and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect thereto.
No executive officer of the Company has failed in any respect to make
the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the
SOX Act, and no enforcement action has been initiated against the Company by
the SEC relating to disclosures contained in any Report of the Company made
with the SEC.

  

(b) The Company has previously made available to Parent copies of (i)
the consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the Subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholdersÂ’ equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period
ended December 31, 2005, as reported in the CompanyÂ’s Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, including any amendments
thereto filed with the SEC (collectively, the "Company 2005 10-K"), filed
with the SEC under the Exchange Act, accompanied by the audit report
by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered public accounting
firm with respect to the Company for such periods (such balance sheets
and statements, the "Company Financial Statements"). The consolidated
balance sheets of the Company (including the related notes, where applicable)
included in the Company Financial Statements fairly present in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and the
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof, and the other financial statements
included in the Company Financial Statements (including the related notes,
where applicable) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
results of the operations and changes in stockholdersÂ’ equity and cash flows
of the Company and the Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods therein
set forth; each of such statements (including the related notes, where
applicable) complies in all material respects with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto; and each of the Company
Financial Statements (including the related notes, where applicable) has been
prepared in all material respects in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied during the periods involved, except, in each case, as indicated in
such statements or in the notes thereto. There is no applicable accounting
rule, consensus or pronouncement that has been adopted as of the date of this
Agreement by the SEC, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Emerging
Issues Task Force or any similar body but is not in effect as of the date of
this Agreement that, if implemented, would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

  

(c) The Company and the Subsidiaries have designed and maintain a system of
internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances
regarding the reliability of financial reporting. The Company (i) has

       

designed and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the Reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the SECÂ’s rules and forms
and is accumulated and communicated to the CompanyÂ’s management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and (ii)
has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of its internal control
over financial reporting prior to the date hereof, to the CompanyÂ’s auditors
and the audit committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (A) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation
of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect in any material respect the CompanyÂ’s ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud,

a significant role in the CompanyÂ’s internal controls over financial
reporting.

practices employed by the Company, (iii) any material change in the CompanyÂ’s
internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) or (iv) any action of the type described in
Section 5.1(b) (other than Section 5.1(b)(iv)) __ or Section 5.1(c) that had
such action been taken after the date of this Agreement would be in violation
of any such Section.

to have a Material Adverse Effect; (h) except as would not reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse
Effect, the unpaid Taxes of the Company and the Subsidiaries did not exceed

forth on the face of the balance sheet in the most recent Company Financial
Statement (disregarding any notes thereto); (i) neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary (A) has been a member of any other affiliated group filing a
consolidated federal income Tax Return (except the affiliated group of which

penalty; and (q) the Company has not made any distribution of stock, and no

the imposition, on the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, of any liability
or obligation arising under common law or under any Environmental
Law (including the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation

consideration; (iii) to the Knowledge of the Company, the CompanyÂ’s rights in
the Licensed Rights and all other material rights in the Licensed Rights are

obligations; and (iv) the Intellectual Property Rights and the Licensed
Rights are all those material intellectual property rights necessary to the
conduct of the business of each of the Company and the Subsidiaries as
presently conducted. The validity of the Intellectual Property Rights and
title thereto, (A) have not been questioned in any prior Litigation; (B) are
not being questioned in any pending Litigation; and (C) to the Knowledge of
the Company, are not the subject of any threatened or proposed Litigation.

  

(b) To the Knowledge of the Company, the business of each of the Company and

on and has not been alleged to conflict with or infringe on any patents,
trademarks, trade names, service marks, copyrights, trade secrets or other
intellectual property rights of others or to constitute unfair competition or
trade practices under the laws of any jurisdiction in which the Company and
the Subsidiaries operate.

  

(c) The consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not result
in the loss or impairment of any of the Intellectual Property Rights or the
CompanyÂ’s or the SubsidiariesÂ’ right to use any of the Licensed Rights.
To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no third parties using any of
the Intellectual Property Rights material to the business of the Company or

actions or proceedings pending or threatened against the Company or any
Subsidiary with respect to any software owned or licensed by the Company or

not breach in any material respect any terms of any license or other contract
between the Company or the Subsidiaries and any third party. The Company and
the Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with the terms
and conditions of all license agreements in favor of the Company and the

Merger Sub to perform its respective obligations under this Agreement or to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (ii) that it believes results or would reasonably be expected to
result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 6.3. The delivery

supplement, or amend the Company Disclosure Letter that it has delivered
pursuant to this Agreement and deliver such supplement or amendment to
Parent; _provided_ that such supplement or amendment shall be for
informational purposes only and shall not enlarge, reduce or otherwise modify
the rights of the parties hereunder (including the right of any party to
assert the failure of a condition to Closing set forth in Article VI without
regard to any such supplement or amendment).

  

Section 5.4. _Further Assurances._

shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under Law, subject to Section 5.5 _,_ to consummate and
make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including using all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all
licenses, permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and
orders of each Governmental Entity and parties to contracts with the Company
and the Subsidiaries as are necessary for the consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or as otherwise
reasonably

       

requested by Parent or as are necessary to fulfill the conditions set forth
in Article VI. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company
shall use all commercially reasonable efforts and shall otherwise cooperate
with Parent in such manner as reasonably requested by Parent in order to
obtain the consents referred to in Section 1.2 of the Company Disclosure
Letter. If at any time after the Effective Time any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the
proper officers of each party to this Agreement and the Surviving
Corporation, subject to Section 5.5 _,_ shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to take all such action.

  

(b) In connection with, and without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall
(i) take all commercially reasonable actions necessary to ensure that no
state antitakeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes
operative with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any state
antitakeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes operative
with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, take all actions necessary to ensure that
this Agreement, the Merger and any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

  

Section 5.5. _Board Recommendations._

  

(a) In connection with the Merger and the StockholdersÂ’ Meeting, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall (i) subject to Section 5.5(b) _,_ recommend to
the Company Stockholders to vote in favor of the approval of the Merger
Agreement and the Merger and use all commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the necessary approvals by the Company Stockholders of this Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii)
otherwise comply with the legal requirements applicable to such meeting.

  

(b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall, except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.5(b) _, _ (i)
withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or
modify the approval or recommendation of such Board of Directors or such
committee of the Merger or this Agreement, (ii) approve or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Alternative Transaction (any
action described in clause (i) above or in this clause (ii) being referred to
as an "Adverse Recommendation Change"), or (iii) cause the Company to enter
into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or
other similar agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement in compliance
with the provisions of Section 5.9(b) (each, an "Acquisition Agreement")
related to any transaction involving an Acquisition Proposal from a third
party (an "Alternative Transaction"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if prior
to the adoption of this Agreement by the Company Stockholders, the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after it has received
a Superior Proposal in compliance with this Section 5.5(b) and after receipt
of advice from outside counsel, that it is required to do so to comply with
fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable Delaware Law,
the Board of Directors of the Company may (subject to this and the following
sentences) make an Adverse Recommendation Change, but only at a time that is
after the fourth business day following ParentÂ’s receipt of written notice
advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company has received a
Superior Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal that is reasonably likely to
be a Superior Proposal. Such written notice shall specify the material terms
and conditions of such Superior Proposal or Acquisition Proposal (and include
a copy thereof with all accompanying documentation, if in writing), identify
the person making such Superior Proposal and state that the Board of
Directors of the Company is considering making an Adverse Recommendation
Change. During such four business day period, the

       

Company shall provide an opportunity for Parent to propose such adjustments
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Company to
proceed with its recommendation to the Company Stockholders without an
Adverse Recommendation Change; _provided, however_ , that any such proposed
adjustment shall be at the discretion of Parent at the time. For purposes of
this Agreement, a "Superior Proposal" means any proposal (on its most
recently amended or modified terms, if amended or modified) made by a third
party to enter into an Alternative Transaction that the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in its good faith judgment (based on the advice of an
independent financial advisor) to be more favorable to the
Company Stockholders than the Merger, taking into account all relevant
factors (including whether, in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors of the Company, after obtaining the advice of such independent
financial advisor, the third party is reasonably able to finance the
transaction, and any proposed changes to this Agreement that may be proposed
by Parent in response to such Alternative Transaction). Notwithstanding any
such Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall submit this Agreement
to the Company Stockholders, with such disclosures as shall be required by
Law, and provided that in the event of an Adverse Recommendation Change
permitted under this Section 5.5(b), the Company may submit this Agreement to
the Company Stockholders without a recommendation or with a negative
recommendation, in which event the Board of Directors of the Company may
communicate the basis for its lack of recommendation or
negative recommendation to the Company Stockholders in the Proxy Statement or
an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Board of Directors of the
Company from taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders pursuant to
Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act a position with respect to a
tender or exchange offer by a third party or from making any similar
disclosure, in either case to the extent required by applicable Law;
_provided,_ that the Company may not, except as provided by this Section
5.5(b), withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the
approval or recommendation of such Board of Directors of the Merger or this
Agreement.

  

Section 5.6. _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company or Parent shall give
the other party the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement
of any stockholder Litigation against the Company and its directors or Parent
and its directors, as the case may be, relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger; _provided_
, however, that no such settlement shall be agreed to without ParentÂ’s
consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.

  

Section 5.7. _Indemnification._

  

(a) It is understood and agreed that all rights to indemnification by the
Company now existing in favor of each present and former director,
officer, employee and agent of the Company or the Subsidiaries (the
"Indemnified Parties") as provided in the Company Certificate of
Incorporation or the Company Bylaws, in each case as in effect on the date of
this Agreement, or pursuant to any other agreements in effect on the date
hereof, copies of which have been made available to Parent, shall survive the
Merger, and Parent shall, subject to Section 5.7(c), (i) cause the Surviving
Corporation to continue in full force and effect for a period of at least six
years from the Effective Time and (ii) perform, or cause the Surviving
Corporation to perform, in a timely manner, the Surviving CorporationÂ’s
obligation with respect thereto (without regard to any discharge of such
obligation in any bankruptcy or similar proceeding). Parent and Merger Sub
agree that any claims for indemnification hereunder as to which they have
received written notice prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time
shall survive, whether or not such claims shall have been finally adjudicated
or settled.

  

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving
Corporation shall, maintain in effect for six years from the Effective Time,
if available, the CompanyÂ’s current directorsÂ’

       

and officersÂ’ liability insurance policies covering acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to those persons who
are currently (and any additional persons who prior to the Effective Time
become) Indemnified Parties ("DandO Insurance") (provided that the Surviving
Corporation may substitute therefor policies with reputable and financially
sound carriers of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions
that are not materially less favorable to the Indemnified Parties);
_provided, however_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation
be required to expend pursuant to this Section 5.7(b) more than an amount
per year equal to 200% of current annual premiums paid by the Company for
such insurance. In the event that, but for the proviso to the
immediately preceding sentence, the Surviving Corporation would be required
to expend more than 200% of current annual premiums, the Surviving
Corporation shall obtain the maximum amount of such insurance obtainable by
payment of annual premiums equal to 200% of current annual premiums. If the
Surviving Corporation elects to reduce the amount of insurance coverage
pursuant to the preceding sentence, it will furnish to the officers and
directors currently covered by such DandO Insurance reasonable notice of such
reduction in coverage and shall, to the extent additional coverage is
available, afford such persons the opportunity to pay such additional
premiums as may be necessary to maintain the existing level of DandO Insurance
coverage. In lieu of the foregoing, the Company may purchase, prior to the
Effective Time, or the Surviving Corporation may purchase, after the
Effective Time, a six-year "tail" prepaid officersÂ’ and directorsÂ’ liability
insurance policy in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time covering each such Indemnified Party; _provided_ that the
premium and terms of such insurance are reasonably acceptable to Parent (it
being understood that a policy with a one-time premium not in excess of 250%
of the current annual premium shall be deemed to be reasonably acceptable to
Parent).

  

(c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.7 _._

  

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.7 __ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives.

  

Section 5.8. _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any
public statements with respect to this Agreement or the Merger and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except as may be required by Law or any listing agreement with
a national securities exchange or trading system to which Parent or
the Company is a party. The parties agree that the initial press release to
be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will be substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit C_.

Section 5.9. ** ****_Acquisition Proposals._**

  

(a) The Company shall, on the date hereof, terminate (and shall cause each
Subsidiary to terminate) all direct and indirect negotiations and discussions
with all other parties with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or any
potential Acquisition Proposal.

  

(b) The Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of the
Subsidiaries or Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
initiate or knowingly encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal or
(ii) participate in or knowingly encourage any discussion or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any person any non-public information with respect
to, or take any other action to knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the
making of, any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not prohibit the Board of Directors of the Company from furnishing
information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, any person
or entity that makes an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal prior to the
adoption of this Agreement by the Company Stockholders if, and only to the
extent that, (A) the Board of Directors of the Company, based upon the advice
of independent outside legal counsel, determines in good faith that such
action is required for the Board of Directors of the Company to comply with
its fiduciary obligations to the Company Stockholders under applicable
Delaware Law, (B) prior to taking such action, the Company receives from such
person or entity an executed agreement in reasonably customary form relating
to the confidentiality of information to be provided to such person or entity
containing provisions no less favorable to the Company than those set forth
in the Confidentiality Agreement and (C) the Board of Directors of the
Company concludes in good faith, based upon advice from its independent
financial advisor, that the Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to lead
to a Superior Proposal. The Company shall provide prompt (and at least within
24 hours) oral and written notice to Parent of (1) the receipt of any such
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead
to any Acquisition Proposal, (2) the material terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, (3) the identity of such person or entity
making any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and (4) the CompanyÂ’s
intention to furnish information to, or enter into discussions or
negotiations with, such person or entity. The Company shall continue to keep
Parent fully and promptly informed of the status and material changes to the
terms of any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. For purposes of this
Agreement, subject to Section 7.2(c), "Acquisition Proposal" means any
proposal with respect to (i) a transaction pursuant to which any person (or
group of persons) other than Parent or its affiliates, directly or
indirectly, acquires or would acquire more than 20% of the outstanding shares
of common stock of the Company or of the outstanding voting power of the
Company, whether from the Company or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange
offer or otherwise, (ii) a merger, share exchange, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization or any other transaction involving the Company
(other than the Merger) or any of the Subsidiaries pursuant to which any
person or group of persons (other than Parent or its affiliates) party
thereto, or its stockholders, owns or would own more than 20% of the
outstanding shares of common stock or the outstanding voting power of the
Company or, if applicable, the parent entity resulting from any such
transaction immediately upon consummation thereof, or (iii) any transaction
pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) other than Parent or its
affiliates acquires or would acquire control of assets (including for this
purpose the outstanding equity securities of the Subsidiaries of the Company
and securities of the entity surviving any merger or business combination
involving any of the Subsidiaries of the Company) of the Company or any of
the Subsidiaries representing more than 20% of the fair market value of all
the assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately
prior to such transaction.

       

Section 5.10. ** ****_Stockholders Â’ Meeting; Proxy Statement._**

  

(a) At the request of Parent, the Company shall cause the StockholdersÂ’
Meeting to be duly called and held as soon as practicable after the Proxy
Statement is cleared by the SEC, for the purpose of voting on the approval
and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger.

  

(b) The Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable
Law and the Company Certificate of Incorporation and Company Bylaws to duly
call, give notice of, and convene the StockholdersÂ’ Meeting.

  

(c) Subject to Sections 5.5 and 5.9, the Company shall (i) solicit from the
Company Stockholders entitled to vote at the StockholdersÂ’ Meeting proxies in
favor of such approval and (ii) take all other action reasonably necessary
to secure the vote or consent of such holders required by the DGCL or
this Agreement to effect the Merger.

  

(d) Parent and the Company will as promptly as practicable after the date of
this Agreement jointly prepare the Proxy Statement, and the Company shall
file the Proxy Statement with the SEC, and shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to respond to the comments of the SEC and to cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company Stockholders at the earliest
practical time. The Company shall furnish all information concerning it and
the holders of its capital stock as Parent may reasonably request in
connection with such actions, and Parent shall furnish all information
concerning it and Merger Sub as the Company may reasonably request in
connection with such actions. Each party to this Agreement will notify the
other parties promptly of the receipt of the comments of the SEC, if any, and
of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement or for additional information with respect thereto, and will supply
the other parties with copies of all correspondence between such party or its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or members of its staff, on the
other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Merger. If (i) at any
time prior to the StockholdersÂ’ Meeting, any event should occur relating to
the Company or any of the Subsidiaries that should be set forth in an
amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, the Company shall
promptly inform Parent and (ii) if at any time prior to the StockholdersÂ’
Meeting, any event should occur relating to Parent or Merger Sub or any of
their respective associates or affiliates, or relating to the plans of any
such persons for the Company after the Effective Time that should be set
forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, Parent
will promptly inform the Company, and in the case of (i) or (ii) the Company
and Parent, will, upon learning of such event, promptly prepare, and the
Company shall file with the SEC and, if required, mail such amendment or
supplement to the Company Stockholders; provided, prior to such filing, the
Company and Parent shall consult with each other with respect to such
amendment or supplement and shall incorporate the otherÂ’s comments,
except with respect to any comment that would create a misstatement of fact
or an omission of a material fact. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall vote,
or cause to be voted, in favor of the Merger and this Agreement all shares of
Company Common Stock directly or indirectly beneficially owned by it.

  

(e) The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Proxy Statement of
the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company described in
Section 3.3, subject to any modification, amendment or withdrawal thereof,
and represents that the Independent Advisor has, subject to the terms of its
engagement letter with the Company and the Board of Directors of the Company
(the "Independent Advisor Engagement Letter"), consented to the inclusion of
references to its opinion in the Proxy Statement.

  

Section 5.11. ** ****_Stockholder and Warrant Holder Lists._**

  

(a) The Company shall promptly upon the request by Parent, or shall cause its
transfer agent to promptly, furnish Parent and Merger Sub with mailing labels
containing the names and addresses of all record holders of shares of Company
Common Stock and with security position listings of shares of 

       

Company Common Stock held in stock depositories, each as of the most recent
practicable date, together with all other available listings and computer
files containing names, addresses and security position listings of record
holders and beneficial owners of shares of Company Common Stock. The Company
shall furnish Parent and Merger Sub with such additional information,
including updated listings and computer files of the Company Stockholders,
mailing labels and security position listings, and such other assistance as
Parent, Merger Sub or their agents may reasonably request. Subject to the
requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to
disseminate the Proxy Statement and any other documents necessary to
consummate the Merger, Parent shall hold in confidence the information
contained in any such labels, listings and files, and the additional
information referred to in the preceding sentence, will use such information
only in connection with the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be
terminated, shall, upon request, deliver to the Company all copies of such
information then in its possession or control or in the possession or control
of its agents or representatives.

  

(b) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide, or
cause the warrant agent for the Company Warrants to provide, promptly after
the date hereof the names and addresses of all record holders of Company
Warrants, as of the most recent practicable date. The Company shall timely
provide notice of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in accordance with the terms of the warrant agreement
governing the Company Warrants to the warrant agent for the Company Warrants,
such notice to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent.
The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
warrant agent for the Company Warrants to timely provide notice of the Merger
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the
terms of the warrant agreement governing the Company Warrants to all holders
of any Company Warrant, such notice to be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent.

  

Section 5.12. ** ****_Director Resignations._** The Company shall cause
to be delivered to Parent resignations of all the directors of the CompanyÂ’s
Subsidiaries to be effective upon the consummation of the Merger. The Company
shall cause such directors, prior to resignation, to appoint new directors
nominated by Parent to fill such vacancies.

  

Section 5.13. ** ****_Benefits Continuation; Severance._**

  

(a) Except as provided in Section 5.13 of the Company Disclosure Letter, for
the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending no earlier than the
first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent, the Company and
the Surviving Corporation shall provide, or shall cause their subsidiaries
to provide, benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to
those provided under the Scheduled Company Benefit Plans as in effect on the
date hereof to employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time ("Affected Employees"); notwithstanding the foregoing,
however, Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation shall not be
obligated to make matching contributions or any other payments under the
UbiquiTel Retirement Plan (the "Company 401(K) Plan") in amounts or
percentage levels comparable to matching contributions or other payments made
by the Company prior to the consummation of the Merger but will provide
matching contributions and other such payments in amounts and percentage
levels comparable to similarly situated employees of Parent. Parent, the
Company and the Surviving Corporation shall comply with the terms of all
Scheduled Company Benefit Plans in effect on the date hereof, subject to any
reserved right to amend or terminate any Scheduled Company Benefit Plan;
provided, however, that no such amendment or termination may be inconsistent
with ParentÂ’s and the Surviving CorporationÂ’s obligations pursuant to the
first sentence of this Section 5.13(a). Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation agree to
honor all obligations to Affected Employees, including, but not limited to,
obligations for severance pay and other severance benefits (x) pursuant to
the terms of the written employment and separation agreements listed in

       

Section 3.16 of the Company Disclosure Letter or pursuant to Section 5.1(c)
of the Company Disclosure Letter and (y) who are terminated prior to the
date that is 12 months following the Effective Time in accordance with the
CompanyÂ’s severance pay plan and policies set forth in Section 5.13(a) of
the Company Disclosure Letter.

  

(b) Affected Employees shall be given credit for all service with the Company
and the Subsidiaries (or service credited by the Company or the Subsidiaries)
under all employee benefit plans and arrangements currently maintained or
established in the future by Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation) in which they are or become participants for purposes
of participation, eligibility, vesting and level of benefits (but not for
benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan or any plan providing
post-retirement medical, dental or prescription drug benefits or as would
otherwise result in duplication of benefits). Parent and its
subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) shall cause any pre-
existing conditions or limitations, eligibility waiting periods or required
physical examinations under any welfare benefit plans of Parent and its
subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to be waived with respect
to Affected Employees and their eligible dependents to the extent waived
under the corresponding Scheduled Company Benefit Plan in which the
applicable Affected Employee participated prior to the Effective Time and,
with respect to life insurance coverage, up to the Affected EmployeeÂ’s
current level of insurability. Parent and its subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation) shall give Affected Employees and their eligible
dependents credit for the plan year in which the Effective Time (or, if
later, the commencement of participation in any benefit plan) occurs toward
applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for expenses incurred
prior to the Effective Time (or, if later, the date of commencement of
participation in such benefit plan).

  

(c) The Company agrees that Parent may enter into retention
bonus arrangements that have effect following the Effective Time with such
employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries as determined by Parent in such
amounts and on such terms and conditions as determined by Parent.

  

(d) For purposes of this Section 5.13, the term "Scheduled Company Benefit
Plan" shall mean only those Company Benefit Plans listed in Section 5.13 of
the Company Disclosure Letter.

  

(e) Nothing in this Section 5.13 shall confer any rights or remedies upon any
person, individual or whomsoever other than the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub.

  

Section 5.14. ** ****_Rule 16b-3._** Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company may approve in accordance with the procedures set forth in Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act and the Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and
Flom LLP SEC No-Action Letter (January 12, 1999) any dispositions of equity
securities of the Company (including derivative securities with respect to
equity securities of the Company) resulting from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by each officer or director of the Company who
is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act with respect to equity
securities of the Company.

 **article VII**

  

 **TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER**

  

Section 7.1. ** ****_Termination._** This Agreement may be terminated
and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time,
whether before or after approval of matters presented in connection with the
Merger by the Company Stockholders:

  

(a) By mutual written consent duly authorized by the Boards of Directors of
Parent and the Company;

  

(b) By either Parent or the Company, upon written notice to the other, if any
court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity shall
have issued an order, decree, ruling or taken any other action
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger and
such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and
nonappealable; provided, however, that the party terminating this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 7.1(b) shall use all commercially reasonable efforts
to have such order, decree, ruling or action vacated;

  

(c) By either Parent or the Company upon written notice to the other if the
Merger shall not have been consummated on or before December 31, 2006;
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 7.1(c) shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill
any of its obligations under this Agreement has been the primary cause of, or
resulted in, the failure to consummate the Merger on or before such date;

  

(d) By Parent or Merger Sub, upon written notice to the Company, if, prior to
the approval required by Section 6.1(a) of the Company Stockholders at the
StockholdersÂ’ Meeting, the Board of Directors of the Company (i) shall have
withdrawn or shall have modified in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub
its approval or recommendation of the Merger or this Agreement, (ii) causes
the Company to enter into an agreement with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement), (iii) shall have endorsed,
approved or recommended any Acquisition Proposal or (iv) shall have resolved
to do any of the foregoing.

       

(e) By the Company or Parent, upon written notice to the other, if this
Agreement shall fail to be adopted by the Company Stockholders at

thereof);

  

(f) By Parent or the Company, upon written notice to the other, if there
shall have been a material breach of or any material inaccuracy in any of the
representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of any
of the other parties, which breach is not cured within 30 days
following receipt by the breaching party of written notice of such breach
from the terminating party, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured
prior to the Closing (provided that the terminating party is not then in
material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement
contained herein); provided, however, that neither party shall have the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(f) unless the breach
of representation or warranty, together with all other such breaches,
would entitle the party receiving such representation not to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under Section 6.2(a) (in the
case of a breach of representation or warranty by the Company) or Section
6.3(a) (in the case of a breach of representation or warranty by Parent or
Merger Sub); or

  

(g) By Parent or the Company, upon written notice to the other, if there
shall have been a material breach of any of the covenants or agreements set

party of written notice of such breach from the terminating party, or which
breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Closing (provided that
the terminating party is not then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein).

  

Section 7.2. ** ****_Effect of Termination_**.

  

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1
hereof, this Agreement shall forthwith be terminated and have no further
effect except that Section 5.2(b), Section 5.11, this Section 7.2 and Article
VIII shall survive termination of this Agreement; _provided_ that nothing
herein shall relieve any party from liability for any willful breach hereof.

  

(b) If Parent or Merger Sub exercises its right to terminate this Agreement
under Section 7.1(d), then the Company shall within two (2) business days of
such termination pay to Parent $35,000,000 in immediately available funds
(the "Termination Fee").

  

(c) In the event that (i)(x) an Acquisition Proposal has been proposed by any
person (other than Parent and Merger Sub or any of their respective
affiliates) or any person has announced its intention (whether or not
conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal or
such intention has otherwise become known to the CompanyÂ’s directors or
officers, or its stockholders generally and (y) thereafter this Agreement is
terminated by either the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(c), 7.1(e)
or 7.1(g), and (ii) within 12 months after such termination of this
Agreement, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into any definitive
agreement providing for an Acquisition Proposal, or an Acquisition Proposal
is consummated, then the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee upon
the first to occur of the events described in clause (ii) of this sentence.
For purposes of this Section 7.2(c), references to 20% in the definition of "
_Acquisition Proposal_ " as such term relates to an Alternative Transaction
will be deemed to be references to 50%.

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if
the Company fails promptly to pay to Parent any amounts due under this
Section 7.2, the Company shall pay the costs and expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) in connection with any action,

payment, together with interest on the

       

amount of any unpaid fee or obligation at the publicly announced prime rate
of Citibank, N.A. in effect from time to time from the date such fee or
obligation was required to be paid.

  

Section 7.3. ** ****_Amendments._** This Agreement may not be amended
except by action taken or authorized by the board of directors of each of the
parties (and, in the case of the Company, with the approval of the Board of
Directors of the Company) set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties; _provided, however_ , that after adoption of
this Agreement by the Company Stockholders, no amendment may be made without
the further approval of the Company Stockholders if the effect of such
amendment would be to reduce the Merger Consideration or change the form
thereof or such further approvals otherwise required by the DGCL.

  

Section 7.4. ** ****_Waiver._** At any time prior to the Effective
Time, whether before or after the StockholdersÂ’ Meeting, any party, by action
taken or authorized by its board of directors, may (a) extend the time for
the performance of any of the covenants, obligations or other acts of any
other party or (b) waive any inaccuracy of any representations or warranties
or compliance with any of the agreements, covenants or conditions of any
other party or with any conditions to its own obligations. Any agreement on
the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party by its
duly authorized officer. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert
any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a
waiver of such rights. The waiver of any such right with respect to
particular facts and other circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with
respect to any other facts and circumstances and each such right shall be
deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to
time.

  

 **article VIII**

  

 **GENERAL PROVISIONS**

  

Section 8.1. ** ****_No Third Party Beneficiaries._** Other than the
provisions of Section 5.7, nothing in this Agreement shall confer any rights
or remedies upon any person other than the parties.

the entire Agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements, or
representations by or among the parties, written or oral, with respect to the
subject matter hereof, except for any Sprint PCS Management Agreement
or related agreement in effect between the Company or any Subsidiary, on the
one hand, and Parent or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand.

  

Section 8.3. ** ****_Succession and Assignment._** This Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties named herein and

of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other parties; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Merger Sub may
freely assign its rights without such prior written approval to another
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent as to which the
representation in Section 4.7 is true and accurate if such assignee were
substituted for Merger Sub therein, but no such assignment shall relieve
Merger Sub or Parent of any of its obligations hereunder.

  

Section 8.4. ** ****_Counterparts._** This Agreement may be executed in
two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all
of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

  

Section 8.5. ** ****_Governing Law; Venue; Service of Process, Waiver of
Jury Trial._**

  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflicts of
law thereof.

  

(b) The parties (i) agree that any suit, action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement will be brought solely in the state or federal
courts of the State of Delaware, (ii) consent to

       

the exclusive jurisdiction of each such court in any suit, action or
proceeding relating to arising out of this Agreement and (iii) waive any
objection that it may have to the laying of venue in any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court.

  

(c) Each party irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner
provided for the giving of notices pursuant to this Agreement; provided that
such service will be deemed to have been given only when actually received by
such party. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of a party to
serve process in another manner permitted by Law.

  

(d) EACH PARTY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, AND WHETHER MADE BY
CLAIM, COUNTERCLAIM, THIRD PARTY CLAIM OR OTHERWISE.

  

Section 8.6. ** ****_Severability._** Any term or provision of this
Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any
jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining
terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the
offending term or provision in any other situation or in any
other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or
unenforceable, the parties agree that the court making the determination of
invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope,
duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or
phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after the expiration
of the time within which the judgment may be appealed.

  

Section 8.7. ** ****_Specific Performance._** Each of the parties
acknowledges and agrees that the other party would be damaged irreparably in
the event any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or otherwise are breached.
Accordingly, each of the parties agrees that the other party shall be
entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the
provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and
the terms and provisions hereof.

  

Section 8.8. ** ****_Construction._** The language used in this
Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties to express
their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied
against any party. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." All references to the "parties" means the parties to
this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires. All references to any
agreement, instrument, statute or regulation are to it as amended and
supplemented from time to time (and, in the case of a statute or regulation,
to any corresponding provisions or successor statutes or regulations). When a
reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, such reference shall be to a
Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The phrase "the date of
this Agreement," "date hereof" and terms of similar import, unless the
context otherwise requires, shall be deemed to refer to April 19, 2006.

  

Section 8.9. ** ****_Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties and
Agreements._** The representations, warranties and agreements in this
Agreement shall terminate at the Effective Time, except that the agreements
set forth in Article I and Article VIII and Section 5.4, Section 5.7 and
Section 5.13 shall survive the Effective Time in accordance with their terms.

  

Section 8.10. ** ****_Certain Definitions._** For purposes of this
Agreement, the terms "associate" and "affiliate" shall have the same meaning
as set forth in Rule l2b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act,

       

and the term "person" shall mean any individual, corporation, partnership
(general or limited), limited liability company, limited liability
partnership, trust, joint venture, joint-stock company, syndicate,
association, entity, unincorporated organization or government or any
political subdivision, agency or instrumentality thereof.

  

Section 8.11. ** ****_Fees and Expenses._** Each party shall pay its
own costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

Section 8.12. _ Notices._ All notices, requests, claims, demands and
other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given (and
shall be deemed to have been duly given upon receipt) by delivery in person,
by telecopy or by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return
receipt requested) or sent by reputable overnight express courier (charges
prepaid) to the respective parties at the following addresses, or at such
