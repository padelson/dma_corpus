-iii-     AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF
MERGER (this "AGREEMENT") is made and entered into as of May 24, 2006, by and
between AMSOUTH BANCORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("AMSOUTH"), and
REGIONS FINANCIAL CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("REGIONS").  
RECITALS   A. APPROVALS. The Boards of Directors of AmSouth and Regions have
each determined that the transactions described herein are consistent with,
and will further, their respective business strategies and goals, and are in
the best interests of AmSouth and Regions, respectively, and their
respective stockholders.   B. OPTION AGREEMENTS. As an inducement and
condition to the entrance of AmSouth into this Agreement, Regions is granting
to AmSouth an option pursuant to a stock option agreement in the form set
forth in EXHIBIT 3 (the "REGIONS OPTION AGREEMENT"). As an inducement and
condition to the entrance of Regions into this Agreement, AmSouth is granting
to Regions an option pursuant to a stock option agreement in the form set
forth in EXHIBIT 4 (the "AMSOUTH OPTION AGREEMENT" and, together with the
Regions Option Agreement, the "OPTION AGREEMENTS").   C. INTENTION OF THE
PARTIES. It is the intention of the Parties that, for federal income Tax
purposes, the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and that this Agreement shall
constitute a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of
the Internal Revenue Code.   D. DEFINED TERMS. Certain capitalized terms
used in this Agreement are defined in 7.1 of this Agreement.   NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the above and the mutual
warranties, representations, covenants, and agreements set forth herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties agree as follows:  
ARTICLE 1  THE MERGER   1.1 MERGER. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, AmSouth shall be merged with and into
Regions in accordance with the provisions of Section 251 of the DGCL (the
"MERGER"). Regions shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (the
"SURVIVING CORPORATION") and shall continue to be governed by the Laws of the
State of Delaware. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate
existence of AmSouth shall cease.   1.2 TIME AND PLACE OF CLOSING. The
closing of the Merger (the "CLOSING") shall take place at such time and place
as Regions and AmSouth shall agree, on the date when the Effective Time (as
defined in Section 1.3) is to occur (the "CLOSING DATE").     1.3
EFFECTIVE TIME. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, on the
Closing Date, the Parties will cause a certificate of merger to be filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "DELAWARE SECRETARY") as
provided in Section 251 of the DGCL to effect the Merger. The Merger
shall take effect when such certificate of merger is filed, or at such other
time as may be specified therein (the "EFFECTIVE TIME"). Subject to the terms
and conditions hereof, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by the duly
authorized officers of each Party, the Parties shall cause the Effective Time
to occur on the third business day following the date on which satisfaction
or waiver of the last of the conditions set forth in Article 5 has occurred
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions), or
such earlier date mutually agreed upon by the Parties.   1.4 CONVERSION OF
AMSOUTH COMMON STOCK. At the Effective Time, in each case subject to Section
1.5, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
Parties or the holder of any securities of the parties:   (a) Each share of
AmSouth Common Stock (including the AmSouth  Stockholder Rights) that is
Outstanding immediately prior to the Effective  Time (other than shares of
AmSouth Common Stock held by either Party (in  each case other than in a
fiduciary or agency capacity or on behalf of  third parties or as a result of
debts previously contracted)) shall be  converted into 0.7974 fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Regions Common  Stock (the "EXCHANGE RATIO").   (b)
All shares of AmSouth Common Stock (including the AmSouth  Stockholder
Rights) converted pursuant to this Section 1.4 shall no longer  be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall  cease
to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate previously 
representing any such shares of AmSouth Common Stock (the "OLD AMSOUTH 
CERTIFICATES") shall cease to represent any rights except the right to 
receive with respect to each underlying share of AmSouth Common Stock (i) a 
certificate representing the number of whole shares of Regions Common Stock 
into which the shares of AmSouth Common Stock represented by such Old 
AmSouth Certificate have been converted pursuant to this Section 1.4, (ii) 
in accordance with Section 1.4(c), cash in lieu of fractional shares of 
Regions Common Stock represented by such Old AmSouth Certificate which have 
been converted pursuant to this Section 1.4; and (iii) any dividends or 
distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to 
Section 2.1(a).   (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
each  holder of shares of AmSouth Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the
Merger  which would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a
share  of Regions Common Stock (after taking into account all Old AmSouth 
Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash 
(without interest and rounded to the nearest cent) in an amount equal to 
such fractional part of a share of Regions Common Stock multiplied by the 
closing sale price of Regions Common Stock on the NYSE Composite  Transaction
Tape on the trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date  as reported
by THE WALL STREET JOURNAL or, if not reported therein, in  another
authoritative source .   -2-    (d) If, following the date of this
Agreement and prior to the  Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Regions
Common Stock or AmSouth  Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased,
changed into or  exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or
securities as a  result of a reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, stock  dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other
similar change in  capitalization, then an appropriate and proportionate
adjustment shall be  made to the number of shares of Regions Common Stock
that each share of  AmSouth Common Stock shall represent the right to receive
upon conversion.   1.5 EFFECTS ON COMMON STOCK.   (a) At and after the
Effective Time, each share of Regions Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an issued and
outstanding share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall not
be affected by the Merger; provided that any shares of Regions Common Stock
held by AmSouth or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (other than
in a fiduciary or agency capacity or on behalf of third parties or as a
result of debts previously contracted) shall be cancelled and retired and
shall resume the status of authorized and unissued shares of Regions
Common Stock, and no shares of Regions Common Stock or other securities of
Regions shall be issued in respect thereof.   (b) Each of the shares of
AmSouth Common Stock held by either Party (in each case other than in a
fiduciary or agency capacity or on behalf of third parties as a result of
debts previously contracted) shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist at the Effective Time and no consideration shall be issued in
exchange therefor.   1.6 AMSOUTH STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER EQUITY-BASED
AWARDS.   (a) Each option to purchase shares of AmSouth Common Stock
(an "AMSOUTH STOCK OPTION") granted under an equity or equity-based
compensation plan of AmSouth (an "AMSOUTH STOCK PLAN"), whether vested or
unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease, at the Effective Time, to represent a right to
acquire shares of AmSouth Common Stock and shall be converted at the
Effective Time, without any action on the part of any holder of any AmSouth
Stock Option, into an option to purchase a share of Regions Common Stock (a
"REGIONS STOCK OPTION") on the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under such AmSouth Stock Option (but taking into account any changes thereto,
including any acceleration thereof, provided for in the relevant AmSouth
Stock Plan, or in the related award document by reason of the transactions
contemplated hereby). The number of shares of Regions Common Stock subject to
each such Regions Stock Option shall be equal to the number of shares of
AmSouth Common Stock subject to each such AmSouth Stock Option multiplied by
the Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of
Regions Common Stock, and such Regions Stock Option shall have an exercise
price per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the per share exercise
price specified in such AmSouth Stock Option divided by the Exchange Ratio;
provided that, in the case of any AmSouth Stock Option to which Section 421
of the Internal Revenue Code applies as of the Effective Time (after
taking into account the effect of any accelerated vesting thereof, if
applicable) by reason of its qualification under Section 422 or Section 423
of the Internal   -3-   Revenue Code, the exercise price, the number of
shares of Regions Common Stock subject to such option and the terms and
conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in a manner
consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code; provided, further, that, in the case of any AmSouth Stock Option to
which Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code applies as of the Effective
Time, the exercise price, the number of shares of Regions Common Stock
subject to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such
option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements
of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.   (b) At the Effective Time,
each Right consisting of, based on or relating to shares of AmSouth Common
Stock granted under an AmSouth Stock Plan, other than AmSouth Stock Options
(each, an "AMSOUTH STOCK-BASED AWARD"), whether contingent or accrued, which
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease, at the
Effective Time, to represent a Right with respect to shares of AmSouth Common
Stock and shall be converted without any action on the part of any holder of
a Right, at the Effective Time, into a Right consisting of, based on or
relating to shares of Regions Common Stock granted under a Regions Stock
Plan, other than Regions Stock Options (each, a "REGIONS STOCK-BASED AWARD"),
on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the AmSouth Stock-
Based Awards (but taking into account any changes thereto, including any
acceleration thereof, provided for in the relevant AmSouth Stock Plan or in
the related award document by reason of the transactions
contemplated hereby). The number of shares of Regions Common Stock subject to
each such Regions Stock-Based Award shall be equal to the number of shares of
AmSouth Common Stock subject to the AmSouth Stock-Based Award multiplied by
the Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of
Regions Common Stock and, if applicable, such Regions Stock-Based Award shall
have an exercise price per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the
per share exercise price specified in the AmSouth Stock-Based Award divided
by the Exchange Ratio. Any dividend equivalents credited to the account of
each holder of an AmSouth Stock-Based Award as of the Effective Time shall
remain credited to such holder\'s account immediately following the Effective
Time, subject to adjustment in accordance with the foregoing.   (c) As soon
as practicable after the Effective Time, Regions shall deliver to the holders
of AmSouth Stock Options and AmSouth Stock-Based Awards any required notices
setting forth such holders\' rights pursuant to the relevant AmSouth Stock
Plans and award documents and stating that such AmSouth Stock Options and
AmSouth Stock-Based Awards have been assumed by Regions and shall continue in
effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required
by this Section 1.6 after giving effect to the Merger and the terms of the
relevant AmSouth Stock Plans).   (d) Following the Effective Time, Regions
may maintain the AmSouth Stock Plans for purposes of granting future awards
in accordance with the NYSE rules. If so, the provisions of the AmSouth Stock
Plans, including the respective terms of such plans, will be unchanged,
except that (i) all Rights issued by Regions pursuant to the AmSouth Stock
Plans following the Effective Time shall be Rights in respect of Regions
Common Stock, (ii) all references to AmSouth (other than any references
relating to a "change in control" of AmSouth) in each AmSouth Stock Plan and
in each agreement evidencing any award thereunder shall be  
-4-   deemed to refer to Regions, unless Regions determines otherwise, and
(iii) the number of shares of Regions Common Stock available for future
issuance pursuant to each AmSouth Stock Plan following the Effective Time
(the "AVAILABLE AMSOUTH STOCK PLAN SHARES") shall be equal to the number of
shares of AmSouth Common Stock so available immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary, down
to the nearest whole share of Regions Common Stock.   (e) Prior to the
Effective Time, AmSouth shall take all necessary action for the adjustment of
AmSouth Stock Options and AmSouth Stock-Based Awards under this Section 1.6.
Regions shall reserve for future issuance a number of shares of Regions
Common Stock at least equal to the number of shares of Regions Common Stock
that will be subject to Regions Stock Options and Regions Stock-Based Awards
as a result of the actions contemplated by this Section 1.6, plus the number
of Available AmSouth Stock Plan Shares in the event that Regions maintains
the AmSouth Stock Plans as contemplated by this Section 1.6. As soon as
practicable following the Effective Time, Regions shall file a registration
statement on Form S-8 or S-3, as the case dictates (or any successor form, or
if Form S-8 or S-3 is not available, other appropriate forms), with respect
to the shares of Regions Common Stock subject to such Regions Stock Options
and Regions Stock-Based Awards (and the Available AmSouth Stock Plan Shares,
as the case dictates) and shall maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the
current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so
long as such Regions Stock Options and Regions Stock-Based Awards remain
outstanding.   (f) AmSouth shall take such action as is necessary to provide
that as of no later than three business days prior to the Closing Date no
further shares of AmSouth Common Stock will be purchased under the AmSouth
Direct Stock Purchase and Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "AMSOUTH DRIP");
provided, that such cessation of further purchases following the Closing Date
shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. Immediately prior
to and effective as of the Effective Time and subject to the consummation of
the Merger, AmSouth shall terminate the AmSouth DRIP.   1.7 CERTIFICATE OF
INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS. At the Effective Time, (1) the Regions Restated
Certificate of Incorporation shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable
law and (2) the Regions Bylaws, as amended in a manner consistent with
Section 4.17, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.   1.8 EFFECTS OF THE
MERGER. At and after the Effective Time, the merger shall have the effects
set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.   1.9 HEADQUARTERS. At the Effective
Time, the location of the corporate headquarters and of the principal
executive offices of the Surviving Corporation shall be the City of
Birmingham in the State of Alabama, United States of America.   -5-   
ARTICLE 2  EXCHANGE OF SHARES   2.1 EXCHANGE PROCEDURES.   (a) At or
prior to the Effective Time, Regions shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Old
AmSouth Certificates, for exchange in accordance with Article 1 and
this Article 2, certificates representing Regions Common Stock ("NEW
CERTIFICATES") (together with any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto and any cash to be paid hereunder in lieu of fractional shares of
Regions Common Stock (without any interest thereon), the "EXCHANGE FUND") to
be paid pursuant to Article 1 and this Article 2 in exchange for outstanding
shares of AmSouth Common Stock.   (b) As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, Regions shall send or cause to be sent to each former holder
of record of shares of AmSouth Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each, a "HOLDER"), transmittal materials for use in
exchanging such Holder\'s Old AmSouth Certificates for the consideration set
forth in Article 1 (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the certificates theretofore representing such
shares of AmSouth Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such
certificates to the Exchange Agent). Regions shall cause the New Certificates
for shares of Regions Common Stock into which shares of a Holder\'s AmSouth
Common Stock are converted at the Effective Time or dividends or
distributions which such Person shall be entitled to receive and any
fractional share interests to be delivered to such Person upon delivery
to the Exchange Agent of Old AmSouth Certificates representing such shares
of AmSouth Common Stock, together with the transmittal materials, duly
executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto. No
interest will accrue or be paid on any such cash to be paid pursuant to
Article 1 and this Article 2 upon such delivery. If any New Certificate is to
be issued or any cash payment is to be made in a name other than that in
which the Old AmSouth Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Person
requesting such exchange shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the issuance of such New Certificate or the making of such cash
payment in a name other than that of the registered Holder of the Old AmSouth
Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of Regions
and the Exchange Agent that any such Taxes have been paid or are not
applicable. Any Person who the Parties reasonably believe to be an
"affiliate" of AmSouth for purposes of Rule 145 of the 1933 Act shall not
be entitled to receive any New Certificate or payment pursuant to Article 1
or this Article 2 until such Person shall have duly executed and delivered
an appropriate agreement as described in Section 4.14.   (c)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Exchange Agent, any of the Parties
or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be liable to any former Holder
for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.   (d) If any Old AmSouth
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Old AmSouth Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Regions or the Exchange
Agent, the   -6-   posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as Regions or the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Old AmSouth
Certificate, Regions or the Exchange Agent shall, in exchange for the shares
of AmSouth Common Stock represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Old
AmSouth Certificate, issue or cause to be issued a New Certificate and pay or
cause to be paid the amounts, if any, deliverable in respect to the shares of
AmSouth Common Stock formerly represented by such Old AmSouth Certificate
pursuant to this Agreement.   (e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the Holders of AmSouth Common Stock for six months after
the Effective Time shall be returned to Regions (together with any dividends
or earnings in respect thereof). Any Holders of AmSouth Common Stock who have
not theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter be entitled to
look only to Regions, and only as a general creditor thereof, for payment of
the consideration deliverable in respect of each share of AmSouth Common
Stock such Holder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any
interest thereon.   (f) The Exchange Agent and Regions shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Regions
Common Stock, cash dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section
2.1(a) and any other cash amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Holder such amounts as the Exchange Agent or Regions, as the
case may be, is required to deduct and withhold under the Internal Revenue
Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law, with respect to
the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so withheld by the
Exchange Agent or Regions, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Holder
in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange
Agent or Regions, as the case may be.   2.2 RIGHTS OF HOLDERS. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of AmSouth shall be closed and no
transfer by any Holder shall thereafter be made or recognized. Until
surrendered for exchange in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.1 and
except as provided in this Section 2.2, each Old AmSouth Certificate (other
than shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.1(b)) shall, from and after
the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive the
consideration provided in Section 1.4, as the case may be, and any dividends
or any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time
which have been declared or made by AmSouth in respect of such shares of
AmSouth Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and which
remain unpaid at the Effective Time. To the extent permitted by Law, Holders
shall be entitled to vote after the Effective Time at any meeting of Regions
stockholders the number of whole shares of Regions Common Stock into which
their respective shares of AmSouth Common Stock are converted, regardless of
whether such Holders have exchanged their certificates representing
AmSouth Common Stock for New Certificates representing Regions Common Stock
in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, but beginning 60 days
after the Effective Time no such Holder shall be entitled to vote on any
matter until such Holder surrenders such Old AmSouth Certificate for exchange
as provided in Section 2.1. Whenever a dividend or other distribution is
declared by Regions on Regions Common Stock, the record date for which is at
or after the Effective Time, the declaration shall include dividends or other
distributions on all shares of Regions Common Stock   -7-   issuable
pursuant to this Agreement, but beginning 60 days after the Effective Time no
dividend or other distribution payable to the holders of record of Regions
Common Stock as of any time subsequent to the Effective Time shall
be delivered to the Holder of an Old AmSouth Certificate until such
Holder surrenders such Old AmSouth Certificate for exchange as provided in
Section 2.1. However, upon surrender of the Old AmSouth Certificate, both the
New Certificate, together with all such undelivered dividends or other
distributions (without interest) and any undelivered cash payments to be paid
for fractional share interests (without interest), shall be delivered and
paid with respect to each share represented by such New Certificate.  
ARTICLE 3  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES   3.1 DISCLOSURE LETTERS. Prior
to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, each Party has delivered to
the other Party a letter (its "DISCLOSURE LETTER") setting forth, among other
things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either in
response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof
or as an exception to one or more of such Party\'s representations or
warranties contained in Section 3.3 or to one or more of its covenants
contained in Article 4; provided, that (i) no such item is required to be set
forth in a Party\'s Disclosure Letter as an exception to any representation
or warranty of such Party if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect under
the standard established by Section 3.2, and (ii) the mere inclusion of an
item in a Party\'s Disclosure Letter as an exception to a representation or
warranty shall not be deemed an admission by that Party that such item
represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or that such
item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect with respect
to such Party. Any disclosures made with respect to a subsection of Section
3.3 shall be deemed to qualify (a) any subsections of Section 3.3
specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (b) other subsections of
Section 3.3 to the extent it is clear (notwithstanding the absence of a
specific cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such
disclosure (i) applies to such other subsections and (ii) contains sufficient
detail to enable a reasonable Person to recognize the relevance of such
disclosure to such other subsections.   3.2 STANDARDS.   (a) No
representation or warranty of any Party hereto contained in Section 3.3
(other than the representations and warranties in (i) Sections 3.3(b)(i),
3.3(c)(i) and (ii), and 3.3(r) which shall be true and correct in
all material respects with respect to it, and (ii) Sections 3.3(b)(ii)(A)
and 3.3(e)(ii) which shall be true and correct in all respects) shall be
deemed untrue or incorrect, and no Party hereto shall be deemed to have
breached a representation or warranty, as a consequence of the existence or
absence of any fact, circumstance or event unless such fact, circumstance or
event, individually or taken together with all other facts, circumstances or
events inconsistent with any representation or warranty contained in Section
3.3, has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
such Party.   (b) The term "MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT," as used with respect
to a Party, means an effect which (i) is materially adverse to the
business, properties, financial condition or results of operations of such
Party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) materially  
-8-   impairs the ability of such Party to consummate the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby on a timely basis; provided that, in
determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred, there shall be
excluded any effect to the extent attributable to or resulting from (A) any
changes in Laws, regulations or interpretations of Laws or regulations
generally affecting the banking, bank holding company or financial holding
company businesses, (B) any change in GAAP or regulatory accounting
requirements, generally affecting the banking, bank holding company or
financial holding company businesses, (C) events, conditions or trends in
economic, business or financial conditions generally affecting the banking,
bank holding company or financial holding company businesses specifically,
(D) changes in national or international political or social conditions
including the engagement by the United States in hostilities, whether or not
pursuant to the declaration of a national emergency or war, or the occurrence
of any military or terrorist attack upon or within the United States, or any
of its territories, possessions or diplomatic or consular offices or upon any
military installation, equipment or personnel of the United States, or due to
natural disasters, (E) the effects of the actions expressly permitted
or required by this Agreement or that are taken with the prior informed
written consent of the other Party in contemplation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (F) the announcement of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.   3.3 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF

as set forth in the relevant Disclosure Letter, Regions hereby represents and

extent applicable) in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction in
which it is organized. It, and each of its Subsidiaries, has the requisite

applicable) in good standing in the States of the United States and foreign
jurisdictions where the character of its assets or the nature or conduct of
its business requires it to be so qualified or licensed. It has made

Organizational Documents, each as amended to the date hereof and as in full
force and effect as of the date hereof. A true and complete list of its

state, local and foreign Tax Laws (including income, social security and

contribute" (as defined in ERISA Section 4212) nor have they ever had an 
obligation to contribute to a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in ERISA 
Sections 4001(a)(3) and 3(37)(A)). Each "employee pension benefit plan," as 
defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA, that was ever maintained by it or any of 
its Subsidiaries and that was intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of 
the Internal Revenue Code, is disclosed as such in Section 3.3(k) of its 
Disclosure Letter.   (ii) It has delivered or made available to the other
Party prior  to the date of this Agreement correct and complete copies of the
following  applicable documents: (A) all trust agreements or other funding 
arrangements for its Compensation and Benefit Plans (including insurance 
Contracts), and all amendments thereto (all such trust agreements and other 
funding arrangements are disclosed in Section 3.3(k) of its Disclosure 
Letter), (B) with respect to any such Compensation and Benefit Plans or

material opinion letters, material information letters, or  material advisory
opinions issued by the Internal Revenue Service, the  United States
Department of Labor, or the PBGC after December 31, 1994, (C)  annual reports
or returns, audited or unaudited financial statements,  actuarial valuations
and reports, and summary annual reports prepared for  any Compensation and

recent summary plan descriptions and any material  modifications thereto.  
(iii) All of its Compensation and Benefit Plans are in compliance  with the
applicable terms of ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code, and any  other
applicable Laws. Except as disclosed in Section 3.3(k) of its  Disclosure
Letter, each of its ERISA Plans which is intended to be  qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code has received a  favorable
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service covering  all Tax Law

its ERISA Plans has been  determined to be exempt from Tax under Section
501(a) of the Internal  Revenue Code and it is not aware of any circumstance
which will or could  reasonably result in revocation of such exemption. Any
voluntary employees\'  beneficiary association within the meaning of Section

Revenue Code,  and it is not aware of circumstances likely to result in the
loss of such  exempt status under Section 501(c)(9) of the Internal Revenue
Code. There  is no pending or, to its knowledge, threatened Litigation
relating to any  of its ERISA Plans.   -16-    (iv) Neither it nor any
of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a  transaction with respect to any of its
Compensation and Benefit Plans that,  assuming the Taxable Period of such
transaction expired as of the date of  this Agreement or the Effective Time,
would subject it or any of its  Subsidiaries to a Tax or penalty imposed by
either Section 4975 of the  Internal Revenue Code or Section 502(i) of
ERISA.   (v) Except as disclosed in Section 3.3(k) of its Disclosure 
Letter, each of its Pension Plans had, as of the date of its most recent 
actuarial valuation, assets measured at fair market value at least equal to 
its "current liability," as that term is defined in Section 302(d)(7) of 
ERISA. To its knowledge, since the date of the most recent actuarial 
valuation, no event has occurred which would adversely change any such 
funded status. None of its Pension Plans nor any "single-employer plan," 
within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently maintained by 
it or any of its Subsidiaries, or the single-employer plan of any entity 
which is considered one employer with it under Section 4001 of ERISA or 
Section 414 of the Internal Revenue Code (an "ERISA AFFILIATE") has an 
"accumulated funding deficiency" within the meaning of Section 412 of the 
Internal Revenue Code or Section 302 of ERISA (whether or not waived). All 
required contributions with respect to any of its Pension Plans or any 
single-employer plan of any of its ERISA Affiliates have been timely made 
and there is no lien, nor is there expected to be a lien, under Internal 
Revenue Code Section 412(n) or ERISA Section 302(f) or Tax under Internal 
Revenue Code Section 4971. Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has 
provided, or is required to provide, security to any of its Pension Plans  or
to any single-employer plan of any of its ERISA Affiliates pursuant to 
Section 401(a)(29) of the Internal Revenue Code.   (vi) No Liability under
Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected  to be incurred by it or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to any defined  benefit plan currently or formerly
maintained by any of them or by any of  its ERISA Affiliates that has not
been satisfied in full (other than  Liability for PBGC premiums, which have
been paid when due).   (vii) Except as disclosed in Section 3.3(k) of its
Disclosure  Letter, neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
obligations for  retiree health and retiree life benefits under any of its
Compensation and  Benefit Plans other than with respect to benefit coverage
mandated by  applicable Law. It or its subsidiaries may amend or terminate
any such plan  at any time without incurring any liability thereunder other
than in  respect of claims incurred prior to such amendment or
termination.   (viii) There has been no amendment to, announcement by it or
any  of its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation
or  coverage under, any Compensation and Benefit Plan which would increase
the  expense of maintaining such plan above the level of the expense
incurred  therefor for the most recent fiscal year. None of the execution
and  delivery of this Agreement or the Option Agreements, the stockholder 
approval of the transactions contemplated hereby or the consummation of the 
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (A) results in any payment or 
increase in payment (including severance, golden parachute, or otherwise), 
whether or not in conjunction with a termination of employment, becoming  due
to any director or any   -17-    employee of it or any of its
Subsidiaries from it or any of its  Subsidiaries under any of its
Compensation and Benefit Plans or otherwise,  (B)increases any benefits
otherwise payable under any of its Compensation  and Benefit Plans, (C)
results in any acceleration of the time of payment  or vesting or result in
any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or  otherwise) of any such
payment or benefit, (D) limits or restrict the right  of it to merge, amend
or terminate any of the Compensation and Benefit  Plans or (E) results in
payments under any Compensation and Benefit Plans  which would not be
deductible under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue  Code.   (l) MATERIAL
CONTRACTS.   (i) Except for Contracts reflected as exhibits to its SEC
Reports  filed prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of this 
Agreement, neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their 
respective assets, businesses, or operations, is a party to, or is bound or 
affected by, or receives benefits under, (A) any Contract relating to the 
borrowing of money by it or any of its Subsidiaries or the guarantee by it 
or any of its Subsidiaries of any such obligation (other than Contracts 
pertaining to fully-secured repurchase agreements, and trade payables, and 
Contracts relating to borrowings or guarantees made in the ordinary course 
of business), (B) any Contract containing covenants that limit the ability 
of it or any of its Subsidiaries to compete in any line of business or with

Contract that requires it or any of its Subsidiaries to  deal exclusively or
on a "sole source" basis with another party to such  Contract with respect to
the subject matter of such Contract, (C) any  Contract for, with respect to,

Contract or amendment thereto that would  be required to be filed as an
exhibit to any SEC Report (as described in  Items 601(b)(4) and 601(b)(10) of

(ii) the ability of any Person to exercise any AmSouth Shareholder Rights

their Representatives, in the preparation of the Registration Statement and
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Neither the Joint Proxy

shall become aware prior to the Effective Time of any information furnished
by it that would cause any of the statements in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement to be false or misleading

necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly
inform the other Party thereof and to take the necessary steps to correct the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement.   (c)

issuance, as promptly as practicable, and in any event before the Effective

filed with all Governmental Authorities and copies of written communications
received by such Party from any Governmental Authorities with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each Party agrees that it will consult with
the other Party with respect to the obtaining of all Regulatory Consents and
other material Consents advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated

Party will give prompt notice to the other Party (and subsequently keep the
other Party informed on a current basis) upon its becoming aware of the
occurrence or existence of any fact, event or circumstance that (a) is
reasonably likely to result in any Material Adverse Effect on it, or (b)
would cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants, or agreements contained herein; provided, that any
failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any
breach shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 4.8 or
the failure of any condition set forth in Sections 5.2(b) or 5.3(b) to be
satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the Party
failing to give such notice, in each case unless the underlying breach would
independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in
Section 5.2(a), 5.2(b), 5.3(a) or 5.3(b), to be satisfied or give rise to
such termination right.   4.9 INVESTIGATION AND CONFIDENTIALITY.   (a)
Each Party shall permit the other Party to make or cause to be made such
investigation of the business and Properties of it and its Subsidiaries and
of their respective financial and legal conditions as the other Party
reasonably requests; provided, that such investigation shall be
reasonably related to the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not
interfere unnecessarily with normal operations; and provided further, that
neither Party nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to
provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure
would jeopardize the attorney-client or other privilege with respect to such
information or contravene any Law, Order, or Contract and the Parties will
use their reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements, to the extent practicable, in circumstances in which the
restrictions of this proviso apply. No investigation by a Party shall affect
the representations and warranties of the other Party.   (b) Each Party
shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, maintain the confidentiality
of all confidential information or Evaluation Material furnished to it by the
other Party concerning its and its Subsidiaries\' businesses, operations, and
financial positions to the extent required by, and in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, and shall not use such information for any purpose
except in furtherance of the transactions contemplated by this  
-26-   Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective
Time, each Party shall promptly return or certify the destruction of all
documents and copies and extracts thereof, and all work papers containing
confidential information received from the other Party.   4.10 PRESS

contemplated hereby prior to issuing such press release or public statement
or making any other public disclosure related thereto (including any broad-
based employee communication that is reasonably likely to become the subject
of public disclosure); provided, that nothing in this Section 4.10 shall be
deemed to prohibit any Party from making any disclosure necessary in order
to satisfy such Party\'s disclosure obligations imposed by Law or the NYSE or
any other self-regulatory organization.   4.11 ACQUISITION PROPOSALS.  
(a) Each Party agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and
its and its Subsidiaries\' officers, directors, Representatives and
Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit,
encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to,
(ii) engage or participate in any negotiations concerning, or (iii) provide
any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have, or engage or
participate in, any discussions with, any Person relating to, any Acquisition
Proposal; provided that, in the event either Party receives an unsolicited
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal with respect to such Party, such Party
may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries\'
Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information or
data and participate in such negotiations or discussions to the extent that
the Board of Directors of such Party concludes in good faith (after receiving
the advice of its outside counsel and its financial advisors) that failure to
take such actions would result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; provided further that, prior to providing any nonpublic
information permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso, it
shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on
terms no less favorable to it than those of the Confidentiality Agreement.
Each Party will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities,
discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with
any Persons other than AmSouth or Regions, as the case dictates, with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal. Each Party will promptly (within one day) advise
the other Party following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry
which could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and
the substance thereof (including the identity of the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal), and will keep the other Party apprised of any related
developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis. Each of the
Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any existing
confidentiality or standstill agreements to which it or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with the terms thereof.   (b)
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent a Party or its Board of
Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the 1934 Act
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; provided, that such Rules will in no
way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such
Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.   -27-    4.12 TAKEOVER
LAWS; NO RIGHTS TRIGGERED. If any Takeover Law may become, or may purport to
be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Option
Agreements, each Party and the members of their respective Boards
of Directors will grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary (other than any action requiring the approval of its stockholders
(other than as contemplated by Section 4.5)) so that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and by the Option Agreements may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
thereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any
Takeover Law on any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by
the Option Agreements. AmSouth shall take all action necessary to ensure
that, so long as this Agreement shall not have been terminated pursuant to
the terms hereof, that no Person shall become able to exercise any rights
under the AmSouth Rights Plan or enable or require the AmSouth Shareholder
Rights to separate from the shares of AmSouth Common Stock to which they are
attached or to be triggered or become exercisable or unredeemable as a result
of entering into this Agreement or consummating the transactions contemplated
hereby. The Parties agree that none of AmSouth\'s representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be inaccurate, untrue or breached in any respect for any purpose as
a result of the redemption of the AmSouth Shareholder Rights with the prior
written consent of Regions.   4.13 EXEMPTION FROM LIABILITY UNDER SECTION
16(B). Regions and AmSouth agree that, in order to most effectively
compensate and retain AmSouth Insiders (as defined below) in connection with
the Merger, both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that
AmSouth Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of
the 1934 Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in connection
with the conversion of shares of AmSouth Common Stock into shares of Regions
Common Stock in the Merger and the conversion of AmSouth Stock Options and
AmSouth Stock-Based Awards into Regions Stock Options or Regions Stock-Based
Awards in the Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purposes agree
to the provisions of this Section 4.13. Assuming AmSouth delivers to Regions
in a reasonably timely fashion prior to the Effective Time accurate
information regarding those officers and directors of AmSouth subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act (the "AMSOUTH
INSIDERS"), the number of shares of AmSouth Common Stock to be held by each
such AmSouth Insider expected to be exchanged for Regions Common Stock in the
Merger, and the number and description of AmSouth Stock Options and AmSouth
Stock-Based Awards held by each such AmSouth Insider and expected to
be converted into Regions Stock Options or Regions Stock-Based Awards, the
Board of Directors of Regions, or a committee of non-employee directors
thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the 1934
Act), shall reasonably promptly thereafter, and in any event prior to the
Effective Time, adopt a resolution providing in substance that the receipt by
the AmSouth Insiders of Regions Common Stock in exchange for shares of
AmSouth Common Stock, and of Regions Stock Options upon conversion of AmSouth
Stock Options, or Regions Stock-Based Awards upon conversion of AmSouth
Stock-Based Awards, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, are approved by such Board of Directors or by such committee
thereof, and are intended to be exempt from Liability pursuant to Section
16(b) of the 1934 Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law.  
-28-    4.14 AGREEMENT OF AFFILIATES. AmSouth shall use its reasonable
efforts to cause each Person whom it reasonably believes may be deemed an
"affiliate" of AmSouth, for purposes of Rule 145 under the 1933 Act, to
deliver to Regions not later than the Effective Time, a written agreement in
substantially the form of Exhibit 2.   4.15 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND
CONTRACTS.   (a) Following the Effective Time, Regions at its election shall
either provide generally to officers and employees of AmSouth and its
Subsidiaries, who at or after the Effective Time become employees of Regions
or its Subsidiaries ("AMSOUTH CONTINUING EMPLOYEES"), employee benefits under
Compensation and Benefit Plans maintained by Regions, on terms and conditions
which are the same as for similarly situated officers and employees of
Regions and its Subsidiaries, or (ii) maintain for the benefit of the AmSouth
Continuing Employees, the Compensation and Benefit Plans maintained by
AmSouth immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that Regions may
amend any Compensation and Benefit Plan maintained by AmSouth immediately
prior to the Effective Time to comply with any Law or as necessary and
appropriate for other business reasons. For purposes of this Section 4.15,
Compensation and Benefit Plans maintained by Regions or AmSouth are deemed to
include Compensation and Benefit Plans maintained by their respective
Subsidiaries. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Regions
and AmSouth shall cooperate in reviewing, evaluating and analyzing the

respect to any plan in which such credit would result in a duplication of

applicable Law, Regions shall cause welfare Compensation and Benefit Plans
maintained by Regions that cover the AmSouth Continuing Employees after the
Effective Time to (i) waive any waiting period and restrictions and

were applicable, under welfare Compensation and Benefit Plans maintained
by AmSouth), and (ii) cause any deductible, co-insurance, or maximum out-of-
pocket payments made by the AmSouth Continuing Employees under welfare
Compensation and Benefit Plans maintained by AmSouth to be credited to such
Continuing Employees under welfare Compensation and Benefit Plans maintained
by Regions, so as to reduce the amount of any deductible, co-insurance, or
maximum out-of-pocket payments payable by such AmSouth Continuing Employees
under welfare Compensation and Benefit Plans maintained by Regions.   (c)
Nothing in this Section 4.15 shall be interpreted as preventing Regions, from
and after the Effective Time, from amending, modifying or terminating any
Compensation and Benefit Plans maintained by Regions, Compensation and
Benefit Plans maintained by   -29-   AmSouth, or other Contracts,
arrangements, commitments or understandings, in accordance with their terms
and applicable Law.   4.16 INDEMNIFICATION.   (a) From and after the
Effective Time, in the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding, or investigation, whether civil, criminal, or administrative, in
which any Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of
this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or
officer of AmSouth or any of its Subsidiaries (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") is,
or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising
in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a
director, officer, or employee of AmSouth, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of
its predecessors, or (ii)this Agreement, the Option Agreements or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether in any case asserted or
arising before or after the Effective Time, Regions shall indemnify and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law each such

extent permitted by Law upon receipt of any undertaking required
by applicable Law), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding, or investigation.   (b) Regions agrees that all rights to
indemnification and all limitations on Liability existing in favor of the
directors, officers, and employees of AmSouth and its Subsidiaries (the
"COVERED PARTIES") as provided in their respective Organizational Documents

agreement in existence on the date of this Agreement with AmSouth or its
Subsidiaries and disclosed in AmSouth\'s Disclosure Letter with respect to
matters occurring prior to the Effective Time shall survive the Merger and
shall continue in full force and effect, and shall be honored by such
entities or their respective successors as if they were the indemnifying
party thereunder, without any amendment thereto; provided, that nothing
contained in this Section 4.16(b) shall be deemed to preclude
any liquidation, consolidation, or merger after the Effective Time of any
AmSouth Subsidiaries, in which case all of such rights to indemnification
and limitations on Liability shall be deemed to so survive and
continue notwithstanding any such liquidation, consolidation, or merger.
Without limiting the foregoing, in any case in which approval by Regions is
required to effectuate any indemnification, Regions shall direct, at the
election of the Indemnified Party, that the determination of any such
approval shall be made by independent counsel mutually agreed upon between
Regions and the Indemnified Party.   (c) Regions, from and after the
Effective Time, will directly or indirectly cause the Persons who served as

Effective Time which were committed by such officers and directors in their
capacity as such; provided, that (i) Regions may substitute therefor policies
of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions
which are not less advantageous than such policy, (ii) in no event shall
Regions be required to expend more than 250% per year of coverage of the
amount currently expended by AmSouth per year of coverage as of the date of
this Agreement (the "MAXIMUM AMOUNT") to   -30-   maintain or procure
insurance coverage pursuant hereto, and (iii) if notwithstanding the use of
reasonable best efforts to do so, Regions is unable to maintain or obtain the
insurance called for by this Section 4.16(c), Regions shall obtain as much
comparable insurance as available for the Maximum Amount. Such insurance
coverage shall commence at the Effective Time and will be provided for a
period of no less than six years after the Effective Time.   (d) Any
Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section 4.16(a),
upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
described above, shall promptly notify Regions thereof; provided that the
failure so to notify shall not affect the obligations of Regions
under Section 4.16(a) unless and to the extent that Regions is prejudiced as
a result of such failure.   (e) The provisions of this Section 4.16 are
intended to be for the benefit of and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.   4.17
