iv This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is dated as of May

and Lake Sunapee Bank Group, a Delaware corporation ("LSBG").

 

 _WITNESSETH_

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of BHB and the Board of Directors of LSBG have
each (i) determined that this Agreement and the business combination and
related transactions contemplated hereby are in the best interests of their
respective entities and shareholders; (ii) determined that this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby are consistent with and in furtherance
of their respective business strategies; and (iii) approved this Agreement;

WHEREAS, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, LSBG will merge with
and into BHB, and BHB shall be the surviving entity (the "Merger");

WHEREAS, as a material inducement to BHB to enter into this Agreement, each
of the directors and certain executive officers of LSBG have entered into a
voting agreement with BHB dated as of the date hereof (a "Voting Agreement"),
substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ , pursuant to which
each such director or executive officer has agreed, among other things, to
vote all shares of LSBG Common Stock (as defined herein) owned by such person
in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in such
agreement;

 

WHEREAS, the parties intend for the Merger to qualify as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code"), and that this Agreement be and hereby is adopted as a
"plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 354 and 361 of the
Code; and

 

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the transactions described in this Agreement
and to prescribe certain conditions thereto.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein contained and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER 

_Section 1.01_ _Terms of the Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, LSBG shall merge with and into BHB,
and BHB shall be the surviving entity (hereinafter sometimes referred to as
the "Surviving Corporation") and shall continue to be governed by the laws of
the State of Maine and its name and separate corporate existence, with all of
its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue
unaffected by the Merger. As part of the Merger, shares of LSBG Common Stock
shall, at the Effective Time, be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to the terms of Article II.

_Section 1.02_ _Bank Merger_. Concurrently with or as soon as practicable
after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Bar Harbor Bank and Trust
("Bar Harbor Bank"), a wholly owned subsidiary of BHB, and Lake Sunapee Bank,
fsb ("Lake Sunapee Bank"), a wholly owned subsidiary of LSBG, shall enter
into the Plan of Bank Merger (the "Plan of Bank Merger"), substantially in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit B, pursuant to which Lake Sunapee Bank will
merge with and into Bar Harbor Bank, and Bar Harbor Bank shall be the
surviving institution (the "Bank Merger"). The parties intend that the Bank
Merger will become effective simultaneously with or immediately following the
Effective Time.

 



1 _Section 1.03_ _Tax Consequences_ _._ It is intended that the Merger
shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code, and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" as
that term is used in Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. From and after the
date of this Agreement and until the Closing, each party hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify, and will not knowingly
take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any action or
cause any action to fail to be taken, which action or failure to act would
reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. LSBG and BHB each hereby
agree to deliver a certificate substantially in compliance with IRS published
advance ruling guidelines, with customary exceptions and modifications
thereto, to enable its counsel to deliver the legal opinion contemplated by
Section 6.01(e).

 

 _Section 1.04_ _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The Articles of
Incorporation, as amended, of BHB, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law. The
Amended and Restated Bylaws of BHB, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.

 

 _Section 1.05_ _Directors of Surviving Corporation After Effective Time_.
Subject to Section 5.18, immediately after the Effective Time, until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, the
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall consist of the directors of BHB
serving immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

 _Section 1.06_ _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of
the Merger shall be as provided under the Maine Business Corporation Act (the
"MBCA"), and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, the
separate corporate existence of LSBG shall cease and all of the rights,
privileges, powers, franchises, properties, assets, debts, liabilities,
obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of LSBG shall be vested in
and assumed by BHB.

 

 _Section 1.07_ _Effective Date and Effective Time; Closing_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, BHB will make all
such filings as may be required to consummate the Merger by applicable laws
and regulations. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the
Articles of Merger are duly filed with the Secretary of the State of Maine or
at such later date or time as BHB and LSBG agree and specify in the Articles
of Merger (the date and time the Merger becomes effective being the
"Effective Time").

(b) The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at 10:00 a.m.,
Eastern time on the Closing Date (as defined below), at the principal offices
of KandL Gates LLP in Boston, MA, or such other place or at such other time on
the Closing Date as the parties may mutually agree upon. At the Closing,
there shall be delivered to BHB and LSBG the certificates and other documents
required to be delivered under Article VI hereof. Subject to the satisfaction
or waiver of all conditions to closing contained in Article VI hereof, the
Closing shall occur no later than ten Business Days following the latest to
occur of (i) the receipt of all Regulatory Approvals, and the expiration of
any applicable waiting periods, (ii) the approval of the Merger by the

the part of the holder thereof, each share of LSBG Common Stock issued and
outstanding at the Effective Time, other than Excluded Shares, shall become
and be converted into, as provided in and subject to the limitations
set forth in this Agreement, the right to receive 0.4970 shares (the

satisfactory to BHB and LSBG shall be mailed as soon as practicable, but in
no event later than five Business Days after the Closing Date, after the
Effective Time to each holder of record of LSBG Common Stock as of the
Effective Time. A Letter of Transmittal will be deemed properly completed
only if accompanied by certificates representing all shares of LSBG Common
Stock ("Certificate(s)") to be converted thereby.

 

(b) At and after the Effective Time, each Certificate shall represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, BHB shall (i) reserve for issuance with its
transfer agent and registrar a sufficient number of shares of BHB Common
Stock to provide for payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.07 and (ii) deposit, or cause to be deposited, with American Stock
Transfer and Trust Company, LLC (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the
holders of shares of LSBG Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this
Section 2.06, an amount of cash sufficient to pay any cash in lieu of
Fractional Shares pursuant to Section 2.03.

 

(d) The Letter of Transmittal shall (i) specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, (ii) be in a form and
contain any other provisions as are reasonably satisfactory to LSBG and BHB
and (iii) include instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon the proper
surrender of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly
completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal, the holder of such
Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate
representing that number of whole shares of BHB Common Stock that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.01, and a check in the amount
equal to the cash in lieu of Fractional Shares, if any, that such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.03, and any dividends or other
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Section 2.06.
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. As soon as
practicable following receipt of the properly completed Letter of Transmittal
and any necessary accompanying documentation, the Exchange Agent shall
distribute BHB Common Stock and cash as provided herein. The Exchange
Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with
respect to the shares of BHB Common Stock held by it from time to time
hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or other
distributions paid or distributed with respect to such shares for the account
of the persons entitled thereto. If there is a transfer of ownership of any
shares of LSBG Common Stock not registered in the transfer records of LSBG,
the Merger Consideration shall be issued to the transferee thereof if the
Certificates representing such LSBG Common Stock are presented to the Exchange
Agent, accompanied by all documents required, in the reasonable judgment of
BHB and the Exchange Agent, to evidence and effect such transfer and to
evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.

(e) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective
Time with respect to BHB Common Stock issued pursuant to this Agreement shall
be remitted to any person entitled to receive shares of BHB Common Stock
hereunder until such person surrenders his or her Certificates in accordance
with this Section 2.06. Upon the surrender of such persons Certificates,
such person shall be entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions,
without interest thereon, which subsequent to the Effective Time had become
payable but not paid with respect to shares of BHB Common Stock represented
by such persons Certificates.

(f) The stock transfer books of LSBG shall be closed immediately upon the
Effective Time and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer records of LSBG of any shares of LSBG Common
Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to BHB, they
shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with the procedures
set forth in this Section 2.06.

 

(g) Any portion of the aggregate amount of cash to be paid pursuant to Section
2.03, any dividends or other distributions to be paid pursuant to this
Section 2.06 or any proceeds from any investments thereof that remains
unclaimed by the shareholders of LSBG for nine months after the Effective Time
shall be repaid by the Exchange Agent to BHB upon the written request of
BHB. After such request is made, any shareholders of LSBG who have not
theretofore complied with this Section 2.06 shall look only to BHB for the
Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of Fractional Shares, if any,
deliverable in respect of each share of LSBG Common Stock such shareholder
holds, as determined pursuant to Section 2.06 of this Agreement, without any
interest thereon. If

 



4  outstanding Certificates are not surrendered prior to the date on which such
payments would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental
unit or agency, the unclaimed items shall, to the extent permitted by any
abandoned property, escheat or other applicable laws, become the property of
BHB (and, to the extent not in its possession, shall be paid over to it), free
and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled to such
claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any
party to this Agreement (or any affiliate thereof) shall be liable to any
former holder of LSBG Common Stock for any amount delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws.

(h) BHB and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon LSBGs stock
transfer books to establish the identity of those persons entitled to receive
the Merger Consideration, which books shall be conclusive with respect
thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of stock
represented by any Certificate, BHB and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled
to deposit any Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of Fractional Shares, if
any, represented thereby in escrow with an independent third party and
thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims thereto.

(i) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Exchange Agent or BHB,
the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as the Exchange Agent may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration and cash
in lieu of Fractional Shares, if any, deliverable in respect thereof pursuant
to Section 2.03.

_Section 2.07_ _Reservation of Shares_. Effective upon the date of this
Agreement, BHB shall reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of
the BHB Common Stock for the purpose of issuing shares of BHB Common Stock to
LSBG shareholders in accordance with this Article II.

 

 _Section 2.08_ _Listing of Additional Shares_. Prior to the Effective Time,
BHB shall notify NYSE of the additional shares of BHB Common Stock to be
issued by BHB in exchange for the shares of LSBG Common Stock.

_Section 2.09_ _Effect on Outstanding Shares of BHB Common Stock_. At the
Effective Time, each share of BHB Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall not be affected
by the Merger.

_Section 3.18_ _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) All benefit and compensation plans, contracts, policies or arrangements
covering current or former employees of LSBG (the "LSBG Employees") and
current or former directors of LSBG including, but not limited to, "employee
benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of LSBG, and deferred
compensation, stock option, stock purchase, stock appreciation rights, stock
based, incentive and bonus plans (the "LSBG Benefit Plans"), are identified in
_LSBG Disclosure Schedule 3.18(a)_. True and complete copies of all LSBG
Benefit Plans including, but not limited to, any trust instruments and
insurance contracts forming a part of any LSBG Benefit Plans and all
amendments thereto, have been provided to BHB. With

 



10  respect to the LSBG Benefit Plans, true and complete copies of the following
have been provided to BHB, where applicable: (i) a copy of the most recent
determination, opinion or advisory letter from the Internal Revenue Service,
(ii) a copy of the three most recently filed Forms 5500 and summary annual

valuations and reports for the three most recently completed plan years, and
(iv) copies of material notices, letters or other correspondence from any

correction or similar program sponsored by any Governmental Authority. Except

terminate any such LSBG Benefit Plan at any time without incurring any
material liability thereunder.

(b) Each LSBG Benefit Plan covering LSBG Employees are in substantial
compliance with its terms and all applicable laws (including ERISA, the Code,
and the Affordable Care Act). Each LSBG Benefit Plan which is an "employee
pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "LSBG
Pension Plan") and which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code, has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS, and to
the Knowledge of LSBG, there are no circumstances likely to result in
revocation of any such favorable determination letter or the loss of the
qualification of such LSBG Pension Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code.
There is no pending or, to LSBGs Knowledge, threatened investigation, audit,
or litigation relating to the LSBG Benefit Plans. LSBG has not engaged in
a transaction with respect to any LSBG Benefit Plan or LSBG Pension Plan
that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as of the date
hereof, could subject LSBG to a material tax or penalty imposed by either
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA.

(c) No LSBG Pension Plan is an "employee stock ownership plan" (as defined
in Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code). Except as identified in _LSBG Disclosure
Schedule 3.18(c)_ , neither LSBG nor or any entity which is considered one
employer with LSBG under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code
(a "LSBG ERISA Affiliate") has ever sponsored a LSBG Pension Plan that is
subject to Title IV of ERISA. Neither LSBG nor any LSBG ERISA Affiliate has
ever sponsored or contributed to any "multiemployer plan," as defined
in Section 3(37) of ERISA or "multiple employer plan," as defined in Section
4063 of ERISA. No liability to any Governmental Entity, other than PBGC
premiums arising in the ordinary course of business, has been or is expected
by LSBG or any Subsidiary with respect to any LSBG Benefit Plan which is
subject to Title IV of ERISA ("LSBG Defined Benefit Plan") currently or
formerly maintained by LSBG or any LSBG ERISA Affiliate. No notice of a
"reportable event," within the meaning of Section of ERISA for which the
30-day reporting requirement has not been waived, has been required to be
filed for any LSBG Defined Benefit Plan or by any LSBG ERISA Affiliate within
the 12 month period ending on the date hereof or will be required to be filed
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No LSBG
Defined Benefit Plan or single-employer plan of any LSBG ERISA Affiliate has
an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the
meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and no ERISA
Affiliate has an outstanding funding waiver. LSBG has not provided, and is not
required to provide, security to any LSBG Defined Benefit Plan or to any
single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of
the Code. No complete or partial termination of any LSBG Defined Benefit Plan
has occurred or is expected to occur. Neither LSBG nor any LSBG ERISA
Affiliate has ever contributed to, sponsored or maintained any "multiple
employer welfare arrangement" within the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA.

 

(d) All material contributions required to be made under the terms of any LSBG
Benefit Plan and applicable law have been timely made, and all anticipated
contributions and funding obligations are accrued on LSBGs consolidated
financial statements to the extent required by GAAP. LSBG and its Subsidiaries
have expensed and accrued as a liability the present value of future
benefits under each applicable LSBG Benefit Plan for financial reporting
purposes as required by GAAP.

(e) Other than as set forth in _LSBG Disclosure Schedule 3.18(e)_ , none of
LSBG or any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations for retiree health and
life benefits under any LSBG Benefit Plan, other than coverage as may be
required under Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA, or
under the continuation of coverage provisions of the laws of any state or
locality.

 



11 (f) Other than as set forth in _LSBG Disclosure Schedule 3.18(f)_ , the
execution of this Agreement, shareholder approval of this Agreement or
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either
alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) will not
(i) entitle any LSBG Employees to severance pay or any increase in severance
pay upon any termination of employment after the date hereof, (ii) accelerate
the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or funding (through a
grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the
amount payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, any of
the LSBG Benefit Plans, (iii) result in any breach or violation of, or a
default under, any of the LSBG Benefit Plans, (iv) result in any payment that
would be a "parachute payment" to a "disqualified individual" as those terms
are defined in Section 280G of the Code, without regard to whether such
payment is reasonable compensation for personal services performed or to be
performed in the future, (v) limit or restrict the right of LSBG, or after the
consummation of the transactions contemplated herby, BHB or Surviving
Corporation, to merge amend, or terminate any of the LSBG Benefit Plans,
or (vi) result in payments that would not be deductible under Section 162(m)
of the Code. _LSBG Disclosure Schedule 3.18(f)_ contains a schedule showing
the present value of the monetary amounts payable as of the date specified in
such schedule, whether individually or in the aggregate (including good faith
estimates of all amounts not subject to precise quantification as of the date
of this Agreement), under certain employment, change-in-control, severance and
similar contracts, plans and arrangements with or which cover any present or
former director, officer or employee of LSBG who are entitled to any such
amount and identifying the types and estimated amounts of the in-kind benefits
due under any LSBG Benefit Plans (other than a plan qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code) for each such person, specifying the assumptions in such
schedule and providing estimates of other related fees or expenses.

 

(g) Each LSBG Benefit Plan that is a deferred compensation plan and any
deferral elections thereunder are in compliance with the terms of the plan
and the operational and documentary requirements Section 409A of the Code, to
the extent applicable. Other than as disclosed on _LSBG Disclosure Schedule
3.18(g)_ , LSBG does not have any obligation to gross up, indemnify or
otherwise reimburse any individual for any excise taxes, interest or
penalties incurred under Section 409A or Section 4999 of the Code.

 

(h) Each LSBG Restricted Share Award (i) was granted in compliance with all

pursuant to which it was issued, (ii) has a grant date identical to the date
on which the LSBG Board or the LSBGs compensation committee actually awarded
it, (iii) is exempt from the Section 409A of the Code, and (iv) qualifies for
the tax and accounting treatment afforded to such award in the LSBG Tax
Returns and the LSBG Financial Statements, respectively.

collective bargaining agreement, contract or other agreement or understanding
with a labor union or labor organization, nor is LSBG or any of its
Subsidiaries the subject of a proceeding asserting that it has committed an
unfair labor practice (within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act,
as amended) or seeking to compel LSBG or any of its Subsidiaries to bargain
with any labor organization as to wages or conditions of employment, nor is

none of LSBG or any of its Subsidiaries has received a written notice of, or
otherwise has Knowledge of any, default or termination with respect to any
Lease. There has not occurred any event and no condition exists that would
constitute a termination event or a material breach by LSBG or any of its

the performance of any covenant, agreement or condition contained in any

LSBG Intellectual Property, is valid and enforceable and has not been
cancelled, forfeited, expired or abandoned, and none of LSBG or any of
its Subsidiaries has received notice challenging the validity or
enforceability of LSBG Intellectual Property. To the Knowledge of LSBG, the
conduct of the business of LSBG and its Subsidiaries does not violate,

Effective Time, (ii) take any action reasonably likely to result in any of

advisable under applicable laws, so as to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, and otherwise to
enable consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article VI hereof,
and shall cooperate fully with the other parties hereto to that end.

 



30 _Section 5.04_ _Shareholder Approval_.

 

(a) BHB agrees to take, in accordance with applicable law, the Articles of
Incorporation, as amended, and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of BHB, all
action necessary to convene a special meeting of its shareholders to consider
and vote upon the approval of this Agreement and any other matters required to
be approved by BHBs shareholders in order to permit consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any adjournment or
postponement, the "BHB Meeting") and, subject to Section 5.08, shall take all
lawful action to solicit such approval by such shareholders. BHB agrees to use
its reasonable best efforts to convene the BHB Meeting within thirty-five
(35) days after the initial mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to
shareholders of BHB pursuant to Section 5.05, and in any event shall convene
the BHB Meeting within forty-five (45) days after such mailing. Except for
matters that would ordinarily be considered at BHBs annual meeting of
shareholders or with the prior approval of LSBG, no other matters shall be
submitted for the approval of BHB shareholders at the BHB Meeting. The BHB
Board shall at all times prior to and during the BHB Meeting recommend
adoption of this Agreement by the shareholders of BHB and shall not withhold,
withdraw, amend or modify such recommendation in any manner or take any other
action or make any other public statement inconsistent with such
recommendation.

(b) LSBG agrees to take, in accordance with applicable law, the Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of
LSBG, all action necessary to convene a special meeting of its shareholders to
consider and vote upon the approval of this Agreement and any other matters
required to be approved by LSBGs shareholders in order to permit consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any adjournment
or postponement, the "LSBG Meeting") and, subject to Section 5.08, shall take
all lawful action to solicit such approval by such shareholders. LSBG agrees
to use its reasonable best efforts to convene the LSBG Meeting within thirty-
five (35) days after the initial mailing of the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to shareholders of LSBG pursuant to Section 5.05, and in
any event shall convene the LSBG Meeting within forty-five (45) days after
such mailing. Except for matters that would ordinarily be considered
at LSBGs annual meeting of shareholders or with the prior approval of BHB,
no other matters shall be submitted for the approval of LSBG shareholders at
the LSBG Meeting. The LSBG Board shall at all times prior to and during the
LSBG Meeting recommend adoption of this Agreement by the shareholders of LSBG
(the "LSBG Recommendation") and shall not withhold, withdraw, amend or modify
such recommendation in any manner adverse to BHB or take any other action or
make any other public statement inconsistent with such recommendation, except
as and to the extent expressly permitted by Section 5.11 (a "Change in
Recommendation"). Notwithstanding any Change in Recommendation, this Agreement
shall be submitted to the shareholders of LSBG for their approval at the LSBG
Meeting and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve LSBG of such
obligation (unless and until this agreement is terminated in accordance with
Section 7.01).

 

 _Section 5.05_ _Merger Registration Statement; Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus_. For the purposes of (x) registering BHB Common Stock
to be offered to holders of LSBG Common Stock in connection with the Merger
with the SEC under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws and
(y) holding the BHB Meeting and the LSBG Meeting, BHB shall draft
and prepare, and LSBG shall cooperate in the preparation of, a registration
statement on Form S-4 for the registration of the shares to be issued by BHB
in the Merger (the "Merger Registration Statement"), including the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus. BHB shall provide LSBG with appropriate
opportunity to review and comment on the Merger Registration Statement and
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus prior to the time they are initially filed
with the SEC. BHB shall file the Merger Registration Statement with the SEC.
Each of BHB and LSBG shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Merger
Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly
as practicable after such filing, and the parties shall thereafter promptly
mail the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to their respective shareholders.
BHB shall also use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any necessary state
securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and LSBG shall furnish to BHB all
information concerning LSBG and the holders of LSBG Common Stock as may be
reasonably requested in connection with such action.

 

 _Section 5.06_ _Cooperation and Information Sharing_. LSBG shall provide BHB
with any information concerning LSBG that BHB may reasonably request in
connection with the drafting and preparation of the Merger Registration
Statement and Joint

 



31  Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and each party shall notify the other promptly
of the receipt of any comments of the SEC with respect to the Merger
Registration Statement or Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and of any
requests by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional
information and shall provide to the other party promptly copies of all
correspondence between it or any of its representatives and the SEC. BHB
shall provide LSBG with appropriate opportunity to review and comment on all
amendments and supplements to the Merger Registration Statement and Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and all responses to requests for additional information
and replies to comments prior to their being filed with, or sent to, the SEC.
Each of BHB and LSBG agrees to use all reasonable efforts, after consultation
with the other party hereto, to respond promptly to all such comments of and
requests by the SEC. Each of BHB and LSBG agrees to cause the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and all required amendments and supplements thereto to be
mailed to the holders of LSBG Common Stock entitled to vote at the LSBG
Meeting and the holders of BHB Common Stock entitled to vote at the BHB
Meeting, respectively, at the earliest practicable time.

_Section 5.07_ _Supplements or Amendments_. LSBG and BHB shall promptly
notify the other party if at any time it becomes aware that the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Merger Registration Statement contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements contained therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. In such
event, LSBG shall cooperate with BHB in the preparation of a supplement
or amendment to such Proxy Statement/Prospectus which corrects such
misstatement or omission, and BHB shall file an amended Merger Registration
Statement with the SEC, and each of BHB and LSBG shall mail an amended Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to their respective shareholders.

_Section 5.08_ _Regulatory Approvals_. Each of LSBG and BHB will cooperate
with the other and use all reasonable efforts to promptly prepare all
necessary documentation, to effect all necessary filings and to obtain all
necessary permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties
and Governmental Authorities necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. LSBG and BHB shall each promptly furnish the
other with copies of written communications to, or received by them from, any
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, to the extent permitted by applicable law. LSBG and BHB will
furnish each other and each others counsel with all information concerning
themselves, their subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such
other matters as may be necessary or advisable in connection with the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and any application, petition or any other
statement or application made by or on behalf of BHB or LSBG to any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and the Bank Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party hereto shall
have the right to review and approve in advance all characterizations of the
information relating to such party and any of its Subsidiaries that appear in
any filing made in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement with any Governmental Authority. In addition, BHB and LSBG shall
each furnish to the other for review a copy of each such filing made in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with any
Governmental Authority prior to its filing.

 

 _Section 5.09_ _Press Releases_. LSBG and BHB shall consult with each other
before issuing any press release with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public statements without the prior consent of the other party,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided, however_ ,
that a party may, without the prior consent of the other party (but after such
consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances), issue such
press release or make such public statements as may upon the advice of
outside counsel be required by law. LSBG and BHB shall cooperate to develop
all public announcement materials and make appropriate management available at
presentations related to this Agreement as reasonably requested by the other
party.

 

 _Section 5.10_ _Access; Information_.

 

(a) Each of BHB and LSBG agrees that upon reasonable notice and subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, it shall afford the
other party and the other partys officers, employees, counsel, accountants
and other authorized representatives such access during normal business hours
throughout the period prior to the Effective Time to its books,
records (including Tax Returns and work papers of independent registered
public accountants), properties and personnel and to such other information
relating to it as the other party may reasonably request and, during such
period, shall furnish promptly to the other party all information concerning
its business, properties and personnel as may reasonably request.

 



32 (b) All information furnished pursuant to Section 5.10(a) shall be subject to,
and each party shall hold all such information in confidence in accordance
with, the provisions of the Mutual Agreement of Confidentiality, dated as of
March 14, 2016, by and between LSBG and BHB (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

 

(c) No investigation by a party of the business and affairs of the other party
shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or the conditions to the obligations
of such party to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 _Section 5.11_ _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, LSBG shall
not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective directors, officers or employees or any investment banker,
financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by it
to, directly or indirectly through another Person, (i) solicit, initiate or
encourage (including by way of furnishing information or assistance), or take
any other action designed to facilitate or that is likely to result in, any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably
likely to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into any agreement
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) participate in any discussions
or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal or furnish, or otherwise
afford access, to any Person (other than BHB) any information or data with
respect to LSBG or any of the LSBG Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to an
Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) make or authorize any statement or
recommendation in support of any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence, LSBG may take any of the actions described in clause (iii)
of the foregoing sentence only if, (A) LSBG has received a bona fide
unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal prior to the LSBG Meeting that did
not result from a breach of this Section 5.11, (B) the LSBG Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with and having considered the
advice of its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Proposal, (C) LSBG provides BHB with at least three (3) Business
Days prior notice of such determination (the "Notice of Superior
Proposal"), which notice shall include the name of such Person and the
material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal, and (D) prior
to furnishing or affording access to any information or data with respect to
LSBG or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, LSBG receives from
such Person a confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to LSBG
than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement between BHB and LSBG.
LSBG shall promptly provide to BHB any non-public information regarding LSBG
and its Subsidiaries provided to any other Person that was not previously
provided to BHB, such additional information to be provided no later than the
date of provision of such information to such other party.

 

(b) Notwithstanding Section 5.04, prior to the date of the LSBG Meeting, the
LSBG Board may approve or recommend to the stockholders of LSBG a Superior
Proposal and withdraw, change, qualify or modify the LSBG Recommendation in
connection therewith (a "Change in Recommendation") after the fifth (5th)
Business Day following BHBs receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal
advising BHB that the LSBG Board has decided that a bona fide unsolicited
written Acquisition Proposal that it received (that did not result from a
breach of this Section 5.11) constitutes a Superior Proposal (it being
understood that LSBG shall be required to deliver a new Notice of Superior
Proposal in respect of any revised Superior Proposal from such third party or
its affiliates that LSBG proposes to accept and the subsequent notice period
(which shall not shorten such original five (5) Business Day period) shall be
two (2) Business Days) if, but only if, (a) the LSBG Board has reasonably
determined in good faith, after consultation with and having considered the
advice of outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that the failure
to take such actions would be reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary
duties to LSBGs stockholders under applicable law, and (b) (i) during such
five (5) Business Day period or two (2) Business Day Period (as the case may
be), LSBG has negotiated, and has used its reasonable best efforts to cause
its financial and legal advisors to negotiate, with BHB in good faith to make
such adjustments, modifications or amendments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement such that such Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute
a Superior Proposal and (ii) at the end of such five (5) Business Day period
or two (2) Business Day period (as the case may be), after taking into
account any such adjusted, modified or amended terms as may have been
committed to in writing by BHB since its receipt of such Notice of Superior
Proposal (provided, however, that BHB shall not have any obligation to
propose any adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement), the LSBG Board has again in good faith made the
determination (x) in clause (a) of this Section 5.11, and (y) that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the withdrawal,

 



33  changing, qualifying or modifying of the LSBG Recommendation or the making
of a Change in Recommendation by the LSBG Board shall not change the approval
of the LSBG Board for purposes of causing any applicable "moratorium,"
"control share," "fair price," "takeover," "interested stockholder" or similar
law to be inapplicable to this Agreement and the LSBG Voting Agreements and
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger.

(c) LSBG shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than BHB) conducted
heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing, and shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause all Persons other than BHB who have been furnished
confidential information regarding LSBG in connection with the solicitation
of or discussions regarding an Acquisition Proposal within the twelve (12)
months prior to the date hereof promptly to return or destroy such
information. LSBG agrees not to release any third party from the
confidentiality and standstill provisions of any agreement to which LSBG is or
may become a party, and shall immediately take all steps necessary to
terminate any approval that may have been heretofore given under any
such provisions authorizing any Person (other than BHB) to make an
Acquisition Proposal.

LSBG shall ensure that the directors, officers, employees, agents
and representatives (including any investment bankers, financial advisors,
attorneys, accountants or other retained representatives) of LSBG are aware of
the restrictions described in this Section 5.11 as reasonably necessary to
avoid violations thereof. It is understood that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 5.11 by any director, officer,
employee, agent or representative (including any investment banker, financial
advisor, attorney, accountant or other retained representative) of LSBG, at
the direction or with the consent of LSBG, shall be deemed to be a breach of
this Section 5.11 by LSBG.

 

 _Section 5.12_ _Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, BHB (the "Indemnifying Party") shall
indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of
LSBG and each other Person entitled to indemnification under the Bylaws of BHB
as in effect on the date hereof, as applicable, determined as of the Effective
Time (the "Indemnified Parties") against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of or pertaining to the fact
that he or she was a director or officer of LSBG or is or was serving at the
request of LSBG as a director, officer, employee or other agent of any other
organization or in any capacity with respect to any employee benefit plan of
LSBG, including matters related to the negotiation, execution and performance
of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, to the
fullest extent which such Indemnified Parties would be entitled under the
Amended and Restated Bylaws of LSBG as in effect on the date hereof (subject
to change as required by law). BHBs obligations under this Section 5.12(a)
shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six years from the
Effective Time; _provided, however,_ that all rights to indemnification in
respect of any claim asserted or made within such period shall continue until
the final disposition of such claim. In addition, BHB shall advance expenses
to the Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent which such
Indemnified Parties would be entitled under the Amended and Restated Bylaws
of LSBG as in effect on the date hereof without regard to director approval of
such advancement of expenses.

 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section
5.12, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party, but the failure
to so notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability it may
have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent that such failure
does actually prejudice the Indemnifying Party. In the event of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or
after the Effective Time), (i) the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
assume the defense thereof and the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to
such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with
the defense thereof, except that if the Indemnifying Party elects not to
assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there
are issues which raise conflicts of interest between the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel

 



34  which is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party, and the
Indemnifying Party shall pay, promptly as statements therefor are received,
the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties
(which may not exceed one firm in any jurisdiction unless counsel for the
Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues that raise conflicts of
interest between the Indemnified Parties), (ii) the Indemnified Parties will
cooperate in the defense of any such matter, (iii) the Indemnifying Party
shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written
consent and (iv) the Indemnifying Party shall have no obligation hereunder
in the event that indemnification of an Indemnified Party in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable laws and regulations or by an
applicable federal or state banking agency or a court of competent
jurisdiction.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, BHB shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the persons serving as directors and officers of LSBG immediately prior
to the Effective Time to be covered by the directors and officers liability
insurance policy maintained by LSBG (provided that BHB may substitute therefor
policies which are not materially less advantageous than such policy or
single premium tail coverage with policy limits equal to LSBGs existing
coverage limits) for a six-year period following the Effective Time with
respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time which were
committed by such directors and officers in their capacities as such,
provided that in no event shall BHB be required to expend in any one year more
than an amount equal to 175% of the current annual amount expended by LSBG to
maintain such insurance (the "Insurance Amount"), and further provided that
if BHB is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this
Section 5.12(c) as a result of the preceding provision, BHB shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as is
available for the Insurance Amount.

(d) If BHB or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate with
or merge into any other entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
entity of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or substantially
all of its assets to any other entity, then and in each case, proper provision
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of BHB shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.12.

_Section 5.13_  _Employees; Benefit Plans_.

(a) Following the Closing Date, BHB may choose to maintain any or all of the
LSBG Benefit Plans in its sole discretion. Effective no later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, LSBG shall terminate any LSBG Benefit
Plans for which participant consent is not required and that BHB has requested
to be terminated by providing written notice to LSBG at least fifteen (15)
days prior to the Closing Date. No later than the day immediately preceding
the Closing Date, LSBG shall provide BHB with evidence that such LSBG Benefit
Plans have been terminated. However, for any LSBG Benefit Plan terminated for
which there is a comparable BHB Benefit Plan of general applicability (other
than the defined benefit pension plan or any nonqualified deferred
compensation plans or arrangements maintained by BHB), BHB shall take
all reasonable action so that employees of LSBG shall be entitled to
participate in such BHB Benefit Plan to the same extent as similarly-situated
employees of BHB (it being understood that inclusion of the employees of LSBG
in the BHB Benefit Plans may occur at different times with respect to
different plans). BHB shall cause each BHB Benefit Plan in which employees of
LSBG are eligible to participate to take into account for purposes of
eligibility and vesting under the BHB Benefit Plans (but not for purposes of
benefit accrual) the service of such employees with LSBG and its Subsidiaries
to the same extent as such service was credited for such purpose by LSBG
(other than for the defined benefit pension plan or any nonqualified
deferred compensation plans or arrangements maintained by BHB); _provided,
however,_ that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. Nothing herein shall
limit the ability of BHB to amend or terminate any of the LSBG Benefit Plans
or BHB Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms at any time; _provided,
however,_ that BHB shall continue to maintain the LSBG Benefit Plans (other
than stock-based or incentive plans and the defined benefit pension plan and
any nonqualified deferred compensation plans or arrangements) for which there
is a comparable BHB Benefit Plan until the LSBG Employees are permitted to
participate in the BHB Benefit Plans, unless such BHB Benefit Plan has been
frozen or terminated with respect to similarly-situated employees of BHB or
any Subsidiary of BHB.

(b) BHB shall assume and honor, under the vacation policies of LSBG, as
disclosed on _LSBG Disclosure Schedule 3.18_ , the accrued but unused vacation
time of employees of the Surviving Corporation who were employees of LSBG
prior to the Effective Time. BHB shall also assume and honor, under the
severance pay policies of LSBG, as disclosed on _LSBG Disclosure Schedule
3.18_ , the rights to severance of the employees of the Surviving Corporation
who were employees of LSBG prior to the Effective Time. Following the
Effective Time BHB shall, and shall cause Bar Harbor Bank, to give priority to
terminated LSBG Employees with respect to any job postings at BHB or Bar
Harbor Bank, as applicable, for which any such LSBG Employee is qualified. 

 



35 (c) If employees of LSBG become eligible to participate in a medical, dental
or health plan of BHB upon termination of such plan of LSBG, BHB shall make
all commercially reasonable efforts to cause each such plan to (i) waive any
preexisting condition limitations to the extent such conditions are covered
under the applicable medical, health or dental plans of BHB, and (ii) waive
any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement which
would otherwise be applicable to such employee on or after the Effective Time,
in each case to the extent such employee had satisfied any similar limitation
or requirement under an analogous LSBG Benefit Plan prior to the Effective
Time.

(d) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, LSBG shall obtain from
each of the individuals named in _LSBG Disclosure Schedule 5.13(d)_ an
agreement (a "Settlement Agreement") to accept in full settlement of his or
her rights under the specified programs the amounts and benefits determined
under his or her Settlement Agreement (the aggregate amounts of such payments
to be specified in _LSBG Disclosure Schedule 5.13(d)_ ) and pay such amounts
to such individuals who are employed at the Effective Time pursuant to the
terms of the Settlement Agreement, subject to a cut-back of any payment that
would constitute an "excess parachute payment", as defined in Section 280G of
the Code, such that no portion of the payment will be subject to the excise
tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code. As to, and only as to, each
individual who enters into a Settlement Agreement, BHB acknowledges and agrees
that (i) the Merger constitutes a "change of control" or "change in control"
for all purposes pursuant to such agreements, and (ii) LSBG will pay out all
cash amounts under such agreements at the Closing Date, to the extent
permitted by Section 409A of the Code. Any officer or employee of LSBG who is
a party to a Settlement Agreement shall be entitled to receive the benefits
payable or to be otherwise provided pursuant to the terms of such Settlement
Agreement, and BHB agrees to provide the non-cash benefits, if any, pursuant
to the terms of the Settlement Agreement.

(e) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, BHB and Bar Harbor
Bank are entering into an employment agreement with William J. McIver in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit C to be effective as of the Effective Time,
and BHB, Bar Harbor Bank, LSBG and Lake Sunapee Bank will enter into
settlement agreements with Stephen R. Theroux, William J. McIver, Laura
Jacobi, Sharon Whitaker, Jodi Hoyt, Stephen W. Ensign and Bliss Dayton in the
forms attached hereto as Exhibits D-1 to D-7 hereto, respectively, to be
effective as of the Effective Time.

 

(f) BHB shall provide a retention pool in an amount up to $350,000 for the
benefit of certain employees of LSBG to be designated by BHB at its sole
discretion; provided that, any such designations shall be made in consultation
with LSBG. Such designated employees will enter into retention agreements to
be agreed upon by BHB and LSBG.

 

(g) This Section 5.13 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 5.13,
express or implied, shall confer upon any LSBG or BHB employee, or any legal
representative or beneficiary thereof, any rights or remedies, including any
right to employment or continued employment for any specified period,
or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this
Agreement. Nothing in this Section 5.13, express or implied, shall be deemed
an amendment of any plan providing benefits to any LSBG or BHB employee.

 

 _Section 5.14_ _Notification of Certain Changes_. BHB and LSBG shall
promptly advise the other party of any change or event having, or which could
be reasonably expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on it or which it
believes would, or which could reasonably be expected to, cause or constitute
a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained herein. From time to time prior to the Effective Time
(and on the date prior to the Closing Date), each party will supplement or
amend its Disclosure Schedules delivered in connection with the execution of
this Agreement to reflect any matter which, if existing, occurring or known
at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or
described in such Disclosure Schedules or which is necessary to correct any
information in such Disclosure Schedules which has been rendered inaccurate
thereby. No supplement or amendment to such Disclosure Schedules shall have
any effect for the purpose of determining the accuracy of the representations
and warranties of the parties contained in Article III and Article IV in
order to determine the fulfillment of the conditions set forth in Sections
6.02(a) or 6.03(a) hereof, as the case may be, or the compliance by LSBG or
BHB, as the case may be, with the respective covenants and agreements of such
parties contained herein.

 



36 _Section 5.15_ _Current Information_. During the period from the date of
this Agreement to the Effective Time, each party will cause one or more of
its designated representatives to confer on a regular and frequent basis with
representatives of the other party and to report the general status of its
ongoing operations. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees to
provide the other party (i) a copy of each report filed by it with a
Governmental Authority within one (1) Business Day following the filing
thereof and (ii) monthly updates of the information required to be set forth
in _LSBG Disclosure Schedule 3.14_ or _BHB Disclosure Schedule 4.14_ , as the
case may be.

 

 _Section 5.16_ _Board Packages_ _._ LSBG shall distribute a copy of its
Board package, including the agenda and any draft minutes, to BHB at the same
time and in the same manner in which it distributes a copy of such packages to
its Board; _provided, however,_ that LSBG shall not be required to copy BHB on
any documents that disclose confidential discussions of this Agreement or the

counsel that such distribution to BHB may violate a
confidentiality obligation or fiduciary duty or any law or regulation.

_Section 5.17_ _Transition; Informational Systems Conversion_. From and
after the date hereof, BHB and LSBG shall use their reasonable best efforts to
facilitate the integration of the businesses of LSBG and BHB following

regular basis to discuss and plan for the conversion of data processing and
related electronic informational systems (the "Informational Systems
Conversion") to a single such system. It is the intent of the Parties that, to
the extent commercially reasonable, the systems of BHB and Bar Harbor Bank be
converted to those used by LSBG and Lake Sunapee Bank. Such planning shall
include, but not be limited to: (a) discussion of the parties third-party
service provider arrangements; (b) non-renewal of personal property leases

operations; (c) retention of outside consultants and additional employees to
assist with the conversion; (d) outsourcing, as appropriate, of proprietary
or self-provided system services; and (e) any other actions necessary and
appropriate to facilitate the conversion, as soon as practicable following the

to facilitate the Informational Systems Conversion; provided, however, that
BHB shall indemnify LSBG for any reasonable out-of-pocket fees, expenses or
charges that LSBG may incur as a result of taking, at the request of BHB, any
action to facilitate the Informational Systems Conversion. If this Agreement
is terminated by BHB and/or LSBG in accordance with Section 7.01(a), 7.01(b),
7.01(c), or 7.01(f), or by LSBG only in accordance with Section 7.01(d),
7.01(e) or 7.01(h)(ii), BHB shall indemnify LSBG for any reasonable fees,
expenses or charges related to reversing the Informational Systems Conversion.

 

 _Section 5.18_ _Board of Directors_. Effective immediately following the
Effective Time, BHB shall take, and shall cause Bar Harbor Bank to take, all
action necessary to expand the size of the Board of Directors of each of BHB
and Bar Harbor Bank by four seats and to appoint four members of LSBGs Board
of Directors, selected by BHB after consultation with LSBG, to each of BHBs
and Bar Harbor Banks Board of Directors, each to serve on BHBs and Bar
Harbor Banks Board of Directors for a term expiring at the next annual
meeting of BHBs shareholders, at which meeting each such appointee shall be
included as a nominee for election to BHBs and Bar Harbor Banks Board of
Directors to serve until the following annual meeting of BHBs shareholders.

 

 _Section 5.19_ _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Prior to the
Effective Time, BHB shall take all steps as may be required to cause any
acquisitions of BHB Common Stock resulting from the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement by each director or officer of LSBG who becomes subject to
the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect
to LSBG to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

ARTICLE VII

 

TERMINATION

 

 _Section 7.01_ _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated, and the

consent of BHB and LSBG if the Board of Directors of each so determines by
vote of a majority of the members of its entire Board.

(b) _No Regulatory Approval_. By either BHB or LSBG, if its Board of
Directors so determines by a vote of a majority of the members of its entire
Board, in the event the approval of any Governmental Authority required for

an application therefor shall have been permanently withdrawn at the request
of a Governmental Authority.

 

(c) _No Shareholder Approval_. By either BHB or LSBG (provided that the
terminating party is not in material breach of any of its obligations under
Section 5.04), if the approval of the shareholders of either party required
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote
at a duly held meeting of such shareholders or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof.

(d) _Breach of Representations and Warranties_. By either BHB or LSBG
(provided that the terminating party is not then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein) if

set forth in this Agreement by the other party, which breach is not cured
within thirty (30) days following written notice to the party committing such
breach, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the
Closing;  _provided, however,_ that neither party shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01(d) unless the breach of
representation or warranty, together with all other such breaches, would
entitle the party receiving such representation or warranty not to consummate
the Merger under Section 6.02(a) (in the case of a breach of a representation
or warranty by LSBG) or Section 6.03(a) (in the case of a breach of a
representation or warranty by BHB).

(e) _Breach of Covenants_. By either BHB or LSBG (provided that the
terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein) if there shall have
been a breach of any of the covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement on the part of the other party, which 

 



40  breach shall not have been cured within thirty (30) days following receipt
by the breaching party of written notice of such breach from the other party
hereto, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Closing,
_provided, however_ , that neither party shall have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01(e) unless the breach of covenant
or agreement, together with all other such breaches, would entitle the party
receiving the benefit of such covenant or agreement not to consummate the
Merger under Section 6.02(b) (in the case of a breach of a covenant or
agreement by LSBG) or Section 6.03(b) (in the case of a breach of a
representation or warranty by BHB).

(f) _Delay_. By either BHB or LSBG if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before March 31, 2017 (the "Termination Date"), unless the
failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to a material breach
of this Agreement by the party seeking to terminate this Agreement.

 

(g) _Superior Proposal_. By LSBG if it has received a Superior Proposal and
the LSBG Board of Directors has determined to accept such Superior Proposal
in accordance with Section 5.11 (including the obligation therein of the LSBG
Board to take into account any adjusted, modified or amended terms of this
Agreement proposed by BHB).

referred to in Section 5.04(b), withdrawn such recommendation or modified or
changed such recommendation in a manner adverse in any respect to the
interests of BHB, (C) the LSBG Board shall have recommended, proposed, or

Acquisition Transaction with any Person other than BHB or a Subsidiary of BHB
or (D) LSBG shall have materially breached its obligations under Section
5.04(b) by failing to call, give notice of, convene and hold the LSBG Meeting
in accordance with Section 5.04(b).

 

(ii) By LSBG, if BHB shall have materially breached its obligations under
Section 5.04(a) by failing to call, give notice of, convene and hold the BHB
Meeting or by failing to make its recommendation or withdrawing, modifying or
changing such recommendation in any manner adverse in any respect to the
interests of LSBG in accordance with Section 5.04(a).

 

(i) _Decrease in BHB Stock Price_. By LSBG, if the LSBG Board so determines by
a vote of the majority of the members of the entire LSBG Board, at any time
during the five-day period commencing with the Determination Date (as defined
below), if both of the following conditions are satisfied:

 

(A) The quotient obtained by dividing the Average Closing Price by the
Starting Price (as defined below) (the "BHB Ratio") shall be less than 0.80;
and

(B) (x) the BHB Ratio shall be less than (y) the quotient obtained
by dividing the Final Index Price by the Index Price on the Starting Date
(each as defined below) and subtracting 0.20 from the quotient in this clause
(B)(y) (such number in this clause (B)(y) that results from dividing the Final
Index Price by the Index Price on the Starting Date being referred to herein
as the "Index Ratio");

subject, however, to the following three sentences. If LSBG elects to
exercise its termination right pursuant to this Section 7.01(i), it shall give
written notice to BHB promptly, and in any event within the five-day period
commencing with the Determination Date. During the five-day period commencing
with its receipt of such notice, BHB shall have the option to increase the
consideration to be received by the holders of LSBG Common Stock hereunder, by
adjusting the Exchange Ratio (calculated to the nearest one one-
thousandth) to equal the lesser of (x) a number (rounded to the nearest one
one-thousandth) obtained by dividing (A) the product of the Starting Price,
0.80 and the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) by (B) the Average Closing
Price and (y) a number (rounded to the nearest one one-thousandth) obtained
by dividing (A) the product of the Index Ratio and the Exchange Ratio (as then
in effect) by (B) the BHB Ratio. If BHB so elects within such five-day period,
it shall give prompt written notice to LSBG of such election and the revised
Exchange Ratio, whereupon no termination shall have occurred pursuant to this
Section 7.01(i) and this Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with
its terms (except as the Exchange Ratio shall have been so modified.)

this Article VII, no party to this Agreement shall have any liability or
further obligation to any other party hereunder except (i) as set forth in
