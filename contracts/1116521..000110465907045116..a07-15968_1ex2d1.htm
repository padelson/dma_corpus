 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

  

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June 4, 2007 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is among SIERRA HOLDINGS CORP., a Delaware corporation ("
_Parent_ "), SIERRA MERGER CORP., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and AVAYA INC., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ "). Certain terms used in this Agreement are
used as defined in Section 8.12.

  

WHEREAS, the parties intend that Merger Sub be merged with and into the
Company, with the Company surviving that merger on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement (the " _Merger_ ");

  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has (i) determined that it is
in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it
advisable, to enter into this Agreement, (ii) approved the execution,
delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger
and (iii) resolved to recommend adoption of this Agreement by the
stockholders of the Company;

  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub have
approved this Agreement and declared it advisable for Parent and Merger Sub,
respectively to enter into this Agreement;

  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to the CompanyÂ’s willingness to enter into this
Agreement, each of the Guarantors (each, a " _Guarantor_ ") is entering into
a limited guarantee in favor of the Company (each, a " _Guarantee_ ") with
respect to certain of ParentÂ’s obligations under this Agreement;

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as
follows:

  

ARTICLE I 
  
  _The Merger_

  

SECTION 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time Merger
Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, and the Company shall be the
surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

  

SECTION 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP, 767 Fifth Avenue,
New York, New     



  

York 10153 at 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on a date to be specified by
the parties, following the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by
applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time), that
is the earlier of (a) any business day before or during the Marketing Period
as may be specified by Parent on no less than three business daysÂ’ prior
notice to the Company and (b) the final day of the Marketing Period, or such
other date, time, or place as agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. The
date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to in this Agreement as
the " _Closing Date_ ".

  

SECTION 1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
soon as practicable on the Closing Date the parties shall file with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger,
executed in accordance with, and in such form as is required by, the relevant
provisions of the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "). The Merger shall
become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger or at such
later time as is agreed to by the parties hereto and specified in the
Certificate of Merger (the time at which the Merger becomes effective is
herein referred to as the " _Effective Time"_ ).

  

SECTION 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of
the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of
the Surviving Corporation.

  

SECTION 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation_. At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and by-
laws of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to be in the form of
(except with respect to the name of the Company) the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws of Merger Sub, and as amended shall be the
certificate of incorporation and by-laws of Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law (and subject to
Section 5.9 hereof).

  

SECTION 1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.

  

(a) Each of the parties hereto shall take all necessary action to cause the
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective
Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with
the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

  

(b) The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors

        



  

are duly appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of
the Surviving Corporation.

  

ARTICLE II 
  
  _Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the Constituent
Corporations; Exchange of Certificates; Company Stock Options_

  

SECTION 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common
Stock_ ") or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

  

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Any shares
of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock, and
any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub, shall
be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor.

  

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with
Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting Shares) shall thereupon be converted
automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to $17.50, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company
Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate,
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of
Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with Section 2.2(b), without interest.

  

SECTION 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent
for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the
Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive, on terms reasonably acceptable to
the Company, for the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock,
the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of shares of Company
Common Stock shall become

        



  

entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c). Parent shall deposit such aggregate
Merger Consideration with the Paying Agent at or prior to the Effective Time.
Such aggregate Merger Consideration deposited with the Paying Agent shall,
pending its disbursement to such holders, be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by Parent in (i) short-term direct obligations of the United States
of America, (ii) short-term obligations for which the full faith and credit
of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of
principal and interest, (iii) short-term commercial paper rated the highest
quality by either MoodyÂ’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
PoorÂ’s Ratings Services or (iv) money market funds investing solely in a
combination of the foregoing. Parent shall promptly replace any funds
deposited with the Paying Agent lost through any investment made pursuant to
this paragraph.

  

(b) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event
more than two business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company
Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which shall
be in such form and shall have such other customary provisions as Parent and
the Company may reasonably agree) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying
Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions (and such other customary
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent), the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration, without interest, for each share of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled.  If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (x) the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and (y) the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of
the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate surrendered and shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax either has been paid
or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2,
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated
by this Article II, without interest.

  

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_.  The
Merger Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company Common Stock upon
the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of
this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificates, and at the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and

        



  

thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates that evidenced
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares
of Company Common Stock, except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable Law. Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.2(e), if, at any
time after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this Article II.

  

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate, as contemplated by this Article II.

  

(e) _Termination of Fund_. At any time following the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require
the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received
with respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and
which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter such
holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent and the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as
general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger
Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates held by
such holders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest
thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at
which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

  

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

  

(g) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (the " _Code_ "), or under any provision of

        



  

state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate Government Authority, the withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. If
any withholding obligation may be avoided by such holder providing
information or documentation to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, such information shall be requested prior to any such
withholding.

  

SECTION 2.3 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by
a stockholder who did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto
in writing) and who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of
such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ "),
shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), but instead such holder
shall be entitled to receive such consideration as may be determined to be
due to such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (and
at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holder
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights set
forth in Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and until such holder shall have
failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost rights to
appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such holderÂ’s
shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as if they had been
converted into and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the
Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each such share of Company
Common Stock, in accordance with Section 2.1, without any interest thereon.
The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of
such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and
received by the Company relating to stockholdersÂ’ rights of appraisal, and
(ii) the opportunity to control all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to demands for appraisal under the DGCL.

  

SECTION 2.4 _Company Stock Options and RSUs_.

  

(a) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action
necessary (including any necessary determinations and/or resolutions of the
Board of Directors of the Company or a committee thereof) such that:

  

(i) Except as otherwise agreed by Parent and the holder thereof, each option
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not then
vested or exercisable) that represents the right to acquire shares of Company
Common Stock and was issued under a Company Stock Plan (each, an " _Option_
") shall at the Effective Time be cancelled and terminated and converted at
the Effective Time into the

        



  

right to receive a cash amount equal to the Option Consideration for each
share of Company Common Stock then subject to the Option. The
Option Consideration shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation on the
Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Option Consideration_ "
means, with respect to any share of Company Common Stock issuable under a
particular Option, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the Merger
Consideration per share of Company Common Stock over (ii) the exercise price
payable in respect of such share of Company Common Stock issuable under such
Option.

  

(ii) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed by
Parent and the holder thereof, each restricted stock unit in respect of a
share of Company Common Stock issued under a Company Stock Plan
(collectively, the " _RSUs_ ") which is subject only to time based vesting
criteria shall vest in full and be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in respect thereof, and the holder of such RSU shall be
paid on the Closing Date, an aggregate amount of cash as the holder would
have been entitled to receive had such RSU been vested in full and settled
immediately before the Effective Time (the " _RSU Consideration_ ").

  

(iii) The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Section 2.4 to any holder of
Options or RSUs such amount as the Surviving Corporation is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or any provision of state, or local Tax Law, and the Surviving
Corporation shall make any required filings with and payments to Taxing
authorities relating to any such deduction or withholding. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Surviving Corporation, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of Options or RSUs in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation.

  

(b) The holders of RSUs that are subject to performance based vesting
criteria have such rights as are conferred on them by the terms of their
grants.  Subject to such rights, the Company and Parent will work together
in good faith to determine the appropriate treatment upon the Closing for
such RSUs.

  

SECTION 2.5 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Article II
to the contrary, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class by reason of the occurrence
or record date of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,

        



  

recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to
reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction.

corporate power and authority necessary to own or lease all of its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The
Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or
the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined below) on the Company.
For purposes of this Agreement, " _Material Adverse Effect_ " shall mean any
change, event or occurrence which, individually or in the aggregate, does
have or would reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on

its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, other than changes, events, occurrences
or effects (i) generally affecting (A) the industry in which the Company

materially disproportionate manner as compared to other participants in such
industry, or (B) the economy, credit or financial or capital markets, in the
United States or elsewhere in the world, including changes in interest or

volume, of the capital stock of the Company, or (G) any failure to meet any
internal or public projections, forecasts or estimates of revenue or

clauses (F) and (G) shall not prevent or otherwise affect a determination
that the underlying cause of any such failure is a Material Adverse Effect).

  

(b) Each of the CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization
except where the failure to be so organized, existing and in good standing
does not have and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

  

(c) The Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of
the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company, as amended to
the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Charter Documents_ ").

SECTION 3.11 _Employee Benefits and Labor Matters_.

  

(a) Section 3.11 of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists each Company Plan
with respect to its current and former employees located in the United States
and Germany (other than statutorily required plans in Germany). The Company
has made available to Parent correct and complete (in all material respects)
copies of (1) each Company Plan (other than statutorily required plans in
Germany) or, in the case of individual agreements, a representative form of
agreement (and, with respect to Severance Agreements for Executive Officers
listed on Section 3.11(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, noting any
instances in which the actual agreements that were executed deviate from the
form), (2) the most recent annual reports on Form 5500 required to be filed
with the IRS with respect to each Company Plan (if any such report was
required) and the most recent actuarial valuation or similar reports with
respect to each Company Plan for which such report is available, (3) the most
recent summary plan description for each Company Plan for which such summary
plan description is required and (4) each trust agreement and insurance or
group annuity contract relating to any Company Plan, provided that, for
purposes of this sentence "Company Plan" shall mean only those Company Plans
required to be set forth in Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure

as set forth in Section 3.7 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened claims (other than
claims for benefits in the ordinary course) with respect to any Company Plans
that would reasonably be expected

        



  

to have a Material Adverse Effect. All Company Plans that are "employee
pension plans" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) that are intended to be
tax qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (each, a " _Company Pension
Plan_ ") have received a favorable determination letter from the IRS or have
filed a timely application therefor and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no
event has occurred since the date of the most recent determination letter or
application therefor relating to any such Company Pension Plan that would
adversely affect the qualification of such Company Pension Plan. The Company
has made available to Parent a correct and complete copy of the most recent
determination letter received with respect to each Company Pension Plan, as
well as a correct and complete copy of each pending application for a
determination letter, if any. No Company Pension Plan has an

its Subsidiaries, would be deemed a single employer within the meaning of
Section 4001 of ERISA (an " _ERISA Affiliate_ ") maintains or contributes to,
or has maintained or contributed to during the previous six years, or has any
material liability with respect to, any Multiemployer Plan or any "defined
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA) subject to Title IV of
ERISA that is not a Company Pension Plan, in each case, as would be
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

  

(c) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
or as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect, no Company Plan exists that, as a result of
the execution of this Agreement, the Stockholder Approval, or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether alone or in connection
with any subsequent event(s)), would reasonably be expected to (i) result in
any increased severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date
of this Agreement, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or result
in any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of
compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable, require the
security of benefits under or result in any other material obligation
pursuant to, any of the Company Plans, or (iii) limit or restrict the right
of the Company to merge, amend or terminate any of the Company Plans.

  

(d) The Company is not aware of any facts that would make the calculation of
the non-deductible amount of the "excess parachute payment" under Section
280G of the Code previously provided to Parent with respect to the thirteen
executives of the Company included in such calculation, based upon the
assumptions used therein, inaccurate in any material respects.

Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the " _PBGC_ ") has not initiated any
proceeding, or asserted any rights, under sections 4041 or 4042 of ERISA and

in any form, written or oral, from the PBGC, under its so-called "Early
Warning Program" or otherwise,

Subsidiaries (any initiation, assertion or inquiry of the sort described in
this clause (e), a " _PBGC Contact_ ").

  

(f) To the Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has granted any "stock right" (as that term is defined in Treas.
Regs. Section 1.409A-1(l)) that does not qualify, or that at any time
following grant would not have qualified, for the exemption from Section 409A
of the Code set forth at Treas. Regs. Section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(i), except to
the extent such failure to qualify would not reasonably be expected to result
in a material liability to the Company.

  

(g) The Company has provided Parent copies of all material terms of each
collective bargaining or other labor union contract to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party related to employees located in the United
States or Germany. Except as disclosed in Section 3.11(g) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule or, in the case of clauses (ii) through (v), as would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect: (i) neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any collective bargaining
agreement, labor union contract, or trade union agreement in the United

complaint against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by the National
Labor Relations Board or any comparable Governmental Authority.

not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (A) each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries is and has been in compliance with
all applicable laws, regulations or other legal requirements relating to the
protection of the environment or human health and safety (" _Environmental
Laws_ "), which compliance includes obtaining, maintaining or complying with
all Permits required under Environmental Laws for the operation of their
respective businesses, (B) there is no investigation, suit, claim, action or
proceeding relating to or arising under Environmental Laws that is pending
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any real property owned, operated or leased by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (C) neither the Company nor any of its

SECTION 4.4 _Ownership and Operations of Merger Sub_.  Parent owns
beneficially and of record all of the outstanding capital stock of Merger

Transactions, has engaged in no other business activities and has conducted
its operations only as contemplated hereby.

  

SECTION 4.5 _Financing_.

  

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and complete copies, as
of the date of this Agreement, of (i) executed commitment letters (the "
_Equity Funding Letters_ ") from Silver Lake Partners III, L.P. and TPG
Partners V, L.P. (each, an "Equity Provider", and collectively the " _Equity
Provider Group_ ") to provide, subject to the terms and conditions therein,
equity financing in the aggregate amount set forth therein (being
collectively referred to as the " _Equity Financing_ "), and (ii) executed
commitment letters and redacted forms of fee letters, dated as of the date of
this Agreement, from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., Citigroup Global
Markets Inc., JPMorgan Securities Inc. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the "
_Debt Commitment Letters_ " and, together with the Equity Funding Letters,
the " _Financing Letters_ ") to provide, subject to the terms and conditions
therein, debt financing in an aggregate amount set forth therein (being
collectively referred to as the " _Debt Financing_ ", and together with the
Equity Financing collectively referred to as the " _Financing_ "). As of
the date hereof, none of the Equity Funding Letters or Debt Commitment
Letters has been amended or modified, no such amendment or modification is
contemplated, and the respective commitments contained in such letters have
not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect.  Parent or Merger Sub has
fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in connection with the
Equity Funding Letters and the Debt Commitment Letters that are payable on or
prior to the date hereof and, as of the date hereof, the Equity Funding
Letters and the Debt Commitment Letters (or, if applicable, any alternative
debt commitment letters entered into pursuant to Section 5.5(a)) are the
valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Parent and Merger Sub, and to
the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto. Assuming the Financing is
funded and assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set
forth in Article 3 and performance by the Company of its obligations under
Section 5.2, the net proceeds contemplated by the Equity Funding Letters and
Debt Commitment Letters will, together with Company cash, in the aggregate be
sufficient for Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration, Option

        



  

Consideration and RSU Consideration (and any other repayment or refinancing
of debt contemplated by this Agreement or the Equity Funding Letters or the
Debt Commitment Letters) and any other amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions and to pay all related
fees and expenses. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub under the Equity
Funding Letters or the Debt Commitment Letters; provided that Parent is not
making any representation regarding the effect of the inaccuracy of the
representations and warranties in Article 3. As of the date of this
Agreement, Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied or that the Financing will
not be available to Parent or Merger Sub on the date of the Closing; provided
that Parent is not making any representation regarding the inaccuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in Article 3, or the failure of the
Company to perform its obligations hereunder. The Financing Letters contain
all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder
to make Financing available to Parent on the terms therein.

  

(b) Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any member of the Equity Provider Group
has (i) retained any financial advisor on an exclusive basis other than
Affiliates of any member of the Equity Provider Group or (ii) entered into an
agreement, arrangement or understanding with any bank or investment bank or
other potential provider of debt or equity financing on an exclusive basis

otherwise hinder) such provider from providing or seeking to provide such
financing to any third party in connection with a transaction relating to the
Company or its Subsidiaries (including in connection with the making of any
Takeover Proposal)), in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), in connection with
the Merger or the other Transactions, except, in the case of clause (ii), for
such actions taken after the No-Shop Period Start Date to the extent
permitted pursuant to the second sentence of Section 5.5(c). Neither Parent,
Merger Sub nor any member of the Equity Provider Group has caused or induced
any Person to take any action that, if taken by Parent, Merger Sub or any
member of the Equity Provider Group, would be a breach of, or would cause to
be untrue, any of the representations in this Section 4.5(b).

  

SECTION 4.6 _Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
Parent has delivered to the Company duly executed limited guarantees of each
of Silver Lake Partners III, L.P. and TPG Partners V, L.P. (collectively, the
" _Guarantors_ ") with respect to certain matters on the terms specified
therein (the " _Guarantee_ "). Each Guarantee is in full force and effect and
is the valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the applicable Guarantor,
and no event has occurred, which, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default on the part of such Guarantor under such
Guarantee.

  

SECTION 4.7 _Solvency_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into the
Transactions with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or
future creditors. Immediately after giving effect to all of the Transactions,
including the Financing, any alternative financing and the payment of the
aggregate Merger Consideration, the Option

        



  

Consideration and the RSU Consideration under Section 2.4 and any other
repayment or refinancing of debt that may be contemplated in the Commitment

to consummate the Merger as set forth herein, or the waiver of such
conditions, and (b) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in Article III hereof (for such purposes, such
representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all material
respects) and (c) any estimates, projections or forecasts of the Company and
its Subsidiaries have been prepared in good faith based upon reasonable
assumptions, and payment of all related fees and expenses, the Surviving
Corporation will be Solvent.  For purposes of this Section 4.7, the term "
_Solvent_ " with respect to the Surviving Corporation means that, as of any
date of determination, (a) the amount of the fair saleable value of the
assets of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
exceeds, as of such date, the sum of (i) the value of all liabilities of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, including
contingent and other liabilities, as of such date, as such quoted terms are
generally determined in accordance with the applicable federal Laws
governing determinations of the solvency of debtors, and (ii) without
duplication of liabilities in clause (i), the amount that will be required to
pay the probable liabilities of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole on its existing debts (including contingent
liabilities) as such debts become absolute and matured; **** (b)
the Surviving Corporation will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably
small amount of capital for the operation of the business in which it is
engaged or proposed to be engaged by Parent following such date; and (c)

contingent and other liabilities, as they mature.

Sub or the Guarantors, on the one hand, and any member of the CompanyÂ’s
management or directors, on the other hand, as of the date hereof that relate

Directors of the Company approving this Agreement, the Merger and the other
Transactions contemplated thereby for purposes of the applicable provisions
of the DGCL, neither Parent nor Merger Sub, alone or together with any other
person, was at any time, or became, an "interested stockholder" thereunder or
has taken any action that would cause any anti-takeover statute under the
DGCL to be applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any Transactions.

  

SECTION 4.9 _Brokers and Other Advisors_. No broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other Person is entitled to any brokerÂ’s, finderÂ’s,
financial advisorÂ’s or other similar fee or commission in connection with
the Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries except for Persons whose fees and expenses will be
paid by Parent.

was not previously provided to Parent or its Representatives; and (ii) enter
into, engage in, and maintain discussions or negotiations with respect to
Takeover Proposals or otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in,

written Takeover Proposal from any Person or group of Persons, which Takeover
Proposal was made on or after the No-Shop Period Start Date, (A) the Company

clarify the terms and conditions thereof and (B) if the Board of Directors of
the Company, or any committee thereof, determines in good faith, after

material developments regarding a Public Equity Takeover Proposal and upon
the reasonable request of Parent shall apprise Parent of the status of such
Takeover Proposal. The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not
enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the
date hereof which prohibits the Company from providing such information to
Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that,

(e) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.3(e), the Board of
Directors of the Company shall not (i)(A) change, qualify, withdraw or
modify, or publicly propose to change, qualify, withdraw or modify, in a
manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, (B) take any
action or make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a
tender offer or exchange offer other than a recommendation against such offer
or a temporary "stop, look and listen" communication by the Board of
Directors of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act,
or (C) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend
to the stockholders of the Company a Takeover Proposal, (any action described
in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) authorize the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, merger, acquisition or
similar agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) (each, a " _Company Acquisition
Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (1) the Board
of Directors of the Company may change, qualify, withdraw or modify, in any
manner adverse to the Parent, the Company Board Recommendation if such Board
determines in good faith for reasons not related to the receipt of a Takeover
Proposal, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action could reasonably be determined to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law provided, however, that nothing in this
clause (1) will relieve the Company of any of its obligations under the first
sentence of Section 5.1(a), and/or (2) if the Board of Directors of
the Company receives a Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with independent
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, constitutes a Superior
Proposal, the Company may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal if the Company concurrently terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(d)(ii) provided however, that, except with respect to a Public
Equity Superior Proposal (w) the Company has given Parent at least five (5)
business daysÂ’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action
(which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of any such
Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party making such Superior
Proposal) and has contemporaneously provided a copy of the relevant proposed
transaction agreements with the party making such Superior Proposal and other
material documents), (x) the Company has negotiated in good faith with Parent
during such notice period to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable
the Parent to propose changes to the terms of this Agreement, the Financing
Letters and the Guarantees that would cause such Superior Proposal to no
longer constitute a Superior Proposal, (y) the Board of Directors of the
Company shall have considered in good faith any changes to this Agreement,
the Financing Letters and the Guarantees proposed in writing by Parent and
shall have determined that the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute
a Superior Proposal if such changes were to be given effect, and (z) in the
event of any material change to the material terms of such Superior Proposal,
the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent an additional
notice and the notice period shall have recommenced; and _provided_ , 
_further_ that the Company has complied in all material respects with
its obligations under this Section 5.3 and _provided_ , _further_ , that any

        



  

purported termination of this Agreement pursuant to this sentence shall be
void and of no force or effect, unless the Company pays Parent the
Termination Fee in accordance with Section 7.3 prior to or concurrently with
such termination.

  

(f) Nothing in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit the Board of Directors of the
Company from taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a)
of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, or other
applicable Law, if such Board determines, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that failure to so disclose such position could constitute a
violation of applicable Law. In addition, it is understood and agreed that,
for purposes of this Agreement (including Article VII), a factually accurate
public statement by the Company that only describes the CompanyÂ’s receipt of
a Takeover Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto,
or any temporary "stop, look and listen" communication by the Board of
Directors of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d.9(f) of the Exchange Act, or
any similar temporary communication to the stockholders of the Company, shall
not constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or a withdrawal or
modification, or proposal by the Board of Directors of the Company to
withdraw or modify, such BoardÂ’s recommendation of this Agreement or the
Transactions, or an approval or recommendation with respect to any Takeover
Proposal.

  

(g) As used in this Agreement, " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other than Parent and its
Subsidiaries) relating to, in a single transaction or series of related
transactions, any (A) acquisition of assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (including securities of Subsidiaries, but excluding sales of
assets in the ordinary course of business) equal to 20% or more of the
CompanyÂ’s consolidated assets or to which 20% or more of the CompanyÂ’s
revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable, (B)
acquisition of 20% or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock, (C)
tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person
beneficially owning 20% or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock, (D)
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company or (E) any combination of the foregoing
types of transactions if the sum of the percentage of consolidated assets,
consolidated revenues or earnings and Company Common Stock involved is 20% or
more; in each case, other than the Transactions.

  

(h) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any bona
fide written Takeover Proposal on terms which the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s
outside legal counsel and independent financial advisors, to be
more favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of Company
Common Stock than the Merger, taking into account all the terms and
conditions of such proposal (including the likelihood and timing of
consummation thereof), and this Agreement (including any changes to the terms
of this Agreement proposed by Parent to the Company in writing in response to
such proposal or otherwise),   _provided_ that for purposes of
the definition of "Superior Proposal", the

        



  

references to "20%" in the definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to
be references to "50%."

  

SECTION 5.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
parties hereto shall cooperate with the other parties and use (and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best
efforts to promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or
cause to be done, all things, necessary, proper or advisable to cause the
conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable and to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Transactions, including preparing and filing promptly and
fully all documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions,
statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other
documents (including any required or recommended filings under applicable
Antitrust Laws), and (ii) obtain all approvals, consents, registrations,
permits, authorizations and other confirmations from any Governmental
Authority or third party necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Transactions. For purposes hereof, " _Antitrust Laws_ " means the Sherman
Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended, all applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws and all
other applicable Laws issued by a Governmental Authority that are designed or
intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition
through merger or acquisition.

  

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (i) each party
hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as promptly as
practicable and in any event within ten business days of the date hereof and
to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions
consistent with this Section 5.4 necessary to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act (including
any extensions thereof) as soon as practicable; (ii) Parent agrees to file
with the European Commission as promptly as reasonably practicable the Form
CO, if any, required for the Transactions pursuant to the EC Merger
Regulation and the Company agrees to provide Parent as promptly
as practicable with such assistance as Parent reasonably requests for the
purposes of filing such Form CO and, if such a filing is made, each party
agrees to supply as promptly as practical any additional information and
documentary material that may be required or requested by the European
Commission and use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken
all other actions consistent with this Section 5.4 necessary to obtain a
decision from the European Commission declaring the Transactions compatible
with the Common Market; and (iii) the Company and Parent shall each use its
reasonable best efforts to (x) take all action necessary to ensure that no
state takeover statute or similar Law is or becomes applicable to any of the
Transactions and (y) if any state takeover statute or similar Law becomes
applicable to any of the Transactions, take all action necessary to ensure
that the Transactions may be

        



  

consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise minimize the effect of such Law on the Transactions.

  

(c) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions
and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a
Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions, including any proceeding
initiated by a private party, and (ii) keep the other party informed in all
material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any material
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the
Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice, the European Commission or any other Governmental Authority and of
any material communication received or given in connection with any
proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of
the Transactions. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, each of the parties hereto shall have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the other on, all
the information relating to the other parties and their
respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that appears in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions, other than "4(c)
documents" as that term is used in the rules and regulations under the HSR
Act.

  

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 5.4, each of the parties hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may
be asserted by a Governmental Authority with respect to the application
of Antitrust Laws to the Transactions.  Without limiting any other provision
hereof, Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to
(i) avoid the entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree,
decision, order or judgment that would restrain, prevent or delay the
consummation of the Transactions, on or before the Walk-Away Date, including
by defending through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court
by any Person, and (ii) avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under
any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with
respect to the Transactions so as to enable the consummation of the
Transactions to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no
later than the Walk-Away Date).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take all such actions,
including (y) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent
decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of such assets or businesses of Parent (or any of its
subsidiaries) and (z) otherwise taking or committing to take actions that
limit Parent or its subsidiariesÂ’ freedom of action with respect to, or its
ability to retain, one or more of its or its subsidiariesÂ’ businesses,
product lines or assets, in each case, as may be required in order to avoid
the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order, or other decision or order in any suit or proceeding under
Antitrust Laws, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or
materially delaying the consummation of the Transactions; _provided, however_
, that Parent shall not be required to take any such actions which

        



  

would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company
shall take such of the foregoing actions as Parent may request; _provided_
 that any such action is conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger.

  

SECTION 5.5 _Financing_.

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and
Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing on
the terms and conditions described in the Financing Letters (or terms no less
favorable to Parent or the Company (including with respect to the
conditionality thereof)) and shall not permit any amendment or modification
to be made to, or any waiver of any material provision or remedy under the
Financing Letters, if such amendment, modification, waiver or remedy reduces
the aggregate amount of the Financing or amends the conditions precedent to
the Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to delay or
prevent the Closing Date or make the funding of the Financing less likely to
occur; _provided_ that Parent and Merger Sub may replace and amend the Debt
Commitment Letters so long as (i) the aggregate amount of the debt financing
contemplated thereby is not decreased by an amount that exceeds the amount,
if any, by which the aggregate amount of the equity financing contemplated by
the Equity Financing Letters is increased, (ii) the terms are no less
favorable to Parent or the Company, including with respect to conditionality
thereof, and (iii) would not expand the conditions to the debt financing set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letters as of the date hereof in a manner that
would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the Closing; and in any such
event Parent shall disclose to the Company its intention to obtain such
alternative financing, shall keep the Company informed of the terms thereof
and shall deliver to the Company final drafts of the Debt Commitment Letters
providing for such alternative financing and, if requested to do so, the
Company shall within a reasonable time (and in no event more than 3 business
days thereafter) inform Parent as to whether it agrees that such alternative
financing is on terms no less favorable (including, with respect to the
conditionality thereof) to the Company than the Financing Letters. For
purposes of this Section 5.5, references to "Financing" shall include the
financing contemplated by the Financing Letters as permitted to be amended,
modified or replaced by this Section 5.5(a) and references to "Debt
Commitment Letters" shall include such documents as permitted to be amended,
modified or replaced by this Section 5.5(a). Each of Parent and Merger
Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts (i) to maintain in effect
the Financing Letters and to negotiate definitive agreements with respect to
the Debt Commitment Letters on the terms and conditions (including the
flex provisions) contained in the Debt Commitment Letters (or on terms no
less favorable to Parent or Merger Sub than the terms and conditions
(including flex provisions) in the Debt Commitment Letters), (ii) to satisfy
all conditions applicable to it and within its control in such
definitive agreements and consummate the Financing at or prior to the
Closing, and (iii) to comply with its obligations under the Financing
Letters. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis
and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing and provide to the Company copies of all documents related to the
Financing

        



  

(other than any ancillary documents subject to confidentiality agreements,
including fee letters and engagement letters). In the event that all
conditions in the Financing Letters (other than in connection with the Debt
Financing, the availability of funding of any of the Equity Financing) have
been satisfied or, upon funding will be satisfied, and taking into account
the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub with respect to bridge financing,
Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause such
lenders and the other Persons providing such Debt Financing to fund on the
Closing Date the Debt Financing required to consummate the Merger and the
other Transactions. In the event that (i) all conditions in Sections 6.1 and
6.2 have been satisfied (or, with respect to certificates to be delivered at
the Closing, are capable of being satisfied upon the Closing) at the time
when the Closing would have occurred but for the failure of the Equity
Financing to be funded, (ii) the financing provided for by the
Debt Commitment Letters (or, if alternative financing is being used in
accordance with this Section 5.5, pursuant to the commitments with respect
thereto) has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity
Financing is funded at the Closing, and (iii) the Company has irrevocably
confirmed that if the Equity Financing and the Debt Financing are funded such
that the Closing pursuant to Article II could occur, the Company is willing
to waive all conditions in Section 6.3, Parent shall enforce its rights under
the Equity Funding Letters to cause the Equity Financing to be funded at the
Closing. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions (including the flex provisions) contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters, (A) Parent and Merger Sub shall immediately notify the
Company and (B) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts
to arrange and obtain alternative financing from alternative sources in an
amount sufficient to consummate the Transactions with terms and conditions
not materially less favorable to Parent than the terms and conditions set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letters (including the flex provisions) (as
determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent) as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event but no later than the final day of the
Marketing Period. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of any material
breach by any party to the Financing Letters or of any condition not likely
to be satisfied, in each case, of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware or
any termination of the Financing Letters. For the avoidance of doubt, in the
event that (x) all or any portion of the Debt Financing structured
as privately offered notes is not yet received by Parent or Merger Sub, (y)
the conditions to closing in Article VI (other than the delivery of
officersÂ’ certificates contemplated in Sections 6.2(a), 6.2(b), 6.3(a) or
6.3(b)) shall have been satisfied or waived and (z) the bridge facilities
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters (or alternative bridge financing
obtained in accordance with this Agreement) are available in all material
respects on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions)
described in the Debt Commitment Letters (or described in replacements
thereof on terms and conditions no less favorable to Parent or Merger Sub or
alternative financing thereof), then Parent shall cause the proceeds of such
bridge financing (or replacement or alternative financing) to be used to
replace such privately offered note financing no later than the final day of
the Marketing Period. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the
obtaining of the Financing, or any alternative financing, is not a condition
to Closing. Notwithstanding anything contained

        



  

in this Section 5.5 or in any other provision of this Agreement, in no event
shall Parent or Merger Sub be required (1) to amend or waive any of the terms
or conditions hereof or (2) to consummate the Closing any earlier than the
final day of the Marketing Period.

  

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide to Parent and Merger
Sub, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide, at ParentÂ’s sole expense,
and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives, including
legal and accounting, to provide, all cooperation reasonably requested by
Parent and that is customary in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing or any permitted replacement, amended, modified or alternative
financing (collectively with the Financing, the " _Available Financing_ ")
and the other Transactions ( _provided_ that such requested cooperation does
not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries), including (i) furnishing Parent and Merger Sub and their
Financing sources as promptly as practicable with financial and other
pertinent information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be
reasonably requested in writing by Parent, including all financial statements
and financial and other data of the type required by Regulation S-X
(other than Item 3-10 of Regulation S-X) and Regulation S-K under
the Securities Act for registered offerings of debt securities, and of the
type and form customarily included in offering documents used in private
placements under Rule 144A of the Securities Act, to consummate the offerings
of debt securities contemplated by the Available Financing at the time during
the CompanyÂ’s fiscal year such offerings will be made (information required
to be delivered pursuant to this clause (i) being referred to as, the "
_Required Information_ "), (ii) participating in a reasonable number of
meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting
sessions and sessions with rating agencies in connection with the Available
Financing, (iii) assisting with the preparation of materials for rating
agency presentations, offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank
information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents required in
connection with the Available Financing; _provided_ that any private
placement memoranda or prospectuses in relation to debt securities need not
be issued by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and _ provided_ ,
_further_ , that any private placement memoranda or prospectuses shall
contain disclosure and financial statements reflecting the Surviving
Corporation and/or its Subsidiaries as the obligor, (iv) using reasonable
best efforts to obtain accountantÂ’s comfort letters, legal opinions, surveys
and title insurance reasonably requested by Parent, (v) taking all corporate
actions, subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time, reasonably
requested by Parent to permit the consummation of the Available Financing and
to permit the proceeds thereof to be made available to the Surviving
Corporation immediately after the Effective Time, (vi) executing and
delivering any pledge and security documents, other definitive financing
documents or other certificates, or documents as may be requested by Parent
(including a certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries with respect to solvency matters and consents of
accountants for use of their reports in any material relating to the
Available Financing) and (vii) facilitating the consummation of the Available
Financing and the direct borrowing or incurrence of all proceeds of the
Available Financing, by the Surviving Corporation immediately following the
Effective Time; _ provided, however,_

        



  

that, no obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any
certificate, document or instrument (other than the representation letter
referred to above) shall be effective until the Effective Time and, none of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any
commitment or other similar fee or incur any other liability in connection
with the Available Financing prior to the Effective Time. The Company hereby
consents to the use of its and its SubsidiariesÂ’ logos in connection with the
Available Financing; _provided_ that such logos are used solely in a manner
that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company,
reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees) incurred by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries contemplated by this Section 5.5 and shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs
or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing and any information used in connection
therewith, except with respect to any information provided by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.

  

(c) In no event shall Parent, Merger Sub or any member of the Equity Provider
Group (i) retain any financial advisor on an exclusive basis other than (x)
advisors to which the Board of Directors of the Company or the Company
consents (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned) or (y) Affiliates of any member of the Equity Provider Group or
(ii) enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding, with any bank or
investment bank or other potential provider of debt or equity financing on an
exclusive basis (or otherwise on terms that could reasonably be expected to
prevent such provider from providing or seeking to provide such financing to
any third party in connection with a transaction relating to the Company or
its Subsidiaries), in connection with the Merger or the Transactions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing in clause (ii) of this Section 5.5(c), but
subject to the other terms of this Agreement, including Section 5.4, Parent
may seek and obtain equity commitments and equity financing with respect to
the Parent Equity Share from (A) the partners of Silver Lake Partners III,
L.P. and TPG Partners V, L.P. (" _Parent Limited Partners_ "), the parties
set forth in Section 5.5 of the Company Disclosure Schedule and their
affiliates and other Persons consented to by the Company and (B) after the
No-Shop Period Start Date, other Persons; provided that, (1) such
other Persons are not, and their respective Affiliates are not, and do
not subsequently become, lenders under the Debt Commitment Letters (or
any alternative debt financing) on an exclusive basis and are not Excluded
Parties that the Company has identified to Parent, and (2) doing so does not
(y) expand in any respect upon the conditions precedent and other
contingencies to the Financing set forth in the Financing Letters as of the
date hereof or (z) prevent, impair or delay in any respect the availability
of the Financing under the Financing Letters or the consumption of the Merger
and other Transactions. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Parent Equity
Share_ " means the amount of equity financing committed to be provided by the
Equity Providers pursuant to the Equity

   

42  

   

Funding Letters. Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any member of the Equity
Provider Group shall cause or induce any Person to take any action that, if
taken by Parent, Merger Sub or any member of the Equity Provider Group, would
be a breach of, or would otherwise not be permitted by, this Section 5.5(c).

  

SECTION 5.6 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company.  Except with respect to
any Company Adverse Recommendation Change or any action taken pursuant
thereto, and in accordance with Section 5.3 and Article VII, so long as this
Agreement is in effect, neither the Company nor Parent shall issue or cause
the publication of any press release or other public announcement (to the
extent not previously issued or made in accordance with this Agreement) with
respect to the Merger, this Agreement or the other Transactions without the
prior consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), except as may be required by Law, applicable fiduciary
duties or by any applicable listing agreement with a national securities
exchange as determined in the good faith judgment of the party proposing to
make such release (in which case such party shall not issue or cause the
publication of such press release or other public announcement without prior
consultation with the other party).

  

SECTION 5.7 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company shall afford to
Parent and ParentÂ’s representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours to the CompanyÂ’s officers, employees, agents, properties,
books, Contracts and records and the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent
such information concerning its business, personnel, assets, liabilities
and properties as Parent may reasonably request (other than any publicly
available document filed by it pursuant to the requirements of Federal or
state securities Laws); _provided_ that Parent and its representatives shall
conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably
with the business or operations of the Company; _provided, however_ , that the
Company shall not be obligated to provide such access or information if the
Company determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing so would violate
applicable Law or a Contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to a
third-party, waive the protection of an attorney-client privilege, or expose
the Company to risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal
information. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that the Company
does not provide access or information in reliance on the preceding sentence,
it shall use its reasonable best efforts to communicate, to the extent
feasible, the applicable information in a way that would not violate the
applicable Law, Contract or obligation or risk waiver of such privilege.
Without limiting the generality of this Section 5.7, from the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company will furnish to the Parent
promptly after becoming available, monthly financial statements including an
unaudited balance sheet, income statement and statement of cash flows for
each month through the Closing Date, as well as any update of its outlook for
the quarter or the balance of the fiscal year, as it may prepare for
managementÂ’s internal use. Until the Effective Time, the information provided
will be subject to the terms of the letter agreement, dated as of May 7,
2007,

        



  

between Parent and Silver Lake Management Company, L.L.C. and TPG Capital,
L.P. (as it may be amended from time to time, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent shall not, and shall cause its representatives not to, use
such information for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the
Transactions.

  

SECTION 5.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i)
any notice or other communication received by such party from
any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions or from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Transactions, if the subject matter of such communication
or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be material to the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent and (ii) any actions, suits,
claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partyÂ’s
knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the
Transactions.

  

SECTION 5.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Company and the Surviving Corporation to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless
each individual who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the
Effective Time was, a director or officer of the Company or of a Subsidiary
of the Company (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the "
_Indemnitees_ ") with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages,
judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or
compromise) and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in
connection with any claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation (whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative), whenever asserted, based
on or arising out of, in whole or in part, (A) the fact that an Indemnitee
was a director or officer of the Company or such Subsidiary or (B) acts or
omissions by an Indemnitee in the IndemniteeÂ’s capacity as a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Company or such Subsidiary or taken at the
request of the Company or such Subsidiary (including in connection with
serving at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary as a director,
officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of another Person (including
any employee benefit plan)), in each case under (A) or (B), at, or at any
time prior to, the Effective Time (including any claim, suit,
action, proceeding or investigation relating in whole or in part to the
Transactions), to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, and (ii)
assume all obligations of the Company and such Subsidiaries to the
Indemnitees in respect of indemnification and exculpation from liabilities
for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided
in (x) the Company Charter Documents and the organizational documents of such
Subsidiaries as currently in effect and (y) the indemnification agreements
listed on Section 5.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, which shall survive
the Transactions and continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their respective terms. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, from and
after the Effective Time until six years from the Effective Time, shall
cause, unless otherwise required by law, the certificate of incorporation and
by-laws of the Surviving

        



  

Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with
respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and officers and
indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the
Company Charter Documents, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed
or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of the Indemnitees. In addition, from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Company and the Surviving
Corporation to, pay any expenses (including fees and expenses of legal
counsel) of any Indemnitee under this Section 5.9 (including in connection
with enforcing the indemnity and other obligations referred to in this
Section 5.9) as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, provided that the person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances to the extent required by
applicable Law.

  

(b) An Indemnitee shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assume and
control the defense of any litigation, claim or proceeding relating to any
acts or omissions covered under this Section 5.9 (each, a " _Claim_ ") with
counsel selected by the Indemnitee, which counsel shall be reasonably
acceptable to Parent; _provided, however_ , that Parent (i) shall be
permitted to participate in the defense of such Claim at its own expense,
(ii) shall not be liable for any settlement effected without ParentÂ’s written
consent and (iii) shall not be liable for the fees and expenses of more than
one counsel in addition to any local counsel. Each of Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation and the Indemnitees shall cooperate in the defense of
any Claim and shall provide access to properties and individuals as
reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be furnished records,
information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in
connection therewith.  Nothing in this Section 5.9(b) shall relieve Parent of
its indemnity and other obligations set forth in Section 5.9(a) except to the
extent provided in clause (ii) above.

  

(c) For the six-year period commencing immediately after the Effective Time,
Parent shall maintain in effect the CompanyÂ’s current directorsÂ’ and
officersÂ’ liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time with respect to those persons who are currently
(and any additional persons who prior to the Effective Time become) covered
by the CompanyÂ’s directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance policy on terms
and scope with respect to such coverage, and in amount, not less favorable to
such individuals than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof (or
Parent may substitute therefor policies, issued by reputable insurers, of at
least the same coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time, including a "tail" policy); _provided, however_ , that, if the
aggregate annual premiums for such insurance shall exceed 300% of the
current aggregate annual premium, then Parent shall provide or cause to be
provided a policy for the applicable individuals with the best coverage
as shall then be available at an annual premium of 300% of the current
aggregate annual premium; _provided_ that any such replacement or substitution
of insurance policies shall not result in gaps in coverage and; _provided
further, however_ , that at no time shall such coverage be less

        



  

than the directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance coverage then provided
by Parent to its directors and officers.

  

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.9 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or
her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
by contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation under this Section 5.9 shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom
this Section 5.9 applies unless (x) such termination or modification is
required by applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee shall have
consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly
agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.9 applies shall be third
party beneficiaries of this Section 5.9).

  

(e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the
obligations thereof set forth in this Section 5.9.

  

SECTION 5.10 _Fees and Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated,
all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, this Agreement
and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring or required to
incur such fees or expenses, except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Parent shall pay
all filing fees required under the HSR Act or other antitrust filings with
any Governmental Authority by reason of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

SECTION 5.11 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take such steps as may be reasonably requested by any party hereto to cause
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)
pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who is a director or officer
of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act in accordance with that certain No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999
issued by the SEC regarding such matters.

  

SECTION 5.12 _Employee Matters_.

  

(a) For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each active employee of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (" _Company Employees_ ") annual base salary and
base wages, cash incentive compensation opportunities and benefits (excluding
equity-based compensation), in each case, that are no less favorable, in the
aggregate, than such annual base salary and base wages, cash incentive
compensation opportunities and

        



  

benefits (excluding equity-based compensation) provided to the Company
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, (i) Parent shall or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to provide Company Employees whose employment
terminates during the one-year period following the Effective Time with
severance benefits at levels no less than and pursuant to the terms of the
CompanyÂ’s severance plan consistent with its past practice and (ii) such
severance benefits shall be determined taking into account the service
crediting provisions set forth in Section 5.12(b) below.

  

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Parent
and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employee after the
Effective Time (including the Company Plans) (the " _New Plans_ "), each
Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the
Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled,
before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar
Company employee benefit plan in which such Company Employee participated or
was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time,
_provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its
application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the
same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under a Company
Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the
Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be
waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the
extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived under the comparable Old
Plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such Company Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall cause any
eligible expenses incurred by any Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date such Company EmployeeÂ’s participation in the corresponding New Plan
begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan.

  

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor all obligations under the Company
Plans and compensation and severance arrangements and agreements in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective
Time, provided that, subject to the requirements of Section 5.12(a),
nothing herein shall prohibit the Surviving

        



  

Corporation from amending or terminating any particular Company Plan to the
extent permitted by its terms or applicable Law.

  

(d) Parent shall unconditionally assume all of the obligations of the Company
under its severance agreements, by written instrument delivered to the
participant or executive (or his or her beneficiary or estate, as
applicable), in accordance with the terms of such agreements.

  

(e) The provisions of this Section 5.12 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no current or former employee or any other
individual associate therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third
party beneficiary of the Agreement and nothing herein shall be construed as
an amendment to any Company Plan for any purpose.

  

SECTION 5.13 _Delisting_. Parent shall cause the CompanyÂ’s securities to be
de-listed from the New York Stock Exchange and de-registered under
the Exchange Act as soon as practicable following the Effective Time.

  

SECTION 5.14 _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. The Company shall suspend or
terminate its Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ") as soon as
practicable. The Company agrees that, promptly following the execution of
this Agreement, it shall provide notice to each of the Communications Workers
of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers pursuant
to their respective collective bargaining agreements with the Company of the
CompanyÂ’s intention to suspend or terminate the ESPP as soon as practicable
after the date of this Agreement. The Company shall eliminate the inclusion
of the Company Common Stock (not including mutual funds and other
collective investment products which may include Company Common Stock in
their holdings) in the CompanyÂ’s 401(k) plans as soon as practicable after
the date of this Agreement.

  

SECTION 5.15 _Parent Expenditure_. Between the date of this Agreement and the

Merger under any other Foreign Antitrust Laws shall have been terminated or

reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, assuming
consummation of the Merger; and

  

(c) _No Injunctions or Restraints_. No Law, injunction, judgment or
ruling enacted, promulgated, issued, entered, amended or enforced by any

if given as of a specific date, at and as of such date), except, in the case
of this clause (4), where the failure to be true and correct does not have

SECTION 6.4 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. None of the Company, Parent
or Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in Section

ARTICLE VII 
  
  _Termination_

  

SECTION 7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and

SECTION 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of
this Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, written notice thereof shall be
given to the other party or parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant
to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become

and (ii) nothing shall relieve any party from liability for fraud.

  

SECTION 7.3 _Termination Fee_.

        



  

(a) In the event that:

  

(i) (A) a Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly made, proposed or
communicated, after the date hereof and not abandoned prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting or prior to the termination of this Agreement if there
has been no Company Stockholders Meeting, and (B) following the occurrence of
an event described in the preceding clause (A), this Agreement is terminated
by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i) or Section 7.1(b)(iii)
or by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i) and (C) within 12 months of the
date this Agreement is terminated, the Company enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal and such Takeover Proposal is
consummated ( _provided_ that for purposes of clause (C) of this Section
7.3(a)(i), the references to "20%" in the definition of Takeover Proposal
shall be deemed to be references to "50%"); or

  

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
7.1(d)(ii); or

  

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii);

Fee (as defined below) (less the amount of Parent Expenses, if any,
previously paid to Parent or its designees by the Company pursuant to Section
7.3(c)), by wire transfer of same day funds, it being understood that in no
event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than
one occasion. " _Termination Fee_ " shall mean an amount equal to $250
million, except (x) in the event that this Agreement is terminated by the
Company pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) in order to enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to a Takeover Proposal with an Excluded Party, or (y)
in the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section
7.1(c)(ii) in a circumstance in which the event giving rise to the right of
termination is based solely on the submission of a Takeover Proposal by a
party that submitted a written Takeover Proposal prior to the No-Shop Period
Start Date, in which cases the Termination Fee shall mean an amount equal to
$80 million. If the Termination Fee becomes payable pursuant to Section
7.3(a)(i) or (iii), it shall be paid no later than two business days after
the event that causes the Termination Fee to be payable. If the Termination
Fee becomes payable pursuant to Section 7.3(a)(ii), it shall be paid prior
to, and such payment shall be a condition precedent to, the termination of
this Agreement.

  

(b) In the event that:

  

(i) the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i);
or

        



  

(ii) the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(d)(iii);

  

then in any such event under clause (i) or (ii) of this Section
7.3(b), Parent shall pay to the Company a termination fee of $250 million in
cash (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ "), it being understood that in no event
shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one
occasion.

  

(c) In the event that:

  

(i) (A) a Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly made, proposed or
communicated, after the date hereof and not abandoned prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting, and (B) following the occurrence of an event described
in the preceding clause (A), this Agreement is terminated by the Company or
the Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii) (provided that for purposes of
this clause (c)(i) of this Section 7.1, the references to "20%" in the
definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to
"50%"); or

  

(ii) Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(iii);

  

then in any such event under clause (i) or (ii) of this Section 7.3(c), the
Company shall pay Parent or its designees, as promptly as possible (but
in any event within 2 business days) following the delivery by Parent of
an invoice therefor, all out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by Parent
or Merger Sub in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Financing (" _Parent Expenses_ "); provided that the
Company shall not be required to pay more than an aggregate of $30 million in
Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section 7.3(c).

  

(d) Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to Section 7.3(a), 7.3(b) or

account designated by the party entitled to receive such payment.

  

(e) Each of the parties hereto acknowledge that the agreements contained in
this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the Transactions, and that without
these agreements, the other party would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails to timely
pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.3, and, in order to obtain the
payment, Parent or the Company, as the case may be, commences a suit which
results in a judgment against the other party for the payment set forth in
this Section 7.3, such paying party shall pay the other party its reasonable
and documented costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented
attorneysÂ’ fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on such
amount at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment
was required to be made through the date such payment was actually received.

   

54  

   

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject
to the CompanyÂ’s rights set forth in the second to last sentence of this
Section 7.3(f) and Section 8.8, the CompanyÂ’s right to receive payment of the
Parent Termination Fee from Parent or the Guarantors pursuant to the
Guarantees in respect thereof shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Company and its Subsidiaries against Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantors or
any of their respective former, current or future general or limited
partners, stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers or Affiliates
for the loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be
consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and
upon payment of such amount none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantors or any
of their former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders,
managers, members, directors, officers or Affiliates shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions (except that Parent shall also be obligated with respect to
Section 7.3(e) and the Guarantors under the Guarantees in respect of Section
7.3(e)). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement but
subject to Section 8.8 and the proviso to this sentence, ParentÂ’s right to
receive payment from the Company of (i) the Parent Expenses pursuant to
Section 7.3(c) and/or (ii) the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.3(a)
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the
Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or
future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members or
Affiliates (collectively, "Company Related Parties") for the loss suffered as
a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated or for a breach or
failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such
amount(s), none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions (except that the Company shall also be obligated with respect to
Section 7.3(e) and for any of its expense reimbursement and indemnification
obligations contained in Section 5.5; provided that, if this Agreement shall
have been terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.2(c)(iii), Parent shall
be entitled to recover from the Company its damages taking into account any
payment of Parent Expenses relating to or arising out of such breach or
failure to perform. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed
that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance of ParentÂ’s
obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded to fund the Merger in
the event that (i) all conditions in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 have been satisfied
(or, with respect to certificates to be delivered at the Closing, are capable
of being satisfied upon the Closing) at the time when the Closing would have
occurred but for the failure of the Equity Financing to be funded, (ii) the
financing provided for by the Debt Commitment Letters (or, if alternative
financing is being used in accordance with Section 5.5, pursuant to the
commitments with respect thereto) has been funded or will be funded at the
Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing, and (iii) the
Company has irrevocably confirmed that if specific performance is granted and
the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the Closing pursuant
to Article II will occur. For the avoidance of doubt, (1) under
no circumstances will the Company be entitled to monetary damages in excess
of the amount of the Parent Termination Fee and (2) while the Company may
pursue both a grant of specific performance of the type provided by the
preceding sentence and the

        

payment of the Parent Termination Fee under Section 7.1(b), under no
circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance of the type contemplated by the preceding
sentence and any money damages, including all or any portion of the Parent
Termination Fee.

  _Miscellaneous_

  

SECTION 8.1 _No Survival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time. This
Section 8.1 shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties that by

this Agreement in accordance with its terms and (ii) terminate as of the
Effective Time.

  

SECTION 8.2 _Amendment or Supplement_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects,
whether before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, by
written agreement of the parties hereto, by action taken by their
respective Boards of Directors; _provided, however,_ that following approval
of the Transactions by the stockholders of the Company, there shall be no
amendment or change to the provisions hereof which by Law would require
further approval by the stockholders of the Company without such approval.

  

SECTION 8.3 _Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc_. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, any party may, subject to applicable Law, (a) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other party

any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the
part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

  

SECTION 8.4 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in
part, by operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the

that such assignment shall not (i) affect the obligations of any Equity
Provider under the applicable Equity Funding Letter or any Guarantor under
the applicable Guarantee or (ii) impede or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise materially impede
the rights of the

        

stockholders of the Company under this Agreement). No assignment by any
Party shall relieve such Party of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject
to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
