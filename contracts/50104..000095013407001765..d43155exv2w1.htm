Statement will be deemed final and binding upon the Parties. If Buyer gives

days after delivery of such notice of objection, each of Buyers and Sellers
positions with respect to the computation of the Inventory Value will be
submitted to an independent and qualified party mutually selected by the
Parties (the  _"Inspector"_ _)_ such as an accounting firm or
independent inspector, for final resolution. If the computation of the
Inventory Value is submitted to the Inspector for resolution, (x) each Party
will furnish to the Inspector such work papers and other documents and
information relating to the disputed issues as the Inspector may request and
are available to that Party, and will be afforded the opportunity to present
to the Inspector any material relating to such issues and to discuss the same
with the Inspector; (y) the Inspectors determination or computation of the
Inventory Value shall be binding and conclusive on the Parties and will be
deemed to be the final Inventory Value (and judgment thereupon may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction over the Party against which the
same is sought to be enforced); and (z) the fees and expenses of the
Inspector for such determination will be borne fifty percent (50%) by Seller
and fifty percent (50%) by Buyer. 

   

 (d) If the sum of the Inventory Value minus the Inventory Deposit (the  _"Inventory Balance"_ _)_ is greater than zero, then Buyer shall pay to Seller, without offset or deduction, an amount equal to the Inventory Balance by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account or accounts of Seller, as may be designated by Seller. If the amount of the Inventory Balance is less than zero, then Seller shall pay to Buyer, without offset or deduction, an amount equal to such deficit by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account or accounts of Buyer, as may be designated by Buyer. All such undisputed amounts shall be paid by the relevant Party to the other Party within five (5) Business Days of the Inventory Notice Date. All disputed amounts shall be paid by the relevant Party to the other Party within five (5) Business Days of the resolution of such disputed amounts. All amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 2.06_ (both disputed and undisputed amounts) shall bear interest from and including the date payment is scheduled to be made to, but excluding, the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to ten percent (10%) for the first thirty (30) days such payment is past due and at a rate per annum equal to fifteen percent (15%) for all subsequent periods such payment is past due, in either event not to exceed the maximum rate permitted by Applicable Law.

Buyer shall have the right to review and approve such application prior to

 (iv) Buyer shall have the right to approve, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, any restrictions or commitments that would materially affect Buyers use of the Refinery Real Property after the satisfaction of the Subdivision Condition; 

   

 (v) Buyer and Seller shall enter into and execute and deliver a Blend Plant Lease, substantially in the form of _Exhibit D_ (the  _"Blend Plant Lease"_ _)_  pursuant to which Buyer shall license the Blend Plant Real Property and lease the Blend Plant Improvements to Seller from the Closing Date until the Subdivision Condition has been satisfied; and

 (f) Prior to the conveyance of the Blend Plant Real Property to Seller as contemplated hereunder, Buyer and Seller shall grant to each other such easements and rights of way on the Blend Plant Real Property and the Processing Unit Real Property the other party reasonably requests in connection with its ownership and operation of the Processing Unit Real Property and the Blend Plant Real Property, respectively.

Nothing in this  _Section 8.11_ shall relieve Seller from a remedy Buyer may have from Sellers breach of any representation or warranty contained in _ARTICLE IV_ ; _provided, however,_ Buyer agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to pursue claims, if any, that it may have against the Title Company pursuant to the Title Policies before making any claim against Seller for any breach of Sellers representations or warranties contained in _Sections 4.04_ and _4.06_ related to the Real Property; _provided further_ that Buyer and Seller shall cooperate, including entering into any tolling agreements and take any other action reasonably required to preserve Buyers claims against Seller during the pendency of Buyers pursuit of claims against the Title Company.

Buyer is aware that these rights are Licensed Technology Rights where (A) such rights are freely transferable without the permission of the licensor or vendor, (B) such Licensed Technology Rights are or have been in Use by Seller or its Affiliates at the Effective Time, and (C) such transfer would not require Seller or Shell Oil Company or its Affiliates to forego future Use of the Licensed Technology Rights for its or their own benefit as currently permitted under the Licensed Technology Rights. Buyer acknowledges that the 

  

 _Refinery Asset Purchase Agreement

Licensed Technology Rights exclude any source code or other aspects of
Software of third parties unless such source code or other aspects of
Software has been licensed to Seller pursuant to the applicable license for
such Licensed Technology Rights or where Seller does not have a right
to provide such other aspects of Software or source code in said license. Any
fees or costs required to be paid for such transfer shall be paid by
Seller. 

   

 (b) _Non-assignable or non-transferable Licensed Technology Rights._  All non-assignable, non-transferable Licensed Technology Rights are listed on _Schedule 9.04(b)._ Buyer recognizes that the Licensed Technology Rights listed on _Schedule 9.04(b)_ are not freely assignable without the permission of the respective licensor or vendor. Seller or its Affiliate, at the written request of Buyer, agrees to contact the licensor or vendor and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a permitted transfer of the Licensed Technology Rights or obtain, in consultation with Buyer, a new, non-transferable license for Use by Buyer solely in the operations of the Refinery on such terms as are reasonably satisfactory to Buyer. In that event, all fees and costs necessary to transfer the Licensed Technology Rights or to acquire a new license commensurate therewith to Buyer, shall be paid by Buyer. Upon such transfer, Seller agrees that all royalties, licensing fees and similar cost payable up to the Effective Time for such Licensed Technology Rights listed on _Schedule 9.04(b)_ shall be fully paid by Seller for Use by Buyer in the operation of the Refinery, it being understood that Buyer shall be responsible for any such royalties, licensing fees and similar costs payable by Buyer in connection with Buyers Use of such Licensed Technology Rights after the Effective Time under the terms of the applicable licenses. Seller shall or shall cause its Affiliates to make commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the status quo of such non-assignable, non-transferable Licensed Technology Rights until Buyer can secure transfer or a new license to Buyer. 

  

 (c) _Licensed Technology Rights not on Schedule 9.04(a) or 9.04(b)._ Both Buyer and Seller recognize that, because of the complexity of the sale of the Refinery to Buyer, some relevant Licensed Technology Rights for the operations of the Refinery may not be included on  _Schedule 9.04(a)_ or _9.04(b)_. In that event, Seller agrees for a period of at least five (5) years after the Closing Date to (i) identify such Licensed Technology Rights and to notify Buyer thereof and (ii) at Buyers request, use commercially reasonable efforts to transfer such Licensed Technology Rights to Buyer for Use solely in the internal operations of the Refinery, provided that any fees necessary to implement such transfer shall be borne exclusively by Seller. 

 

It is understood that Licensed Technology Rights were acquired by Seller
subject to certain third party obligations. In any assignment or issuance of
a sublicense from Seller to Buyer of any such third party Licensed Technology
Rights under this Section, Buyer agrees to assume all applicable obligations
reasonable and necessary to enable Buyer to Use such Licensed Technology
Rights in the operations of the Refinery. For avoidance of doubt, Seller
shall not be obligated to extend to Buyer any source code or any other
aspects of Software of third parties to the extent not licensed to it under
the applicable licenses for the Licensed Technology Rights or where Seller
does not have a right to provide such other aspects of Software or source
code in said license or maintain for Buyer such third party Licensed
Technology Rights in the same manner and to the same extent as practiced by
Seller prior to the Effective Time, in each case where the extension or
maintenance of such rights would be to the detriment of the rights of Seller
or any of its Affiliates to practice under its own rights and licenses.
Seller shall follow the procedures described in _Section 9.04(a)_ at Buyers
expense, with respect to such non-assignable non-transferable third party
Licensed Technology Rights set forth in _Schedule 9.04(b),_ or at Sellers
expense, with respect to such third party Licensed Technology Rights not on
_Schedule 9.04(a)_ or _9.04(b)._  

  

Upon such transfer, Seller agrees that all royalties, licensing fees and
similar cost payable up to the Effective Time for such Licensed Technology
Rights shall be fully paid for Use by Buyer in the operation of the Refinery,
it being understood that Buyer shall be responsible for any such royalties,
licensing fees 

   

 _Refinery Asset Purchase Agreement 
 Page 40 of 63_ 

    ##### 

  

 

and similar costs payable after the Effective Time for any period of Use by
Buyer after the Effective Time under the terms of the applicable licenses.
For avoidance of doubt, Seller shall be and remains responsible for any and
all such royalties, licensing fees and similar costs payable arising out of
any Use of the Licensed Technology Rights up to the Effective Time. 

   

 9.05 _Term and Termination._ The grants made in this _ARTICLE IX_ are perpetual and shall not be subject to any term. Seller agrees that the licenses granted to the Seller and/or its Affiliates under the TTA are perpetual and irrevocable. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event of any termination of the Technology Transfer Agreement dated January 15, 1998, Seller agrees that all Intellectual Property owned by Texaco, Inc. and licensed to Seller under the TTA, and all Intellectual Property owned by Seller, will each continue to be licensed to Buyer on a perpetual basis, in accordance with the terms of this _ARTICLE IX._  

  

 9.06 _Representations and Warranties._  

   

 (a) Seller represents and warrants that it has the right to grant the licenses of Intellectual Property as set forth in _Section 9.01_ free and clear of any Liens, other than Permitted Encumbrances; and that to the Knowledge of Seller no claim, action, suit, proceeding, governmental or court order, or demand is pending or threatened with respect to any Intellectual Property licensed pursuant to this _ARTICLE IX_. 

  

 (b) Seller represents and warrants that, to the Knowledge of Seller, (i) there are no facts that would support a claim that may result in losses having a Material Adverse Effect on Buyers Use of the Intellectual Property licensed pursuant to this _ARTICLE IX_ in the operations of the Refinery in a manner substantially similar to the Operations and (ii) the Intellectual Property licensed pursuant to this _ARTICLE IX_ and the Use of the Intellectual Property in accordance with such license has not and, does not infringe or otherwise violate any intellectual property or other proprietary or contractual right of a third party except as provided in _Schedule 9.06(b)._ 

  

Except for the representations and warranties and agreements contained in this
_ARTICLE IX_  and this Agreement, any oral or written report, data or other
information provided to Buyer hereunder, whether provided under license or
otherwise, shall be provided on an _" _as is_ " _basis without any
warranties, express or implied including the results or effects obtained
through use of information, or that it is fit for any use intended or can be
used without infringing the patent or copyright rights of a person. Without
any limitation on the preceding, any implied warranty of merchantability and
fitness for a particular purpose is expressly excluded from this  _ARTICLE
IX._ with respect to any information or Intellectual Property provided
hereunder. In no event will any Party be liable for loss of profits, or
indirect, consequential (except for breach of confidentiality and amounts
payable in connection with Third Party Claims) or special damages resulting
from the other Partys use or disclosure of any information or
Intellectual Property. 

   

 9.07 _Export Control._ Buyer agrees to comply with any applicable U.S. export control laws and regulations in regard to any information or data covered by this _ARTICLE IX._  

   

 9.08 _Miscellaneous._ Buyer shall not be entitled to receive and Seller and its Affiliates shall have no obligation to provide any modifications, enhancements or upgrades made by Seller or its Affiliates to any Intellectual Property or Licensed Technology Rights subsequent to the Closing. All rights not expressly granted in this _ARTICLE IX_ to Buyer are retained by Seller and its Affiliates. If Buyer develops any improvements or modifications to the Intellectual Property licensed to it under _Section 9.01_, Buyer shall retain all right, title and interest to such improvements or modifications and

related intellectual property rights therein. Seller shall deliver to Buyer
copies of the Deliverable Items for any software licensed pursuant to this
_ARTICLE IX_ within twenty (20) days after the Closing Date. _"Deliverable
Items"_ means, with respect to Software, all object code, source code (except
for source code and other aspects of Software owned by a third party and
not licensed to Seller under the applicable license therefor) documentation
(including all user and operation manuals), job control information, job
control language, system engineering and design information, and all
databases related to the operation of the Refinery that is being licensed in 
_Section 9.01._

following: 

   

 11.01 _Compliance with Agreement._ Seller shall have performed and complied in all material respects with all covenants, agreements and conditions required by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by Seller prior to the Closing Date. 

  

 11.02 _Representations and Warranties._ The representations and warranties of Seller made in this Agreement (as may be amended by Seller in accordance with _Section 6.03)_ shall be true and correct except to the extent such failures would not have a "Material Adverse Impact," in each case as of the date hereof and on and as of the Closing Date, as though made on and as of the Closing Date, except for representations and warranties that speak as of a specific date or time (which need only be true and correct as of such date or time). For purposes of the preceding sentence, whether a representation and warranty has been satisfied will be determined without regard to any qualifiers relating to materiality or Material Adverse Effect contained in the terms of such representation and warranty. For purposes of this _Section 11.02_ the term "Material Adverse Impact" shall mean if the act(s), omission(s), conduct,occurrence(s), condition(s) or situation(s). are reasonably expected to (i) result in Losses with respect to the value of the Purchased Assets in excess of Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000), or (ii) if not quantifiable, materially impair the ownership or use of the Purchased Assets or the Operations, taken as a whole. 

  

 11.03 _Closing Deliverables._ Seller shall be willing and able to enter into, and shall have delivered or caused to be delivered, at the Closing the items set forth in _Section 3.02_ to which Seller is to be a signatory.

Refinery by Buyer after the Closing Date. 

   

 11.05 _Governmental Consents._ The waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions shall have expired or been terminated under the HSR Act and (ii) any mandatory waiting period or required consent under any applicable state competition or antitrust law or regulation shall have expired or been obtained except where the failure to observe such waiting period or obtain a consent referred to in this clause (ii) would not reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions or have a material adverse effect on the expected benefits of the Contemplated Transactions to Buyer. 

  

 11.06 _Taking of Purchased Assets._ In the event that prior to Closing there shall be instituted or threatened in writing any governmental proceeding or other governmental action, including eminent domain, condemnation or other governmental proceeding, that there is a reasonable probability of Seller or Buyer (after Closing) losing any portion of or interest in the Purchased Assets, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer. Buyer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 15.01_within thirty (30) days from the date of such notice, by giving notice to Seller of its election to terminate this Agreement if such proceeding or other action has or there is a reasonable probability of a taking of property that either materially impacts Operations or that has an estimated value (as determined by the Parties in good faith) in excess of Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000.000). If Buyer is not entitled to or, if entitled, does not timely terminate this Agreement, then Seller shall assign to Buyer at Closing any rights Seller may have to receive any payments (net of any expenses) as a result of any such proceeding or other action. In the event Seller and Buyer disagree over the probable economic impact of any such governmental proceeding or action then the Parties will resolve such dispute pursuant to _ARTICLE XVI._

In the event Seller and Buyer disagree over the probable economic impact of any such adverse change(s) then the Parties will resolve such dispute pursuant to _ARTICLE XVI._  

  

 Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation to correct or cure any such material adverse change(s) over Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) at its sole option and cost prior to Closing, including material adverse change(s) due to a Force Majeure Event. Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to extend the Closing Date for up to thirty (30) days (but no later than the Termination Date) within which to use commercially reasonable efforts to cure or correct any such material adverse change. The foregoing shall not act to modify Sellers obligations under _Section 8.07._ 

  

 If Buyer shall waive the condition to Closing contained in this _Section 11.07_, then Seller shall assign and transfer to Buyer on the Closing Date all of Sellers right, title and interest to any insurance proceeds paid to Seller on account and to the extent of such material adverse change and Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount of any deductible under any applicable insurance policies. 

  

 11.08 _Environmental Consents/Waivers/Amendments._ Seller and Buyer, as applicable,shall have obtained the environmental consents, waivers and amendments set forth in  _Schedule 8.10._

 BUYER UNDERSTANDS, ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT SUCH INDEMNIFICATION MAY INCLUDE AN INDEMNIFICATION OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES FOR AND AGAINST EACH OF THEIR OWN PRE-CLOSING NEGLIGENCE. 

  

 13.02 _Seller s Indemnification of Buyer._ Except as otherwise provided herein and subject to the provisions of this _ARTICLE XIII._ from and after the Closing Date, Seller shall indemnify, defend, save and hold harmless, Buyer, its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, shareholders, partners, counsel, auditors, accountants, agents, advisors and other representatives and each of the heirs, executors, successors and permitted assigns of any of the foregoing (collectively, the _"Buyer Indemnified Parties"_ _)_ from and against any and all Losses to the extent caused by, arising from or incurred in connection with or relate to:

Notwithstanding the foregoing: 

   

(i) a Buyer Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to indemnity hereunder
against Seller under _Sections 13.02(ii) or 13.02(iii)_ unless and until (A)

claim; and (B) Seller shall have failed to cure such claim, if curable,

(ii) a Seller Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to indemnity hereunder
against Buyer under _Sections 13.01(ii) or 13.01(iii)_ unless and until (A)
such Indemnified Party 

  

 _Refinery Asset Purchase Agreement 
 Page 47 of 63_ 

    ##### 

  

   

shall have provided Buyer written notice of such claim; and (B) Buyer shall
have failed to cure such claim, if curable, within sixty (60) days after
Buyers receipt of a Claim Notice. 

  

 13.06 _Procedures Relating to Indemnification for Third Party Claims._  

  

 (a) With respect to any indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim or demand made by any Person against an Indemnified Party (a _"Third Party Claim"),_ such Indemnified Party must provide a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party of the Third Party Claim as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt by such Indemnified Party of notice of the Third Party Claim. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver to the Indemnifying Party copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim; _provided, however,_ that the failure to provide a Claim Notice, or deliver copies of all notices and documents, in a reasonably timely manner shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. 

  

 (b) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall permit the Indemnifying Party to participate in the defense thereof (it being understood that the Indemnified Party shall control such defense unless the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense as provided herein) and, if the Indemnifying Party so chooses and acknowledges its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party therefor, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party provided that such counsel is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding any acknowledgment made pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the Indemnifying Party shall continue to be entitled to assert any limitation on its indemnification responsibility contained in  _Sections 13,08 and 13.09._ Should the Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof provided the Indemnifying Party does not seek to assert any limitation on its indemnification responsibility to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it being understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall control such defense subject to the agreement of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party to cooperate in the defense of such Third Party Claim as provided below. The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period during which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense thereof or assumes the defense but asserts any limitation on its obligation to indemnify or defend which reduces its indemnification actions. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, the Parties shall reasonably cooperate in the defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Partys request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the Indemnified Partys prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided, however,_ such consent of the Indemnified Party shall not be required in the event of the entry of such judgment or entering into a settlement with respect to such Third Party Claim does not include (i)

or mandating actions by a Party with respect to the performance of this
Agreement or matters arising out of or in connection therewith. 

   

 (d) In its award, the Panel may apportion the costs of arbitration between or among the Parties in such manner as it deems reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case, the conduct of the Parties during the proceedings, and the result of the arbitration, including requiring one Party to bear all or the majority of such costs.

 (f) Unless otherwise ordered by the Panel as part of its award, each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses and the costs of arbitration, and the fees and expenses of the arbitrators and of any expert or other assistance engaged by the Panel shall be borne by the Parties to the arbitration in equal shares.

 (a) The failure or refusal of any Party, having been given due notice thereof, to participate at any stage of the dispute resolution proceedings shall not prevent the proceedings from continuing, nor shall such failure or refusal impair the validity of the award or cause the award to be void or voidable, nor shall it be a basis for challenge of the validity or enforceability of the award or of the arbitration proceedings. 

   

 (b) If any Party fails to timely pay an advance on fees and costs ordered by the Panel or the AAA within twenty (20) days after the date set for such deposit, that Party shall be deemed to be in default. The Panel or the AAA shall then determine whether the funds on deposit are sufficient to satisfy the anticipated estimated expenses for the proceeding to continue on an expedited basis without the participation of the defaulting Party. If so, the proceeding will continue without the participation of the defaulting Party, and the Panel may enter an award on default. Prior to entering an award on default,the Panel shall require the non-defaulting Party to produce such evidence and legal argument in support of its contentions as the Panel may deem appropriate. The Panel may receive such evidence and argument without the defaulting Partys presence or participation. If the funds on deposit are deemed insufficient to satisfy the estimated costs of continuing as provided herein, the non-defaulting Party may make all or part of the requested deposit in an amount sufficient to allow the proceeding to continue without the participation of the defaulting Party. If the non-defaulting Party chooses not to make the requested deposit, the Panel may suspend or terminate the proceedings. 

   

 16.08 _Adherence to Time Limits._

 (c) Any failure of the Panel to satisfy such time limits or to render a final award within the time specified shall not impair the validity of the award or cause the award to be void or 

   

 _Refinery Asset Purchase Agreement 
 Page 57 of 63_ 

    ##### 

  

 

voidable, nor shall it be a basis for challenge of the validity or
enforceability of the award or of the arbitration proceedings. 

   

 16.09 _Interim Measures from the Courts in Aid of Arbitration._  

  

 (a) At any time after submission of a written notice of arbitration, any Party may request a court of competent jurisdiction to grant interim measures of protection: (a) to preserve the status quo pending resolution of the Dispute; (b) to prevent the destruction of documents and other information or things related to the Dispute; (c) to prevent the transfer, dissipation, or hiding of assets; and/or (d) to aid the arbitral proceedings and the award.

 17.03 _Publicity._ Buyer and Seller agree that, from the date hereof through and including the Closing Date, no public release or announcement concerning the Contemplated Transactions shall be issued or made by any Party without the prior consent of each other Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be required by Applicable Law, prior contractual obligations or the rules or regulations of any securities exchange,whether in the United States or elsewhere, (or upon advice of counsel such release or announcement is appropriate or desirable under or in light of such contractual obligations, laws and regulations), in which case the Party making the release or announcement shall allow each other Party reasonable time to

comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate to prepare a
joint press release to be issued on the Closing Date and, upon the request of
either Buyer or Seller, at the time of the signing of this Agreement. Buyer
and Seller agree to keep the terms of this Agreement confidential, except to
the extent required by Applicable Law or prior contractual obligation or for
financial reporting purposes and except that the Parties may disclose such
terms to their respective Affiliates, counsel, auditors, accountants, agents,
advisors and other representatives as necessary in connection with the
ordinary conduct of their respective businesses (so long as such
Persons agree to keep the terms of this Agreement confidential). 

   

 17.04 _Entire Agreement._ This Agreement, the Schedules and Exhibits and the agreements referred to herein or executed simultaneously herewith, set forth the entire agreement and under standing of the Parties in respect to the Contemplated Transactions and supersede all prior agreements,arrangements and undertakings, whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter hereof (including the Confidentiality Agreement which shall not continue in effect). Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, no conditions, usage of trade, course of dealing or performance, understanding or agreement purporting to modify, vary, explain or supplement the terms or conditions of this Agreement will be binding unless hereafter made in writing and signed by the Party to be bound, and no modification will be effected by the acknowledgment or acceptance of documents containing terms or conditions at variance with or in addition to those set forth in this Agreement, except as otherwise specifically agreed to by the Parties in writing. 

  

 17.05 _Assignment._ This Agreement and the Related Agreements (excluding the Commercial Agreements which shall be governed as provided therein) and, except as otherwise provided in _ARTICLE IX_ with respect to the Intellectual Property, any rights and obligations hereunder or thereunder shall not be assignable or transferable by Buyer or Seller without the prior written consent of the other Party (provided that Sellers prior written consent shall not be required in the event Buyer transfers its entire rights and obligations hereunder to its parent company or a wholly owned Subsidiary of Buyer, as long as Buyer first fully guarantees such parent companys or Subsidiarys performance of all of Buyers obligations under this Agreement and under all of the agreements that are exhibits hereto) and any purported assignment without such consent shall be void and without effect. Without limiting the generality of the preceding, the indemnification Obligations of Seller and Buyer pursuant to this Agreement and the Related Agreements (excluding the Commercial Agreements) shall not be transferable or assignable in whole or in part without such Partys prior written consent and any purported or attempted transfer or assignment by an Indemnified Party shall be null and void without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller may assign or transfer any or all of its rights hereunder to any qualified intermediary to complete a 1031 Exchange as contemplated in this Agreement. 

  

 17.06 _Amendment and Waiver._ This Agreement may be amended, modified, superseded or canceled, and any of the terms, covenants, representations, warranties or conditions hereof may be waived, only by a written instrument executed by the Parties, or, in the case of a waiver, by or on be half of the Party waiving compliance. The failure of any Party at any time or times to require performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect the right at a later time to enforce the same. No waiver by any Party of any condition, or of any breach of any term, covenant, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such condition or breach or a waiver of any other condition or of any breach of any other term, covenant representation or warranty. 

  

 17.07 _Expenses._ Whether or not the Contemplated Transactions are consummated, and except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in connection 

  

 _Refinery Asset Purchase Agreement 
 Page 60 of 63_ 

    ##### 

  

 

with this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions, including legal, due
diligence, accounting and investment banking fees and expenses, shall be paid
by the Party incurring such costs or expenses. 

   

 17.08 _Schedules._ Matters listed once on the Schedules shall be deemed disclosed with reference to all sections of the Schedules (including any disclosures made in amendments made pursuant to _Section 6.03)_ to the extent the applicability of such information is readily apparent. The inclusion of information in the Schedules shall not be construed as an admission that such information is material to the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or Seller. In addition, matters reflected in the Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in such Schedules. Such additional matters are set forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily include other matters of a similar nature. 

  

 17.09 _Representation By Counsel._ Buyer and Seller acknowledge that each of them has been represented by counsel in connection with this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal decision that would require interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this Agreement against the Party that drafted it has no application and is expressly waived. 

  

 17.10 _Severability._ Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be valid and effective under Applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement or the application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be held invalid,illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision hereof. 

  

 17.11 _Bulk Transfer Laws._ Buyer hereby waives compliance by Seller with the provisions of any so-called bulk transfer laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets. Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold Buyer harmless (subject to _ARTICLE XIIJ_ ) from any Losses Buyer may incur due to failure to so comply in accordance with _Section 13.02(iv)._ 

  

 17.12 _No Third Party Beneficiaries._ Except as provided with respect to indemnification for Indemnified Parties as set forth in _ARTICLE XIII_ and elsewhere in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall confer any rights upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns. 

  

 17.13 _Binding Effect._ Subject to the provisions hereof restricting assignment, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 

  

 17.14 _Confidentiality._  

  

 (a) Each of Seller and Buyer (on behalf of themselves and each of their respective Affiliates) acknowledges that the information and material, in whatever form, including this Agreement and the Related Agreements (collectively, the _**"Confidential Information")** _disclosed or made available to it by, and relating to, the other (and its Affiliates) prior to the Effective Time is confidential. Each of Seller and Buyer (on behalf of themselves and each of their respective Affiliates) further agrees that it shall use commercially reasonable efforts not to make or permit disclosure of the Confidential Information to any Person, other than their Affiliates and their respective stockholders, members or owners, officers, employees, advisers and representatives to whom such disclosure is necessary or convenient for the completion of the Contemplated Transactions, and except in an arbitration proceeding as described in _ARTICLE XVI_ or as may be required by Applicable Law or a court of competent jurisdiction. Each of Seller and Buyer (and their respective Affiliates) shall appropriately notify each officer, employee, adviser and representative to whom any such disclosure is made, that such disclosure is 

   

 _Refinery Asset Purchase Agreement 
 Page 61 of 63_ 

    ##### 

  

 

made in confidence and shall be kept in confidence and not to be used in any
capacity except for the operations of the Refinery by Buyer. 

   

 (b) Each of Seller and Buyer (and their respective Affiliates) agrees to use diligent efforts in accordance with customary and reasonable commercial practice, and at least with the same degree of skill and care that it would manifest in protection of its own confidential information, to protect the Confidential Information. 

   

 (c) Each of the Parties (on behalf of themselves and each of their respective Affiliate) agrees to notify the other Party promptly, in the event that it becomes aware of the unauthorized possession or use of the Confidential Information (or any part thereof) by any third Person, including any of its officers, employees, advisers or representatives. Each of Seller and Buyer (and their respective Affiliates) agrees to cooperate with the other in connection with the others efforts to terminate or prevent such unauthorized possession or use of its Confidential Information. Each of Seller and Buyer (on behalf of themselves and each of their respective Affiliate) shall pay the others reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in so cooperating in protecting its Confidential Information, unless the unauthorized possession or use of the Confidential Information resulted from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Party otherwise entitled to reimbursement of its expenses. 

   

 (d) Each of Seller and Buyer (on behalf of themselves and each of their respective Affiliate) acknowledges that the other will suffer injury for which the other will not have an adequate remedy at law, in the event of a breach of the provisions of this _Section 17.14,_ and that the other shall be entitled to injunctive relief as is reasonably necessary to prevent or curtail such breach, whether actual or threatened; provided, that, in no event (including a willful breach of this Agreement by Seller or Buyer, respectively) shall Seller or Buyer (or their respective Affiliates) be prevented from exercising all of the rights granted to it hereunder. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement,the obligations of each of Seller and Buyer (and their respective Affiliates) to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information (each in such capacity a  _ **"Receiving Party"** ) _shall not apply to any portion of the Confidential Information that: 

    

 (i) is or becomes generally available to the public through no fault of the Receiving Party, including information in the public domain; 

   

 (ii) the Receiving Party receives from a third party without any requirement to keep such information secret; 

   

 (iii) the Receiving Party can prove was in its possession without any obligation of secrecy at the time of its disclosure; or 

   

 (iv) the Receiving Party develops independently of and without reference to or use of the Confidential Information. 

  

 (f) Seller acknowledges and agrees that, as of the Effective Time, nothing herein shall restrict the use by Buyer and its Affiliates of the Refinery Records, the same becoming property of Buyer as a consequence of the Closing. Except for Refinery Records, Buyer shall not use the Confidential Information prior to the Closing for any other purpose other than the evaluation of the Contemplated Transactions.

 (g) In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of this _Section 17.14_ and the confidentiality provisions of any Related Agreement, the provisions of the Related Agreement shall control with respect to any matters addressed by such Related Agreement. 

   

 (h) At the request of Seller, Buyer shall within twenty (20) days after receiving such request return to Seller all written Confidential Information which is not a Refinery Record, including all photocopies of the same. 

   

 (i) The provisions of this _Section 17.14_ shall remain in force for a period of five (5) years from the later of the date hereof or the Closing Date. The terms of this _Section 17.14_ shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement. 

   

 (j) To the extent the Confidentiality Agreement conflicts with the terms of this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement is hereby modified so that it is consistent with this Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect as of the date hereof. 

   

 (k) If the Closing occurs, Seller agrees to treat information it possesses concerning the historical operation of the Refinery as Confidential Information. 

   

 (1) Seller and Buyer do not intend for any obligations of confidentiality contained herein to limit disclosure of the transaction in any way that would cause it to be treated as a "confidential transaction" under Treasury Regulation 1.601 l-4(b)(3). 

   

 17.15 _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in one or more counterparts (including by means of faxed signature pages), all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more such counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Party.
