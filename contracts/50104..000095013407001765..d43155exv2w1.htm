acknowledges its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party therefor, to assume the defense
thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party provided that such counsel is
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding any acknowledgment made pursuant
to the immediately preceding sentence, the Indemnifying Party shall continue to be
entitled to assert any limitation on its indemnification responsibility contained in
<U>Sections&nbsp;13,08 and 13.09.</U> Should the Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the defense of

Party chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, the Parties shall reasonably cooperate in the
defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim. Such cooperation shall include the retention and
(upon the Indemnifying Party&#146;s request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim and making employees available

Claim without the Indemnifying Party&#146;s prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the

the Indemnified Party&#146;s prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
