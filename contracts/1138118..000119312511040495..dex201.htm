delivery of the Preliminary Closing Statement until the Closing, the Sellers
Representative shall consult in good faith with the Purchasers Representative
regarding such Preliminary Closing Statement and shall use reasonable efforts
to resolve in good faith any reasonable issues or objections of the
Purchasers Representative with respect to the contents of such Preliminary
Closing Statement prior to the Closing; _provided that_ in the event the
Purchasers Representative has objections to the calculations, and the

the Estimated Revenue Adjustment and the Preliminary Share Closing Amount at
the Closing. Following the Closing, any disputes relating to the Preliminary
Closing Statement will be resolved in accordance with _Section 2.8_.

shall ensure that each other and each others Representatives have reasonable

the Purchasers Representative shall pay (or cause to be paid) to the Sellers
Representative on behalf of the relevant Sellers the amount of the Post-

documentation, and (ii) cooperate fully with such other party and its
Representatives as reasonably requested, including the provision on a timely
basis of all information reasonably relevant for purposes of the Closing
Statement.

 

(b) After receipt of a Closing Statement, the Sellers Representative shall
have sixty (60) Business Days to review such statement (the date immediately
following the expiration of such period, the " _Resolution Date_ "). Unless
the Sellers Representative delivers written notice to the Purchasers
Representative on or prior to the sixtieth (60th) Business Day after the
Purchasers Representative delivers such statement stating that the Sellers
Representative has objections to such statement, the Sellers Representative
shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to the Closing Statement. Matters
included in such Closing Statement, which are not objected to in writing by
the Sellers Representative, shall be deemed to be accepted by the Sellers
Representative (" _Resolved Items_ ") and any amounts included within such
items shall be deemed to be final, binding and conclusive. If the Sellers
Representative has objections to such Closing Statement, it shall notify the
Purchasers Representative in writing of its objections and such notification
shall be accompanied by a letter including a list of adjustments proposed by
the

 



-32-   Sellers Representative together with a detailed reasoning for its

Representative of its objections to such Closing Statement, the Purchasers
Representative and the Sellers Representative shall, within thirty (30)
Business Days (or such longer period as the Sellers Representative and the
Purchasers Representative may agree in writing) following such notice (each
such period, a " _Resolution Period_ "), attempt to resolve their differences,
and any written resolution by them as to any disputed amounts shall be final,
binding and conclusive.

 

(c) Any amounts remaining in dispute at the conclusion of the Resolution
Period (the " _Unresolved Items_ ") shall be submitted by the Purchasers
Representative and the Sellers Representative to an internationally
recognized firm of independent accountants mutually agreed in writing by the
Sellers Representative and the Purchasers Representative, which shall be
Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu or if such firm is unavailable another firm agreed by
the Sellers Representative and the Purchasers Representative (the " _CPA
Firm_ ") within ten (10) Business Days after the expiration of the Resolution
Period or as soon as practicable after the Purchasers Representative and the
Sellers Representative have engaged the CPA Firm. In the event that the
parties fail to appoint the CPA Firm pursuant to this _Section 2.8(c)_
within ten (10) Business Days after the expiration of the applicable
Resolution Period, the parties agree that the CPA Firm shall be appointed (on
the application of either party) by the President of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants. The Sellers Representative and the Purchasers
Representative agree to use their reasonable best efforts to engage the CPA
Firm as promptly as practicable. Each of the Sellers Representative and the
Purchasers Representative agrees to execute, if requested by the CPA Firm, an
engagement letter with the CPA Firm containing reasonable terms and to provide
the CPA Firm such work papers and other documents and information related
to the Unresolved Items as the CPA Firm may reasonably request if available
to such party or, in the case of the Purchasers Representative, the
Purchasers Group, or, in the case of the Sellers Representative, the
Sellers Group (or their accountants or auditors). All fees and expenses
relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the CPA Firm shall be borne
in proportion to the dollar amounts of the Unresolved Items that are resolved
by the CPA Firm in favor of the other party. The CPA Firm shall act as an
arbitrator and not as an expert, to determine, based on the provisions of this
_Section 2.8(c)_, only the Unresolved Items; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the CPA Firm shall have authority to determine, and the term "Unresolved
Items" as used in this _Section 2.8(c)_ shall mean, only the amount(s)
contained in the Closing Share Statement and no other matter whatsoever,
absent a written agreement to the contrary by the Purchasers Representative
and the Sellers Representative; _provided_ _further_ that the determination
of the Unresolved Items provided by the CPA Firm shall be limited to the range
provided by the Sellers Representative and the Purchasers Representative on
the resolution of the specific Unresolved Item. The Sellers Representative
and the Purchasers Representative shall request that the CPA Firm provide,
within thirty (30) days after the submission of the Unresolved Items to the
CPA Firm, a written statement setting out (x) its determination of the
Unresolved Items and (y) its calculation of the amounts set forth in the
Closing Statement, based upon (A) the amount of Resolved Items and (B) its
determination of the Unresolved Items. Such written statement shall be
delivered to the Purchasers Representative and the Sellers Representative
and shall be final, binding and conclusive on and with respect to the
Purchasers Representative and the Sellers Representative absent manifest
error.

Representative against any amounts the Purchasers Representative would
otherwise be required to pay under  _Section 2.9(b)_.

Consented Contingent Fund, if such Consented Contingent Fund then remains in
existence, the Purchasers Representative shall pay to the Sellers
Representative an amount equal to the _excess_ of:

Benefits Plan that would subject the Target Companies to a tax or penalty

individually or in the aggregate, material to the Target Companies, taken as a
whole. Each Permit has been duly obtained, is valid and in full force and
effect and is not subject to any pending or, to the knowledge of the Sellers
Representative, threatened administrative or judicial proceeding to revoke,
cancel, suspend or declare such Permit invalid, except as would not be

subsisting, and, to the knowledge of Sellers Representative, valid and

(ii) on the part of the relevant Target Company to the extent such breach,
event or condition would reasonably be expected to be, individually and in the
aggregate material to the Target Companies, taken as a whole. As of the date
of this Agreement, no Target Company has received any written notice of an
intention, to terminate, not renew or challenge the validity or

(b) No Target Company or any of its "affiliated persons" (as that term is
defined under applicable provisions of the Investment Company Act as
interpreted by the SEC) has any understanding or arrangement that would
reasonably be expected to impose an unfair burden on any of the Registered

-48-   Adviser and that is subject to the law of any foreign jurisdiction has
adopted written policies and procedures to the extent required by analogous
applicable Laws. There has been no material non-compliance by any Target

reasonably be expected to be material to the Target Companies, taken as a
whole.

relief from the SEC with respect to any such disqualification. None of the
Target Companies or any "affiliated person" (as defined under the Investment
Company Act) thereof has been subject to disqualification as an investment
adviser or subject to disqualification to serve in any other capacity
contemplated by the Investment Company Act for any investment company under
Sections 9(a) and 9(b) of the Investment Company Act, unless, in each case,
such person, as applicable, has received exemptive relief from the SEC with
respect to any such disqualification. None of the Target Companies or any
associated person thereof is subject to any disqualification under any
applicable Law precluding the operation of the Target Business as currently

any consent judgments, decrees, cease and desist or other orders,
disqualifications, penalties or special restrictions against any of the
Target Companies, relating to or affecting the conduct of the Target Business

"directed brokerage" (as such term is used in SEC Release IC-26591) as a means
to compensate any Person for selling mutual fund shares in violation of the
provisions of Rule 12b-1(h) under the Investment Company Act or Conduct Rule
2830(k) of FINRA. No pending inquiry or audit by the SEC of any of the Target

required) all Prospectuses, financial statements, other forms, reports, sales
literature, and advertising, and any other documents required to be filed
with the applicable Government Authority (the " _Government Reports_ "),

expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Target
Companies taken as a whole. The Government Reports have been prepared in
accordance with the requirements of applicable Law, except for such non-

whole, (i) there is no action or threatened action in any court or before or
by any Government Authority or any arbitrator, by or against any of the Adobe
Funds or any officer thereof relating to the activities of the Adobe

 



-51-   Funds, any disqualification of any of the Target Companies under Section
9(a) of the Investment Company Act, or, except as disclosed as of the date of
this Agreement in response to Item 11 to Part 1A of the Companys Form ADV,
any event which would require any of the Target Companies to give an
affirmative response to any of the questions in Item 11 to Part 1A of its Form
ADV (or any similar or successor form) and (ii) are no judgments,
injunctions, court orders or other judicial or administrative mandates
outstanding against or affecting any of the Adobe Funds or any officer or
trustee thereof relating to the activities of or affecting the Adobe Funds.

Letter, none of the Funds nor any Client account (in each case solely with
respect to the portion of such Clients or Funds investment that is managed
by a Target Company) holds any investment other than (i) an investment in a
security that is publicly traded on an exchange, or (ii) cash or money market
accounts. Except as set forth in _Section 3.18(g)_ of the Sellers Disclosure
Letter, none of the Funds (solely with respect to the portion of such Funds
investment that is managed by a Target Company) holds any interest in any
joint venture, partnership, limited liability company or other similar
arrangement other than a security that is traded on an exchange.

 

(h) Except as set forth in _Section 3.18(g)_ of the Sellers Disclosure

(i) Neither the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by any
of the Sellers, nor the consummation by the Sellers and their Affiliates of
the Transactions, will (i) at the Closing, and subject to the satisfaction of
the requirements set forth in _Annex 2_  ( _Assignment Requirements_ ) and
any other consents obtained by the Sellers Representative or a Target Company
on or prior to the Closing, conflict with, result in a breach or violation of,
result in a material modification of the terms or conditions of, or result in
a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default) under or cause an adverse effect under, any Fund
Document or Advisory Contract, or (ii) subject to the receipt of
the satisfaction of the Assignment Requirements, violate any Law applicable
to the Target Companies or any of the Adobe Funds or their respective
businesses, assets or properties, except in each case (i) and (ii) as would

for any Registered Fund, as such term is defined in Rule 38a-1(e)(2) under the
Investment Company Act, other than those which have been reported to the
applicable Adobe Fund board and satisfactorily remedied or are in the process
of being remedied. Each Adobe Fund that is required to be registered under any

is subject to Title I of ERISA, (ii) a Person acting on behalf of such a plan
or (iii) any Person whose assets are "plan assets" within the meaning of
Department of Labor Regulation Section 2510.3-101, such Target Company has
acted in compliance with the applicable requirements of ERISA, except for any
failure to act in compliance as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to be material to the Target Companies, taken as a
whole. To the extent any such Target Company has relied upon any statutory or
administrative exemption from the prohibited transaction rules of Section 406
of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, such Target Company is eligible to rely
on such exemption and has satisfied the requirements of such exemption, except
for any failure to be so eligible or to so satisfy as would not, individually

and complete list of all written redemption requests as of the date hereof,
including the date of such request and the amount to be redeemed other than

from a Client or any investor in any Adobe Fund that is outstanding and has
not been fulfilled, in whole or in part as of the date hereof.

(o) The U.S. federal income tax status of each Adobe Fund, as a regulated
investment company, a corporation (other than a regulated investment company
or a real estate investment trust) or a partnership, is set forth in _Section
3.18(n)_ of the Sellers Disclosure Letter.

(p) Each Adobe Fund that is identified as a "regulated investment company" in
_Section 3.18(n)_ of the Sellers Disclosure Letter has satisfied the
relevant requirements of the Code for all taxable periods, or portions
thereof, of such Adobe Fund ending on or prior to the date of this Agreement
or the Closing Date, as the case may be, to be treated as a regulated
investment company. No Adobe Fund has received any written notice or other
written communication asserting that such Fund is not in compliance with any
of the requirements necessary to be treated as a regulated investment company.
Each Adobe Fund has timely filed or

 



-53-   caused to be timely filed all material Tax Returns required to be filed for
it with the applicable Tax Authority. Each such Tax Return is true and

Authority with respect to any material amount of Taxes and there are no
threatened claims for any material amount of Taxes.

Bank N.V., London Branch, whose fees will be paid by the Sellers or members of
the ING Group, there is no other investment banker, broker, finder or other
intermediary that has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of
the Sellers or any other member of the ING Group who would be entitled to any
fee or commission from the Sellers or any other member of the ING Group in
connection with the Transactions.

Section 3.20 _Insurance_. The Target Companies, as of the date of this
Agreement, maintain the insurance policies and coverages related to the Target
Business set forth in _Section 3.20_ of the Sellers Disclosure Letter, and
all such policies are in full force and effect. Between January 1, 2008 and
the date of this Agreement, the Target Companies have not received in writing
any notice of cancellation or termination or denial of coverage with respect
to any such policy except to the extent such policy has expired and been
replaced in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. As
of the date of this Agreement, there are no material outstanding claims
related to the Target Business under any insurance policy or default with
respect to the provisions in any such policy. No member of the Sellers Group
or any of their Affiliate maintains any occurrence based insurance policies
covering the Target Business other than such occurrence based policies entered
into by any Target Company.

or any present or former director, officer or employee of Sellers or the
Target Business, or any member of such officers, directors or employees
immediate family, or any Person controlled by such officer, director or
employee or his or her immediate family (each of the foregoing, a " _Related
Party_ ") is a party to any material loans, leases or other material
Contracts or transactions with the Target Business, or any of the Target
Companies or any Adobe Fund (each of the foregoing, a " _Related Party
Contract_ ").

 

Section 3.22 _Sufficiency of Assets_. At the Closing, the assets, rights and
properties of the Target Companies together with the rights of the Target
Companies under the Transaction Documents and the licenses provided in
_Section 5.14_ will, in the aggregate, constitute in all material respects
the assets, rights and properties necessary to conduct the Target Business as
conducted on the date hereof on the same terms as the Sellers operated the
Target Business in the Ordinary Course prior to the date hereof and as
reflected in the CRES Financial Statements, except as would not reasonably be
expected to be material to the Target Companies, taken as a whole.

 



-54-  Section 3.23 _Fund Co-Investments_. The transfer of any Sale Asset in any
Adobe Fund made by any member of the ING Group in connection with the
Transactions would not result in the breach of any agreement (including for
the avoidance of doubt, any co-investment commitment contained in any Fund
Document or Prospectus) with any investor in such Adobe Fund, except as would
not be reasonably expected to be material to the Target Companies, taken as a
whole.

Section 3.24 _Foreign Corrupt Practices Act_. No Seller or Target Company, nor
to the knowledge of the Sellers Representative, any of their directors,
officers, agents, employees, consultants or contractors or other persons
acting on behalf of any such person has, directly or indirectly, paid, offered
or promised to pay, or authorized payment of, any monies or any other thing of
value to any government official or employee (including employees of

for political office (collectively, a " _Proscribed Recipient_ ") for the
purpose of, (i) influencing any act or decision of such Proscribed Recipient,
(ii) inducing such Proscribed Recipient to do or omit to do any act in
violation of the lawful duty of such Proscribed Recipient, or to use his, her
or its influence with a Government Authority to affect or influence any act
or decision of such Government Authority or (iii) assisting in obtaining or
retaining business for or with, or directing business to, any person, except
as would not be reasonably expected to be material to the Target Companies,

compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the " _FCPA_ ") and
any other anti-bribery or anti-corruption law including with respect to
requirements to maintain internal controls, except as would not reasonably be
expected to be material to the Target Companies, taken as a whole. The Sellers
and the Target Companies are in compliance with all applicable Laws relating
to money laundering, currency transfers or other regulations concerning the
transfer of monetary instruments, except as would not be reasonably expected
to be material to the Target Companies, taken as a whole. Such persons
maintain policies and procedures designed to ensure, and which are reasonably
expected to continue to ensure, compliance with such Laws.

Section 3.25 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this _Article III_ and the

objection referenced in _Section 6.1(e)_ hereof); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that neither the Purchasers Representative nor the Sellers Representative
shall, and shall cause the Sellers Group (in the case of the

Purchasers Representative) not to, make any initial filing for any such
notice, report or filing in respect of consents, registrations, approvals,
waivers, orders, interpretive guidance, exemptions, permits and
authorizations without the prior written consent of the other, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ _further_

and submissions required under any applicable Law in connection with this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the Transactions, and file
promptly any additional information requested under any applicable Law in
connection with this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the
Transactions, after receipt of the request therefor.

(b) In no event shall any member of the Purchasers Group be required to agree
to any divestiture or to proffer its willingness to effect any divestiture, or
to agree to any other requirements or condition imposed on any member of the
Purchasers Group or any requirement, condition or request of any Government
Authority. In addition, nothing in this Agreement shall obligate any member of
the Purchasers Group to agree to any remedy not conditioned on the
consummation of the applicable Closing.

(c) Without limiting the generality of this  _Section 5.4_, the Sellers
Representative and the Purchasers Representative shall reasonably cooperate
with each other and shall each furnish to the other all information reasonably
necessary or desirable in connection with making any application or other
filing required to be made pursuant to any Law, and in connection with
resolving any investigation or other inquiry by any Government Authority under
any Laws, in each case, with respect to the Transactions. Each of the
Sellers Representative and the Purchasers Representative shall as promptly
as reasonably practicable inform the other, of any communication with, and any
proposed understanding, undertaking or agreement with, any Government
Authority regarding any such filings or any such transaction. The Sellers
Representative and the Purchasers Representative shall consult and reasonably
cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any member of the Sellers Group or the
Purchasers Group in connection with all meetings, actions and proceedings
under or relating to any Laws in connection with the Transactions (including,
with respect to making a particular filing, by providing copies of all such
documents to the non-filing party and their Representatives prior to filing
and, if requested, giving due consideration to all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith). The Sellers

Sale Assets have expired or are waived irrevocably by the Persons entitled

to pay any money or provide any other consideration in order to obtain any
such waiver.

 

Section 5.6 _Employees and Retirement Benefit Arrangements_. (a) Effective as
at the Closing, all Company Employees shall cease to be employees of the
Sellers Group as a result of the Transactions, but the parties intend that
each Company Employee shall have continuity of employment with the applicable

-63-  (b) Except as specifically provided herein, the Purchasers will cause service
rendered by Continuing Employees prior to the Closing to be taken into
account for vesting, eligibility and benefit accrual (other than benefit
accrual under a defined benefit pension plan) purposes under all employee
benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements of the Purchasers Group
(the " _Purchaser Plans_ "), to the same extent as such service was taken into
account under the corresponding plans of the Target Companies for those
purposes, _provided_ that nothing herein shall result in the duplication of
any benefits. Without in any way limiting the foregoing, Continuing Employees
will not be subject to any pre-existing condition limitation or waiting period
under any health plan of the Purchasers Group for any condition for which
they would have been entitled to coverage, or any satisfied waiting period,
under the corresponding plan of the Target Companies in which they
participated immediately prior to the Closing Date. The
Purchasers Representative will and will cause such Continuing Employees to
be given credit under such plans for co-payments made and deductibles and out-
of-pocket expenses satisfied for the applicable calendar year in which the
Closing Date occurs.

 

(c) On and prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall be responsible with respect
to Company Employees and their beneficiaries for compliance with applicable
Law, including any requirement to provide for and discharge any and all
notifications, benefits and Liabilities to Company Employees and Government

applicable Law, including any requirement to provide for and discharge any and
all notifications, benefits and Liabilities to Continuing Employees and
Government Authorities that might be imposed as a result of the consummation

be paid, all Company Benefits Plan expenses and benefits for each Continuing
Employee (to the extent such Continuing Employee participated in the Company
Benefits Plans) and no member of the Sellers Group shall have any Liability
or obligations on or after the Closing with respect to such Company Benefits
Plans. Other than as reflected in the Closing Share Statement, the Sellers
shall be responsible for and continue to pay, whether before or after the
Closing Date, and the Sellers Representative shall cause to be paid, all
expenses and benefits for each Company Employee due pursuant to a Benefits
Plan that is not a Company Benefits Plan (each a " _Seller Benefits Plan_ ")
(to the extent such Company Employee participated in such Seller Benefits
Plans) and no member of the Purchasers Group (including the Target Companies)
shall have any Liability or obligations on or after the Closing Date with
respect to any such expenses or benefits, except as expressly provided
herein. 

(e) Immediately prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall cause all outstanding
loans by the Sellers or any of their Affiliates to Company Employees,
including under any co-investment or leveraged investment program, to be
repaid in full.

(f) The Target Companies shall continue to be liable for accrued and unused
vacation with respect to each Continuing Employee on and after the Closing.

 



-64-  (g) Effective as of immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the Closing,

ING Clarion Real Estate Securities, L.P. 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan (the "
_Company 401(k) Plan_ "), including, without limitation, by making any
amendments to the Company 401(k) Plan required by the terms of such plans, or
amendments that Purchaser may reasonably require, or any required filings. The
Sellers Representative shall provide the Purchasers Representative with
evidence that the Company 401(k) Plan has been terminated in accordance with
its terms. The Purchasers Representative shall cause the CB Richard Ellis
401(k) Plan (the " _Purchasers  401(k) Plan_") to, following the Closing and
pursuant to Section 401(a)(31)(D) of the Code, accept rollover contributions
of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31)
of the Code) in the form of cash, a promissory note (in the case of loans) or
any combination thereof from the Company 401(k) Plan. In the case of any
Continuing Employee with an outstanding loan balance under the Company 401(k)
Plan, the Sellers Representative and the Purchasers shall take (or cause to
be taken) any and all necessary action, to the extent allowable by Law, to
permit the Continuing Employee to rollover such outstanding loan balance to
the Purchasers 401(k) Plan through a direct rollover on or as soon as
administratively possible after the Closing Date. Each Continuing Employee
shall become a participant in the Purchasers 401(k) Plan on the Closing Date
and, for purposes of eligibility and vesting under such plan, shall receive
credit for the Continuing Employees service with the Sellers and the
Sellers Affiliates (including the Target Companies).

(h) Effective as of immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the Closing,
the Sellers Representative shall cause the Target Companies to terminate and
liquidate each Benefits Plan that is an "account balance" non-qualified
deferred compensation plan under Section 409A of the Code (each, a " _Company
Deferred Compensation Plan_ ") in accordance with Section 409A of the Code and
Treas. Reg. §1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B), but solely with respect to any Company
Employee who participates in any such Company Deferred Compensation Plan. The
Sellers Representative shall provide the Purchasers Representative with
evidence that each Company Deferred Compensation Plan will be terminated
effective on or prior to the Closing. The Sellers Representative shall take
such actions in furtherance of terminating the Company Deferred Compensation
Plans (including, without limitation, by making any required amendments to any
Company Deferred Compensation Plans or any required filings).

(i) The Target Companies shall have in effect, as of the Closing, flexible
spending reimbursement accounts under a cafeteria plan qualifying under
Section 125 of the Code (the " _Target Cafeteria Plan_ ") that provides
benefits for the calendar year in which the Closing occurs to Continuing
Employees not less favorable than those provided by the flexible spending
reimbursement accounts under the cafeteria plans in which such Continuing
Employees are eligible to participate as of the date hereof (the " _Seller
Cafeteria Plan_ "). As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, the
Sellers shall cause to be transferred to the Target Companies an amount in
cash equal to the excess of the aggregate accumulated contributions to the
flexible spending reimbursement accounts under the Seller Cafeteria Plan made
during the year in which the Closing Date occurs by the Continuing Employees
over the aggregate reimbursement payouts made for such year from such accounts
to such Continuing Employees. The Target Companies shall credit such amounts
to each such Continuing Employees corresponding accounts under the Target
Cafeteria Plan in which such employees participate following the Closing Date.
On and after the Closing Date, the Target Companies shall assume and be solely
responsible for all 

 



-65-   claims for reimbursement by Continuing Employees under the Seller Cafeteria
Plan, whether incurred prior to, on or after the Closing Date, that have not
been paid in full as of the Closing Date, which claims shall be paid pursuant
to and under the terms of the Target Cafeteria Plan. The Target Companies
shall cause the Target Cafeteria Plan to honor and continue through the end of
the calendar year and plan year runout period in which the Closing Date
occurs the elections made by each Continuing Employees under the Seller
Cafeteria Plan in respect of the flexible spending reimbursement accounts that
are in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date. The Sellers
Representative shall and shall cause its Affiliates to provide the
Purchasers Representative with all information necessary for the Purchasers
and the Target Companies to meet their obligations under this _Section
5.6(i)_, including, but not limited to, copies of employee elections and any
claims submitted prior to the Closing Date that remain unpaid as of the
Closing Date.

(j) On and after the Closing Date until the first anniversary thereof, the
Purchasers shall either (i) provide, or cause the Target Companies to provide,
benefits to Continuing Employees that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the benefits provided under Benefits Plans on the date of this
Agreement, or (ii) provide, or cause the Target Companies, to provide the same
levels of benefits to the Continuing Employees as are made available to
similarly situated and comparable employees of the Purchaser under the
Purchasers benefit and compensation plans.

(k) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (i) be
treated as an amendment of any particular Benefits Plan; or (ii) obligate the
Purchasers or any of their Affiliates or the Target Companies to (A) maintain
any particular Benefits Plan or (B) retain the employment of any particular
Continuing Employee for any specified period. This _Section 5.6_ shall inure
exclusively to the benefit of, and be binding upon the parties hereto and
their respective successors, assigns, executors, and legal representatives.
Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer on any
person other than the parties hereto or their respective successors and
assigns any rights, remedies, obligations, or Liabilities under or by reason
of this _Section 5.6_.

 

(l) Except as prohibited by Law, prior to the Closing, the Sellers will
provide or otherwise make available to the Purchasers such employee records,
information and documentation related to Benefits Plans as reasonably
requested by the Purchasers with respect to the Continuing Employees.

Section 5.7 _Reorganization Transactions_. Prior to the Closing, the Sellers
Group shall effect the Pre-Closing Reorganization Transactions set forth in
clauses (a), (e), (f) and (g) of _Annex 6_ ( _Pre-Closing Reorganization
Transactions_ ). Prior to the Closing, the Sellers Group may, but is not
required to, effect the Pre-Closing Reorganization Transactions set forth in
clause (b) of _Annex 6_  ( _Pre-Closing Reorganization Transactions_ ). Prior
to the Closing, the Sellers Group shall effect the Pre-Closing Reorganization
Transactions set forth in clause (c) of _Annex 6_ ( _Pre-Closing
Reorganization Transactions_ );  _provided_ , _however_ , that if a material
adverse effect on the Taxes of Sellers Group would be reasonably expected to
arise from such transactions, the Sellers Group shall effect the Pre-Closing
Reorganization Transactions set forth in clause (d) of _Annex 6_ ( _Pre-
Closing Reorganization Transactions_ ) instead of the Pre-Closing
Reorganization Transactions set forth in clause (c) of _Annex 6_ ( _Pre-
Closing Reorganization Transactions_ ). The 

 



-66-   Sellers Group (excluding the Target Companies) shall bear all out-of-pocket
costs and expenses in connection with the Pre-Closing Reorganization
Transactions and the Purchasers Group shall not be required to incur any
cost or expense in connection with such Pre-Closing Reorganization
Transactions. The Sellers Representative agrees to keep the Purchasers
Representative reasonably informed regarding the timing and actions made in
connection with the Pre-Closing Reorganization Transactions. Solely for the
purpose of determining whether the Pre-Closing Reorganization Transactions set
forth in clause (c) of _Annex 6_ ( _Pre-Closing Reorganization Transactions_
) would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Taxes
of the Sellers Group, a "material adverse effect on the Taxes of the Sellers
Group" shall mean an increase of more than $200,000 in the amount of the
Taxes for which the Sellers Group is liable where such increase is the
difference between the Taxes arising solely from the transactions pursuant to
clause (c) being undertaken as compared to the Taxes arising solely from the
transactions pursuant to clause (d) being undertaken.

Section 5.8 _Access and Information_. (a) From the date hereof until the
Closing, subject to the applicable policies and practices of the Funds and any
applicable Law, the Sellers Representative shall and shall cause any other
relevant members of the Sellers Group to afford the Purchasers
Representative reasonable access to the assets, books and records, offices and
other facilities and Representatives who have knowledge relating to the Target
Business, in each case, in order that the Purchasers Representative shall
have the opportunity to make such investigation and to make such copies of
such information and data as the Purchasers Representative shall reasonably
require in connection with the Transactions, including the Pre-
Closing Reorganization Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall the Purchasers Group have access to any information that (x)
relates solely to a part of the business of the ING Group or its subsidiaries
that are not being transferred pursuant to this Agreement, (y) based on
advice of Sellers counsel, or in Sellers reasonable determination, would
violate applicable Law or (z) in the reasonable judgment of any member of the
Sellers Group could violate any obligation of the Sellers Group with
respect to confidentiality. All information received pursuant to this _Section
5.8(a)_ shall be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement until
its termination according to _Section 5.16(a)_ ( _Confidentiality_ ), and
thereafter, shall be governed by _Section 5.16(b)_ ( _Confidentiality_ ) and
_Section 5.16(c)_ ( _Confidentiality_ ).

 

(b) Following the Closing, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the
Purchasers Representative agrees to provide (or cause the relevant members
of the Purchasers Group to provide) the Sellers Representative with, and the
Sellers Representative agrees to provide (or cause the relevant members of
the Sellers Group to provide) the Purchasers Representative with, all
necessary access to all books and records and other documents of the Target
Companies and the Sale Assets and to their related assets, properties and
Representatives, in each case, to the extent that such access is reasonably
required by any member of such group to (x) prepare financial statements,
regulatory filings or Tax Returns in respect of periods ending on or prior to
the applicable Closing Date, or (y) comply with the terms of this
Agreement, any other Transaction Document, any applicable Law or request of
any Government Authority; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the
Sellers Group have access to any information that (A) based on advice
of Purchasers counsel, or in Purchasers reasonable determination, would
violate applicable Law or (B) in the reasonable judgment of any member of the
Purchasers Group could violate any obligation of the Purchasers Group with
respect to confidentiality. The Purchasers Representative agrees to (or to
cause the relevant members of the Purchasers Group to), and the

 



-67-   Sellers Representative agrees to (or to cause the relevant members of the
Sellers Group to), retain and preserve all relevant books and records of the
Target Companies and the Sale Assets and all such other documents in its
possession, in compliance with all applicable Law, for at least eight (8)

Section 5.9 _Section 15(f)_. (a) The Purchasers acknowledge and agree that
the Transactions are intended to qualify for the treatment described in
Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act. In this regard, to the extent
within the control of the Purchasers Group, the Purchasers Representative
shall, and from and after the Closing shall cause the Target Companies to,
comply with the conditions of Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act,
including (i) ensuring that, for a period of three (3) years after the Closing
Date, at least 75% of the Fund Board of each Registered Fund or any permitted
successor thereto are not "interested persons" of the Purchasers Group or
the ING Group (such efforts to include (A) causing any employee, officer,
director or agent of a member of the Purchasers Group, and requesting any
other individual who is for any reason an "interested person" of the
Purchasers Group, who shall be a trustee or director of any Registered Fund
to resign when required to maintain such percentage, and (B) ensuring that
vacancies on the Fund Board of any Registered Fund will be filled by a Person
who is not an "interested person" of the Purchasers Group, or any other
member of the Purchasers Group, who has been selected and proposed for
election by a majority of the trustees or directors who are not such
"interested persons", and who has been elected by shareholders if such
shareholder action is required by Section 16(b) of the Investment Company
Act); and (ii) refraining from imposing or seeking to impose, for a period of
two (2) years after such Closing Date, any "unfair burden" (as that term is
defined in Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act and interpreted by the
SEC) on any Registered Fund.

 

(b) No Purchaser or any of its "affiliated persons" (as that term is defined
under applicable provisions of the Investment Company Act and interpreted by
the SEC) has, and the Purchasers Representative shall ensure that no such
Persons have, any express or implied understanding or arrangement which would
reasonably be expected to impose an "unfair burden" (as that term is defined
in Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act and interpreted by the SEC) on
any of the Registered Funds as a result of the Transactions or would in any
way cause Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act to be unavailable.

Section 5.10 _Client Approvals_. (a) The Sellers Representative agrees
to use, and to cause each other member of the Sellers Group to use, its
reasonable best efforts, to (i) obtain the consents and approvals (including
all approvals by the Fund Boards and shareholders of each Registered Fund of
New Advisory Contracts in accordance with the requirements of Section 15 of
the Investment Company Act and to the extent applicable all approvals by the
Fund Boards of Specified Funds of Interim Advisory Contracts pursuant to Rule
15a-4 thereunder) necessary to satisfy the Assignment Requirements with
respect to all Advisory Contracts and (ii) secure the approval of the
shareholders of each Registered Fund of New Advisory Contracts in accordance
with the requirements of Section 15 of the Investment Company Act. The
Purchasers Representative agrees to cooperate and to cause each other member
of the Purchasers Group to use its reasonable best efforts to assist the
Sellers Representative in obtaining the consents and approvals (including
all approvals by the Fund Boards and shareholders of each Registered Fund of
New Advisory Contracts in accordance with the requirements of Section 15 of
the Investment Company Act and to the extent applicable all approvals by the
Fund Boards of each Specified

 



-68-   Fund of Interim Advisory Contracts pursuant to Rule 15a-4 thereunder)
necessary to satisfy the Assignment Requirements with respect to all Advisory
Contracts and to secure the approval of the shareholders of each Registered
Fund of New Advisory Contracts in accordance with the requirements of Section
15 of the Investment Company Act; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt,
the foregoing shall not require the Purchasers Representative to grant any
approval under _Section 5.1(a)(ix)_.

(b) The Sellers Representative agrees to use, and cause each other member of
the Sellers Group to use, its reasonable best efforts to cause each
Registered Fund to call a special meeting of the shareholders of such
Registered Fund as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof to
consider the relevant New Advisory Contract. In connection therewith, the
Purchasers Representative will, and shall cause the Target Companies to, use
their respective reasonable best efforts to jointly prepare, promptly file
with the SEC, and mail (as soon as practicable after SEC review), in
sufficient time to comply with requirements as to notice of each such special
meeting, a proxy statement in respect of each such Registered Fund
that complies in all material respects with the applicable provisions of
Section 14 of the Exchange Act and Section 20 of the Investment Company Act.
Each of the Sellers Representative and the Purchasers Representative agrees,
and agrees to cause their respective applicable Affiliates, to promptly
provide in writing all information concerning itself and its respective
Affiliates required to be included in the Registered Funds proxy statements
under the Exchange Act or the Investment Company Act. Each of the Sellers
Representative and the Purchasers Representative agrees, and agrees to cause
their respective applicable Affiliates, to promptly correct such information
if and to the extent that such information becomes false or misleading in any
respect.

(c) All reasonable and documented third party legal and administrative fees,
and other similar costs and expenses, payable in connection with obtaining
approval of the shareholders of each Registered Fund, approvals or waivers
reasonably required to satisfy the Assignment Requirements and to obtain
the consent to enter into a New Advisory Contract shall be borne 50% by the
Sellers Group and 50% by the Purchasers Group. Subject to _Section 10.5_ (
_Costs_ ) of this Agreement, notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, none of the Sellers Representative, the Purchasers Representative
or any other member of the Sellers Group or the Purchasers Group shall have
any obligation under this Agreement or otherwise to pay any consent, approval
or waiver "fee", discount, rebate or any money or other consideration beyond
administrative costs, including a _de minimis_ review charge, to any Person or
to initiate any claim or proceeding against any Person in order to obtain
any consent, approval or waiver necessary to satisfy any Assignment
Requirement or obtain any other approval, consent or waiver of any third
party.

Purchasers Representative agrees to cause each Target Company that is an
Investment Adviser promptly to amend its Form ADV and promptly to file such
amendment with the SEC and any applicable state authorities, for the purpose
of disclosing, _inter alia_ , information regarding the change in control of
each Investment Adviser and any change in personnel following the Closing.
Following the Closing, the Purchasers Representative agrees to, or to cause
the applicable members of the Purchasers Group to, make all necessary filings

kept all insurance policies referred to in _Section 5.12(a)_ of the Sellers
Disclosure Letter, or suitable replacements therefor, to the extent relating
to the Target Business, in full force and effect up to and including the
Closing Date. As of the close of business on the Closing Date, the Sellers
Representative may terminate all coverage relating to the Sellers Group
Insurance Policy; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) no such termination of any
policy in force as of the Closing Date shall be effected so as to prevent the
Target Business from recovering under any such policies for losses from
events occurring prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) no such termination of
any claims made policy in force as of the Closing Date shall be effected so as
to prevent the Target Business from recovering under such policies for losses
from event occurring prior to the Closing Date and for which the Purchasers
Representative shall have given the Sellers Representative written notice of
such loss within one-hundred and eighty (180) days after the Closing Date.
The Purchasers Representative shall become solely responsible for all
insurance coverage and related risk of loss with respect to the Target
Business based on (A) events occurring on or after the close of business on
the Closing Date, and (B) events covered under a claims made policy occurring
on or prior to the Closing Date with respect to which notice has not been
received by the Sellers Representative within one-hundred and eighty (180)
days after the Closing Date. Following the Closing, the Sellers
Representative shall and shall cause its Affiliates to (i) until the date that
is one-hundred and eighty (180) days after the Closing Date not seek
to materially change any rights or obligations of any of Target Companies
under such insurance to the detriment of the Target Companies, (ii) cooperate
with the Target Companies in making claims under such insurance, and (iii)
promptly pay over to the Target Companies any amounts that the Sellers
Representative or any such Affiliate may receive under such insurance in
respect of losses experienced by any of the Target Companies.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Sellers Representative shall maintain the

respect to any claim related to any time prior to the Closing Date existing
immediately prior to the date hereof (or another policy providing comparable
coverage), and shall maintain such a policy for a period of at least six (6)
years following the Closing Date in a manner that is not less favorable than
the DandO Insurance existing as of the date hereof. 

(c) For a period of six (6) years following the Closing Date, the Purchasers
Representative shall cause the Target Companies to maintain DandO Insurance
covering the directors, officers and senior executives of the Target Companies

nor any member of the Purchasers Group is purchasing, acquiring, licensing or
otherwise obtaining any right, title or interest in, to or under any

Representative and the other relevant members of the Purchasers Group shall,
and shall cause the Target Companies to, use the Materials and make any use of

and communicated to the Purchasers Group in writing, (iii) when using any of
the Materials in the context of entering into or conducting contractual
relationships, the Purchasers or the relevant member of the Purchasers Group
shall and shall cause the Target Companies to make clear to all other
applicable parties that one of the Target Companies, rather than the Sellers
or any members of the Sellers Group, is the party entering into or conducting
the contractual relationship, and (iv) the Purchasers and the Purchasers
Group shall cause each of the relevant Target Companies to use its reasonable
best efforts to minimize its use of the Sellers Names and Marks, and shall
cause each of such Target Companies to cease using the Sellers Names and
Marks on such Materials as soon as practicable and in any event within ninety
(90) days following the Closing. Seller may terminate the Materials License
upon written notice in the event of a breach of the terms and conditions
set forth in this _Section 5.14_. Any physical Materials remaining after
such ninety (90) day period shall be destroyed by the Purchasers
Representative or the Purchasers Group and an authorized officer of the
Purchasers shall certify to the Sellers Representative in writing that such
destruction has taken place, unless, at Sellers option, a member of the

remaining Materials to be delivered to its or its designees offices.

and the Purchasers Group (including following the Closing, the Target
Companies) shall maintain a hyperlink to the website of the Sellers and the
Sellers shall maintain a hyperlink to the website of the Target Companies or
such other domain name or uniform resource locator that may be agreed upon by
the parties hereto during such period of one hundred eighty (180) days,
informing customers and end users they may reach the website of the Sellers or
any member of

 



-72-   the Sellers Group, or the website of the applicable Target Companies,
respectively, via such hyperlink. For a period of one hundred and eighty (180)
days following the Closing, Seller or its designee will redirect Internet

Group, acknowledges and agrees that, (x) as between the parties hereto, the

and Marks as permitted in this _Section 5.14_ shall be only with respect to
goods and services of a level of quality equal to or greater than the quality
of goods and services with respect to which the Target Companies used such
Sellers Names and Marks prior to the Closing. The Purchasers Representative,
for itself and the Purchasers Group, agrees that after the Closing, neither
the Purchasers nor any member of the Purchasers Group, will expressly, or
willingly by implication, do business as or represent themselves as the
Sellers or any member of the Sellers Group, and the personnel of the
Purchasers or any member of the Purchasers Group shall not, and shall have
no authority to, as of the Closing, hold themselves out as officers, employees
or agents of the Sellers or any member of the ING Group.

 

(f) The Purchasers Representative, on behalf of itself and the Purchasers
Group (including, following the Closing, the Target Companies) agrees that

concurrently with this Agreement, the Trademark Assignment Agreement, the
Clarion Partners Trademark License Agreement and the ING Trademark License
Agreement. The Sellers acknowledge that the Target Companies currently use

or interest in the name CLARION, such Seller shall, and shall cause such
Affiliates to, at or prior to Closing, assign, transfer and convey to a Target
Company all such right, title and interest, if any, in the CLARION name. The
Sellers and such Affiliates will cease use of the CLARION name within a
reasonable period after Closing, not to exceed ninety (90) days after Closing,
except (i) that the

 



-73-   Sellers or such Affiliates may redirect or may cause the redirection of
certain domain names containing the CLARION name for a limited time period
after the Closing of this Agreement or any agreement involving the sale of
ING Clarion Partners, LLC (" _CP Sales Agreement_ ") or (ii) in accordance
with this Agreement, the CP Sales Agreement, the Clarion Partners Trademark
License Agreement or the ING Trademark License Agreement.

(h) For the purposes of this _Section 5.14_ only, references to Target
Companies shall be deemed to refer to the relevant Target Companies and the
Funds (including Fund Subsidiaries).

shall procure that as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing and in
any event within forty-five (45) Business Days thereafter the registered

the Sellers Guarantor on demand.

(e) The liability of the Sellers Guarantor under this _Section 5.17_ (i)
shall not be released or diminished by any variation of the Sellers
Guaranteed Obligations or any forbearance, neglect or delay in seeking

(c) This guarantee is to be a continuing guarantee and accordingly is to
remain in force until all of the Purchasers Guaranteed Obligations have been
performed or satisfied. This guarantee is in addition to and without prejudice

have or hold for the performance and observance of the Purchasers Guaranteed
Obligations.

or circumstance (other than any limitation imposed by this Agreement or any

(b) After the Closing Date, the Purchasers Representative and the Sellers
Representative shall (i) assist the other party in preparing any Tax Returns
which such other party is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance
with this _Section 7.4_, and (ii) reasonably cooperate in preparing for any
audits of, or disputes with, any Tax Authority regarding any Tax Returns of
the Target Companies.

(c) Except as provided in _Section 7.5_ ( _Transfer Taxes_ ), if either the
Purchasers Representative or the Sellers Representative shall be liable
hereunder for any portion of the Tax shown due on any Tax Returns required to
be filed by the other party, the party preparing such Tax Return
shall deliver a copy of the relevant portions of such Tax Return to the party
so liable for its review and approval not less than thirty (30) days prior to
the date on which such Tax Returns are due to be filed (taking into account
any applicable extensions). If the Purchasers Representative and the
Sellers Representative disagree as to any item reflected on any such return,
the Sellers Representative shall determine how the disputed items are
reflected, if at all, unless (i) such returns relate solely to Taxes for
which the Purchasers Representative is liable hereunder, in which case the
Purchasers Representative shall make the determination, or (ii) such items
relate to Taxes which could reasonably be expected to otherwise materially
adversely affect the Purchasers Representative or any of its Affiliates, in
which case the Purchasers Representative and the Sellers Representative
shall negotiate in good faith to arrive at a reasonable resolution and, if
the Purchasers Representative and the Sellers Representative are unable to
reach an agreement, the CPA Firm shall make the determination, in a reasonable
manner that takes into account the interests of both the Purchasers
Representative and the Sellers Representative. The Purchasers Representative
must not, without the prior written consent of the Sellers Representative
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,

 



-86-   conditioned or delayed): (i) except as required by applicable Law or except
solely to carryback losses or credits from another taxable period, amend, or
request or permit the amendment of a Tax Return filed or required to be filed
by the Sellers Representative or of a Tax Return that the Sellers
Representative is entitled to review pursuant to this _Section 7.4(c)_,
provided that if consent is required because such amendment does not relate
solely to the carryback of losses or credits, the Sellers Representative
shall not have the right to deny the carryback in connection with such
amendment; (ii) apply to any Tax Authority for any binding or non-binding
opinion, ruling or other determination in relation to any act, matter or
transaction covered by any such Tax Returns or to any act, matter or
transaction occurring on or before the Closing Date; or (iii) except as
otherwise required by applicable Law, furnish to any Tax Authority any
information (in writing or otherwise) in relation to any such Tax Returns or
to any act, matter or transaction occurring on or before the Closing Date.

 

Section 7.5 _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes arising in respect of the
acquisition of the Shares and the Sale Assets shall be borne by the
Purchasers. The Purchasers Representative, or, if the Sellers Representative
or a member of its group is legally required to do so, the Sellers
Representative (the " _Payer_ ") shall procure the filing of all necessary
documentation relating to such Transfer Taxes and the parties shall cause
members of their respective groups to sign any such documentation (except that
a party shall not be required to sign any document which it
reasonably considers not to be true and correct in all material respects). To
the extent that any Transfer Taxes are required to be remitted to any
Government Authority, the Payer shall discharge such obligation and if the
Purchasers Representative is not the Payer it shall pay or procure the
payment of an amount equal to such Transfer Taxes to the Payer or at its
direction, in accordance with this _Section 7.5_, by the later of (i) five
(5) Business Days after receiving a demand from the Payer to do so and (ii)
two (2) Business Days before the date on which that obligation would have had
to be discharged in order to avoid incurring a liability to interest or a
charge or penalty. Any Transfer Taxes resulting from any subsequent transfer
of the Shares, Sale Assets or any transfer of property on or subsequent to the
Closing Date shall be borne by the Purchasers Representative.

Section 7.6 _Contest Provisions_. Each of the Purchasers Representative and
the Sellers Representative shall promptly notify the other in writing upon
receipt of notice of any pending or threatened audits or assessments with
respect to Taxes for which such other party (or such other partys Affiliates)
may be liable hereunder, _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to give
such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Partys obligations under this
_Article VII_ except to the extent such failure prejudices the defenses or
other rights available to the Indemnifying Party. The Sellers Representative,
at its own expense, shall be entitled to participate in the defense of and,
at its option, take control of the complete defense of, any Tax audit or
administrative or court proceeding relating to Taxes for which it may be
liable, including any settlement or other disposition thereof, and to employ
counsel of its choice at its expense _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Sellers Representative must, to the extent doing so is reasonably
practicable, inform the Purchasers Representative before taking any material
action with respect to the conduct of such Tax audit or other proceeding.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Purchasers Representative reasonably
determines that such Tax audit or other proceeding could have a material
adverse impact on the Taxes of any member of the Purchasers Group in a
taxable period or portion thereof beginning after the Closing Date or
otherwise materially adversely affect any member of the Purchasers Group, (i)
the Sellers Representative shall not settle such Tax audit or other

 



-87-   proceeding without the consent of the Purchasers Representative (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and (ii) the
Purchasers Representative, at its own expense, shall have the right to
participate fully in all aspects of the prosecution or defense of such Tax
audit or other proceeding. The Purchasers Representative must, at the cost of
the Sellers Representative ( _provided_  that the Sellers Representative
will only be liable for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses), procure all
assistance the Sellers Representative may reasonably require in relation to
any action taken in respect of such audit or assessment. The Purchasers
Representative must procure that the Sellers Representative (or its
designated Affiliate) is authorized to take such action on behalf and in the
name of the relevant Target Company as the Sellers Representative
may reasonably require in respect of such audit or assessment, including
responding (in writing or otherwise) to any audit inquiry from any Tax
Authority, attending and conducting interviews, meetings, discussions and
negotiations with any Tax Authority, negotiating and concluding compromises,
agreements and settlements with any Tax Authority, lodging requests for
ruling, opinions or determinations with any Tax Authority or lodging or
instituting objections, applications, appeals and other litigations with any
Tax Authority, tribunal or court. Neither party may agree to settle any claim
for Taxes for which the other may be liable (including under _Section 7.1_
and _Section 7.2_ of this Agreement) without the prior written consent of
such other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 

Section 7.7 _Members of the Purchasers  Group Claiming, Receiving or Using of
Refunds and Overpayments_. (a) If, after the Closing, any member of the
Purchasers Group or its Affiliates receives any refund, credit of Taxes or
similar payments which (x) relates to a Tax that is paid by any members of the
Sellers Group or its Affiliates, unless that Tax represents an asset on a
Closing Statement, (y) relates to a Tax that is otherwise taken into account
in a Closing Share Statement for purposes of determining any adjustment to the
Purchase Price under _Section 2.6_ or (z) otherwise relates to an amount
that has been paid by the Sellers Representative to a Purchasers Indemnified
party pursuant to _Section 7.1_ or _Article VIII_ , the Purchasers
Representative shall promptly transfer, or cause to be transferred, to the
Sellers Representative the entire amount of the refund or credit (including
interest actually received from a Taxing Authority) received or utilized by
such member of the Purchasers Group or its Affiliates, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such refunds or similar payments shall be for the account
of the Purchasers Representative to the extent they are attributable to the
carryback from a taxable period (or portion thereof) that begins after the
Closing Date. The Purchasers Representative agrees to notify the Sellers
Representative promptly of both the discovery of a right to claim any such
refund, credit or similar payment and the receipt of any such refund, credit
or similar payment. The Purchasers Representative agrees to cause members of
the Purchasers Group or their Affiliates to claim any such refund or credit
as soon as possible and to furnish to the Sellers Representative all
information, records and assistance necessary to verify the amount of the
refund or credit. The Purchasers Representative shall permit the Sellers
Representative (or its designated Affiliate) to control at the Sellers
Representatives expense the prosecution of any such refund claim and shall
cause the relevant entity to authorize by appropriate power of attorney such
Persons as the Sellers Representative shall designate to represent
such entity with respect to such refund claim, _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Sellers Representative must, to the extent doing so is reasonably
practicable, first inform the Purchasers Representative before taking any
action with respect to the conduct of such refund claim and, if the
Purchasers Representative reasonably determines that such refund claim could
have a

 



-88-   material adverse impact on the Taxes of any member of the Purchasers Group
in a taxable period or portion thereof beginning after the Closing Date, (i)
the Sellers Representative shall not settle such refund claim without the
consent of the Purchasers Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) and (ii) the Purchasers Representative, at
its own expense, shall have the right to participate fully in all aspects of
the prosecution of such refund claim.

(b) If, after the Closing, any member of the Purchasers Group or its
Affiliates actually realizes a Tax benefit as a result of payments of amounts
set forth in _Section 7.7(b)_ of the Sellers\' Disclosure Letter, the
Purchasers Representative shall promptly transfer, or cause to be
transferred, to the Sellers Representative, the entire amount the amount of
such actually realized Tax benefit (calculated and determined under the
principles of Section 8.7(b)).

 

Section 7.8 _Allocation of Purchase Prices_. The allocation of the Aggregate
Estimated Sale Asset Closing Amount and the Initial Share Purchase Price, as
set forth in column (2) of Part 3 ( _Initial Share Purchase Price_ ) of _Annex
1_ ( _Details Regarding Shares and Sale Assets_ ), and subject to any
adjustments to such amounts herein (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
adjustments made in respect of indemnity payments pursuant to _Section 8.12_
( _Adjustment to the Purchase Price_ ), shall be binding on the Sellers
Representative, the Share Seller, the Asset Sellers, the Purchasers
Representative, the Share Purchasers and the Asset Purchasers for all Tax
purposes.

Section 7.9  _Assistance and Cooperation_. After the Closing Date, the
Sellers Representative and the Purchasers Representative shall cooperate
fully in preparing for any audits of, or disputes with any Tax Authority
regarding, any applicable Tax Returns and payments in respect thereof. Each
party shall (a) provide timely notice to the other in writing of any pending
or proposed audits or assessments with respect to Taxes for which such other
party may have a liability under this Agreement, (b) furnish the other with
copies of all relevant correspondence received from any Tax Authority in
connection with any audit or information request with respect to any Taxes
referred to in (a), and (c) make available to the other party all books,
records, financial statements, Tax Returns or portions thereof (together with
related paperwork and documents relating to rulings or other determinations by
Tax Authorities), proof of payment of Taxes, documents, files, officers or
employees (without substantial interruption of employment) or other relevant
information necessary or useful for such purposes.

Section 7.10 _Maintenance of Books and Records by Members of the Purchasers 
Group_. Until the applicable statute of limitations (including periods of
extension or waiver) has run for any Tax Returns filed or required to be
filed covering the periods up to and including each Closing Date, the
Purchasers Representative shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, retain or
cause to be retained all books and records relating to the Target Business in
existence on such Closing Date and after such Closing Date will provide the
Sellers Representative access to such books and records for inspection and
copying by the Sellers Representative, or its agents upon reasonable request
and upon reasonable notice. After the expiration of such period no such books
or records shall be destroyed by members of the Purchasers Group without
first advising the Sellers in writing and giving the Sellers Representative
a reasonable opportunity to obtain possession thereof (with any costs of
transferring such books and records to be paid by the Sellers
Representative).

 



-89-  Section 7.11 _Scope of Article VII_. This _Article VII_ shall constitute
the sole governing provisions regarding Tax matters and claims with respect
to any indemnification for Taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the Agreement, the indemnity provided under _Section 7.1_ ( _Indemnification
for Taxes by the Sellers  Representative_) shall not be subject to the
provisions of _Section 8.2(b)_ ( _Minimum Claims_ ), _Section 8.2(c)_ (
_Seller Thresholds_ ) and _Section 8.2(d)_ ( _Seller Liability Caps_ ).
However, this _Article VII_ shall be governed by the terms of _Section 8.4_ (
_Damages_ ), _Section 8.5_ ( _Contingent Liabilities_ ), _Section 8.6_ (
_Provisions_ ), _Section 8.7_ ( _Net Financial Benefit_ ), _Section 8.9_ (
_Right to Recover_ ), _Section 8.12_ ( _Adjustment to the Purchase Price_ )
and _Section 8.13_ ( _Remedies_ ).

 

Section 7.12 _Tax Sharing Agreement_. The Sellers Representative shall cause
all Tax allocation agreements or Tax sharing agreements with respect to each
of the Target Companies (other than Tax allocation agreements or Tax sharing
agreements that are solely between or among Target Companies) to be terminated
as of the Closing Date, and shall ensure that such agreements are of no
further force or effect as to any of the Target Companies on and after the
Closing Date and that there shall be no further liabilities or obligations
imposed on any of the Target Companies under any such agreements.

notice of any claim for indemnification (I) under this _Article VIII_ shall
have been given in accordance with _Section 8.11(c)_ or (II) under _Article
VII_ shall have been given in accordance with the relevant provisions of
_Article VII_ , in each case within the applicable Survival Period and such
claim has not been finally resolved by the expiration of such Survival Period,
the representation or warranty that is the subject of such claim shall survive
solely for purposes of resolving such outstanding claim until such claim is
finally resolved. The covenants in this Agreement shall survive the Closing in
accordance with their terms; _provided_ _that_ , the indemnification

actually sustained or incurred by any of the Purchasers Indemnified Parties,
whether in respect of third party claims, claims between the parties hereto,

in  _Section 3.9_ ( _Taxes_ ), the exclusive remedy, if any, for which shall
be provided pursuant to _Article VII_ ( _Tax Matters_ )) as of the date hereof
or as of the Closing with the same force and effect as if made on and as
of the Closing (it being understood, however, that representations and
warranties that are made as of a specific date speak only as of that date),
(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement to be performed by any member of
the Sellers Group contained in this Agreement other than _Section

provided pursuant to Article VII, ( _Tax Matters_ )), (iii) any Excluded CP
Liability, (iv) any Excluded Advisory Contract Liability, (v) liabilities of
any Target Company as obligor or guarantor of any indebtedness for borrowed

determining the Purchase Price adjustment pursuant to _Section 2.5_, and (vi)
any Specified Liabilities or Indebtedness of any Target Company to the extent
existing at Closing and not taken into account for purposes of determining
the Purchase Price adjustment pursuant to _Section 2.5_. The indemnities in

relevant Specified Liability or Indebtedness is a Tax Loss (the applicable
remedy for which, if any, is provided pursuant to Article VII of this
Agreement).

(b) _Minimum Claims_. No member of the Sellers Group shall be liable for any
individual Loss or Losses arising from a single event or related set of
circumstances with respect to the matters contained in _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ (
_Indemnification by the Sellers_ ) unless the Loss or Losses arising from a a
single event or related set of circumstances, exceeds $250,000 in which case
the Purchasers Indemnified Parties shall be entitled, subject to the
limitations set forth in this Agreement, to indemnification for the full
amount of such Loss (and not merely the excess) up to the aggregate maximum
amount set forth in _Section 8.2(d)_ ( _Seller Liability Caps_ ).

(c) _Seller Thresholds_. No member of the Sellers Group shall be liable in
respect of Losses with respect to the matters contained in _Section
8.2(a)(i)_ and _Section 8.2(a)(iv)_ ( _Indemnification by the Sellers_ )

-91-  (e) For purposes of this _Section 8.2_ and notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, any qualification of any Sellers
Representations and Warranties by reference to the materiality of or Material
Adverse Effect relating to the matters stated therein or word of similar
effect (excluding such references in _Section 3.6(a)_, _Section 3.7(a)_,
_Section 3.6(b)_, _Section 3.18(c)_, _Section 3.18(e)_ and _Section 3.22_)
shall be disregarded in determining any breach thereof or the amount of any
Loss arising therefrom, except to the extent the word "material" is used to
define a list of items rather than a qualifying statement in _Sections 3.11_ ,
_Section 3.12_, _Section 3.13_ and  _Section 3.15_.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the limitations contained
in  _Section 8.2(b)_, _Section 8.2(c)_ and _Section 8.2(d)_, shall not
apply to (i) any Loss incurred by any member of the Purchasers Group in
connection with or arising from actual fraud by any member of the Sellers
Group, (ii) any Loss arising from a breach of any Seller Fundamental
Representation, (iii) any Loss in respect of _Section 8.2(a)(ii)_, _Section
8.2(a)(iii)_, _Section 8.2(a)(v)_ and  _Section 8.2(a)_(vi), or (iv) any
Loss under _Article VII_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
limitations contained _Section 8.2(b)_ and _Section 8.2(c)_ shall not apply
to any Loss in respect to _Section 8.2(a)(iv)_.

Section 8.3 _Indemnification by the Purchasers_. The
Purchasers Representative, on behalf of each Purchaser, hereby agrees that
from and after the Closing it shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless,
without duplication, the Sellers Indemnified Parties from, against and in
respect of any Losses actually sustained or incurred by the Sellers
Indemnified Parties, whether in respect of third party claims, claims between
the parties hereto, or otherwise, to the extent relating to or arising out of:
(i) any inaccuracies in or breach of any Purchasers Representation or
Warranty (it being understood that representations and warranties that are
made as of a specific date speak only as of that date), (ii) any breach of any
covenant or agreement to be performed by the Purchasers Group, and (iii) the
Management Transactions.

Section 8.4 _Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, no Person shall be liable under this Article VIII or under
Article VII (Tax Matters) for any punitive, special or exemplary damages or
lost profits (except to the extent such damages are actually awarded by a
court in connection with a Third-Party Claim).

Section 8.5 _Contingent Liabilities_. No Indemnifying Party shall be liable
under this _Article VIII_ or under _Article VII_ ( _Tax Matters_ ) in respect
of any Loss or Tax Loss which is contingent unless and until such contingent
Loss or Tax Loss becomes an actual liability and is due and payable.

Section 8.6 _Provisions_. No Indemnifying Party shall be liable under this
_Article VIII_ or under  _Article VII_ ( _Tax Matters_ ) in respect of any
Loss or Tax Loss to the extent such Loss or Tax Loss was specifically taken
into account in a Closing Statement for purposes of determining any adjustment
to the Purchase Price under  _Section 2.6_.

Section 8.7 _Net Financial Benefit_. (a) No Indemnifying Party shall be liable
under  _Article VII_ (Tax Matters) (in respect of any Tax Losses) or this
_Article VIII_ (in respect of any Losses) suffered by any Indemnified Party or
any of the Target Companies to the extent of any corresponding savings
actually realized by or quantifiable net financial benefit actually provided

 



-92-   to any member of such Indemnified Partys Group or any Target Company
arising from such Losses or Tax Losses or the facts, matters, events or
circumstances giving rise to such Losses or Tax Losses (including, as set
forth in _Section 8.7(b)_, where the amount (if any) by which any Taxation
for which any member of such Indemnified Partys Group or any Target Company
would otherwise have been accountable or liable to be assessed is actually
reduced or extinguished as a result of any fact, matter, event or circumstance
giving rise to such Loss or Tax Loss).

(b) Any amount of any Loss or Tax Loss for which reimbursement or
indemnification is provided under _Article VII_ ( _Tax Matters_ ) or this
_Article VIII_ shall be (i) paid net of any Tax benefit actually realized by
the reimbursed or indemnified party arising from the incurrence or payment of
any such Loss or Tax Loss, and (ii) increased by the amount of any Tax cost
(including from the receipt of any indemnity payments under _Section 7.1_ (
_Indemnification for Taxes by the Sellers  Representative_), _Section 7.2_ (
_Indemnification for Taxes by the Purchasers  Representative_), _Section
8.2_ ( _Indemnification by the Sellers_ ) or _Section 8.3_ (
_Indemnification by the Purchasers_ ) hereof and also including from any Tax
withheld or deducted at source) actually realized by the Indemnified Party as
a result of the receipt or accrual of the indemnification payment. For
purposes of this Agreement, an Indemnified Party shall be deemed to have
"actually realized" a Tax cost or a Tax benefit to the extent that, and at
such time as, the amount of Taxes payable by such Indemnified Party is
increased above or reduced below, as the case may be, the amount of Taxes that
such Indemnified Party would be required to pay but for the receipt of the
indemnity payment and/or the incurrence or payment of such Loss or Tax, as the
case may be. The amount of any increase or reduction hereunder shall be
adjusted to reflect any final determination with respect to the Indemnified
Partys liability for Taxes, and payments between the parties to this
Agreement to reflect such adjustment shall be made if necessary. The
determination of whether there has been a Tax cost or Tax benefit shall be
made in the Indemnified Partys reasonable discretion (exercised in good
faith). To the extent possible (and consistent with  _Section 8.12_ (
_Adjustment to the Purchase Price_ )) the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall cooperate to minimize the Tax costs and maximize any
Tax benefits that are realized on account of the receipt or accrual of any
indemnity payments made under _Article VII_ ( _Tax Matters_ ) or this _Article
VIII_ , _provided_ , however, that this cooperation provision shall only
require actions that are in compliance with applicable Law and that do
not materially adversely affect the Indemnified Party and shall not require
any party to share its Tax Returns.

Section 8.8  _Mitigation of Losses_. The Indemnified Parties shall procure
that all commercially reasonable steps are taken and all commercially
reasonable assistance is given to avoid or mitigate any Losses, which in the
absence of mitigation might give rise to or increase a Loss in respect of any
claim under this _Article VIII_. In the event an Indemnified Party fails to so
mitigate an indemnifiable Loss, the Indemnifying Party shall have no liability
for any portion of such Loss that could reasonably have been avoided had the
Indemnified Party made such efforts.

Section 8.9 _Right to Recover_. (a) If any Indemnifying Party is liable to
pay an amount in discharge of any claim under this Agreement and any member of
the Indemnified Partys Group recovers or is entitled to recover (whether by
payment, discount, credit, relief, insurance or otherwise) from a third party
(other than a Tax Authority, recovery against which is subject to the
provisions of _Article VII_ ( _Tax Matters_ ) of this Agreement) a sum which
indemnifies or compensates any member of the Indemnified Partys Group (in
whole or in part)

 



-93-   in respect of the Loss which is the subject matter of the claim, the
Purchasers Representative or the Sellers Representative, as applicable,
shall procure that, before steps are taken to enforce a claim against any
Indemnifying Party under this Agreement, all reasonable steps are taken to
enforce recovery against the third party and any actual recovery (less any
reasonable costs incurred in obtaining such recovery) shall reduce or
satisfy, as the case may be, such claim to the extent of such recovery.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Purchasers Representative or
Sellers Representative shall be required to act or forbear to act under
this  _Section 8.9_ if such act or forbearance, as applicable, could
prejudice such persons ability to prosecute a claim against an Indemnifying
Party or any right hereunder in the reasonable judgment of the Purchasers
Representative or Sellers Representative, as applicable.

(b) If any Indemnifying Party has paid an amount in discharge of any
claim under this Agreement and any member of the Indemnified Partys Group
recovers or is entitled to recover (whether by payment, discount, credit,
relief, insurance or otherwise) from a third party a sum which indemnifies or
compensates any member of the Indemnified Partys Group (in whole or in part)
in respect of the Loss or Tax Loss which is the subject matter of the claim,
the Purchasers Representative or the Sellers Representative, as applicable,
shall procure that all steps are taken as may reasonably be required to
enforce such recovery and shall, or shall procure that the relevant member of
the Indemnified Partys Group shall, pay to the Sellers Representative or the
Purchasers Representative, as applicable, as soon as practicable after
receipt an amount equal to (i) any sum recovered from the third party less any
costs and expenses incurred in obtaining such recovery less any Tax cost
actually realized after taking into account any Tax benefit actually realized
(each as determined under Section 8.7(b)) as a result of the recovery or (ii)
if less, the amount previously paid by the relevant Indemnifying Party to the
relevant Indemnified Party.

 

Section 8.10 _Double Claims_. No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
recover from any Indemnifying Party under _Article VII_ ( _Tax Matters_ ) or
this _Article VIII_ more than once in respect of the same Loss or Tax Loss
(notwithstanding that such Loss or Tax Loss may result from breaches of
multiple provisions of this Agreement).

 

Section 8.11 _Claims; Third Party Claim Indemnification Procedures_. (a) Any
claim notified in accordance with this  _Article VIII_ is unenforceable
against the Indemnified Party on the expiration of the applicable Survival
Period unless notice of such a claim shall have been given to the Indemnified
Party within the applicable Survival Period in accordance with _Section
8.11(c)_ below.

(b) _Notification of Potential Claims_. If any Indemnified Party becomes
aware of any matter or circumstance that may give rise to a claim for
indemnification under this _Article VIII_ (including an Investor Claim), the
Indemnified Partys Representative shall promptly give a notice in writing
(each, a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the Indemnifying Partys Representative
setting out the provisions under this Agreement on which such claim is based,
and such other information (to the extent available) as is reasonably
necessary to enable the Indemnifying Partys Representative to assess the
merits of the potential claim, to act to preserve evidence and to make such
provision as it may consider necessary (including details of the legal and
factual basis of the claim and the evidence on which the party relies
(including where the claim is the result of or in connection with a Third
Party Claim (including an Investor Claim), evidence of the Third Party Claim)
and setting out its estimate of the amount of Losses to the
extent ascertainable (which

 



-94-   estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such claim) which
are, or are to be, the subject of the claim); _provided_ _that_ failure to
provide notice hereunder shall not release the Indemnifying Partys
obligations under this _Article VIII_ except to the extent the Indemnifying
Party is materially prejudiced by such failure.

(c) _Investigation by the Indemnifying Party s Representative_. In connection
with any fact, matter, event or circumstance that may give rise to a claim
against any Indemnifying Party under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party
shall ensure that each relevant member of the Indemnified Partys Group: (i)
shall allow the Indemnifying Partys Representative and its advisers to
investigate the fact, matter, event or circumstance alleged to give rise to
such claim and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect of
such claim, and (ii) shall disclose to the Indemnifying Partys Representative
and its Representatives all material of which it is aware which relates to
the claim and shall, and shall procure that any other relevant members of the
Indemnified Partys Group shall, give, subject to their being paid all
reasonable costs and expenses, all such information and assistance,
including access to premises and personnel, and the right to examine and copy
or photograph any assets, accounts, documents and records, as the Indemnifying
Partys Representative or its Representatives may reasonably request, subject
to the Indemnifying Partys Representative and its advisers agreeing in such
form as the Indemnified Partys Representative may reasonably require to keep
all such information confidential and to use it only for the purpose of
investigating and defending the claim in question.

(d) The Purchasers Representative acknowledges and agrees that the only
Sellers Representations and Warranties given in relation to Tax matters are
the Article VIII Tax Representations and Warranties and the representations
and warranties set forth in _Section 3.9_ _( _Taxes_ )_. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in the preceding sentence shall prevent the Purchasers
Indemnified Parties from being indemnified under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ for any
Losses merely because such Losses happen to take the form of Taxes.

 

(e) In the event that any written claim or demand for which an Indemnifying
Party may have liability to any Indemnified Party hereunder is asserted
against or sought to be collected from any Indemnified Party by a third party
(a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall promptly, but in no
event more than ten (10) days following such Indemnified Partys receipt of a
Third Party Claim, notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such Third
Party Claim, the amount or the estimated amount of damages sought thereunder
to the extent then ascertainable (which estimate shall not be conclusive of
the final amount of such Third Party Claim), any other remedy sought
thereunder, any relevant time constraints relating thereto and, to the extent
practicable, any other material details pertaining thereto (a " _Third Party
Claim Notice_ "); _provided_ that the failure to provide notice hereunder
shall not release the Indemnifying Partys obligations under this _Article
VIII_ except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by
such failure. With respect to any Third Party Claim (other than a _Section
8.11(g)_ Investor Claim), the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days
(or such lesser number of days as set forth in the Third Party Claim Notice as
may be required by court proceeding in the event of a litigated matter) after
receipt of the Third Party Claim Notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") to notify
the Indemnified Party that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against
such Third Party Claim. With respect to any Section 8.11(f) Investor Claim,
the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing within
the Notice Period that the

 



-95-   Indemnified Party desires to follow the procedures set forth in Section
8.11(f) (a " _Section 8.11(f) Election_ "). In the event the Indemnified Party
fails to deliver a Section 8.11(f) Election within the Notice Period (or if
after assuming the defense of an Investor Claim, fails to take reasonable
steps necessary to defend diligently such Investor Claim within ten (10) days
after receiving written notice from the Indemnifying Party to the effect that
the Indemnified Party has so failed) the standard procedures in _Section
8.11(e)_ shall apply.

(f) In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party
within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third Party Claim (other than an Investor Claim as to which a
_Section 8.11(g)_ Election has been duly made), the Indemnifying Party shall
have the right to defend the Indemnified Party by appropriate proceedings and
the Indemnifying Party shall have the sole power to direct and control such
defense at its expense. Once the Indemnifying Party has duly assumed the
defense of a Third Party Claim (other than an Investor Claim as to which a
_Section 8.11(g)_ Election has been duly made), the Indemnified Party
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in any such
defense and to employ separate counsel of its choosing. The Indemnified Party
shall participate in any such defense at its expense unless (i) the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are both named parties to the
proceedings and the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that
representation of both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party by the
same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing
interests between them or (ii) the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of a
Third Party Claim (other than an Investor Claim as to which a _Section
8.11(g)_ Election has been duly made) after the Indemnifying Party has failed
to diligently pursue a Third Party Claim it has assumed, as provided in the
first sentence of _Section 8.11(i)_. The Indemnifying Party shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, to settle,
compromise or offer to settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim (other than
an Investor Claim as to which a _Section 8.11(g)_ Election has been duly
made) on a basis that would result in (v) the imposition of a consent order,
injunction or decree that would restrict the future activity or conduct of the
Indemnified Party or any member of the Indemnified Partys Group or Adobe
Fund, (w) a finding or admission of a violation of Law or violation of
the rights of any Person by the Indemnified Party, Adobe Fund or any member
of the Indemnified Partys Group, (x) a finding or admission that would have a
material adverse effect on other claims made or threatened against the
Indemnified Party, Adobe Fund or any member of the Indemnified Partys Group,
or (y) the imposition of any obligation on the Indemnified Party other than
the payment of monetary damages (which monetary damages will be paid or
reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party) or (z) any obligation on the part of
any member of the Indemnified Partys Group to make any public disclosure
regarding such settlements or the subject matter thereof.

 

(g) With respect to any Investor Claim brought against the Purchasers
Indemnified Parties (a "Section 8.11(g) Investor Claim"), the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to defend itself and its Affiliates by appropriate
proceedings and the Indemnified Party shall have the sole power (acting
reasonably and in good faith) to direct and control such defense (x) in
consultation with the Indemnifying Party and (y) with the assistance of
counsel selected by the Indemnified Party and approved by the Indemnifying
Party (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld). Once the Indemnified
Party has duly made a Section 8.11(g) Election, the Indemnifying Party shall
have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in any such defense and
to employ separate counsel of its choosing. The Indemnifying Party shall
participate in any such defense at

 



-96-   its expense unless (i) the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are
both named parties to the proceedings and the Indemnified Party shall have
reasonably concluded that representation of both the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to
actual or potential differing interests between them or (ii) the Indemnifying
Party assumes the defense of an Investor Claim after the Indemnifying Party
has failed to diligently pursue an Investor Claim as provided in the first
sentence of Section 8.11(h). The Indemnified Party shall not be permitted,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld), to settle, compromise or offer to settle or
compromise any Investor Claim; provided that, the Indemnified Party shall not
be permitted, without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party,
to settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any Investor Claim on
a basis that would result in (v) the imposition of a consent order, injunction
or decree that would restrict the future activity or conduct of the
Indemnifying Party or any member of the Indemnifying Partys Group, (w) a
finding or admission of a violation of Law or violation of the rights of any
Person by the Indemnifying Party or any member of the Indemnifying Partys
Group, (x) a finding or admission that would have a material adverse effect
on other claims made or threatened against the Indemnifying Party or any
member of the Indemnifying Partys Group, or (y) the imposition of any
obligation on the Indemnifying Party other than the payment of monetary
damages or (z) any obligation on the part of any member of the Indemnifying
Partys Group to make any public disclosure regarding such settlements or the
subject matter thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this
Section 8.11(g) do not apply during the period prior to the Closing.

(h) If the Indemnifying Party (i) elects not to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third Party Claim, whether by not giving the Indemnified Party
timely notice of its desire to so defend or otherwise or (ii) after assuming
the defense of a Third Party Claim, fails to take reasonable steps necessary
to defend diligently such Third Party Claim within ten (10) days after
receiving written notice from the Indemnified Party to the effect that the
Indemnifying Party has so failed, the Indemnified Party shall have the right
but not the obligation to assume its own defense; it being understood that the
Indemnified Partys right to indemnification for a Third Party Claim shall not
be adversely affected by assuming the defense of such Third Party Claim. The
Indemnified Party shall not settle a Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(i) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in order
to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third Party Claim, including
by providing access to each others relevant business records and other
documents, and employees.

(j) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall use reasonable
best efforts to avoid production of confidential information (consistent with
applicable Law), and to cause all communications among employees, counsel and
others representing any party to a Third Party Claim to be made so as to
preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privileges.

(k) If, due to the operation of any applicable Law, the Indemnifying Partys
Representative cannot exercise its rights or fulfill its obligations as
provided in _Section 8.11(g)_ above, the Indemnified Partys Representative
shall procure that each relevant member of the

 



-97-   Indemnified Partys Group shall co-operate with the Indemnifying Partys
Representative and shall use its reasonable best efforts to achieve the same
result as if  _Section 8.11(g)_ had been able to be fully implemented.

(l) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in no event may the Indemnifying Party
assume or maintain control of the defense of any Third Party Claim involving
potential criminal liability for the Indemnified Party, and (ii) in no event
may the Sellers Representative or any of its Affiliates (other than the
Target Companies) assume or maintain control of the defense of any Investor
Claim after the Closing (except in accordance with _Section 8.11 (g)_).

Section 8.12 _Adjustment to the Purchase Price_. (a) If any payment is made by
any Seller to any Purchaser or by any Purchaser to any Seller in respect of
any claim under this Agreement, including any claim made (pursuant to
_Section 7.1_ ( _Indemnification for Taxes by the Sellers 
Representative_)): (i) the payment shall, to the extent possible, be allocated
to the set of Shares or the Sale Assets to which the Sellers Representative
and the Purchasers Representative agree the payment and/or claim relates,
(ii) if the Sellers Representative and the Purchasers Representative agree
that the payment and/or claim relates to more than one set of Shares and/or
Sale Assets (such Shares and/or Sale Assets being referred to in this _Section
8.12(a)(i) _and _Section 8.12(a)(ii)_ as the " _Relevant Shares and/or Sale
Assets_ "), the payment shall be allocated among the Relevant Shares and/or
Sale Assets in a manner that the Sellers Representative and the Purchasers
Representative agree reflects the impact of the matter to which the payment
and/or claim relates, failing which it shall be allocated pro rata among the
Relevant Shares and/or Sale Assets in the same proportions as the amount of
the Purchase Price allocated to the Relevant Shares or Sale Assets bears to
the aggregate amount of the Purchase Price for all the Relevant Shares and
Sale Assets, or (iii) if the Sellers Representative and the Purchasers
Representative do not agree that the payment and/or claim relates to both
Shares and/or Sale Assets, the payment shall be allocated pro rata to all
Shares and Sale Assets in the same proportions as the amount of the Purchase
Price allocated to the Shares or relevant Sale Assets bears to the aggregate
Purchase Price, and in each case the Share Purchase Price and the Sale
Asset Purchase Price, as applicable, shall, to the extent possible, be deemed
to have been adjusted by the amount of such payment.

 

(b) If any payment is made by any Seller to any Purchaser in respect of any
claim under this Agreement and in any such case the allocation of such
payment pursuant to _Section 8.12(a)_ would otherwise reduce the
consideration paid for any set of Shares or Sale Asset to less than $1.00,
such allocation shall be made on the following basis: (i) the
consideration for the relevant set of Shares or Sale Asset shall be reduced
to $1.00, and (ii) the balance shall be allocated pro rata among all other
Shares and Sale Assets, or in the case of payment under _Section 8.12(a)(ii)_
among all other relevant Shares and/or Sale Assets, in the proportions set
forth in _Section 8.12(a)(ii)_ or _Section 8.12(a)(iii)_ as relevant.

(c) The proportions used for the purposes of allocating reductions shall be
adjusted as necessary to take account of any relevant previous reductions of
the Purchase Price in accordance with this  _Section 8.12_.

(d) For all Tax purposes, but subject to applicable Law, payments made by the
Sellers Representative and the Purchasers Representative pursuant to this
Agreement shall be

 



-98-   treated as having been made by the Sellers or the Purchasers, respectively,
of the Sale Shares or Sale Assets to which such payment is allocated pursuant
to this _Section 8.12_. 

Section 8.13 _Remedies_. Following the Closing, the rights and remedies of all
members of the Sellers Group and all members of the Purchasers Group under
_Article VII_ ( _Tax Matters_ ) or this _Article VIII_ are and shall be
exclusive and in lieu of any and all other rights and remedies which any
member of the Sellers Group and any member of the Purchasers Group may have
under this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or otherwise against each
other or each others Representatives with respect to the Transactions for
monetary relief (other than causes of action arising from fraud), and each of
the Purchasers Representative and the Sellers Representative expressly
waives for periods following the Closing any and all other rights or causes of
action (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, actions for specific
performance or similar injunctive relief or for fraud) it or any other member
of its group (such group being either the Purchasers Group or the Sellers
Group, as the context may require) may have against any other member of its
group (such group being either the Purchasers Group or the Sellers Group, as
the context may require) now or in the future under any Law or this Agreement
with respect to the subject matter of such indemnification provisions or
under or in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions. The foregoing
limitations shall not apply with respect to (i) the exercise of any rights or
remedies in connection with any breach under any Transaction Document, (ii)
the exercise of rights under _Section 10.7_ in connection with the breach of
any covenant to be performed after Closing hereunder, or (iii) actual fraud.

 

ARTICLE IX

 

 _TERMINATION_

Section 9.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing (a) by written agreement of the Sellers Representative and the
Purchasers Representative or (b) by either the Sellers Representative or
the Purchasers Representative, on behalf of itself and the relevant other
members of the Sellers Group or the Purchasers Group, respectively, by
notice in writing to the Purchasers Representative or the Sellers
Representative, as the case may be, if the Closing shall not have occurred on
or prior to the Final Closing Date _provided_ that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1_ shall not be available to a party
that has (or whose subsidiaries or holding companies have) breached in any
material respects its obligations under this Agreement in any manner that
shall have proximately contributed to the occurrence of the failure of the
satisfaction of any of the conditions in _Section 6.1_ ( _Conditions to the
Obligations of the Purchasers and the Sellers with Respect to the Closing_ ),
_Section 6.2_ ( _Conditions to the Obligations of the Purchasers to Effect
the Closing_ ) or _Section 6.3_ ( _Conditions to the Obligations of the
Sellers to Effect the Closing_ ).

Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. Upon a termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 9.1_ ( _Termination_ ), each partys further rights
and obligations hereunder, other than the Surviving Provisions, shall
terminate, but termination does not affect any rights or obligations of a
party which may have accrued prior to such termination. The termination of
this Agreement shall not relieve any party from liability for any breach of
this Agreement that arose prior to such termination, for which the liability
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in

 



-99-   effect. For the avoidance of doubt, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
survive any termination of this Agreement.

Section 9.3 _Additional Rights and Remedies_. The parties acknowledge and
agree that nothing in this _Article IX_ shall prejudice or limit any rights or
remedies which may otherwise be available to the Sellers or Purchasers under
this Agreement or pursuant to applicable Law, including the right to claim
damages.

and assigns. None of the parties may assign any of its rights or delegate any
of its obligations under this Agreement, by operation of Law or otherwise,
without the prior written consent of the other party, except as provided in

Documents_. (a) This Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the
Confidentiality Agreement contain the whole agreement between the parties
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement to the exclusion of any terms
implied by Law which may be excluded by contract and supersede any previous
written or oral agreement between the parties in relation to the matters dealt
with herein and therein.

(b) Each Purchaser acknowledges that it has not been induced to enter this
Agreement by any representation, warranty assurance, commitment, statement or
undertaking not expressly incorporated into it and agrees that it will not
contend to the contrary.

(c) So far as is permitted by Law, each Purchaser agrees and
acknowledges that its only right and remedy in relation to any provision of
this Agreement shall be for breach of the terms of this Agreement to the
exclusion of all other rights and remedies (including those in tort or arising
under statute) including any right to rescind this Agreement.

(d) If there is any inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and any
other Transaction Document, this Agreement shall prevail (as between the
parties to this Agreement and as between any other members of the Sellers
Group and any other members of the Purchasers Group) to the extent of the
inconsistency, unless otherwise expressly agreed.

Section 10.4 _Announcements_. No member of either the Purchasers Group or the
Sellers Group shall, and they shall cause the other members of the
Purchasers Group and the Sellers Group, respectively, not to, issue any
press release or make any written public announcement relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement prior to the Closing Date without the prior review
and written approval of (in the case of any press release or written public
announcement by a member of the Purchasers Group) the Sellers Representative
or (in the case of any press release or written public announcement by a
member of the Sellers Group) the Purchasers Representative; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any member of the Sellers Group or the Purchasers Group or
their respective Affiliates may make any public disclosure it believes in
good faith, after consultation with legal counsel, is required by applicable
Law or any listing or trading agreement concerning its publicly-traded
securities (in which case the Representative of the disclosing party (being
either the Sellers Representative or the Purchasers Representative, as
applicable) will use its reasonable best efforts to consult with the
Representative of the other party (being the other of the Sellers
Representative or the Purchasers Representative, as applicable)) before
making the disclosure and to allow such other partys Representative to review
the text of the disclosure before it is made.

 

Section 10.5 _Costs_. (a) Except as otherwise provided herein (including
_Section 5.10_ and  _Section 5.20_), the Sellers shall bear all costs
incurred by them or any of the Target Companies in connection with the
preparation, negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents and the sale of the Shares and the Sale Assets,
including the fees, expenses and disbursements of their counsel and
independent public accountants.

 

(b) Except as otherwise provided herein (including _Section 5.10_ and
_Section 5.20_), the Purchasers shall bear all such costs incurred by them
in connection with the preparation, negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the

 



-102-   purchase of the Shares and the Sale Assets including the fees, expenses and
disbursements of their counsel and independent public accountants.

 

Section 10.6 _Further Assurances_. (a) Without prejudice to _Article VI_ (
_Conditions to Closing_ ) and Section 2.13(b) ( _Deliveries and Actions by
the Sellers  Representative_), each of the parties shall from time to time
execute, or procure the execution of, such documents and instruments as any
party may reasonably require to transfer the Shares and the Sale Assets to
the Share Purchasers and the Asset Purchasers in accordance with the terms and
provisions of this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, with
respect to any Advisory Contract that Seller reasonably believes will become
an Excluded Advisory Contract, the Purchasers Representative agrees to
reasonably consider alternative structuring arrangements proposed by Sellers
Representative for any such Advisory Contract prior to the Closing.

 

Section 10.7 _Governing Law; Injunctive Relief; Consent to Jurisdiction;
Waiver of Trial by Jury_. (a) THE AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (WITHOUT REGARD
TO ANY PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW THAT WOULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF GIVING
EFFECT TO THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION). Each party acknowledges that
it would be impossible to determine the amount of damages that would result
from any breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement and that the remedy
at law for any breach, or threatened breach, of any of such provisions would
likely be inadequate and, accordingly, agrees that each other party shall, in
addition to any other rights or remedies which it may have, be entitled to
seek such equitable and injunctive relief as may be available from any court
of competent jurisdiction to compel specific performance of, or restrain any
party from violating, any of such provisions. In connection with any action or
proceeding for equitable and injunctive relief permitted hereunder, each party
hereby waives the claim or defense that a remedy at Law alone is adequate and
agrees, to the maximum extent permitted by law, to have each provision of this
Agreement specifically enforced against it, without the necessity of posting
bond or other security against it, and consents to the entry of equitable and
injunctive relief against it enjoining or restraining any breach or threatened
breach of such provisions of this Agreement.

(b) Each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the personal
jurisdiction of the Federal district court for the Southern District of New
York or the courts of the State of New York sitting in the Borough of
Manhattan in connection with any dispute that arises out of this Agreement or
any of the Transactions, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court and (iii) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to
this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby or any of the
Transactions in any court other than the Federal district court for the
Southern District of New York or the courts of the State of New York sitting
in the Borough of Manhattan unless venue would not be proper under rules
applicable in such courts. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, a party may
commence any such action in a court other than the above-named courts solely
for the purpose of enforcing an order or judgment issued by one of the above-
named courts.

 



-103-  (c) EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS.

Section 10.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, including via facsimile or electronic email transmission of a
copy, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which shall
constitute one and the same Agreement.

Section 10.9 _Headings_. The heading references herein and the table of
contents hereof are for convenience purposes only, and shall not be deemed to
limit or affect any of the provisions hereof.

Section 10.10 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not
be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity
or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision,
or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

 

Section 10.11 _Joint Negotiation_. The parties hereto have participated
jointly in negotiating and drafting this Agreement. In the event that an
ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement
shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or
burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue
of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

Section 10.12 _Sellers  Representative_. Each Seller hereby irrevocably
appoints the Sellers Representative as its representative to act on its
behalf for all purposes under this Agreement, including for the purposes of:

(a) delivering payment instructions to the Purchasers Representative in
connection with the payment of sums due hereunder and thereunder;

 

(b) accepting notices on its behalf;
