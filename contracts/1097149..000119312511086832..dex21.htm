as the "Surviving Corporation."

2.2 _The Closing._ Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to
Section 9.1 hereof, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place
at 10:00 a.m. (local time) on a Business Day as promptly as practicable after
the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto, and following
satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of the conditions
set forth in Article VII hereof (except for those conditions that, by their
nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction of
such conditions at the Closing), at the offices of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and
Rosati, Professional Corporation, 650 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, California,

2.3 _The Effective Time._ On the Closing Date, Parent, Merger Sub and the

being referred to herein as the "Effective Time").

2.4  _General Effects of the Merger._ At the Effective Time, the effect of
the Merger shall be as set forth in this Agreement and as provided in the
applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, except as otherwise
agreed to pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, all of the property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall
vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of
the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of
the Surviving Corporation.

2.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation._

(a) _Certificate of Incorporation_. Unless otherwise determined by Parent
prior to the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub,
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective
Time until thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware Law and as provided
in such certificate of incorporation; _provided, however_ , that at the
Effective Time, Article I of the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:
"The name of the corporation is Cadent Holdings, Inc." 

(b) _Bylaws_. Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective
Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation at the

provided in the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and
such bylaws.

2.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation._

 

(a) _Directors_. Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective
Time, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation from and after the

the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until their successors are duly elected and qualified.

2.7 _Effect of Merger on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Corporations._

 

(a) _Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of Common Stock of Merger Sub that
is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and thereafter represent one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of Common Stock of the Company as the Surviving
Corporation, such that immediately following the Effective Time, Parent
shall become the sole and exclusive owner of all of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of the Company as the Surviving Corporation. Each
stock certificate of Merger Sub shall thereupon evidence ownership of such
shares of capital stock of the Company as the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Parent-Owned or Company-Owned Company Capital Stock_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.7, each share of
Company Capital Stock that is held by Parent, the Company or any direct or
indirect Subsidiary of Parent or the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished without any consideration
paid therefor or in respect thereof.

(c) _Dissenting Shares of Company Capital Stock_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Section 2.7, Dissenting Shares shall be treated in
accordance with the terms of Section 2.8 hereof.

 

(d) _Company Capital Stock Generally_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holders of any shares of Company Capital Stock, each share of Company
Capital Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than (i) any shares of Company Capital Stock then held
by Parent, the Company or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent or the
Company, and (ii) any Dissenting Shares) shall be cancelled and extinguished
and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the per
share consideration that such class of Company Capital Stock is entitled to
receive pursuant to the Companys certificate of incorporation, as amended by
the Charter Amendment.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a portion of the consideration payable to each
Company Securityholder pursuant to this Section 2.7(d) with respect to the
shares of Company Capital Stock owned by such Company Securityholder as of the
Effective Time shall be reduced pursuant to the escrow provisions of Section
2.10(a) and Article VIII hereof. For purposes of calculating the amount of
Adjusted Merger Consideration payable to each Company Stockholder pursuant to
this Section 2.7(d), all shares of the Company Capital Stock held by each
Company Stockholder shall be aggregated on a certificate-by-certificate basis
and rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

(e) _Treatment of Company Options_.

(i) Parent shall not assume any Company Options in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. At the Effective Time, each Company Option
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be cancelled for no consideration.

(ii) Prior to the Effective Time, and subject to the review and approval of
Parent, the Company shall take all actions necessary to effect the
transactions anticipated by this Section 2.7(e) under the Plan and all
Company Option agreements and any other plan or arrangement of the Company
(whether written or oral, formal or informal), including delivering all
notices required thereby. No later than the Notice Mailing Date, the
Company shall notify the holders of Company Options, which such notice shall
be in compliance with the terms of the Plan and such Company Options, that
such Company Options will be cancelled at the Closing in the manner set forth
in this Section 2.7(e)(ii) hereof, and that the holders of such Company
Options may exercise

 



15  any such Company Options that are Company Options in compliance with the
terms provided in the Plan and the relevant Company Option agreement governing
the exercise thereof on or prior to the last date specified in the notice,
conditioned upon and subject to completion of the Merger. Materials to be
submitted to the holders of Company Options in connection with the notice
required under this Section 2.7(e)(ii) shall be subject to review and
approval by Parent.

(f) _Treatment of Company Warrants_.

 

(i) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause each holder of a Company Warrant to
execute and deliver an agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as
Exhibit G (each, a "Warrant Termination Agreement"), consenting to the
treatment of such holders Company Warrant provided for in Section 2.7(f)(ii)
and providing for (A) the appointment by such holder of the Securityholder
Representative pursuant to Section 8.8 of this Agreement, (B) the agreement of
such holder to be bound by the indemnification provisions contained in this
Agreement, and (C) the waiver of any advance notice of the Merger under the
terms of such holders Company Warrant.

(ii) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Warrant, whether or not
then exercisable, with respect to which the holder thereof has executed and
delivered a Warrant Termination Agreement, shall be cancelled in
consideration for the right to receive, for each share of Company Capital
Stock which may be purchased under such Company Warrant, an amount, in cash,
equal to (A) the per share consideration that such class of Company
Capital Stock is entitled to receive pursuant to the Companys certificate of
incorporation, as amended by the Charter Amendment _minus_ (B) the exercise
price per share of Company Capital Stock at which such Company Warrant was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(iii) All Company Warrants other than those to be cancelled pursuant
to Section 2.7(f)(ii) above shall be either (A) exercised by the holders of
such Company Warrants in full or (B) terminated, cancelled or automatically
converted into shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock as
of immediately prior to the Closing, either pursuant to its terms or pursuant
to an agreement with the holder thereof.

(g)  _Withholding Taxes_. The Company, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
and their respective representatives and agents shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any amount, including any portion of the Adjusted Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former
holder of Company Capital Stock, a Company Option or a Company Warrant, such
amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under any
provision of U.S. federal, state, local, Israeli or other non-U.S. Tax Law or
under any other Law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes as having been paid to the
Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not withhold, or
shall withhold a reduced Tax amount, as the case may be, pursuant to a Valid
Tax Certificate if the holder or former holder of Company Capital
Stock, Company Options or Company Warrants has provided to Parent or the
Surviving Corporation a Valid Tax Certificate at least three (3) Business Days
prior to the date any payment payable pursuant to this Agreement is made. A
"Valid Tax Certificate" means a certificate or ruling issued by the ITA which
is sufficient to enable Parent or the Surviving Corporation to conclude in its
sole discretion that no withholding (or reduced withholding) of Israeli Tax is
required with respect to such holder or former holder of Company Capital
Stock, Company Options or Company Warrants

2.8 _Dissenting Shares._

(a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary,
any shares of Company Capital Stock held by an Company Stockholder who has
not effectively withdrawn or lost such Company Stockholders dissenters or
appraisal rights under Delaware Law (any such shares, the "Dissenting Shares")
shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive a portion of the
Adjusted Merger Consideration for such Company Stockholders shares of Company
Capital Stock set forth in Section 2.7 hereof, but in lieu thereof, such
Company Stockholder shall be entitled to such rights as are provided by
Delaware Law.

 



16 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.8(a) hereof, if any holder
of Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) such holders dissenters or appraisal rights under
Delaware Law, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence
of such event, such holders shares shall automatically be converted into and
represent only the right to receive the Adjusted Merger Consideration for
Company Capital Stock, as applicable, set forth in Section 2.7 hereof, without
interest thereon, and upon surrender of the certificate representing such
shares in accordance with the terms of Section 2.10 hereof.

 

(c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demand for
appraisal or other payment received by the Company pursuant to the applicable
provisions of Delaware Law, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld), make any payment with respect to any such demands
or offer to settle or settle any such demands. Any communication to be made by
the Company to any Company Stockholder with respect to such demands shall be
submitted to Parent in advance and shall not be presented to any Company
Stockholder prior to the Company receiving Parents consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the
extent that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Company (i) makes any
payment or payments in respect of any Dissenting Shares in excess of the
portion of the Adjusted Merger Consideration that otherwise would have been
payable in respect of such shares in accordance with this Agreement or (ii)
incurs any Losses (including attorneys and consultants fees, costs and
expenses and including any such fees, costs and expenses incurred in
connection with investigating, defending against or settling any action or
proceeding) in respect of any Dissenting Shares (excluding payments for such
shares) ((i) and (ii) together "Dissenting Share Payments"), Parent shall be
entitled to recover under the terms of Article VIII hereof the amount of such
Dissenting Share Payments.

2.9 _Determination of Adjusted Merger Consideration._ Three (3) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a
certificate, validly executed by the Companys chief financial officer,
setting forth the Companys good faith estimate of Net Debt, and attaching
copies of (x) statements from each financial institution at which the Company
and its Subsidiaries hold accounts setting forth the amount of cash on
deposit in such accounts, and (y) pay-off letters from each third party
referred to in clause (i) of the definition of Company Indebtedness, which
pay-off letters will set forth the amount of principal, interest and penalties
(if any) owing to the applicable third party as of the Closing Date (the "Net
Debt Certificate"). For purposes of determining the Adjusted Merger
Consideration, "Net Debt" shall be equal to the amount of Net Debt set forth
in the Net Debt Certificate.

 

2.10 _Closing Payment Procedures._

 

(a) _Escrow Deposit_. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, and
in no event later than 5:00 pm California time on the first (1st)
Business Day following the Business Day on which the Effective Time occurs,
Parent shall deposit with the Escrow Agent an amount of cash equal to the sum
of (i) the Base Escrow Amount, (ii) the Sales Tax Escrow Amount and (iii)
the Securityholder Representative Expenses Reserve. The Securityholder
Representative Expenses Reserve shall be made available solely to the
Securityholder Representative as directed by written instructions of the
Securityholder Representative for the payment of all Representative Losses
and Advisory Committee Expenses.

(b) _Closing Payments_.

 

(i) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, and in no event later
than 5:00pm California time on the first (1st) Business Day following the
Business Day on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall deliver an
amount equal to (A) the Adjusted Merger Consideration _less_ (B) the Base
Escrow Amount, _less_ (C) the Sales Tax Escrow Amount _less_ (D)
the Securityholder Representative Expenses Reserve to a paying agent,
selected by Parent in its sole discretion, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by the paying agent.

 



17 (ii) Following the Closing Date, Parent or its paying agent shall mail a
letter of transmittal in Parents standard form (the "Letter of Transmittal")
to each Company Stockholder, and, to the extent such Company Stockholder has
not already executed and delivered a Joinder Agreement and Stockholder Waiver
to Parent, a Joinder Agreement and Stockholder Waiver to each Company
Stockholder, in each case at the address set forth opposite such Company
Stockholders name on the Closing Date Spreadsheet.

 

(iii) Upon surrender of a certificate representing their respective shares of
Company Capital Stock (the "Company Stock Certificates") for cancellation to
Parent or its paying agent, together with the Letter of Transmittal and any
other instruments that Parent or its paying agent may reasonably require (the
"Exchange Documents"), duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall
be entitled to receive from Parents paying agent in exchange therefor, that
portion of the Adjusted Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company
Capital Stock represented by such Company Stock Certificate have been
converted pursuant to Section 2.7 hereof (determined, solely for purposes of
this Section 2.10(b), as if the Adjusted Merger Consideration equaled the
Adjusted Merger Consideration _less_ the Base Escrow Amount _less_ the Sales
Tax Escrow Amount and _less_ the Securityholder Representative Expenses
Reserve). Upon the surrender of any such Company Stock Certificate, the
Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall thereupon be cancelled. Until
so surrendered, each Company Stock Certificate outstanding after the Effective
Time will be deemed, for all corporate purposes thereafter, to evidence only
the right to receive the portion of the Adjusted Merger Consideration payable
in exchange for shares of Company Capital Stock (without interest) into which
such shares of Company Capital Stock shall have been converted pursuant
to Section 2.7 hereof.

(iv) Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the paying
agent to deliver the amount provided for in Section 2.7(f) to each holder of
Company Warrants that has executed a Warrant Termination Agreement.

(c) Subject to any amounts payable in respect of Dissenting Shares in
accordance with Section 2.8 hereof, in no event shall the aggregate per share
consideration paid or payable to Company Securityholders hereunder exceed the
Adjusted Merger Consideration.

2.11 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock._ The amounts
paid in respect of the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Capital
Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to be full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company
Capital Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Capital Stock which
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Company Stock Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this Article II.

2.12 _No Liability._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, none of Parent, Parents paying agent, the Surviving Corporation or
any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of any shares of Company Capital
Stock for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

2.13 _Transfers of Ownership._ If any payments are to be disbursed to a
Person other than the Person whose name is reflected on the Company Stock
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor, it will be a condition of the
issuance or delivery thereof that the certificate so surrendered will be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
person requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent
designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment
of any portion of the Adjusted Merger Consideration in any name other than
that of the registered holder of the certificate surrendered, or established
to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that such tax has
been paid or is not payable.

2.14 _Surrender of Certificates; Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates._ No
portion of the Adjusted Merger Consideration shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to shares 

 



18  of Company Capital Stock formerly represented thereby until the holder of
record of such Company Stock Certificate shall have surrendered such Company
Stock Certificate and the Exchange Documents pursuant hereto. In the event
any Company Stock Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
Parent or its agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, such amount, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 2.7
hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent or its agent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require
the Person who is the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to
provide an indemnification agreement in a form and substance acceptable to
Parent or its agent, against any claim that may be made against Parent or its
agent with respect to the certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

2.15 _Additional Adjustments to Adjusted Merger Consideration._ The per
share amounts of any Adjusted Merger Consideration payable to holders of
Company Capital Stock hereunder, and any other applicable numbers or amounts,
shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Capital Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with respect to
Company Capital Stock occurring or having a record date on or after the date
hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

2.16  _Further Assurances._ If at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, and the officers and directors of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub are fully authorized in the name of their
respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful
and necessary action.

of Company Capital Stock, whether or not such shares of Company Capital Stock
are outstanding.

any taxes. 

(c) _Executive Compensation Tax_. There is no contract, agreement, plan or
arrangement to which the Company or any ERISA Affiliate is a party, including

3.13 _Restrictions on Business Activities._ There is no agreement (non-
competition or otherwise), commitment, judgment, injunction, order or decree
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise
binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which has or may
reasonably be expected to have the effect of prohibiting or impairing in any
material respect any business practice of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, any acquisition of property (tangible or intangible) by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the conduct of business by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or otherwise limiting the freedom of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to engage in any line of business or to
compete with any person. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any agreement
under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is restricted from selling,
licensing, manufacturing or otherwise distributing any Company-Owned
Intellectual Property or Company Products or from providing services to
customers or potential customers or any class of customers, in any geographic
area, during any period of time, or in any segment of the market. 

3.14 _Title to Properties; Absence of Liens and Encumbrances; Condition of
Equipment._

 

(a) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any real property,
nor has the Company or any of its Subsidiaries ever owned any real property.
Section 3.14(a) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of all real
property currently leased, subleased or licensed by or from the Company and
its Subsidiaries or otherwise used or occupied by the Company and
its Subsidiaries for the operation of its business (the "Leased Real
Property"), the name of the lessor, licensor, sublessor, master lessor and/or
lessee, the date and term of the lease, license, sublease or other occupancy
right and each amendment thereto, the size of the premises and the aggregate
annual rental payable thereunder.

(b) The Company has provided Parent true, correct and complete copies of all
leases, lease guaranties, subleases, agreements for the leasing, use or
occupancy of, or otherwise granting a right in or relating to the Leased Real
Property, including all amendments, terminations and modifications thereof
("Lease Agreements"); and there are no other Lease Agreements for real
property affecting the Leased Real Property or to which the

 



28  Company is bound, other than those identified in Section 3.14(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule. All such Lease Agreements are valid and effective in
accordance with their respective terms, and there is not, under any of such
leases, any existing default, no rentals are past due, or event of default (or
event which with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a
default). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
notice of a default, alleged failure to perform, or any offset or counterclaim
with respect to any such Lease Agreement, which has not been fully remedied
and withdrawn. The Closing will not affect the enforceability against
any Person of any such Lease Agreement or the rights of the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation to the continued use and
possession of the Leased Real Property for the conduct of business as
presently conducted. The Company and its Subsidiaries currently occupy all of
the Leased Real Property for the operation of their respective business. There
are no other parties occupying, or with a right to occupy, the Leased Real
Property. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is party to any
agreement or subject to any claim that may require payment of any brokerage
commissions or finders fees, and no such commission is owed, with respect to
any such Leased Real Property or would owe any such fees if any existing
Lease Agreement were renewed pursuant to any renewal options contained in such
Lease Agreements.

(c) The Leased Real Property is in good operating condition and repair, free
from any material structural, physical and mechanical defects, is maintained
in a manner consistent with standards generally followed with respect to
similar properties. Neither the operation of the Company and its Subsidiaries
on the Leased Real Property nor, to the Companys Knowledge, such Leased Real
Property, including the improvements thereon, violate in any material respect
any applicable building code, zoning requirement, ordinance, rule, regulation
or statute relating to such property or operations thereon, and any such non-
violation is not dependent on so-called non-conforming use exceptions. The
Companys Israeli Subsidiary has at all times had a valid occupancy permit (
_tofes 4_ ) for its Leased Real Property in its entirety. No event has
occurred in the Leased Real Property or in the public areas adjacent to its
Leased Real Property where a lack of such occupancy permit could, on its own,
or together with other contributing factors, adversely affect the Companys
Israeli Subsidiary or the Company, including (i) by invalidating or allowing a
third party (including an insurer) to claim an agreement whereby
the Companys Israeli Subsidiary was to be insured or indemnified or
otherwise protected from liability for third party claims is invalid, (ii)
allowing a third party (including a Governmental Entity) to claim that such
third party is not liable for damages it would otherwise have been liable
for, or (iii) preventing the legal provision of services to any part of the
Leased Real Property. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to expend more than $50,000 in the aggregate under all Lease
Agreements to restore the Leased Real Property at the end of the term of the
applicable Lease Agreement to the condition required under the Lease Agreement
(assuming the conditions existing in such Leased Real Property as of the date
hereof and as of the Closing). The Company and its Subsidiaries have good and
valid title to, or, in the case of leased properties and assets, valid
leasehold interests in, all of its tangible properties and assets, real,

rights, including all Intellectual Property rights therein, to the Company or
one of its Subsidiaries in writing, and the Company obtained any third party
consents required to effect such assignment. No employee, contractor or
consultant of the Company or its Subsidiaries who has been engaged in the
development of any Company-Owned Intellectual Property incorporated or
embodied in any Company Product, was an employee of, or engaging in services
for, a third party during such time that he or she was engaged by the Company

royalties or payments which the Company and its Subsidiaries would otherwise
be required to pay had such transactions contemplated hereby not occurred.

(iv) Neither this Agreement nor the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the assignment to Parent, by operation of law or

any third party in excess of those payable by Company and its Subsidiaries
prior to the Closing.

Subsidiaries with any applicable Laws, Permits or such requests or
requirements of a Governmental Entity, and, to the Knowledge of the Company,
neither the FDA nor any Governmental Entity is considering such action. No

substance of such resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of
Parent. The Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance
of terminating such Company Employee Plans as Parent may reasonably require.
In the event that termination of a 401(k) Plan would reasonably be anticipated
to trigger liquidation charges, surrender charges or other fees, then such

are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees
and provide such estimate in writing to Parent no later than 15 calendar days

Subsidiary for taxable years or periods ending on or before the Closing Date
("Pre-Closing Period Return"). In addition, Parent shall be responsible for
the preparation and timely filing of any Return relating to any Straddle
Period that is required to be filed after the Closing Date ("Straddle Period
Return"). The expense of preparing and filing any Pre-Closing Period Return or
Straddle Period Return shall be borne by the Surviving Corporation. Pre-
Closing Period Returns and Straddle Period Returns shall be filed in a manner
consistent with past practice (unless required by applicable Law to be filed
in a different manner), and no position shall be taken, election made or
method adopted that is inconsistent with positions taken, elections made
or methods used in prior income periods in filing such Pre-Closing Period
Returns and Straddle Period Returns (including any position which would have
the effect of accelerating or deferring income or deductions from one period
to another period (including from one portion of a Straddle Period to
another)) unless required by applicable Law or unless such position, election
or method does not give rise to a Loss of an Indemnified Party subject to the
indemnification provisions of Article VIII. Pre-Closing Period Returns and
Straddle Period Returns relating to income Taxes to be prepared by Parent
shall be submitted to the Securityholder Representative not later than fifteen
(15) days prior to the due date for filing such Returns (or, if such due date
is within 45 days following the Closing Date, as promptly as practicable
following the Closing Date) for review and approval by the Securityholder
Representative (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, it being
agreed and understood that Parent may file such Returns without first
obtaining the approval of the Securityholder Representative, but any such
Return filed without the approval of the Securityholder Representative shall
not be dispositive for purposes of determining the existence or amount of any
Loss that would be indemnifiable

 



59  pursuant to the provisions of Article VIII) and a copy of any such Return
filed by Parent shall be provided to the Securityholder Representative upon
request. All Taxes due on Pre-Closing Period Returns and Straddle Period
Returns shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, as
appropriate, and shall be, for the avoidance of doubt, subject to the
indemnification provisions of Article VIII hereof, together with any Losses
related thereto.

(ii) If Parent, any Affiliate of Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries amends any
Return filed by the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the date of this
Agreement, such amended Return shall be filed in a manner consistent with past
practice (unless required by applicable Law to be filed in a different manner
or unless such inconsistent manner does not give rise to a Loss of an
Indemnified Party subject to the indemnification provisions of Article VIII),
and Parent shall submit any amended Return relating to income Taxes to the
Securityholder Representative not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the
filing of such amended Return for review and approval by the Securityholder
Representative (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, it being
agreed and understood that Parent may file such amended Returns without first
obtaining the approval of the Securityholder Representative, but any such
Return filed without the approval of the Securityholder Representative
shall not be dispositive for purposes of determining the existence or amount
of any Loss that would be indemnifiable pursuant to the provisions of Article
VIII).

(b) _Allocation for Straddle Period_. For purposes of this Agreement, the
amount of Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries attributable to the pre-
Closing portion of any taxable period beginning before and ending after the
Closing Date (the "Straddle Period") shall be determined based upon a
hypothetical closing of the taxable year on such Closing Date with the Closing
Date being included in the pre-Closing portion of such Straddle Period
(except to the extent of any extraordinary actions taken by Parent after the
Closing on the Closing Date); _provided, however_ , real and personal property
Taxes (which are not based on income) shall be determined by reference to the
relative number of days in the pre-Closing and post-Closing portions of such
Straddle Period.

(c)  _Refunds_. Any refund of Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries
_plus_ any interest received with respect thereto from a Governmental Entity
for the taxable periods or portions thereof ending on or before the Closing
Date (including without limitation, refunds arising from amended Returns
filed after the Closing Date, but excluding any refunds attributable to the
carryback of a loss, credit or other Tax attribute arising in a post-Closing

(a) If the Merger is consummated, then until the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company to its
directors and officers as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the
"Company Indemnified Persons") pursuant to any indemnification provisions
under the Charter Documents as in effect on the date of this Agreement, and
pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company and such
Company Indemnified Parties existing as of the Agreement Date (the
"Company Indemnification Provisions"), with respect to claims arising out of
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. In connection
therewith Parent shall advance expenses to the Company Indemnified Persons as
incurred to the extent provided for under the Company Indemnification
Provisions, _provided_ , that the person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined

other insurance policies with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance with respect to acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the
coverage applicable to directors and officers as of the Effective Time under
the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy; _provided,
however_ , that if such "tail" or other policies are not available at an
aggregate cost not greater than 200% of the last annual premium paid prior to
the date hereof under such policy (the "Insurance Cap"), then the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be obtained as much comparable insurance as can
reasonably be obtained in its good faith judgment at a cost up to but not
exceeding the Insurance Cap.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.20, nothing in
this Section 6.20 shall be deemed to release and Company Securityholder or
any affiliate of such Company Securityholder who is also an officer or
director of the Company from his, her or its indemnity obligations as a
securityholder under Article VIII hereof, nor shall such Company
Securityholder or any affiliate of such Company Securityholder have any right
of contribution, indemnification or right of advancement from the Surviving
Corporation or Parent with respect to any Loss claimed by an Indemnified Party
against such Company Securityholder or any affiliate of such Company
Securityholder in his, her or its capacity as a company Securityholder
pursuant to Article VIII hereof.

(d) This Section 6.20 shall survive the consummation of the Merger, is
intended to benefit each Company Indemnified Person, shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation and Parent, and shall be
enforceable by the Company Indemnified Persons.

Stockholders identified on Section 3.2(e) of the Disclosure Schedule shall
have been paid off in full prior to the Effective Time.

a _bona fide_ claim by validly delivering a Claim Certificate of such
indemnification claim pursuant to this Article VIII; _provided, further,
however_ , that such indemnification obligations shall not terminate with
respect to any indemnification claim pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 8.2(a)
in respect of a willful failure by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
perform or comply with any covenant applicable to any of them contained in
this Agreement, any Related Agreements, or any certificates or other
instruments required to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

(e) Except in the case of fraud or willful misrepresentation with respect to
this Agreement, in any Related Agreement, or in any certificate or other
instrument required to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement on the part of
an Indemnifying Party, from and after the Effective Time, the Indemnifying
Parties shall not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Parties pursuant
to clause (x) of Section 8.2(a) for any indemnification claim that is made
after the eighteenth (18th) calendar month anniversary of the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such indemnification obligations shall not
terminate with respect to any item as to which any Indemnified Parties shall
have, before such date, previously made a _bona fide_ claim by validly
delivering a Claim Certificate of such indemnification claim pursuant to this
Article VIII.

8.4 _No Other Indemnification Limitations._

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
nothing herein shall limit the liability of an Indemnifying Party in respect
of Losses arising out of any fraud or any willful misrepresentation with
respect to this Agreement, in any Related Agreement, or in any certificate or
other instrument required to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement on the
part of the Indemnifying Party.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
parties hereto agree and acknowledge that any Indemnified Parties may bring a
claim for indemnification for any Loss under this Article VIII notwithstanding
the fact that such Indemnified Parties had knowledge of the breach, event or
circumstance giving rise to such Loss prior to the Closing or waived any
condition to the Closing related thereto.

(c) The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that their sole and exclusive
remedy from and after the Effective Time for recovery of Losses arising out of
or relating to the Agreement (other than claims of, or causes of action
arising from, fraud or willful misrepresentation) shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VIII; _provided, however_
, that nothing in this Agreement shall limit the rights of any party hereto to
apply for equitable remedies to enforce the other party or parties
obligations hereunder.

8.5 _Indemnification Claims Procedures._

 

(a) With respect to Section 8.2(a), any Indemnified Parties may make an
indemnification claim pursuant to Section 8.2(a) by delivering a certificate
(a "Claim Certificate") to the Securityholder Representative, with a copy to
the Escrow Agent (if and to the extent that the Indemnified Parties are
seeking recourse against the Escrow Fund), and to one or more Company
Securityholders (if and to the extent that the Indemnified Parties are seeking
recourse directly against any such Company Securityholders), (i) stating that
such Indemnified Parties have paid, sustained, suffered, incurred or accrued
(or reasonably anticipate that they will have to pay, sustain, suffer, incur,
or accrue) Losses, and (ii) specifying in reasonable detail the Losses
included in the amount so stated, if available, the date each such item was
paid, sustained, suffered, incurred or accrued, if applicable, or the basis
for such anticipated liability, and, if applicable, the nature of the
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant to which such item is
related. Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Securityholder
Representative hereby acknowledge and agree that (i) with respect to Losses
that are recoverable under Section 8.2 (other than Losses that are recoverable
under Section 8.2(a)(x)), until the earlier to occur of (x) the date on which
no funds (other than any remaining portion of the Securityholder
Representative Expenses Reserve and the Sales Tax Escrow Amount) remain
available in the Escrow Fund and

 



69  (y) the termination of the Escrow Period, the Indemnified Parties shall
first seek recourse from the Escrow Fund before seeking recourse directly
against any Company Securityholder, and (ii) with respect to Losses that are
recoverable under Section 8.2(a)(x), the Indemnified Parties sole recourse
shall be from the Sales Tax Escrow Amount in the Escrow Fund. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Securityholder Representative Expenses Reserve shall
not be available to the Indemnified Parties for recovery of Losses under
Section 8.2.

(b) Following its receipt of a Claim Certificate, the Securityholder
Representative shall have fifteen (15) calendar days to object to any item(s)
or amount(s) set forth therein by delivering written notice thereof (an
"Objection Notice") to the Indemnified Parties submitting such Claim
Certificate at the addresses of such Indemnified Parties set forth in such
Claim Certificate, with a copy to the Escrow Agent (if and to the extent that
the Indemnified Parties are seeking recourse against the Escrow Fund in
connection with Section 8.2(a)). In the event that the Securityholder
Representative shall fail to object, pursuant to this Section 8.5(b), to any
item or amount set forth in an Claim Certificate within the foregoing fifteen
(15) calendar day period, the Securityholder Representative shall be deemed to
have irrevocably agreed and consented to each such item or amount. With
respect to claims against the Escrow Fund, upon the expiration of such
fifteen (15) day calendar day period, the Escrow Agent shall promptly release
from the Escrow Fund and deliver to any Indemnified Parties that have
previously delivered the Claim Certificate only an amount of cash equal to
any item(s) and amount(s) that the Indemnifying Party is deemed to have
accepted pursuant to this Section 8.5(b); _provided_ , that in no event shall
the amount released from the Escrow Fund pursuant to this Section 8.5(b)
result in the amounts in the Escrow Fund being less than the remaining
Securityholder Representative Expenses Reserve.

(c) In the event that the Securityholder Representative shall object, pursuant
to Section 8.5(b), to any item(s) or amount(s) set forth in any Claim
Certificate, the Securityholder Representative and the Indemnified Parties
shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties
with respect to each of such claims. If the Securityholder Representative and
the Indemnified Parties should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by both Parent and the Securityholder
Representative, and, in the case of a claim against the Escrow Fund, shall be
furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on
any such memorandum and make distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance
with the terms hereof.

(d) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation and
prior to thirty (30) calendar days after delivery of an Objection Notice,
either the Securityholder Representative or the Indemnified Parties may demand
arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the Loss that is at issue is
the subject of a pending litigation with a third party, in which event
arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both
parties agree to arbitration, and in either such event the matter shall be
settled by arbitration conducted by one arbitrator mutually agreeable to the
Securityholder Representative and the Indemnified Parties. In the event that,
within thirty (30) calendar days after submission of any dispute to
arbitration, the Securityholder Representative and the Indemnified Parties
cannot mutually agree on one arbitrator, then, within fifteen (15) calendar
days after the end of such thirty (30) calendar-day period,
the Securityholder Representative and the Indemnified Parties shall each
select one (1) arbitrator. The two (2) arbitrators so selected shall select a
third arbitrator, who shall have relevant industry experience, to conduct the
arbitration. 

(e) Any such arbitration shall be held in Santa Clara County, California,
under the rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association. The
arbitrator(s) shall determine how all expenses relating to the arbitration
shall be paid, including the respective expenses of each party, the fees of
each arbitrator and the administrative fee of the American Arbitration
Association. The arbitrator or arbitrators, as the case may be, shall set a
limited time period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and
time for discovery while allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate in the
sole judgment of the arbitrator or majority of the three arbitrators, as the
case may be, to discover relevant information from the opposing parties about
the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrator, or a majority of the three
arbitrators, as the case may be, shall rule upon motions to compel or limit
discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including
attorneys fees and costs, to the same extent as a competent court of law or
equity, should the arbitrators or a majority of the

 



70  three arbitrators, as the case may be, determine that discovery was sought
without substantial justification or that discovery was refused or objected to
without substantial justification. The decision of the arbitrator or a
majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, as to the validity and
amount of any claim in such Claim Certificate shall be final, binding, and
conclusive upon the Indemnifying Party or Parties and the Indemnified
Parties. Such decision shall be written and shall be supported by written
findings of fact and conclusions which shall set forth the award, judgment,
decree or order awarded by the arbitrator(s). With respect to claims against
the Escrow Fund, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on, and make
distributions from the Escrow Fund (excluding any remaining amount of the
Securityholder Representative Expenses Reserve) in accordance with, the terms
of such award, judgment, decree or order as applicable. Within fifteen (15)
calendar days or, in the event that a payment is required exceeding the
remaining amount of the Escrow Fund (excluding any remaining amount of the
Securityholder Representative Expenses Reserve), promptly, after a decision
of the arbitrator(s) requiring payment by one (1) party to another, such party
shall make the payment to such other party, including any distributions out of
the Escrow Fund with respect to Section 8.2(a);  _provided_ , that in no
event shall the amount released from the Escrow Fund pursuant to this Section
8.5(e) result in the amounts in the Escrow Fund being less than the remaining
Securityholder Representative Expenses Reserve. 

(f) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in
any court having jurisdiction.

 

(g) The foregoing arbitration provisions shall apply to any dispute among the
Securityholder Representative and the Indemnified Parties under this Article
VIII.

8.6 _Third-Party Claims._

 

(a) In the event that any Indemnified Parties become aware of a third party
claim (a "Third Party Claim") which such Indemnified Parties reasonably
believe may result in an indemnification claim pursuant to this Article VIII,
the Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties) will
be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses, to
assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the Securityholder
Representative. Should the Securityholder Representative so elect to assume
the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Securityholder Representative
will not be liable to the Indemnified Parties for legal fees and expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Parties in connection with the
defense thereof. If the Securityholder Representative assumes such defense,
the Indemnified Parties shall have the right to participate in the defense
thereof and, at their own expense, to employ counsel reasonably acceptable to
the Securityholder Representative, separate from the counsel employed by the
Securityholder Representative, it being understood that the Securityholder
Representative shall control such defense. If there is a Third Party Claim
that, if adversely determined, would give rise to a right of recovery for
Losses hereunder, then any amounts incurred by the Indemnified Person in
defense of such Third Party Claim, regardless of the outcome of such claim,
shall be deemed Losses hereunder. The Company Securityholders shall be liable
for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Parties for
any period during which the Securityholder Representative has not assumed the
defense thereof. If the Securityholder Representative chooses to defend or
prosecute any Third Party Claim, all the parties hereto shall cooperate in the
defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon the Securityholder Representatives request) the provision to the
Securityholder Representative of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making officers, directors, employees
and agents of the Indemnified Parties available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide information, testimony at depositions, hearings or trials, and such
other assistance as may be reasonably requested by the Securityholder
Representative.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a Third Party Claim is made
against an Indemnified Party as to which such Indemnified Party is entitled to
seek indemnification hereunder and such Third Party Claim involves a claim (i)
that, in the reasonable judgment of Parent, could materially adversely affect
the Company in any respect, (ii) that, in the reasonable judgment of Parent,
could result in Losses in excess of the amounts then remaining in the Escrow
Fund available to satisfy such Losses, (iii) relating to, or otherwise in 

 



71  connection with Company Business Intellectual Property, or (iv) involving
criminal liability or in which equitable relief is sought against any
Indemnified Party, then in each such case the Indemnifying Party may not
elect to retain the defense of such Third Party Claim (or, if such Third Party
Claim was previously assumed by the Securityholder Representative, the
Securityholder Representative shall immediately relinquish control thereof to
the Indemnified Party), and the Indemnified Party will be entitled to be
reimbursed by the Indemnifying Parties for its Losses incurred in such defense
(including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees), such expenditures
to be reimbursed promptly after submission of invoices therefor, subject to
the limitations set forth in this Article VIII.

 

(c) Whether or not the Securityholder Representative shall have assumed the
defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any
liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third
Party Claim without the Securityholder Representatives prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
The Securityholder Representative shall not admit any liability with respect
to, or settle, compromise or discharge any Third Party Claim without the
Indemnified Partys prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnified Party shall agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of a
Third Party Claim that the Securityholder Representative may recommend and
that by its terms obligates the Company Securityholders to pay the full
amount of the liability in connection with such Third Party Claim, which
releases the Indemnified Parties completely in connection with such Third
Party Claim, and which does not otherwise have any adverse effect on any
Indemnified Party.

8.7 _Escrow Arrangements._

 

(a) _Escrow Fund_. By virtue of this Agreement and as partial security for the
Indemnified Parties under Section 8.2(a), at the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit with the Escrow Agent the Base Escrow Amount, the Sales Tax Escrow
Amount and the Securityholder Representative Expenses Reserve, such deposit to
constitute an escrow fund to be governed by the terms set forth herein. The
Base Escrow Amount ( _plus_ any interest paid on such Base Escrow Amount)
shall be available to compensate the Indemnified Parties for any claims by
such parties for any Losses suffered or incurred by them and for which they
are entitled to recovery under Section 8.2(a). The Sales Tax Escrow Amount (
_plus_ any interest paid on such Sales Tax Escrow Amount) shall be exclusively
available to compensate the Indemnified Parties for any claims by such
parties for any Losses suffered or incurred by them and for which they are
entitled to recovery under Section 8.2(a)(x). The Securityholder
Representative Expenses Reserve shall be used to pay the
Securityholder Representative Expenses and Advisory Committee Expenses in
accordance with Section 8.8(b). The Base Escrow Amount ( _plus_ any interest
paid on such Base Escrow Amount), the Sales Tax Escrow Amount ( _plus_ any
interest paid on such Sales Tax Escrow Amount) and the Securityholder
Representative Expenses Reserve ( _plus_ any interest paid on such
Securityholder Representative Expenses Reserve) are collectively referred to
herein as the "Escrow Fund". The Escrow Agent may execute this Agreement
following the date hereof and prior to the Closing, and such later execution,
if so executed after the date hereof, shall not affect the binding nature of
this Agreement as of the date hereof between the other signatories hereto.

(b) _Distribution of Escrow Fund_.

 

(i) Subject to the following requirements, the Escrow Fund shall be in
existence immediately following the Effective Time and shall terminate at
11:59 p.m., California time, on the seventh day following the termination of
the Escrow Period, and the Escrow Agent shall distribute the portion of the
Escrow Fund relating to the Base Escrow Amount to the Company Stockholders
(and to the former holders of Company Warrants who have executed Warrant
Termination Agreements) following such termination in accordance with the
Initial Escrow Release Spreadsheet (such distribution, the "Initial Escrow
Distribution");  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Escrow Fund shall not
terminate (i) with respect to any amount in respect of any unsatisfied claims
specified in any Claims Certificate in connection with Section 8.2(a)
("Unresolved Claims") delivered prior to the termination of the Escrow Period
with respect to facts and circumstances existing prior to the Expiration Date,

 



72  (ii) with respect to the Sales Tax Escrow Amount, or (iii) with respect to
the Securityholder Representative Expenses Reserve, and any such amounts shall
not be distributed to the Company Securityholders at such time. As soon as
all Unresolved Claims have been resolved after the Escrow Period termination
date, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the remaining portion of the Escrow Fund
(including any remaining portion of the Securityholder Representative
Expenses Reserve, but excluding any remaining portion of the Sales Tax Escrow
Amount), if any, not required to satisfy such Unresolved Claims, (i) first, to
the Securityholder Representative for any Representative Losses and Advisory
Committee Expenses that have not previously been paid to the Securityholder
Representative, and (ii) second, to the Company Stockholders (and the former
holders of Company Warrants who have executed Warrant Termination Agreements)
(such distribution to the Company Stockholders and former holders of Company
Warrants, the "Final Escrow Distribution", and the date of the Final Escrow
Distribution, the "Final Escrow Distribution Date"), in accordance with the
Final Escrow Release Spreadsheet.

(ii) No portion of the Escrow Fund relating to the Sales Tax Escrow Amount
shall be released or delivered to a Company Stockholder or former holder of
Company Warrants until the earlier of (x) the eighteen (18) calendar month
anniversary of the Closing Date, and (y) resolution, in a manner satisfactory
to Parent and determined in Parents sole discretion, of all issues in respect
of Unpaid Sales Taxes (written notice of such resolution to be delivered to
the Securityholder Representative, with a copy to the Escrow Agent) (the
"Sales Tax Escrow Termination Date"), and the Escrow Agent shall distribute
any remaining portion of the Escrow Fund relating to the Sales Tax Escrow
Amount to the Company Stockholders (and to the former holders of
Company Warrants who have executed Warrant Termination Agreements) following
such termination in accordance with the Initial Sales Tax Escrow Release
Spreadsheet (such distribution to the Company Stockholders and former holders
of Company Warrants, the "Initial Sales Tax Escrow Distribution"); _provided_
, _however_ , that the Escrow Fund in respect of the Sales Tax Escrow Amount
shall not terminate with respect to any amount in respect of any unsatisfied
claims specified in any Claims Certificate in connection with Section
8.2(a)(x) ("Unresolved Sales Tax Claims") delivered prior to the Sales Tax
Escrow Termination Date with respect to facts and circumstances existing prior
to the Sales Tax Escrow Termination Date. As soon as all Unresolved Sales Tax
Claims have been resolved after the Sales Tax Escrow Termination Date, the
Escrow Agent shall deliver the remaining portion of the Sales Tax Escrow
Amount, if any, not required to satisfy such Unresolved Sales Tax Claims to
the Company Stockholders (and the former holders of Company Warrants who have
executed Warrant Termination Agreements) (such distribution to the Company
Stockholders and former holders of Company Warrants, the "Final Sales Tax
Escrow Distribution", and the date of the Final Sales Tax Escrow Distribution,
the "Final Sales Tax Escrow Distribution Date"), in accordance with the Final
Sales Tax Escrow Release Spreadsheet. 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Escrow
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any portion of the Escrow
Fund payable pursuant to this Agreement to any former holder of Company
Capital Stock or Company Warrants such amounts as may be required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom under any provision of U.S. federal,
state, local or non-U.S. tax Law or under any applicable legal requirement.
To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid. The parties hereto agree that the Securityholder
Representative Expenses Reserve shall be treated for Tax purposes as owned by
the Company Securityholders. The Escrow Agent shall withhold from any
distribution of the Securityholder Representative Expenses Reserve any Taxes
it determines may be required by any Law in effect at the time of such
distribution. Parent shall instruct its paying agent to transmit to the
Escrow Agent, after receipt thereof by the paying agent, the wiring
instructions or delivery address for payment, as applicable, for each Company
Securityholder from which the paying agent receives such information. Unless
otherwise directed by the Securityholder Representative, the Escrow Agent
shall make distributions to Company Securityholders under this Escrow
Agreement in the same form and in accordance with the same wiring instructions
or delivery address, as applicable, previously delivered to the Escrow Agent
by the Companys paying agent.

 



73 (c) _Protection of Escrow Fund_.

 

(i) The Escrow Agent shall hold and safeguard the Escrow Fund during the
Escrow Period, shall treat such fund as a trust fund in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and shall hold and dispose of the Escrow Fund only in
accordance with the terms of this Article VIII and Section 2.10 hereof.

 

(ii) The Base Escrow Amount, the Sales Tax Escrow Amount and the
Securityholder Representative Expenses Reserve shall be invested in the U.S.
Bank Money Market Savings Account. The parties hereto acknowledge that the U.
S. Bank Money Market account is a U. S. Bank National Association ("U.S.
Bank") interest-bearing money market deposit account designed to meet
the needs of U.S. Banks Corporate Trust Services Escrow Group and other
Corporate Trust customers of U.S. Bank. Selection of this investment includes
authorization to place funds on deposit with U.S. Bank. U.S. Bank uses the
daily balance method to calculate interest on this account (actual/365 or
366). This method applies a daily periodic rate to the principal balance in
the account each day. Interest is accrued daily and credited monthly to the
account. Interest rates currently offered on the accounts are determined at
U.S. Banks discretion and may be tiered by customer deposit amount. The owner
of the accounts is U.S. Bank as Escrow Agent for its trust customers. U.S.
Banks trust department performs all account deposits and withdrawals. Each
customers deposit is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as
determined under FDIC Regulations, up to applicable FDIC limits. Any and all
interest earned on the Base Escrow Amount, the Sales Tax Escrow Amount and
the Securityholder Representative Expenses Reserve after the deposit shall be
added to the Escrow Fund and shall become a part thereof and available for
satisfaction of claims. The Escrow Agent shall thereafter hold, maintain and
utilize the Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. Pursuant to Proposed Treasury Regulations Section 1.468B-8, for tax
reporting and withholding purposes the Base Escrow Amount and the Sales Tax
Escrow Amount shall be treated as a contingent at closing escrow owned by
Parent, any interest or other income earned on the Base Escrow Amount and the
Sales Tax Escrow Amount shall be reported as earned by Parent, and Parent
shall be liable and responsible for any Taxes due with respect to such
income. The Escrow Agent is hereby instructed to distribute from the Base
Escrow Amount and the Sales Tax Escrow Amount 40% of such income to Parent
within thirty (30) days of reporting such income earned on the Base Escrow
Amount and the Sales Tax Escrow Amount and reported to the IRS as taxable
income to Parent (which reporting shall be requested by Parent in writing).
Each Company Securityholder shall provide any necessary Tax forms, including
Form W-9 or the appropriate series of Form W-8, as applicable, or any similar
form requested by the Escrow Agent.

(d)  _Escrow Agent s Duties_.

(i) The Escrow Agent shall be obligated only for the performance of such
duties as are specifically set forth herein, and as set forth in any
additional written escrow instructions which the Escrow Agent may receive
after the date of this Agreement which are jointly signed by an officer of
Parent and the Securityholder Representative (except with respect to the
Securityholder Representative Expenses Reserve, the written escrow
instructions for which shall be signed by the Securityholder Representative
and shall not require the signature of an officer of Parent), and may rely
and shall be protected in relying or refraining from acting on any instrument
reasonably believed to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the
proper party or parties. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any act
done or omitted hereunder as Escrow Agent while acting in good faith and in
the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant to
the advice of legal counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith.
The Escrow Agent shall provide monthly reports of the balance of the
Securityholder Representative Expenses Reserve to the Securityholder
Representative only and to no other party, and shall not disclose the
remaining balance of, or the nature of or amounts of disbursement requests by
the Securityholder Representative from, the Securityholder Representative
Expenses Reserve. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Securityholder Representative shall be entitled to direct
the Escrow Agent to release funds from the Securityholder Representative
Expenses Reserve to the Securityholder Representative, or to such other third
party directly, as the Securityholder Representative directs without the
requirement of the consent or participation of Parent.

 



74 (ii) The Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized to disregard any and all
warnings given by any of the parties hereto or by any other Person, excepting
only orders or process of courts of Law, and is hereby expressly authorized to
comply with and obey orders, judgments or decrees of any court, awards of
arbitrators and joint written instructions of Parent and the Securityholder
Representative. In case the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such
order, judgment or decree of any court, award of arbitrator or instructions,
the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any
other Person by reason of such compliance, notwithstanding any such order,
judgment, decree or award being subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set
aside, vacated or found to have been entered without jurisdiction.

(iii) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable in any respect on account of the
identity, authority or rights of the parties executing or delivering or
purporting to execute or deliver this Agreement or any documents or papers
deposited or called for hereunder.

(iv) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for the expiration of any rights
under any statute of limitations with respect to this Agreement or any
documents deposited with the Escrow Agent.

 

(v) In performing any duties under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall not
be liable to any party for damages, losses, or expenses, except for
negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent. The Escrow
Agent shall not incur any such liability for (A) any act or failure to act
made or omitted in good faith, or (B) any action taken or omitted in reliance
upon any instrument, including any written statement or affidavit provided for
in this Agreement that the Escrow Agent shall in good faith believe to be
genuine, nor will the Escrow Agent be liable or responsible for forgeries,
fraud, impersonations, or determining the scope of any representative
authority. In addition, the Escrow Agent may consult with legal counsel in
connection with performing the Escrow Agents duties under this Agreement and
shall be fully protected in any act taken, suffered, or permitted by him/her
in good faith in accordance with the advice of counsel. The Escrow Agent is
not responsible for determining and verifying the authority of any person
acting or purporting to act on behalf of any party to this Agreement.

(vi) If any controversy arises between the parties to this Agreement, or with
any other party, concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, its terms
or conditions, the Escrow Agent will not be required to determine the
controversy or to take any action regarding it. The Escrow Agent may hold all
documents and the Escrow Fund and may wait for settlement of any such
controversy by final appropriate legal proceedings or other means as, in the
Escrow Agents discretion, may be required, despite what may be set forth
elsewhere in this Agreement. In such event, the Escrow Agent will not be
liable for damages. Furthermore, the Escrow Agent may at its option, file an
action of interpleader requiring the parties to answer and litigate any claims
and rights among themselves. The Escrow Agent is authorized to deposit with
the clerk of the court all documents and the Base Escrow Amount and the Sales
Tax Escrow Amount held in escrow, except all costs, expenses, charges and
reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Escrow Agent due to the interpleader
action (the "Agent Interpleader Expenses") and which the parties agree to pay
as follows: 50% to be paid by Parent and 50% to be paid by the Securityholder
Representative (solely on behalf of the Company Securityholders and in its
capacity as the Securityholder Representative, not in its individual
capacity); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event the Securityholder
Representative fails to timely pay (or cause to be paid) the Company
Securityholders portion of the Agent Interpleader Expenses, the parties
agree that Parent may at its option pay such portion of the Agent Interpleader
Expenses and recover an amount equal thereto from the Escrow Fund. Upon
initiating such action, the Escrow Agent shall be fully released and
discharged of and from all obligations and liability imposed by the terms of
this Agreement.

(vii) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, and their respective successors and
assigns agree jointly and severally to indemnify and hold Escrow Agent
harmless against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and
expenses, including reasonable costs of investigation, counsel fees,
including allocated costs of in house counsel and disbursements that may be
imposed on Escrow Agent or incurred by Escrow Agent in connection with the
performance of his/her duties under this Agreement, including any litigation
arising from this

 



75  Agreement or involving its subject matter, other than those arising out of
the negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent (the "Agent
Indemnification Expenses") as follows: 50% to be paid by Parent and 50% to be
paid by the Securityholder Representative (solely on behalf of the Company
Securityholders and in its capacity as the Securityholder Representative, not
in its individual capacity); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in the event the
Securityholder Representative fails to timely pay (or cause to be paid) the
Company Securityholders portion of the Agent Indemnification Expenses, the
parties agree that Parent may at its option pay such portion of the Agent
Indemnification Expenses and recover an amount equal thereto from the Escrow
Fund.

(viii) The Escrow Agent may resign at any time upon giving at least 30 days
written notice to Parent and the Securityholder Representative; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such resignation shall become effective until the
appointment of a successor escrow agent by Parent, subject to the consent of
the Securityholder Representative, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. The successor escrow agent shall execute and deliver an
instrument accepting such appointment and the rights and obligations of the
Escrow Agent under this Agreement, and it shall, without further acts, be
vested with all the estates, properties, rights, powers, duties and
obligations of the predecessor escrow agent as if originally named as escrow
agent. Upon appointment of a successor escrow agent, the Escrow Agent shall
be discharged from any further duties and liability under this Agreement.

(e) _Fees_. All fees of the Escrow Agent for performance of its duties
hereunder shall be paid out of the Escrow Fund in accordance with the standard
fee schedule of the Escrow Agent. It is understood that the fees and usual
charges agreed upon for services of the Escrow Agent shall be considered
compensation for ordinary services as contemplated by this Agreement. In the
event that the conditions of this Agreement are not promptly fulfilled, or if
the Escrow Agent renders any service not provided for in this Agreement but
that has been jointly requested by an officer of Parent and the Securityholder
Representative, or if the parties request a substantial modification of
the terms of the Agreement, or if any controversy arises, or if the Escrow
Agent is made a party to, or intervenes in, any litigation pertaining to the
Escrow Fund or its subject matter, the Escrow Agent shall be reasonably
compensated for such extraordinary services and reimbursed for all costs,
attorneys fees, including allocated costs of in house counsel, and expenses
occasioned by such default, delay, controversy or litigation.

 

(f) _Successor Escrow Agents_. Any corporation into which the Escrow Agent in
its individual capacity may be merged or converted or with which it may be
consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or
consolidation to which the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity shall be a
party, or any corporation to which substantially all the corporate trust
business of the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be transferred,
shall be the Escrow Agent under this Escrow Agreement without further act.

8.8 _Securityholder Representative._

(a) By voting in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, the approval of the
principal terms of the Merger, and the consummation of the Merger or
participating in the Merger and receiving the benefits thereof, including the
right to receive the consideration payable in connection with the Merger,
each of the Company Securityholders shall be deemed to have approved the
designation of, and hereby designates, Shareholder Representative Services LLC
as the Securityholder Representative under the terms set forth herein, and as
its agent and attorney-in-fact to give and receive notices and communications,
to authorize payment to any Indemnified Parties from the Escrow Fund in
satisfaction of claims by such Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section
8.2(a), to object to such payments, to agree to, negotiate, enter into
settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders
of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, to
assert, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand
arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with
respect to, any other claim by any Indemnified Parties against any Company
Securityholder or by any such Company Securityholder against any Indemnified
Parties or any dispute between any Indemnified Parties and any such Company
Securityholder, in each case relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, and to take all other actions that are necessary or
appropriate in the judgment of the Securityholder Representative for the
accomplishment of the Securityholder Representatives responsibilities under
this Agreement and to otherwise effectuate the transactions contemplated
hereby. The

 



76  Securityholder Representative may be removed by written consent of the
holders of a majority of the Company Capital Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time agreeing to such removal and to the identity of the
substituted agent. If the Securityholder Representative shall die, become
disabled, resign or otherwise be unable to fulfill its responsibilities
hereunder, the Company Securityholders shall (by consent of the holders of
a majority of Company Capital Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time),
within ten (10) days after such death, disability, resignation or inability,
appoint a successor to the Securityholder Representative and immediately
thereafter notify Parent of the identity of such successor. Any such
successor shall succeed the former Securityholder Representative as the
Securityholder Representative hereunder. If for any reason there is no
Securityholder Representative at any time, all references herein to the
Securityholder Representative shall be deemed to refer to the Company
Securityholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a vacancy in the position of
Securityholder Representative may be filled by the holders of a majority
of the Company Capital Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time. No bond
shall be required of the Securityholder Representative, and the Securityholder
Representative shall not receive any compensation for its services other than
pursuant to the terms of the Securityholder Representative Agreement entered
into between Shareholder Representative Services LLC, the Company and certain
of the Company Securityholders on or about the date hereof. After the
Effective Time, notices or communications to or from the Securityholder
Representative shall constitute notice to or from the Company Securityholders.

 

(b) The Securityholder Representative shall not be liable for any act done or
omitted hereunder as Securityholder Representative, except in the case of
gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Company Securityholders shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Securityholder Representative and its
successors and assigns from and against any and all claims, demands,
suits, actions, causes of action, losses, damages, obligations, liabilities,
costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and court costs) (collectively,
"Representative Losses") arising as a result of or incurred in connection
with any actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Securityholder
Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, in each case as such
Representative Loss is incurred or suffered; _provided_ , that to the extent
it is finally adjudicated that a Representative Loss or any portion thereof
was primarily caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Securityholder Representative, the Securityholder Representative will
reimburse the Company Securityholders the amount of such indemnified
Representative Loss attributable to such gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The members of the advisory committee to the Securityholder
Representative (the "Advisory Committee") shall not be liable for any
act done or omitted hereunder by the members of the Advisory Committee while
acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment. The Company
Securityholders shall indemnify the members of the Advisory Committee (solely
in their individual roles as members of the Advisory Committee and not in
their roles as Company Securityholders) and hold the members of the Advisory
Committee harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without
gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the members of the Advisory
Committee and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of the Advisory Committees duties hereunder, including the
reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by the members of
the Advisory Committee ("Advisory Committee Expenses"). If not paid directly
to the Securityholder Representative by the Company Securityholders, any
Representative Losses or Advisory Committee Expenses may be recovered by the
Securityholder Representative from the Securityholder Representative Expenses
Reserve; _provided_ , that while this section allows the Securityholder
Representative to be paid from the Securityholder Representative Expenses
Reserve, this does not relieve the Company Securityholders from their
obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses as such Representative
Losses are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Securityholder
Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise.
Prior to any distribution from the Escrow Fund, the Securityholder
Representative shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a certificate setting forth
the Representative Losses and/or Advisory Committee Expenses actually
incurred. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Securityholder
Representative, including an amendment, extension or waiver of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.3 and Section 9.4, shall constitute a decision of the
Company Securityholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the
Company Securityholders, and the Escrow Agent and Parent may rely upon any
such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Securityholder
Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Company Securityholders. The Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby relieved from
any liability to any person for any acts done by them in accordance with such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Securityholder Representative.

 



77 (c) Following the delivery of a Claim Certificate, the Securityholder
Representative and its representatives and agents shall be given such access
(including electronic access, to the extent available) as they may reasonably
request to the books and records of the Surviving Corporation for the purpose
of resolving any disputes or responding to any matters or inquiries raised in
such Claim Notice.

ARTICLE IX

which has the effect of making the Merger illegal;

or character that has had, or could reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate with all such other events or conditions, a
Company Material Adverse Effect;

Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) hereof would
not be satisfied, and such breach has not been cured within ten (10) calendar
days after written notice thereof to Parent; _provided, however_ , that no

provisions of Section 6.4 hereof (Confidentiality), Section 6.5 hereof (Public

survive any termination of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of this
Article IX.

 

9.3 _Amendment._ This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any
time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the party
against whom enforcement is sought. For purposes of this Section 10.3, the
Company Securityholders agree that any amendment of this Agreement signed by
the Securityholder Representative shall be binding upon and effective against
the Company Securityholders whether or not they have signed such amendment.

9.4  _Extension; Waiver._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent
and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company and the Securityholder
Representative, on the other hand, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations of the other
party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of the covenants, agreements or
conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on
the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only
if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. For
purposes of this Section 9.4, the Company Securityholders agree that any
extension or waiver signed by the Securityholder Representative shall be
binding upon and effective against all Company Securityholders whether or not
they have signed such extension or waiver.

80 10.2 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being
understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.

10.3 _Entire Agreement._ This Agreement, the Exhibits and Schedules
hereto, the Disclosure Schedule, the Confidentiality Agreement, and the
documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto
referenced herein constitute the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof.

10.4 _No Third Party Beneficiaries._ This Agreement, the Exhibits and
Schedules hereto, the Disclosure Schedule, the Confidentiality Agreement, and
the documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto

provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or
unenforceable provision.

conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a
