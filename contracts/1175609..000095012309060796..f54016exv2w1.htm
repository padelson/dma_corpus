hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel or other professional
retained by the Stockholders&#146; Agent. By virtue of their approval of the Merger and this Agreement,

documentation to verify its formation and existence as a legal entity. The Escrow Agent may also
ask to see financial statements, licenses, identification and authorization documents from
individuals claiming authority to represent the entity or other relevant documentation. The

by Escrow Agent to ensure compliance with federal law.

Securities Act Sections) regarding short selling:
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>&#147;</I><B><I>239.10 </I></B><I>An issuer filed a Form S-3 registration statement for a secondary offering of common stock
which is not yet effective. One of the selling shareholders wanted to do a short sale of common
stock &#147;against the box&#148; and cover the short sale with registered shares after the effective date.
The issuer was advised that the short sale could not be made before the registration statement
becomes effective, because the shares underlying the short sale are deemed to be sold at the time
such sale is made. There would, therefore, be a violation of Section&nbsp;5 if the shares were
effectively sold prior to the effective date. &#091;Nov. 26, 2008&#093;&#148;</I>
