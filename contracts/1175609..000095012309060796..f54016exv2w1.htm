 4.5 Actions Under Certain Plans. Effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Company and any ERISA Affiliate shall terminate any and all account balance non-qualified deferred compensation plans programs or arrangements and any and all Company Employee Plans intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (each, a " _4_ _01(k)_ _Plan_ ") (unless Parent provides written notice to the Company that such plans shall not be terminated). Unless Parent provides such written notice to the Company, no later than five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such Company Employee Plans have been terminated (effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the board of directors of the Company or such ERISA Affiliate, as the case may be.

The Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating such Company Employee Plans as Parent may reasonably require.

of Parent and other Indemnities against Persons who may be liable for fraud

connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 9.6 Mitigation. Parent, Merger Sub, Merger LLC and all Indemnitees acknowledge their obligations under principles of common law to mitigate Damages for which Indemnitees may be entitled to indemnification hereunder. 

  

 9.7 Defense of Third Party Claims. 

  

 (a) In the event that an Indemnitee receives notice of the assertion of any claim or the commencement of any Legal Proceeding by a third party in respect of which indemnity may be sought under the provisions of this Section 9, or reasonably believes that any such claim will be asserted or commenced (" _Third Party Claim_ "), Parent shall notify the Stockholders Agent in writing of such Third Party Claim (" _Notice of Claim_ "). The Notice of Claim shall set forth: (i) that an Indemnitee has incurred Damages or anticipates that it will incur Damages for which such Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement; (ii) the amount of such Damages, if known, or, if not known, a reasonable estimate of the foreseeable maximum amount of such Damages (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such Damages); and (iii) a description of the basis for such Third Party Claim. Failure or delay in notifying the Stockholders Agent will not relieve the Indemnitors of any liability they may have to the Indemnitee, except and only to the extent that such failure or delay causes actual harm to the Indemnitors with respect to such Third Party Claim. 

   

 (b) Parent shall have the right, at its election, to proceed with the defense of Third Party Claims on its own; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Stockholders Agent shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such Third Party Claim and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Stockholders Agent; provided, however, the expenses of the Stockholders Agent shall be reimbursed to the extent possible from the Escrow Fund to the extent any amounts remain in the Escrow Fund immediately prior to distribution to the Merger Stockholders. If Parent is not reasonably conducting the defense of the Third Party Claim in good faith, the Stockholders Agent shall have the right to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the expense of said defense shall be paid out of the Escrow Fund, subject to the right of Parent to employ separate counsel in any such Third Party Claim and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the cost and expense of Parent. 

   

 (c) If Parent so elects to proceed with the defense of any such Third Party Claim: 

    ##### 

  

 

 _Execution Version_  

     

 (i) each Indemnitor shall make available to Parent any documents and materials in his, her or its possession or control that may be reasonably necessary to the defense of such Third Party Claim; and 

  

 (ii) Parent shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise such Third Party Claim with the prior written consent of Stockholders Agent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld;  _provided, however_ , if the Stockholders Agent reasonably refuses consent to such settlement, adjustment or compromise, the amount of such settlement, adjustment or compromise of such Third Party Claim shall not be determinative of the validity of the claim against the Escrow Fund or the amount of Damages recoverable hereunder. 

  

 (d) If Parent does not elect to proceed with the defense of any such claim or Legal Proceeding, the Stockholders Agent may proceed with the defense of such Third Party Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the expense of said defense shall be paid out of the Escrow Fund. If the Stockholders Agent assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, it will take all reasonable steps in the defense, prosecution, or settlement of such claim or litigation. The Stockholders Agent will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement except with the written consent of the Indemnitee; _provided_ , _however_ , the consent of the Indemnitee shall not be required if all of the following conditions are met: (i) the terms of the judgment or proposed settlement include as an unconditional term thereof the giving to the Indemnitee by the third party of a release of the Indemnitee from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim; (ii) there is no finding or admission of (A) any violation of Law by the Indemnitee, (B) any violation of the rights of any Person and (C) no effect on any other action or claims of a similar nature that may be made against the Indemnitee; and (iii) the sole form of relief is monetary damages which will be paid in full from the Escrow Fund. The Indemnitee will provide reasonable cooperation in the defense of the Third Party Claim. If the Stockholders Agent is not reasonably conducting the defense of the Third Party Claim in good faith, the Indemnitee shall have the right to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim, subject to the right of the Stockholders Agent to employ separate counsel in any such Third Party Claim and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the cost and expense of the Stockholders Agent. 

   

 9.8 Exercise of Remedies by Indemnitees Other Than Parent. No Indemnitee (other than Parent or any successor thereto or assign thereof) shall be permitted to assert any indemnification claim or exercise any other remedy under this Agreement unless Parent (or any successor thereto or assign thereof) shall have consented to the assertion of such indemnification claim or the exercise of such other remedy. 

  

 9.9 Execution by Stockholders Agent. The Stockholders Agent may execute this Agreement at any time after the date hereof and prior to the Closing; _provided, however_ , that the effectiveness of this Agreement shall not be predicated upon such execution.

Kelly as their agent for purposes of Section 9 and Section 10.3 (the "
_Stockholders  Agent_") to give and receive notices and communications, to
authorize delivery to Parent of Parent Common Stock, cash or other property
from the Escrow Fund, to object to such deliveries, to agree to, negotiate,
enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand dispute resolution
pursuant to Section 3 of the Escrow Agreement and comply with orders of

hereby accepts his appointment as the Stockholders Agent. Parent shall be
entitled to deal exclusively with the Stockholders Agent on all

(without further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any document executed or
purported to be executed on behalf of any Merger Stockholder by the
Stockholders Agent, and on any other action taken or purported to be taken
on behalf of any Merger Stockholder by the Stockholders Agent, as fully
binding upon such Merger Stockholder. If the Stockholders Agent shall die,
become disabled or otherwise be unable to fulfill his responsibilities as
agent of the Merger Stockholders, then the Merger Stockholders shall, within
ten days after such death or disability, appoint a successor agent and,
promptly thereafter, shall notify Parent of the identity of such successor.

good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment. The Merger
Stockholders shall jointly and severally indemnify the Stockholders Agent and
hold the Stockholders Agent harmless against any loss, liability or expense
incurred without gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the
part of the Stockholders Agent and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the Stockholders Agents duties hereunder,
including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel or other
professional retained by the Stockholders Agent. By virtue of their approval
of the Merger and this Agreement, the Merger Stockholders hereby agree to pay
(i) the reasonable fees of the Stockholders Agent relating to his services
performed in such capacity, and (ii) all reasonable costs and
expenses, including those of any legal counsel or other professional retained
by the Stockholders Agent, in connection with the acceptance and
administration of the Stockholders Agents duties hereunder. Subject to the
prior right of Parent to make claims for Damages, the Stockholders Agent
shall have the right to recover from the Escrow Fund prior to any
distribution to the Merger Stockholders, any reasonable fees, costs and
expenses, including those of any legal counsel or other professional retained
by the Stockholders Agent, in connection with the performance, acceptance
and administration of the Stockholders Agents duties hereunder. 

   

 10.2 Further Assurances. Each party hereto shall execute and cause to be delivered to each other party hereto such instruments and other documents, and shall take such other actions, as such other party may reasonably request (prior to, at or after the Closing) for the purpose of carrying out or evidencing any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

that, the total amount of all such fees, costs and expenses incurred by or
for the benefit of the Acquired Companies (including all such fees, costs and
expenses incurred prior to the Signing Date) in excess of the Estimated
Transaction Costs shall be borne and paid by the Merger Stockholders
as provided in the calculation of Total Merger Consideration as provided in
Section 1.5(b)(vii) and, if necessary, by deducting from the Escrow Fund,
Escrow Cash and/or Escrow Shares any such amount not included in the
calculation of Total Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Transaction Costs shall not include any amounts paid to Company
Employees in connection with the termination of employment in connection with
this Agreement or the Merger (or any taxes payable by the Company in
connection with such payments), expenses associated with the purchase of the
Tail DandO Policy as contemplated by Section 5.14 and expenses incurred by the
Company in connection with the audit of Company Financial Statements.

Agreement 

   

 The parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: 

  

 Section 1\. Defined Terms. 

  

 1.1 As used in this Agreement, the term " _Merger Stockholders_ " shall refer initially to all Persons who were stockholders of the Company holding Series G-1 Preferred Stock, Series G Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and D Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Company Stockholders_ ") and who prior to the Effective Time either (a) voted in favor of or consented in writing to the adoption of the Merger Agreement, or (b) failed to take any action required by Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law or, if applicable, Section 1301(b) of the California General Corporation Law (collectively the 

     ##### 

  

    

" _Appraisal Rules_ ") to have been taken prior to such time in order to
perfect or otherwise preserve their dissenters or appraisal
rights thereunder. In the event that following the Effective Time, any
Company Stockholder who was not initially a Merger Stockholder either (i)
votes in favor of or consents in writing to the adoption of the Merger
Agreement, or (ii) otherwise takes (or omits to take) any action that results
in the failure of such Company Stockholder to perfect or preserve its
dissenters rights under the Appraisal Rules, such Company Stockholder shall
automatically and without the requirement of any action on the part of such
Company Stockholder or any party to this Agreement be deemed to be a Merger
Stockholder hereunder. Parent shall cause Exhibit A to be revised from time to
time to reflect any such additional Merger Stockholders; provided that until
the Escrow Agent receives a revised Exhibit A from Parent, the Escrow Agent
may rely on the then existing forms thereof. 

   

 1.2 Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings given to them in the Merger Agreement. 

   

 Section 2\. Escrow and Indemnification. 

  

 2.1 Appointment of Escrow Agent. The Interested Parties hereby appoint the Escrow Agent and the Escrow Agent hereby agrees to assume and perform the duties of the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. 

   

 2.2 Cash and Shares Placed in Escrow. Following the Effective Time, in accordance with the Merger Agreement, Parent shall deliver to Escrow Agent (a) (i) an aggregate of up to [ ] in immediately available funds to be held in escrow in accordance with this Agreement; and (ii) confirmation of book-entry issuances by Parents transfer agent for shares of Parent Common Stock registered in the name of the Escrow Agent or its nominee, EMBASSY and CO., evidencing the shares of Parent Common Stock to be held in escrow on behalf of the Merger Stockholders as set forth on Exhibit A, in accordance with this Agreement; and (b) a certificate identifying the Closing Date and Parents stock transfer agent. The cash being held in escrow pursuant to this Agreement (the " _Escrow Cash_ ") and the shares of Parent Common Stock being held in escrow pursuant to this Agreement (the " _Escrow Shares_ ") shall collectively constitute an escrow fund (the " _Escrow Fund_ ") with respect to the indemnification, compensation and reimbursement rights of Parent and the other Indemnitees under the Merger Agreement. The Escrow Agent agrees to accept delivery of the Escrow Fund and to hold the Escrow Fund in an escrow account (the " _Escrow Account_ "), subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

In the absence of written directions from the Stockholders Agent, the Escrow Agent need not vote the Escrow Shares. Because each of the Merger Stockholders is or will be a stockholder of Parent and will be furnished with proxy materials and other documents distributed by Parent to its stockholders, the Escrow Agent need not distribute to the Merger Stockholders proxy materials and other documents relating to the Escrow Shares received by the Escrow 

     ##### 

  

    

Agent from Parent. The Escrow Agent shall distribute to the Stockholders
Agent proxy materials and other documents relating to the Escrow Shares
received by the Escrow Agent from Parent. 

   

 2.4 Dividends, Etc. Parent and the Stockholders Agent (on behalf of each of the Merger Stockholders) agree among themselves, for the benefit of Parent and the Escrow Agent, that any shares of Parent stock or other property (including ordinary cash dividends) distributable or issuable (whether by way of dividend, stock split or otherwise) in respect of or in exchange for any Escrow Shares (including pursuant to or as a part of a merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, reorganization or liquidation involving Parent) shall not be distributed or issued to the beneficial owners of such Escrow Shares, but rather shall be distributed or issued to and held by the Escrow Agent in the Escrow Account as part of the Escrow Fund. Any cash, securities or other property received by the Escrow Agent in respect of any Escrow Shares held in escrow as a result of any stock split or combination of shares of Parent Common Stock, payment of a cash or stock dividend or other stock distribution in or on shares of Parent Common Stock, or change of Parent Common Stock into any other securities pursuant to or as a part of a merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, reorganization or liquidation involving Parent, or otherwise, shall be held by the Escrow Agent as, and shall be included within the definition of, Escrow Shares. In each such instance, Parent shall deliver an amended Exhibit A to the Escrow Agent as may be necessary to reflect such dividends, etc. 

   

 2.5 Transferability. The interests of the Merger Stockholders in the Escrow Account and in the Escrow Shares and Escrow Cash shall not be assignable or transferable, other than by operation of law.

 2.6 Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or other securities shall be released from the Escrow Account pursuant to this Agreement. In connection with any release of Escrow Shares from the Escrow Account to the Merger Stockholders or any Indemnitees, Parent and the Escrow Agent shall be permitted to "round down" or to follow such other rounding procedures as Parent and the Stockholders Agent reasonably determine to be appropriate in order to avoid releasing any fractional shares from the Escrow Account. When Escrow Shares are "rounded down", no cash-in-lieu payments need to be made. 

   

 2.7 Trust Fund. The Escrow Fund shall be held as a trust fund and shall not be subject to any lien, attachment, trustee process or any other judicial process of any creditor of any Merger Stockholder or of any party hereto. The Escrow Agent shall hold and safeguard the Escrow Fund until the Termination Date, subject to Section 4.3 of this Agreement. 

   

 2.8 Investments. The Escrow Agent shall invest and reinvest the Escrow Cash held in the Escrow Account in Authorized Investments (as defined below) upon delivery of specific joint written instructions from Parent and the Stockholders Agent. All earnings received 

       ##### 

  

    

from any investment of the funds in the Escrow Account shall be included in,
and shall become a part of, the Escrow Funds (and any losses on such
investments shall be deducted from the Escrow Fund). "
_Authorized Investments_ _"_ shall mean any of the investment vehicles
described in Exhibit C hereto. In the event that the Escrow Agent does not
receive joint written directions to invest the Escrow Funds, or if Parent
instructs that the Escrow Funds be so invested, the Escrow Agent shall invest
such funds in the Escrow Agents FDIC insured money market fund (IMMA). The
Escrow Agent or any of its affiliates may receive customary compensation with
respect to any investment directed hereunder. Upon the request of either
Parent or Stockholders Agent, the Escrow Agent shall provide a statement to
such requesting party that describes any deposit, distribution or investment
activity or deductions with respect to the Escrow Funds. 

   

 2.9 Income. All income earned on the Escrow Fund shall be taxable to Parent and shall be credited to the Escrow Fund. 

   

 Section 3\. Administration of Escrow Account. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Escrow Agent shall administer the Escrow Account as follows: 

  

 3.1 If any Indemnitee has or claims to have incurred or suffered Damages for which it is or may be entitled to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under Section 9 or Section 10.3 of the Merger Agreement, such Indemnitee may, on or prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Termination Date_ "), deliver a claim notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the Stockholders Agent and to the Escrow Agent. Each Claim Notice shall state that (i) it is a Claim Notice under the Cavium/MontaVista 2009 Escrow; (ii) such Indemnitee believes in good faith that there is or has been a breach of a representation, warranty or covenant contained in the Merger Agreement or that such Indemnitee is otherwise entitled to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under Section 9 or Section 10.3 of the Merger Agreement, and (iii) contain a brief description of the circumstances supporting such Indemnitees belief that there is or has been such a breach or that such Indemnitee is so entitled to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement and shall, to the extent possible, contain a good faith, non-binding, preliminary estimate of the amount of Damages such Indemnitee claims to have so incurred or suffered (the " _Claimed Amount_ "). 

   

 3.2 Within 30 days after receipt by the Stockholders Agent of a Claim Notice, the Stockholders Agent may deliver to the Indemnitee who delivered the Claim Notice and to the Escrow Agent a written response (the " _Response Notice_ ") in which the Stockholders Agent: (i) states that it is a Response Notice under the Cavium/MontaVista 2009 Escrow; (ii) agrees that an amount equal to the full Claimed Amount may be released from the Escrow Account to the Indemnitee; (iii) agrees that an amount equal to part, but not all, of the Claimed Amount (the " _Agreed Amount_ ") may be released from the Escrow Account to the Indemnitee; or (iv) indicates that no part of the Escrow Fund may be released from the Escrow Account to the Indemnitee in respect of the Claimed Amount. Any part of the Claimed Amount that is not agreed to be released to the Indemnitee pursuant to the Response Notice shall be the " _Contested Amount_." If a Response Notice is not received by the Escrow Agent within such 30-day period, then the Stockholders Agent shall be conclusively deemed to have agreed that an amount equal to the full Claimed Amount may be released to the Indemnitee from the Escrow Account. 

    ##### 

  

     

 3.3 If the Stockholders Agent delivers a Response Notice agreeing that an amount equal to the full Claimed Amount may be released from the Escrow Account to the Indemnitee, or if the Stockholders Agent does not deliver a Response Notice on a timely basis in accordance with Section 3.2, the Escrow Agent shall within five business days following the receipt of such Response Notice (or, if the Escrow Agent has not received a Response Notice, within five business days following the expiration of the 30-day period referred to in Section 3.2), deliver to such Indemnitee an amount equal to the Claimed Amount (based on the Stipulated Value of the Escrow Shares). 

   

 3.4 If the Stockholders Agent delivers a Response Notice agreeing that an amount equal to less than the full Claimed Amount may be released from the Escrow Account to the Indemnitee, the Escrow Agent shall, within five business days following the receipt of such Response Notice, deliver to such Indemnitee an amount equal to the Agreed Amount (based on the Stipulated Value of the Escrow Shares). Such payment shall not be deemed to be made in full satisfaction of the claim described in such Claim Notice, but shall count toward the satisfaction of the claim described in such Claim Notice. 

   

 3.5 If the Stockholders Agent delivers a Response Notice indicating that there is a Contested Amount, the Stockholders Agent and the Indemnitee shall attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute related to the Contested Amount. If the Indemnitee and the Stockholders Agent resolve such dispute, such resolution shall be binding on all of the Merger Stockholders and all of the Indemnitees and a settlement agreement shall be signed by such Indemnitee and the Stockholders Agent (a " _Settlement Agreement_ ") and sent to the Escrow Agent, who shall, upon receipt thereof, if applicable, release Escrow Funds from the Escrow Account (based on the Stipulated Value of the Escrow Shares) in accordance with such Settlement Agreement. Unless and until the Escrow Agent shall receive written notice that any such dispute has been resolved by the Indemnitee and the Stockholders Agent, the Escrow Agent may assume without inquiry that such dispute has not been resolved. 

   

 3.6 If the Stockholders Agent and the Indemnitee are unable to resolve the dispute relating to any Contested Amount within 60 days after the delivery of the Claim Notice (" _Initial Resolution Period_ "), then the claim described in the Claim Notice shall be settled by binding arbitration in the County of Santa Clara in the State of California in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association (the " _AAA Rules_ "). Arbitration will be conducted by one arbitrator, mutually selected by Parent and the Stockholders Agent. If Parent and the Stockholders Agent fail to mutually select an arbitrator within three business days following the expiration of the Initial Resolution Period, then arbitration will be conducted by three arbitrators: one selected by Parent; one selected by the Stockholders Agent; and the third selected by the first two arbitrators. If Parent or the Stockholders Agent fails to select an arbitrator within 10 days following the expiration of the Initial Resolution Period, then the other shall be entitled to select the second arbitrator. The parties agree to use all reasonable efforts to cause the arbitration hearing to be conducted within 75 days after the appointment of the mutually-selected 

     ##### 

  

    

arbitrator or the last of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, and to
use all reasonable efforts to cause the decision of the arbitrator(s) to be
furnished within 95 days after the appointment of the mutually-selected
arbitrator or the last of the three arbitrators, as the case may be. The
parties further agree that discovery shall be completed at least 10
days prior to the date of the arbitration hearing. The decision of the
arbitrator(s) shall relate solely: (i) to whether the Indemnitee is entitled
to recover the Contested Amount (or a portion thereof), and the portion of
such Contested Amount the Indemnitee is entitled to recover; and (ii) to the
determination of the non-prevailing party as provided below. The final
decision of the arbitrator(s) shall be furnished to the Stockholders Agent,
the Indemnitee and the Escrow Agent in writing and shall constitute a
conclusive determination of the issue(s) in question (an " _Arbitration
Judgment_ "), binding upon the Stockholders Agent, the Merger Stockholders,
the Indemnitee and the Escrow Agent and shall not be contested by any of
them. The non-prevailing party in any arbitration shall pay the reasonable
expenses (including attorneys fees) of the prevailing party, any additional
reasonable fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) of the
Escrow Agent, and the fees and expenses associated with the arbitration
(including the arbitrators fees and expenses). For purposes of this Section
3.6, the non-prevailing party shall be determined solely by the
arbitrator(s). Any amounts payable by the Merger Stockholders to Indemnitees
pursuant to an Arbitration Judgment shall be paid out of the Escrow Cash and
Escrow Shares to the extent available in the Escrow Fund. 

   

 3.7 The Escrow Agent shall release Escrow Funds from the Escrow Account (based on the Stipulated Value of the Escrow Shares) in connection with any Contested Amount within five business days after the delivery to it of: (i) a copy of a settlement agreement executed by the Indemnitee and the Stockholders Agent setting forth instructions to the Escrow Agent as to the amount to be released from the Escrow Account, with respect to such Contested Amount; or (ii) a copy of the award of the arbitrator(s) referred to and as provided in Section 3.6 setting forth instructions to the Escrow Agent as to the amount to be released from the Escrow Account, with respect to such Contested Amount. 

   

 Section 4\. Allocation and Release of Escrow Cash and Escrow Shares. 

  

 4.1 Any Escrow Cash and Escrow Shares released from the Escrow Account shall be deemed to reduce the Escrow Shares (based on the Stipulated Value of the Escrow Shares) and Escrow Cash pro rata with respect to each Merger Stockholder in accordance with each Merger Stockholders percentage interest in the Escrow Fund as set forth on Exhibit A. Any release from the Escrow Account shall be proportionately allocated between Escrow Shares and Escrow Cash such that, immediately following such release, the relative proportion of the value of the Escrow Cash and Escrow Shares (based on the Stipulated Value of the Escrow Shares) remaining in the Escrow Account is maintained. 

   

 4.2 Within ten business days after any release of Escrow Funds, Parent shall deliver to the Escrow Agent and the Stockholders Agent a revised Exhibit A showing the number of Escrow Shares attributable to each Merger Stockholder after taking the reduction in the Escrow Shares into account and the amount of Escrow Cash attributable to each Merger Stockholder after taking the reduction in Escrow Cash into account (a " _Revised Schedule_ "), upon which the Escrow Agent may conclusively rely. 

     ##### 

  

     

 4.3 Termination Date and Holdback 

  

 (a) Within five business days after the Termination Date, the Escrow Agent shall distribute or cause to be distributed (pursuant to Section 4.4 below) to each of the Merger Stockholders at such Merger Stockholders address set forth on Exhibit A such Merger Stockholders pro-rata portion of the Escrow Cash and Escrow Shares (or other property held in the Escrow Account resulting from such Escrow Shares), if any, then held in escrow based on the percentage interests in the Escrow Fund as set forth on Exhibit A; _provided, however_ , that if prior to the Termination Date, any Indemnitee has given a Claim Notice containing a claim which has not been resolved prior to the Termination Date in accordance with Section 3, the Escrow Agent shall retain in the Escrow Account after the Termination Date Escrow Cash and Escrow Shares collectively having a Stipulated Value equal to the Claimed Amount or, in the event the Stockholders Agent has timely delivered a Response Notice, 100% of the Contested Amount, with respect to any Claim Notice which has not then been resolved (the " _Holdback_ "). The Stockholders Agent may object to any Claim Notice with respect to either the claim made therein pursuant to Section 3.2 or the reasonableness of the amount of the Holdback by delivering a written notice to the Indemnitee and the Escrow Agent within 30 days of receiving the Claim Notice for which there is a Holdback (a " _Reasonableness Objection_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, any failure to make a Reasonableness Objection shall in no way preclude, limit or otherwise affect the ability of the Stockholders Agent to otherwise object to any item in any Claim Notice. 

  

(b) In case the Stockholders Agent timely delivers a Reasonableness Objection
in accordance with Section 4.3(a), the Stockholders Agent and the Indemnitee
shall attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute related to the Contested
Amount. If the Indemnitee and the Stockholders Agent resolve such dispute,
such resolution shall be binding on all of the Merger Stockholders and all of
the Indemnitees and a settlement agreement shall be signed by such Indemnitee
and the Stockholders Agent and sent to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent
shall distribute to the Merger Stockholders or retain amounts in the Escrow
Fund in accordance with the terms thereof. If the Stockholders Agent and the
Indemnitee are unable to resolve the dispute in a Reasonableness Objection
within 30 days after the delivery of the Reasonableness Objection, then the
claim described in the Reasonableness Objection shall be settled by binding
arbitration in the manner set forth in Section 3.6 of this Agreement. The
decision of the arbitrator(s) shall relate solely to whether the amount of
the Holdback is appropriate and the final decision of the arbitrator(s) shall
be furnished to the Stockholders Agent, the Indemnitee and the Escrow Agent
in writing and shall constitute a conclusive determination of the proper
amount of the Holdback, binding upon the Stockholders Agent, the Merger
Stockholders, the Indemnitee and the Escrow Agent and shall not be contested
by any of them. 

   

 4.4 The Escrow Agent is not the stock transfer agent for the Parent Common Stock. Accordingly, whenever a distribution of Escrow Shares is to be made, the Escrow Agent must requisition the appropriate number of shares from such stock transfer agent, delivering to it the appropriate instructions to transfer the book entry shares. For purposes of this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall be deemed to have delivered Parent Common Stock to the Person entitled to it when the Escrow Agent has delivered such instructions to transfer such book entry 

      ##### 

  

    

shares to such stock transfer agent with instructions to deliver it to the
appropriate Person. Distributions of Parent Common Stock shall be made to
Parent at the address set forth herein or the Merger Stockholders, as
appropriate, at the addresses set forth on Exhibit A. Whenever a distribution
is to be made to the Merger Stockholders, pro rata distributions shall be
made to each of them based on the percentage interests in the Escrow Fund and
at their addresses set forth on Exhibit A. 

   

 Section 5\. Valuation of Escrow Shares, Etc. 

  

 5.1 Stipulated Value. For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Stipulated Value_ " of each Escrow Share shall be deemed to be equal to the Parent Average Stock Price, as set forth in a certificate delivered by Parent to the Escrow Agent and upon which the Escrow Agent may conclusively rely. The Stipulated Value of any non-cash property (other than Escrow Shares) received by the Escrow Agent in exchange for Escrow Shares and held in the Escrow Account shall be equal to the Stipulated Value of the Escrow Shares for which such property was exchanged. 

   

 5.2 Stock Splits. All numbers contained in, and all calculations required to be made pursuant to, this Agreement with respect to the Escrow Shares shall be adjusted as appropriate to reflect any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction effected by Parent after the date hereof; _provided, however,_ that the Escrow Agent shall have received written notice of such stock split or other action and shall have received the appropriate number of additional shares of Parent Common Stock or other property pursuant to Section 2.5. In the event of any such stock split or other similar occurrence, Parent shall deliver to the Stockholders Agent and the Escrow Agent a revised version of Exhibit A setting forth the new number of Escrow Shares held in the Escrow Fund. Unless and until the Escrow Agent receives the certificates representing additional shares of Parent Common Stock or other property pursuant to Section 2.5, the Escrow Agent may assume without inquiry that no such stock or other property has been or is required to be issued with respect to Escrow Shares. 

   

 Section 6\. Fees and Expenses. Upon the execution of this Agreement by all parties hereto, and the initial deposit of the Escrow Fund in the Escrow Account, fees and expenses, in accordance with Exhibit D attached hereto will be payable by Parent to the Escrow Agent. This annual Escrow Agent fee will cover the first twelve months of the Escrow Account. In accordance with Exhibit D, the Escrow Agent will also be entitled to reimbursement for reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Escrow Agent in the performance of its duties hereunder and the execution and delivery of this Agreement. All such fees and expenses shall be paid by Parent. 

   

 Section 7\. Limitation of Escrow Agents Liability. 

  

 7.1 The Escrow Agent undertakes to perform such duties as are specifically set forth in this Agreement only and shall have no duty under any other agreement or document (including the Merger Agreement), and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall incur no liability with 

     ##### 

  

    

respect to any action taken by it or for any inaction on its part in reliance
upon any notice, direction, instruction, consent, statement or other document
believed by it in good faith to be genuine and duly authorized, nor for any
other action or inaction except for its own negligence or willful misconduct.
In all questions arising under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent may rely on
the advice of counsel, and for anything done, omitted or suffered in good
faith by the Escrow Agent based upon such advice the Escrow Agent shall not
be liable to anyone. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any act done or
omitted hereunder as escrow agent except for gross negligence or willful
misconduct; provided the Escrow Agent shall be liable for negligence in the
handling of funds. In no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable for
incidental, punitive or consequential damages. If at any time (i) there shall
exist any dispute between the Interested Parties with respect to the holding
or disposition of all or any portion of the Escrow Funds or any other
obligations of the Escrow Agent hereunder, or (ii) the Escrow Agent is unable
to determine the proper disposition of all or any portion of the Escrow Fund
or the Escrow Agents proper actions with respect to its
obligations hereunder, then the Escrow Agent may take either or both of the
following actions: (1) suspend the performance of any of its obligations
(including, without limitation, any disbursement obligations) under this
Escrow Agreement until such dispute or uncertainty shall be resolved to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Escrow Agent or until a successor Escrow Agent
shall have been appointed (as the case may be); and/or (2) petition (by means
of an interpleader action or any other appropriate method) any court of
competent jurisdiction in any venue convenient to the Escrow Agent,
for instructions with respect to such dispute or uncertainty, and to the
extent required or permitted by law, pay into such court, for holding and
disposition in accordance with the instructions of such court, the Escrow
Fund. The Escrow Agent shall have no liability to the Interested Parties, the
Merger Stockholders or any other person with respect to any such suspension of
performance or petition to a court, specifically including any liability or
claimed liability that may arise, or be alleged to have arisen, out of or as
a result of any delay in the disbursement of the Escrow Funds or any delay in
or with respect to any other action required or requested of the
Escrow Agent. 

   

 7.2 Parent and the Stockholders Agent (acting on behalf of the Merger Stockholders but only to the extent of their respective interests in the Escrow Fund), severally and not jointly, hereby agree to indemnify the Escrow Agent and its officers, directors, employees and agents for, and hold it and them harmless against, any loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence, willful misconduct or breach of this Agreement on the part of Escrow Agent, arising out of or in connection with the Escrow Agent carrying out its duties hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that such losses, liabilities and expenses will be divided equally between the Parent, on the one hand, and the Merger Stockholders, on the other, and the portion of such losses, liabilities and expenses to be paid by the Merger Stockholders shall be withdrawn by the Escrow Agent directly from the Escrow Fund solely to the extent available. This right of indemnification, compensation and reimbursement shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and the resignation of the Escrow Agent. 

   

 Section 8\. Termination. This Agreement shall terminate on the Termination Date or, if earlier, upon the release by the Escrow Agent of the entire Escrow Fund in accordance with this Agreement _; provided, however,_ that if the Escrow Agent has received from any Indemnitee a Claim Notice setting forth a claim that has not been resolved by the Termination Date, then this 

   ##### 

  

 

Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until the claim has been
resolved and the Escrow Fund released in accordance with this Agreement. 

   

 Section 9\. Successor Escrow Agent. In the event the Escrow Agent becomes unavailable or unwilling to continue as escrow agent under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder by giving its written resignation to the parties to this Agreement. Such resignation shall take effect not less than 30 days after it is given to all parties hereto. In such event, Parent may appoint a successor Escrow Agent. If Parent fails to appoint a successor Escrow Agent within 15 days after receiving the Escrow Agents written resignation, the Escrow Agent shall have the right to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Escrow Agent. The successor Escrow Agent shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent an instrument accepting such appointment, and the successor Escrow Agent shall, without further acts, be vested with all the estates, property rights, powers and duties of the predecessor Escrow Agent as if originally named as Escrow Agent herein. The Escrow Agent shall act in accordance with written instructions from Parent as to the transfer of the Escrow Fund to a successor escrow agent. 

  

 9.1 Any corporation into which the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity shall be a party, or any corporation to which substantially all the corporate trust business of the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity (including the administration of this Agreement) may be transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under this Agreement without further act. 

   

 Section 10\. Stockholders Agent. 

  

 10.1 As provided in the Merger Agreement, by virtue of the adoption of the Merger Agreement the Company Stockholders shall be deemed to have approved the indemnification, compensation, reimbursement and escrow terms set forth in the Merger Agreement and this Agreement and the appointment of Stockholders Agent as the Stockholders Agent, to give and receive notices and communications, to authorize delivery to Parent of Parent Common Stock, cash or other property from the Escrow Fund, to object to such deliveries, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand dispute resolution pursuant to Section 3 of this Agreement and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrator(s) with respect to claims of Indemnitees hereunder, and to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the reasonable judgment of the Stockholders Agent for the accomplishment of the foregoing. 

   

 10.2 If the Stockholders Agent or any successor shall die, resign or become unable to act as the Stockholders Agent, a replacement (who shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent) shall promptly be appointed by a writing signed by Merger Stockholders who hold a majority in interest of the Escrow Fund. Parent and the Escrow Agent shall be notified promptly in writing of such appointment. Unless and until Parent and the Escrow Agent shall have received written notice of the appointment of a successor Stockholders Agent, Parent and the 

      ##### 

  

    

Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on, and shall be fully protected
relying on, the power and authority of the Stockholders Agent to act on
behalf of the Merger Stockholders. 

   

 Section 11\. Miscellaneous. 

  

 11.1 Attorneys Fees _._ In any Legal Proceeding to enforce or interpret this Agreement or the rights of any of the parties hereunder, the prevailing party in such Legal Proceeding shall be entitled to receive a reasonable sum for its attorneys fees and all other reasonable costs and expenses incurred in such Legal Proceeding. This provision does not include the Escrow Agent. 

   

 11.2 Notices. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be delivered to any party under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed properly delivered, given and received when delivered by hand, registered mail or, by courier or express delivery service, or by facsimile (with confirmation of receipt), to the address or facsimile telephone number set forth below (or to such other address or facsimile telephone number as such party shall have specified in a written notice given to the other parties hereto):

 The Escrow Agent may assume that any Claim Notice, Response Notice or other notice of any kind required to be delivered to the Escrow Agent and any other Person has been received by such other Person on the date it has been received by the Escrow Agent, but the Escrow Agent need not inquire into or verify such receipt. 

   

 11.3 Headings _._ The bold-faced headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only, shall not be deemed to be a part of this Agreement and shall not be referred to in connection with the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

No Merger Stockholder may assign such Merger Stockholders rights under this Agreement without the express prior written consent of Parent, and any attempted assignment of this Agreement or any of such rights by a Merger Stockholder without such consent shall be void and of no effect; _provided, however,_ that upon the death of a Merger Stockholder, such Merger Stockholders rights under this Agreement shall be transferred to the person(s) who receive such Merger Stockholders Escrow Cash and Escrow Shares under the laws of descent and distribution. 

     ##### 

  

     

 11.7 Waiver _._ No failure on the part of any Person to exercise any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any Person in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right, privilege or remedy. No Person shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of such Person; and any such waiver shall not be applicable or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it is given. 

   

 11.8 Amendment _._ This Agreement may not be amended, modified, altered or supplemented other than by means of a written instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of all of the parties hereto; _provided, however,_ that any amendment executed and delivered by the Stockholders Agent shall be deemed to have been approved by and duly executed and delivered by all of the Merger Stockholders. 

   

 11.9 Severability _._ In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application of any such provision to any Person or set of circumstances, shall be determined to be invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable to any extent, the remainder of this Agreement, and the application of such provision to Persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is determined to be invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable, shall not be impaired or otherwise affected and shall continue to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. 

   

 11.10 Parties in Interest _._ Except as expressly provided herein, none of the provisions of this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to provide any rights or remedies to any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, if any. 

   

 11.11 Entire Agreement _._ This Agreement and the other agreements referred to herein set forth the entire understanding of the parties hereto relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings among or between any of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof. 

   

 11.12 Waiver of Jury Trial. To the extent permitted under applicable law, each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives any and all right to trial by jury in any Legal Proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 11.13 Tax Reporting Information and Certification of Tax Identification Numbers. 

   

 (a) The parties hereto agree that, for all tax purposes, all cash amounts held in the Escrow Fund, including all interest on or other income, if any, attributable to the Escrow Fund shall be the property of Parent unless and until paid to the individuals and/or entities set forth on Exhibit A hereto in accordance with the percentages set for them therein. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Each of the Merger Stockholders and Parent agree to provide the Escrow Agent with their tax identification number by furnishing a form W-9 or applicable form W-8 and any other forms and documents that the Escrow Agent may reasonably request (collectively, " _Tax Reporting Documentation_ ") to the Escrow Agent within 30 days after the date hereof. The Interested Parties hereto understand that, if such Tax Reporting Documentation is not so furnished to the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to withhold any amounts it is required by law to deduct and withhold, including in respect of dividends and any interest or other income earned on the investment of monies or other property held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to this Agreement, and to immediately remit such withholding to the Internal Revenue Service. 

  

 11.14 USA Patriot Act Compliance. To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. For a non-individual person such as a business entity, a charity, a trust or other legal entity, the Escrow Agent will ask for documentation to verify its formation and existence as a legal entity. The Escrow Agent may also ask to see financial statements, licenses, identification and authorization documents from individuals claiming authority to represent the entity or other relevant documentation. The parties each agree to provide all such information and documentation as to themselves as requested by Escrow Agent to ensure compliance with federal law. 

   

 11.15 Cooperation. The Stockholders Agent agrees to cooperate fully with Parent and the Escrow Agent and to execute and deliver such further documents, certificates, agreements and instruments and to take such other actions as may be reasonably requested by Parent or the Escrow Agent to evidence or reflect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to carry out the intent and purposes of this Agreement.

 (d) Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to "Sections" and "Exhibits" are intended to refer to Sections of this Agreement and Exhibits to this Agreement. 

   #####

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company hereby consents to and agrees to register on the books of the Company and with its transfer agent, without any legal opinion, except to the extent that the transfer agent requests such legal opinion, any Transfer of Restricted Shares by a Stockholder to an Affiliate of such Stockholder or to any general or limited partner of such Stockholder.

THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933,
AS AMENDED (THE "ACT"), OR ANY STATE SECURITIES LAWS AND MAY NOT BE
TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR AN EXEMPTION THEREFROM
UNDER THE ACT AND THE RULES AND REGULATIONS THEREUNDER AND APPLICABLE STATE
SECURITIES LAWS. 

   

Certificates evidencing the Shares shall not be required to contain such
legend or any other legend (i) following any sale of such Shares pursuant to
an effective registration statement (including the Shelf Registration
Statement) covering the resale of the Restricted Shares, (ii) following any
sale of such Shares pursuant to Rule 144 or Rule 144A (or any similar
provision then in force) or if the Shares are transferrable by a person who
is not an Affiliate of the applicable Stockholder pursuant to Rule 144 or
Rule 144A (or any similar provision then in force) without any volume or
manner of 

   ##### 

  

   

sale restrictions thereunder, in each case if the holder provides the
Company with a legal opinion reasonably acceptable to the Company to the
effect that the Shares were sold under Rule 144 or Rule 144A or (iii) if the
holder provides the Company with a legal opinion reasonably acceptable to the
Company to the effect that the legend is not required under applicable

ARTICLE III 
 REGISTRATION RIGHTS 

   

 The Company hereby grants to each of the Holders the registration rights set forth in this Article III, with respect to the Registrable Securities owned by such Holders: 

   

 Section 3.1. _Shelf Registration_  

   

 (a) The Company shall file under the Securities Act as soon as reasonably practicable, but no later than the Filing Deadline, a Shelf Registration Statement providing for the registration of, and the sale on a continuous or delayed basis by the holders of, all, but not less than all, of the Registrable Securities, pursuant to Rule 415 or any similar rule that may be adopted by the SEC (such filing, the "Shelf Registration"). The Company agrees to use commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the Shelf Registration Statement to become or be declared effective by the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable. The Company agrees to use commercially reasonable best efforts to keep such Shelf Registration Statement effective until the earlier of (i) the date on which each Holder is able to dispose of all of its Registrable Securities in any 90 day period pursuant to Rule 144 (or any similar or analogous rule promulgated under the Securities Act) and without the requirement to be in compliance with Rule 144(c)(1) (or any successor rule) and (ii) the date on which there are no Registrable Securities. By 9:30 a.m. New York time on the second Business Day following the Effective Time of the Shelf Registration Statement or the post effective amendment, as applicable, the Company shall file with the SEC in accordance with Rule 424 under the Securities Act the final Prospectus to be used in connection with sales pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement. In no event shall the Company be required to file, and maintain effectiveness of more than one Shelf Registration Statement at any one time. 

   

 (b) _Suspension of Filing or Registration_. If the Company shall furnish to the Holders a certificate signed by the Chief Executive Officer or equivalent senior executive of the Company, stating that the filing, effectiveness or continued use of the Shelf Registration Statement would require the Company to make an Adverse Disclosure, then the Company shall have a period of not more than 30 days (or such longer period as the Holders holding a majority of the Registrable Securities shall consent to in writing) within which to delay the filing or effectiveness of such Shelf Registration Statement or, in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement that has been declared effective, to suspend the use by Holders of such Shelf Registration Statement (in each case, a " _Shelf Suspension_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, unless consented to in writing by Holders holding a majority of the Registrable Securities, the Company shall not be permitted to exercise a Shelf Suspension more than twice during any 12-month period and there must be at least 60 days between each permitted Shelf Suspension. In the case of a Shelf Suspension that occurs after the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement, the Holders agree to suspend use of the applicable Prospectus in connection with any sale or purchase of, or offer to sell or purchase, Registrable Securities, upon receipt of the notice referred to above. The Company shall immediately notify the 

   ##### 

  

   

Holders upon the termination of any Shelf Suspension, and (i) in the case the
Shelf Registration Statement has not been declared effective, shall
promptly thereafter file the Shelf Registration Statement and use its
commercially reasonable best efforts to have such Shelf Registration
Statement declared effective under the Securities Act and (ii) in the case
Shelf Registration Statement has become effective, shall amend or supplement
the Prospectus, if necessary, so it does not contain any untrue statement
or omission prior to the expiration of the Shelf Suspension and furnish to
the Holders such numbers of copies of the Prospectus as so amended or
supplemented as the Holders may reasonably request. The Company agrees, if
necessary, to supplement or make amendments to the Shelf Registration
Statement, if required by the registration form used by the Company for
the Shelf Registration or by the instructions applicable to such registration
form or by the Securities Act or the rules or regulations promulgated
thereunder or as may reasonably be requested by the Holders of a majority of
the Registrable Securities then outstanding. 

   

 (c) The Company shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to take all actions reasonably necessary to ensure that the transactions contemplated herein are effected as so contemplated in Section 3.1(a) hereof, and to submit to the SEC, within two Business Days after the Company learns that no review of the Shelf Registration Statement will be made by the staff of the SEC or that the staff has no further comments on the Shelf Registration Statement, as the case may be, a request for acceleration of effectiveness (or post effective amendment, if applicable) of the Shelf Registration Statement to a time and date not later than 48 hours after the submission of such request. 

   

 (d) Any reference herein to a registration statement or prospectus as of any time shall be deemed to include any document incorporated, or deemed to be incorporated, therein by reference as of such time and any reference herein to any post-effective amendment to a registration statement as of any time shall be deemed to include any document incorporated, or deemed to be incorporated, therein by reference as of such time. Any reference to a prospectus as of any time shall include any supplement thereto, preliminary prospectus, or any free writing prospectus in respect thereof. 

   

 (e) In connection with the filing of the Shelf Registration Statement, the Company shall: 

   

 (i) prepare and file with the SEC within the time periods specified in Section 3.1(a), a Shelf Registration Statement on any form which may be utilized by the Company and which shall register all of the Registrable Securities for resale by the Holders thereof in accordance with (except if otherwise required pursuant to written comments received from the SEC upon a review of such Shelf Registration Statement) the "Plan of Distribution" section attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ and use reasonable best efforts to cause such Shelf Registration Statement to become effective as soon as reasonably practicable; 

   

 (ii) as soon as reasonably practicable prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to such Shelf Registration Statement (including without limitation, any required post effective amendments) and the prospectus included therein as may be necessary to effect and maintain the effectiveness of such Shelf Registration Statement for the period specified in Section 3.1(a) hereof and as may be required by the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the instructions applicable to the form of such Shelf Registration Statement; 

   

 (iii) include in the Shelf Registration Statement the " _Selling Securityholders_ " and " _Plan of Distribution_ " sections in substantially the form attached hereto as  _Exhibit A_. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (iv) comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all of the Registrable Securities covered by such Shelf Registration Statement in accordance with the methods of disposition as described in _Exhibit A_ by the Holders provided for in such Shelf Registration Statement; 

   

 (v) provide the Holders and, if any, single legal counsel designated by the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities then outstanding (" _Legal Counsel_ ") a reasonable opportunity to participate in the preparation of such Shelf Registration Statement, each prospectus included therein or filed with the SEC and each amendment or supplement thereto (but not including any documents incorporated by reference), in each case subject to customary confidentiality restrictions, and give reasonable consideration to any comments Legal Counsel provides with respect to any Shelf Registration Statement or amendment or supplement thereto. The Company shall furnish to Legal Counsel copies of any correspondence from the SEC or the staff of the SEC to the Company or its representatives relating to any Shelf Registration Statement; 

   

 (vi) keep the Shelf Registration Statement current and continuously effective pursuant to Rule 415 at all times until the date set forth in Section 3.1(a). The Shelf Registration Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; 

   

 (vii) promptly notify the Holders (A) when the Shelf Registration Statement or the Prospectus included therein or any prospectus amendment or supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed, and, with respect to such Shelf Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective, (B) of any comments by the SEC with respect thereto or any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to such Shelf Registration Statement or prospectus or for additional information (the Company shall respond to such comments and requests from the SEC as promptly as reasonably possible), (C) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of such Shelf Registration Statement or the initiation or threatening of any proceedings for that purpose, (D) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose (in the cases of (C) and (D), the Company shall obtain the withdrawal of such stop order or suspension at the earliest practicable time) or (E) if at any time when a prospectus is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, that such Shelf Registration Statement, prospectus, prospectus amendment or supplement or post-effective amendment does not conform in all material respects to the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing (the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly prepare a supplement or amendment to the Shelf Registration Statement to conform to such requirements or to correct such untrue statement or omission, and deliver such number of copies of such supplement or amendment to the selling Holders as the selling Holders may reasonably request); and 

   

 (viii) in the event that Form S-3 is not available for the registration of the resale of Registrable Securities hereunder, the Company shall (i) register the resale of the Registrable Securities on another appropriate form reasonably acceptable to the Holders, including a Form S-1 and (ii) undertake to register the Registrable Securities on Form S-3 as soon as such form is available. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (f) In connection with the Shelf Registration Statement, each Holder agrees to furnish to the Company a duly completed Selling Securityholder Questionnaire substantially in the form of  _Exhibit B_ hereto no later than November 25, 2009 and the Company agrees to mail each Holder the Selling Securityholder Questionnaire no later than November 13, 2009. Each Holder further agrees that it shall not be entitled to be named as a selling securityholder in the Shelf Registration Statement or use the prospectus for offers and resales of Registrable Securities at any time, unless such Holder has returned to the Company a completed and signed Selling Securityholder Questionnaire. Each Holder acknowledges and agrees that the information in the Selling Securityholder Questionnaire will be used by the Company in the preparation of the Shelf Registration Statement and hereby consents to the inclusion of such information in the Shelf Registration Statement. Each Holder agrees to notify the Company as promptly as practicable of any inaccuracy or change in information previously furnished by such Holder to the Company contained in a Selling Securityholder Questionnaire or of the occurrence of any event in either case that could cause the prospectus to contain an untrue statement of a material fact regarding such Holder or its intended method of disposition of such Registrable Securities or omits to state any material fact regarding such Holder or its intended method of disposition of such Registrable Securities required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing, and promptly to furnish to the Company any additional information required to correct and update any previously furnished information or required so that such prospectus shall not contain, with respect to each Holder or the disposition of such Registrable Securities, an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing. If any Holder fails to provide to the Company any information required to be provided pursuant to this Section 3 after such Holder became aware of the inaccuracy, omission or required change, the Company may suspend the use of the Shelf Registration Statement and the prospectus contained therein until such time as such Holder provides the required information to the Company.

 Section 3.3. _Obligations of the Company_. Whenever required under this Article III to effect the registration of any Registrable Securities, the Company shall (in addition to the requirements set forth in Section 3.1(e) with respect to the Shelf Registration Statement), as expeditiously as reasonably possible:

 (b) use its reasonable efforts to register or qualify, and cooperate with the Holders of Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement and their respective counsel, in connection with the registration or qualification of such Registrable Securities for offer and sale under the securities or "blue sky" laws of each state and other jurisdiction of the United States as any such Holder or their respective counsel reasonably request in writing, and do any and all other

things reasonably necessary or advisable to keep such registration or
qualification in effect for such period as required by Section 3.1(a),

   ##### 

  

   

employees, agents and officers, against all claims, losses, damages and
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arising out of or based on any
untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained
in any such Shelf Registration Statement, prospectus, offering circular or
other document, or any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances in which they
were made, and will reimburse, as incurred, the Company, each such other
Holder, and each such director, officer, employee, agent, partner and
controlling Person of the foregoing, for any legal or any other
expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending
any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, in each case to the
extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue
statement) or omission (or alleged omission) was made in such Shelf
Registration Statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document,
in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the
Company by such Holder expressly for use therein (including, without
limitation, information included on such Holders Selling Securityholder
Questionnaire); _provided_ , _however_ , that the liability of each Holder
hereunder shall be limited to the net proceeds received by such Holder from

No Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, may, without the consent of each Indemnified Party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liabilities on claims that are the subject matter of such claim or litigation. 

   

 (d) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in case indemnification is unavailable to an Indemnified Party (by reason of legal prohibition or otherwise), the Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party in connection with the actions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party, and such partys relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such actions; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in any case, (i) no Holder will be required to contribute any amount in excess of any amount the public offering price of all securities offered by it pursuant to such Shelf 

   ##### 

  

   

Registration Statement, and (ii) no Person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
will be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation. 

   

 (e) The indemnity and contribution agreements contained herein are in addition to any liability that the Indemnifying Party may have to the Indemnified Parties and shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party or any officer, director or controlling Person of such Indemnified Party and shall survive the transfer of the Registrable Securities. 

  

 Section 3.5. _Information by Holder_.

Schedule A 

   

Stockholders  

   ##### 

  

  

Exhibit A 

   

Plan of Distribution 

   

 We are registering the shares of common stock issued to the selling stockholders to permit the resale of these shares of common stock by the holders of the shares of common stock from time to time after the date of this prospectus. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale by the selling stockholders of the shares of common stock. We will bear all fees and expenses incident to our obligation to register the shares of common stock. 

   

 Each selling stockholder of the common stock and any of their pledgees, assignees and successors-in-interest may, from time to time, sell any or all of their shares of common stock covered hereby on The NASDAQ Global Market or any other stock exchange, market or trading facility on which the shares are traded or in private transactions. These sales may be at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale, at varying prices determined at the time of sale, or negotiated prices. A selling stockholder may use any one or more of the following methods when selling shares: 

   

       |   |   | ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in
which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    |   |   | block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to
sell the shares as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block
as principal to facilitate the transaction;  
      
    |   |   | purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by
the broker-dealer for its account;  
      
    |   |   | an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of
the applicable exchange;  
      
    |   |   | privately negotiated transactions;  
      
    |   |   | settlement of short sales entered into after the
effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a
part;  
      
    |   |   | in transactions through broker-dealers that agree with
the selling stockholders to sell a specified number of such shares at a
stipulated price per share;  
      
    |   |   | through the writing or settlement of options or other
hedging transactions, whether through an options exchange or otherwise;  
      
    |   |   | a combination of any such methods of sale; or  
      
    |   |   | any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law.  
   

  

 The selling stockholders may also sell shares under Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, if available, rather than under this prospectus. 

   

 Broker-dealers engaged by the selling stockholders may arrange for other brokers-dealers to participate in sales. Broker-dealers may receive commissions or discounts from the selling stockholders (or, if any broker-dealer acts as agent for the purchaser of shares, from the purchaser) in amounts to be negotiated, but, except as set forth in a supplement to this Prospectus, in the case of an agency transaction not in excess of a customary brokerage commission in compliance with FINRA Rule 2440; and in the case of a principal transaction a markup or markdown in compliance with FINRA IM-2440-1. 

    ##### 

  

     

 In connection with the sale of the common stock or interests therein, the selling stockholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions, which may in turn engage in short sales of the common stock in the course of hedging the positions they assume. The selling stockholders may also sell shares of the common stock short and deliver these securities to close out their short positions or to return borrowed shares in connection with such short sales, or loan or pledge the common stock to broker-dealers that in turn may sell these securities. The selling stockholders may also enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or create one or more derivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial institution of shares offered by this prospectus, which shares such broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell pursuant to this prospectus (as supplemented or amended to reflect such transaction). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the selling stockholders have been advised that they may not use shares registered on this registration statement to cover short sales of our common stock made prior to the date the registration statement, of which this prospectus forms a part, has been declared effective by the Commission. 

   

 The selling stockholders and any broker-dealers or agents that are involved in selling the shares may be deemed to be "underwriters" within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with such sales. In such event, any commissions received by such broker-dealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the shares purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. Selling stockholders who are "underwriters" within the meaning of Section 2(11) of the Securities Act will be subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act and may be subject to certain statutory liabilities of, including but not limited to, Sections 11, 12 and 17 of the Securities Act and Rule 10b-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Each selling stockholder has informed us that it is not a registered broker-dealer and does not have any written or oral agreement or understanding, directly or indirectly, with any person to distribute the common stock. In no event shall any broker-dealer receive fees, commissions and markups which, in the aggregate, would exceed eight percent (8%). 

   

 We are required to pay certain fees and expenses incurred by us incident to the registration of the shares. We have agreed to indemnify the selling stockholders against certain losses, claims, damages and liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and the selling stockholders may be entitled to contribution. We may be indemnified by the selling stockholders against certain losses, claims, damages and liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, that may arise from any written information furnished to us by the selling stockholders specifically for use in this prospectus, or we may be entitled to contribution. 

   

 The selling stockholders will be subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act including Rule 172 thereunder unless an exemption therefrom is available. 

   

 The selling stockholders have advised us that there is no underwriter or coordinating broker acting in connection with the proposed sale of the resale shares by the selling stockholders. 

   

 We agreed to use our commercially reasonable best efforts keep this prospectus effective until the earlier of (i) the date on which the shares may be resold by the selling stockholders without registration and without regard to any volume restrictions by reason of under Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect or (ii) all of the shares have been sold pursuant to this prospectus or Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect. The resale shares will be sold only through registered or licensed brokers or dealers if required under applicable state securities laws. In addition, in certain states, the resale shares of Common Stock covered hereby may not be sold unless they have been registered or qualified for sale in the applicable state or an exemption from the registration or qualification requirement is available and is complied with. 

    ##### 

  

     

 Under applicable rules and regulations under the Exchange Act, any person engaged in the distribution of the resale shares may not simultaneously engage in market making activities with respect to the common stock for the applicable restricted period, as defined in Regulation M, prior to the commencement of the distribution. In addition, the selling stockholders will be subject to applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, including Regulation M, which may limit the timing of purchases and sales of shares of the common stock by the selling stockholders or any other person. We will make copies of this prospectus available to the selling stockholders and have informed them of the need to deliver a copy of this prospectus to each purchaser at or prior to the time of the sale (including by compliance with Rule 172 under the Securities Act). 

   

 There can be no assurance that any selling stockholder will sell any or all of the shares of common stock registered pursuant to the registration statement, of which this prospectus forms a part. 

   

 Once sold under the registration statement, of which this prospectus forms a part, the shares of common stock will be freely tradable in the hands of persons other than our affiliates.

 Certain legal consequences arise from being named as a selling stockholder in the Registration Statement and the related prospectus.

 The undersigned agrees to promptly notify the Company of any inaccuracies or changes in the information provided herein that may occur subsequent to the date hereof at any time while the Registration Statement remains effective. All notices hereunder and pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement shall be made in writing and shall be delivered as set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement. In the absence of any such notification, the Company shall be entitled to continue to rely on the accuracy of the information in this Notice and Questionnaire. 

   

 By signing below, the undersigned consents to the disclosure of the information contained herein in its answers to Items 1 through 7 and the inclusion of such information in the Registration Statement and the related prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto. The undersigned understands that such information will be relied upon by the Company in connection with the preparation or amendment of the Registration Statement and the related prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto. 

   

 By signing below, the undersigned acknowledges that it understands its obligation to comply, and agrees that it will comply, with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, particularly Regulation M in connection with any offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement. The undersigned also acknowledges that it understands that the answers to this Questionnaire are furnished for use in connection with Registration Statements filed pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement and any amendments or supplements thereto filed with the Commission pursuant to the Securities Act. 

  

 The undersigned hereby acknowledges and is advised of the following Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation (" _CDI_ ") of the staff of the Division of Corporation Finance (with respect to Securities Act Sections) regarding short selling: 

 

 _"_ _239.10_ _An issuer filed a Form S-3 registration statement for a
secondary offering of common stock which is not yet effective. One of the
selling shareholders wanted to do a short sale of common stock "against the
box" and cover the short sale with registered shares after the effective
date. The issuer was advised that the short sale could not be made before the
registration statement becomes effective, because the shares underlying the
short sale are deemed to be sold at the time such sale is made. There would,
therefore, be a violation of Section 5 if the shares were effectively sold
prior to the effective date. [Nov. 26, 2008]"_ 

  

By returning this Questionnaire, the undersigned will be deemed to be aware of
the foregoing CDI. 

    ##### 

  

     

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF the undersigned, by authority duly given, has caused this Notice and Questionnaire to be executed and delivered either in person or by its duly authorized agent.
