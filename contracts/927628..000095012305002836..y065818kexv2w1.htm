receive from Capital One the fraction of a share of Capital One Common Stock
(the " _Stock Consideration_ ") as is equal to the Exchange Ratio

" _Exchange Ratio_ " shall mean the quotient, rounded to the nearest one ten-

thousandth, of 0.2261 (the " _Share Ratio_ ") times the Capital One Closing

Effective Time.   

" _Cash Component_ " shall mean $2,382,141,311.   

The Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration are sometimes referred to
herein collectively as the " _Merger Consideration_."    

 (d) All of the shares of Hibernia Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article I_ shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate previously representing any such shares of Hibernia Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and/or cash in lieu of fractional shares, into which the shares of Hibernia Common Stock represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to this Section 1.4 and Section 2.3(f), as well as any dividends to which holders of Hibernia Common Stock become entitled in accordance with Section 2.3(c).   

 (e) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Capital One Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in capitalization, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Share Ratio.   

 (f) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, no shares of Hibernia Common Stock that are issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and that are held by a stockholder who has properly exercised such stockholders appraisal rights    ##### 

  

    

(any such shares being referred to herein as " _Dissenting Shares_ ") under
the LBCL shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 1.4(c) and instead shall be entitled
to such rights (but only such rights) as are granted by Section 12:131 of the
LBCL (unless and until such stockholder shall have failed to perfect, or
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, such stockholders right to dissent
from the Merger under the LBCL) and to receive such consideration as may be
determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to and
subject to the requirements of the LBCL. If any such stockholder shall have
failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right
prior to the Election Deadline, each of such holders shares of Hibernia
Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to be Non-Election Shares for
all purposes of this Agreement unless such stockholder shall thereafter
otherwise make a timely Election under this Agreement. If any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall have so failed to perfect or has effectively
withdrawn or lost such stockholders right to dissent from the Merger after
the Election Deadline, each of such holders shares of Hibernia Common Stock
shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become, as
of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Stock Consideration or the
Cash Consideration, or a combination thereof, as determined by Capital One in
its sole discretion.   

 1.5 _Proration_.   

 (a) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the total number of shares of Hibernia Common Stock (including Hibernia Restricted Shares) to be converted into Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 1.4 (which, for this purpose, shall be deemed to include the Dissenting Shares determined as of the Effective Time) (the " _Cash Conversion Number_ ") shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the Cash Component by (y) the Per Share Amount. All other shares of Hibernia Common Stock shall be converted into Stock Consideration (other than shares of Hibernia Common Stock to be canceled as provided in Section 1.4(b)).   

 (b) Within five business days after the Effective Time, Capital One shall cause the Exchange Agent (as defined below) to effect the allocation among holders of Hibernia Common Stock of rights to receive the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration as follows:    

 (i) If the aggregate number of shares of Hibernia Common Stock with respect to which Cash Elections shall have been made (which, for this purpose, shall be deemed to include the Dissenting Shares determined as of the Effective Time) (the " _Cash Election Number_ ") exceeds the Cash Conversion Number, then all Stock Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration, and Cash Election Shares of each holder thereof will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that number of Cash Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Cash Conversion Number and the denominator of which is the Cash Election Number (with the Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with Section 1.5(a), whether fractions of Cash Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of such holders    ##### 

  

   

Cash Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration; and    

 (ii) If the Cash Election Number is less than the Cash Conversion Number (the amount by which the Cash Conversion Number exceeds the Cash Election Number being referred to herein as the " _Shortfall Number_ "), then all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and the Non-Election Shares and Stock Election Shares shall be treated in the following manner:    

 (A) If the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-Election Shares, then all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration, and the Non-Election Shares of each holder thereof shall convert into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that number of Non-Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number and the denominator of which is the total number of Non-Election Shares (with the Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with Section 1.5(a), whether fractions of Non-Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of such holders Non-Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration; or    

 (B) If the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration, and Stock Election Shares of each holder thereof shall convert into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that number of Stock Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which (1) the Shortfall Number exceeds (2) the total number of Non-Election Shares, and the denominator of which is the total number of Stock Election Shares (with the Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with Section 1.5(a), whether fractions of Stock-Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of such holders Stock Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration.   

 1.6 _Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_.   

 (a) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each option to purchase shares of Hibernia Common Stock granted to employees or directors of Hibernia or any of its Subsidiaries under any of the 1987 Stock Option Plan, the Long Term Incentive Plan, the 1993 Directors Stock Option Plan, the 2001 Nonqualified Stock Option Plan and the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan of Hibernia (collectively, the " _Hibernia Stock Plans_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the    ##### 

  

    

Effective Time (collectively, the " _Hibernia Options_ ") shall be converted
into an option (an " _Adjusted Option_ ") to purchase, on the same terms and
conditions as applied to each such Hibernia Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time (taking into account any accelerated vesting of such Hibernia
Options in accordance with the terms thereof), the number of whole shares of
Capital One Common Stock that is equal to the number of shares of Hibernia
Common Stock subject to such Hibernia Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest
whole share), at an exercise price per share of Capital One Common
Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole penny) equal to the exercise price for
each such share of Hibernia Common Stock subject to such Hibernia Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio.   

 (b) As of the Effective Time, each restricted share of Hibernia Common Stock granted to any employee or director of Hibernia or any of its Subsidiaries under a Hibernia Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Hibernia Restricted Shares_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive (the " _Capital One Restricted Share Right_ "), on the same terms and conditions as applied to each such Hibernia Restricted Share immediately prior to the Effective Time (including the same transfer restrictions), the Merger Consideration determined in accordance with Sections 1.4 and 1.5 of this Agreement based on the holders election in accordance with Section 2.1 of this Agreement, and treating such Hibernia Restricted Shares in the same manner as all other shares of Hibernia Common Stock for such purposes; _provided_ , _however_ , that, upon the lapsing of restrictions with respect to each such Capital One Restricted Share Right in accordance with the terms applicable to the corresponding Hibernia Restricted Share immediately prior to the Effective Time, Capital One shall be entitled to deduct and withhold such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld under the Code and any applicable state or local tax law with respect to the lapsing of such restrictions.   

 (c) (i) As of the Effective Time, each restricted share unit with respect to shares of Hibernia Common Stock granted to any employee or director of Hibernia or any of its Subsidiaries under a Hibernia Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Hibernia RSUs_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into a restricted share unit, on the same terms and conditions as applied to each such Hibernia RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (taking into account any accelerated vesting of such Hibernia RSU in accordance with the terms thereof), with respect to the number of shares of Capital One Common Stock that is equal to the number of shares of Hibernia Common Stock subject to the Hibernia RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share) (a " _Capital One RSU_ ").    

 (ii) As of the Effective Time, each phantom share of Hibernia Common Stock credited immediately prior to the Effective Time to the book entry account of a participant in the Supplemental Stock Compensation Plan for Key Management Employees (such plan, the " _Supplemental Stock Plan_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of such participant, be converted into a book entry account number under the Supplemental Stock Plan of a number of shares of Capital One Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Hibernia Common Stock    ##### 

  

   

credited to such book entry account immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole
share).   

 (d) As of the Effective Time, Capital One shall assume the obligations and succeed to the rights of Hibernia under the Hibernia Stock Plans with respect to the Adjusted Options, the Capital One RSUs and Capital One Restricted Share Rights. Hibernia and Capital One agree that prior to the Effective Time each of the Hibernia Stock Plans shall be amended, to the extent possible without requiring stockholder approval of such amendments, (i) if and to the extent necessary and practicable, to reflect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the conversion of the Hibernia Options, Hibernia Restricted Shares and Hibernia RSUs pursuant to paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above and the substitution of Capital One for Hibernia thereunder to the extent appropriate to effectuate the assumption of such Hibernia Stock Plans by Capital One and (ii) to preclude any automatic or formulaic grant of options, restricted shares or other awards thereunder on or after the date hereof, except as permitted under Section 5.2(b)(iii). From and after the Effective Time, all references to Hibernia (other than any references relating to a "Change in Control" of Hibernia) in each Hibernia Stock Plan and in each agreement evidencing any award of Hibernia Options or Hibernia Restricted Shares shall be deemed to refer to Capital One, unless Capital One determines otherwise.   

 (e) Capital One shall take all action necessary or appropriate to have available for issuance or transfer a sufficient number of shares of Capital One Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of the Adjusted Options or settlement of the Capital One RSUs. Promptly after the Effective Time, Capital One shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or other appropriate form) registering a number of shares of Capital One Common Stock necessary to fulfill Capital Ones obligations under this paragraph (e).   

 1.7 _Certificate of Incorporation of Capital One_. At the Effective Time, the Capital One Certificate (as defined in Section 4.1) shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.   

 1.8 _Bylaws of Capital One_. At the Effective Time, the Capital One Bylaws (as defined in Section 4.1) shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.

ARTICLE II    

DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION    

 2.1 _Election Procedures_. Each holder of record of shares of Hibernia Common Stock (" _Holder_ ") shall have the right, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article II, to submit an election in accordance with the following procedures:    ##### 

  

  

 (a) Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.1 (herein called an " _Election_ ") (i) the number of shares of Hibernia Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder desires to make a Stock Election and (ii) the number of shares of Hibernia Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder desires to make a Cash Election.   

 (b) Capital One shall prepare a form reasonably acceptable to Hibernia (the " _Form of Election_ ") which shall be mailed to record holders of Hibernia Common Stock so as to permit those holders to exercise their right to make an Election prior to the Election Deadline.   

 (c) Capital One shall make the Form of Election initially available not less than twenty (20) business days prior to the anticipated Election Deadline and shall use all reasonable efforts to make available as promptly as possible a Form of Election to any stockholder of Hibernia who requests such Form of Election following the initial mailing of the Forms of Election and prior to the Election Deadline.   

 (d) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the person authorized to receive Elections and to act as exchange agent under this Agreement, which person shall be a bank or trust company selected by Capital One and reasonably acceptable to Hibernia (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), pursuant to an agreement (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ ") entered into prior to the mailing of the Form of Election to Hibernia stockholders, shall have received, by the Election Deadline, a Form of Election properly completed and signed and accompanied by Certificates to which such Form of Election relates or by an appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such certificates, as set forth in such Form of Election, from a member of any registered national securities exchange or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States; _provided_ , that such Certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the time required in such guarantee of delivery. Failure to deliver shares of Hibernia Common Stock covered by such a guarantee of delivery within the time set forth on such guarantee shall be deemed to invalidate any otherwise properly made Election, unless otherwise determined by Capital One, in its sole discretion. As used herein, " _Election Deadline_ " means 5:00 p.m. local time (in the city in which the principal office of the Exchange Agent is located) on the later of (1) the date of the meeting of Hibernia stockholders pursuant to Section 6.3 and (2) the earlier of (i) the date that Capital One and Hibernia shall agree is as near as practicable to five (5) business days prior to the expected Closing Date taking into account Capital Ones intention to minimize the impact of limitations under applicable law that might apply during the period from the initial mailing of the Forms of Election until the Election Deadline and (ii) September 2, 2005;  _provided_ that if it appears that the Closing Date will not take place on or prior to October 15, 2005, the parties shall in good faith discuss whether such September 2, 2005 date should be deferred to an appropriate later date. Hibernia and Capital One shall cooperate to issue a press release reasonably satisfactory to each of them announcing the date of the Election Deadline not more than fifteen (15) business days before, and at least five (5) business days prior to, the Election Deadline.   

 (e) Any Hibernia stockholder may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, change or revoke his or her Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and signed revised Form of Election. Subject to the terms of the Exchange Agent Agreement, if Capital One shall determine    ##### 

  

    

in its reasonable discretion that any Election is not properly made with
respect to any shares of Hibernia Common Stock (neither Capital One nor
Hibernia nor the Exchange Agent being under any duty to notify any stockholder
of any such defect), such Election shall be deemed to be not in effect, and
the shares of Hibernia Common Stock covered by such Election shall, for
purposes hereof, be deemed to be Non-Election Shares, unless a proper
Election is thereafter timely made.   

 (f) Any Hibernia stockholder may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, revoke his or her Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline of his or her Certificates, or of the guarantee of delivery of such Certificates, previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. All Elections shall be revoked automatically if the Exchange Agent is notified in writing by Capital One or Hibernia that this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Article VIII.   

 (g) Subject to the terms of the Exchange Agent Agreement, Capital One, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, shall have the right to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing (i) the validity of the Forms of Election and compliance by any Hibernia stockholder with the Election procedures set forth herein, (ii) the manner and extent to which Elections are to be taken into account in making the determinations prescribed by Section 1.5, (iii) the issuance and delivery of certificates representing the whole number of shares of Capital One Common Stock into which shares of Hibernia Common Stock are converted in the Merger and (iv) the method of payment of cash for shares of Hibernia Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Capital One Common Stock.   

 2.2 _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Capital One shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, (i) certificates representing the number of shares of Capital One Common Stock sufficient to deliver, and Capital One shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely deliver, the aggregate Stock Consideration, and (ii) immediately available funds equal to the aggregate Cash Consideration (together with, to the extent then determinable, any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.3(f)) (collectively, the " _Exchange Fund_ ") and Capital One shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay the Cash Consideration, and such cash in lieu of fractional shares, in accordance with this Agreement.   

 2.3 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_.   

 (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Certificate(s) which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Hibernia Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.4 and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Capital One Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor who did not complete an Election Form, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificate(s) shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such certificates)) (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") to the Exchange Agent and shall be substantially in such form and have such other provisions as shall be prescribed by the Exchange Agent Agreement and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering Certificate(s) in exchange for the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of    ##### 

  

    

fractional shares of Capital One Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor in accordance with Section 2.3(f) upon surrender of
such Certificate and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(c).   

 (b) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate or Certificates, accompanied by a properly completed Form of Election or a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a holder of Hibernia Common Stock will be entitled to receive promptly after the Effective Time the Merger Consideration (elected or deemed elected by it, subject to Sections 1.4 and 1.5) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Capital One Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in respect of the shares of Hibernia Common Stock represented by its Certificate or Certificates. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Capital One Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with, and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to, this Article II.   

 (c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Capital One Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Capital One Common Stock represented thereby, in each case until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, following surrender of any such Certificate in accordance with this Article II the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the whole shares of Capital One Common Stock represented by such Certificate and not paid and/or (ii), at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions payable with respect to shares of Capital One Common Stock represented by such Certificate with a record date after the Effective Time (but before such surrender date) and with a payment date subsequent to the issuance of the Capital One Common Stock issuable with respect to such Certificate.   

 (d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing Hibernia Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer records of Hibernia, the proper amount of cash and/or shares of Capital One Common Stock shall be paid or issued in exchange therefor to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Certificate formerly representing such Hibernia Common Stock shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment or issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment or issuance to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Capital One that the Tax has been paid or is not applicable. The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Capital One) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash portion of the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Capital One Common Stock otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Hibernia Common Stock such amounts as the Exchange Agent or Capital One, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or Capital One, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to    ##### 

  

    

the holder of shares of Hibernia Common Stock in respect of whom such
deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or Capital One, as
the case may be.   

 (e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Hibernia of the shares of Hibernia Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle transfers of Hibernia Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Capital One Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II.   

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Capital One Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates for exchange, no dividend or distribution with respect to Capital One Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Capital One. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Capital One shall pay to each former stockholder of Hibernia who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the Capital One Closing Price by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of Hibernia Common Stock hold by such holder at the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Capital One Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.4.   

 (g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of Hibernia as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time shall be paid to Capital One. Any former stockholders of Hibernia who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Capital One with respect to the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Capital One Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of Hibernia Common Stock such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Capital One, Hibernia, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Hibernia Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.   

 (h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Capital One or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Capital One may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.     #####

 Subject to Section 9.2 and except as disclosed in the disclosure schedule (the " _Hibernia Disclosure Schedule_ ") delivered by Hibernia to Capital One prior to the execution of this Agreement (which schedule sets forth, among other things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in this Article III, or to one or more of Hibernias covenants contained in Article V, _provided_ ,  _however_ , that disclosure in any section of such Hibernia Disclosure Schedule shall only apply to the indicated Section of this Agreement except to the extent that it is reasonably apparent that such disclosure is relevant to another section of this Agreement), Hibernia hereby represents and warrants to Capital One as follows:

These disclosures were made in writing by management to Capital Ones auditors and audit committee and a copy has previously been made available to Hibernia.

Neither Hibernia nor the Board of Directors of Hibernia (nor any committee thereof) shall, in a manner adverse to Capital One, (i) withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose to withdraw, modify or qualify, the recommendation by such Board of Directors of this Agreement and/or the Merger to Hibernias stockholders, (ii) take any action or make any statement in connection with the meeting of Hibernia stockholders to be held pursuant to Section 6.3 inconsistent with such approval (any action referred to in clause (i) or (ii) being a " _Change in Hibernia Recommendation_ ") or (iii) recommend any Alternative Proposal (as defined in Section 6.11). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of Hibernia shall be permitted to take the actions described in clauses (i) through (iii) above if (A) Hibernia has complied with Section __ 6.11, and (B) to the extent the Board of Directors of Hibernia reasonably determines in good faith (after due consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Hibernia shall have provided Capital One with three business days prior written notice to the effect that the Board of Directors of Hibernia intends to take such action and the reasons therefor.   

 6.4 _Affiliates_. Hibernia shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each director, executive officer and other person who is an "affiliate" (for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act) of Hibernia to deliver to Capital One, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, and prior to the date of the meeting of the Hibernia stockholders to be held pursuant to Section 6.3, a written agreement, in the form of Exhibit A.   

 6.5 _NYSE Listing_. Capital One shall cause the shares of Capital One Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.   

 6.6 _Employee Matters_. (a) For the one-year period following the Effective Time, Capital One shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to, provide to those individuals actively employed by Hibernia or one of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Covered Employees_ ") with employee benefits, rates of base salary or hourly wage and annual bonus opportunities that are substantially similar, in the aggregate, to the aggregate rates of base salary or hourly wage provided to such Covered Employees and the aggregate employee benefits and annual bonus opportunities provided to such Covered Employees under the Hibernia Benefit Plans (other than the ESOP and its related non-qualified supplemental stock plan) as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that nothing herein shall limit the right of Capital One or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Covered Employee at any time or require Capital One or any of its Subsidiaries to provide any such employee benefits, rates of base salary or hourly wage or annual bonus opportunities for any period following any such termination.    ##### 

  

  

 (b) To the extent that a Covered Employee becomes eligible to participate in an employee benefit plan maintained by Capital One or any of its Subsidiaries, other than Hibernia or its Subsidiaries, Capital One shall cause such employee benefit plan to (i) recognize the service of such Covered Employee with Hibernia or its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility and vesting and, except under defined benefit pension plans, benefit accrual under such employee benefit plan of Capital One or any of its Subsidiaries to the same extent such service was recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time under a comparable Hibernia Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee was a participant immediately prior to the Effective Time or, if there is no such comparable benefit plan, to the same extent such service was recognized under the Hibernia 401(k) plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ that such recognition of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefits with respect to the Covered Employee, and (ii) with respect to any health, dental or vision plan of Capital One or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Hibernia and its Subsidiaries) in which any Covered Employee is eligible to participate in the plan year that includes the year in which such Covered Employee is eligible to participate, (x) cause any pre-existing condition limitations under such Capital One or Subsidiary plan to be waived with respect to such Covered Employee to the extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the Hibernia Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (y) recognize any medical or other health expenses incurred by such Covered Employee in the year that includes the Closing Date for purposes of any applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such health, dental or vision plan of Capital One or any of its Subsidiaries. From and after the Effective Time, Capital One shall not amend, and shall not permit to be amended, the ESOP in any manner that would extend participation thereunder to employees other than employees of Hibernia and its Subsidiaries and shall cause all unallocated shares of Capital One Common Stock held in trust thereunder to be allocated solely for the benefit of participants who are, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, employees of Hibernia and its Subsidiaries. Prior to the Effective Time, Hibernia may take all action necessary to effectuate the foregoing. For the one-year period following the Effective Time, notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6.6 to the contrary, Capital One agrees to provide employees of Hibernia who are listed on a written schedule provided to Capital One by Hibernia within 90 days following the Closing Date and whose employment is terminated in a qualifying termination of employment (other than those employees who are party to a change in control employment agreement) with severance benefits no less favorable than the greater of (i) the severance benefits that would be payable to such employees upon a qualifying termination of employment under the 2003 Special Severance Pay Plan and (ii) the severance benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Capital One upon a qualifying termination of employment under the applicable severance plan or program of Capital One.   

 (c) From and after the Effective Time, Capital One shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, honor, in accordance with the terms thereof as in effect as of the date hereof or as may be amended after the date hereof with the prior written consent of Capital One, each employment agreement and change in control agreement listed on Section 3.11 of the Hibernia Disclosure Schedule and the obligations of Hibernia and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time under each deferred compensation plan or agreement listed on Section 3.11 of the Hibernia Disclosure Schedule.    ##### 

  

  

 6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.   

 (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative (a " _Claim_ "), including any such Claim in which any individual who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer or employee of Hibernia or any of its Subsidiaries or who is or was serving at the request of Hibernia or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer or employee of another person (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a director, officer or employee of Hibernia or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the parties shall cooperate and use their best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party as provided in their respective certificates or articles of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable organizational documents), and any existing indemnification agreements set forth in Section 6.7 of the Hibernia Disclosure Schedule, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of such individuals for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time or taken at the request of Capital One pursuant to Section 6.8 hereof.   

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, each Indemnified Party against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in connection with any Claim based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer of employee of Hibernia or any Subsidiary of Hibernia, and pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or any acts or omissions occurring, at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time (including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) or taken at the request of Capital One pursuant to Section 6.8 hereof.   

 (c) Capital One shall cause the individuals serving as officers and directors of Hibernia or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered for a period of six years from the Effective Time by the directors and officers liability insurance policy maintained by Hibernia ( _provided_ that Capital One may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous than such policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time that were committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as such; _provided_ that in no event shall Capital One be required to expend annually in the aggregate an amount in excess of 250% of the annual premiums currently paid by Hibernia (which current amount is set forth in Section 6.7 of the Hibernia Disclosure Schedule) for such insurance (the " _Insurance Amount_ "), and provided further that if Capital One is unable to maintain such policy (or such    ##### 

  

    

substitute policy) as a result of the preceding proviso, Capital One shall
obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance
Amount.   

 (d) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.   

 6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of Capital One, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of Hibernia, on the other) or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either party to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party and their respective Subsidiaries shall, at Capital Ones sole expense, take all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by Capital One.   

 6.9 _Advice of Changes_. Each of Capital One and Hibernia shall promptly advise the other of any change or event (i) having or reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) that it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement; _provided_ _further_  that a failure to comply with this Section 6.9 shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement or the failure of any condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied unless the underlying Material Adverse Effect or material breach would independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied.   

 6.10 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Prior to the Effective Time, Capital One and Hibernia shall each take all such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause any disposition of shares of Hibernia Common Stock or conversion of any derivative securities in respect of such shares of Hibernia Common Stock in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, including any such actions specified in the No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom, LLP.   

 6.11 _No Solicitation_.   

 (a) None of Hibernia, its Subsidiaries or any officer, director, employee, agent or representative (including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other retained representative) of Hibernia or any of its Subsidiaries shall directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, encourage, facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) or take any other action designed to facilitate any inquiries or proposals regarding any merger, share exchange, consolidation, sale of assets, sale of shares of capital stock (including, without limitation, by way of a tender offer) or similar transactions involving Hibernia or any of its Subsidiaries that, if consummated, would constitute an Alternative Transaction (any of the foregoing inquiries or proposals, including the indication of any intention to propose any of the    ##### 

  

    

foregoing, being referred to herein as an " _Alternative Proposal_ "), (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding an Alternative
Transaction or (iii) enter into any agreement regarding any Alternative
Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors
of Hibernia shall be permitted, prior to the meeting of Hibernia stockholders
to be held pursuant to Section 6.3, and subject to compliance with the other
terms of this Section 6.11 and to first entering into a confidentiality
agreement with the person proposing such Alternative Proposal on terms
substantially similar to, and no less favorable to Hibernia than, those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, to consider and participate in
discussions with respect to a bona fide Alternative Proposal received by
Hibernia, if and only to the extent that the Board of Directors of Hibernia
reasonably determines in good faith (A) such Alternative Proposal constitutes
or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal and (B) after
consultation with outside legal counsel that failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties.   

 As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Transaction_ " means any of (i) a transaction pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) (other than Capital One or its affiliates) directly or indirectly, acquires or would acquire more than 25% of the outstanding shares of Hibernia or any of its Subsidiaries or outstanding voting power or of any new series or new class of preferred stock that would be entitled to a class or series vote with respect to a merger of Hibernia or any of its Subsidiaries whether from Hibernia or any of its Subsidiaries or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) a merger, share exchange, consolidation or other business combination involving Hibernia or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Merger), (iii) any transaction pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) (other than Capital One or its affiliates) acquires or would acquire control of assets (including for this purpose the outstanding equity securities of subsidiaries of Hibernia and securities of the entity surviving any merger or business combination including any of Hibernias Subsidiaries or) of Hibernia, or any of its Subsidiaries representing more than 25% of the fair market value of all the assets, net revenues or net income of Hibernia and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such transaction, or (iv) any other consolidation, business combination, recapitalization or similar transaction involving Hibernia or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that, for the purposes of Section 8.3(b), the applicable percentage in clauses (i) and (iii) of the definition of "Alternative Transaction" shall be 50% and any transaction contemplated by clauses (ii) and (iv) shall be limited to transactions in which the stockholders of Hibernia immediately prior to the consummation thereof would not hold at least 50% of the total voting power of the surviving company in such transaction.   

 (b) Hibernia shall notify Capital One promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt of any Alternative Proposal, or any material modification of or material amendment to any Alternative Proposal, or any request for nonpublic information relating to Hibernia or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records of Hibernia or any Subsidiary by any Person or entity that informs the Board of Directors of Hibernia or any Subsidiary that it is considering making, or has made, an Alternative Proposal. Such notice to Capital One shall be made orally and in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the Person making the Alternative Proposal or intending to make or considering making an Alternative Proposal or requesting non-public information or access to the books and records of Hibernia or any Subsidiary, and the material terms of any such Alternative Proposal or modification or amendment to an Alternative Proposal. Hibernia shall keep Capital One fully informed, on a    ##### 

  

    

current basis, of any material changes in the status and any material changes
or modifications in the terms of any such Alternative Proposal, indication or
request. Hibernia shall also promptly, and in any event within 24 hours,
notify Capital One, orally and in writing, if it enters into discussions
concerning any Alternative Proposal in accordance with Section 6.11(a).   

 (c) Hibernia and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than Capital One) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all Persons other than Capital One who have been furnished confidential information regarding Hibernia in connection with the solicitation of or discussions regarding an Alternative Proposal within the 12 months prior to the date hereof promptly to return or destroy such information. Hibernia agrees not to, and to cause its Subsidiaries not to, release any third party from the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any agreement to which Hibernia or its Subsidiaries is or may become a party, and shall immediately take all steps necessary to terminate any approval that may have been heretofore given under any such provisions authorizing any person to make an Alternative Proposal.   

 (d) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Alternative Proposal which the Board of Directors of Hibernia concludes in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and legal advisors, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation), (i) is more favorable to the stockholders of Hibernia than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) is fully financed or reasonably capable of being fully financed, reasonably likely to receive all required governmental approvals on a timely basis and otherwise reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed; _provided_ that, for purposes of this definition of "Superior Proposal," the term Alternative Transaction shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 6.11(a), except that the reference to "25%" in the definition of "Alternative Transaction" shall be deemed to be a reference to "a majority" and the definition of "Alternative Proposal" shall only be deemed to refer to a transaction involving Hibernia.   

 (e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.11 shall prohibit Hibernia or its Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act.   

 6.12 _Directorships_. Capital One shall take such actions as may be reasonably required to appoint the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Hibernia to the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation, appointed to the class of directors with its term expiring at the 2006 Annual Meeting of Capital One stockholders, and, to the extent so required, shall increase the size of the Capital One Board of Directors to permit the foregoing.   

 6.13 _Restructuring Efforts_. If Hibernia shall have failed to obtain the requisite vote or votes of its stockholders for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at a duly held meeting of its stockholders or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, then, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to its terms, each of the parties shall in good faith use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the    ##### 

  

    

transaction provided for herein (it being understood that neither party shall
have any obligation to alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger
Consideration in a manner adverse to such party or its stockholders) and to
resubmit the transaction to Hibernias stockholders for approval.

 (c) Hibernia acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Capital One would not have entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if Hibernia fails to promptly pay any amounts due pursuant to this Section 8.3 and, in order to obtain such payment, Capital One commences a suit which results in a judgment against Hibernia for the fee set forth in this Section 8.3, Hibernia shall pay to Capital One Capital Ones reasonable costs and    ##### 

  

    

expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses of enforcement)
in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts owed at
the prime lending rate prevailing at such time, as published in the Wall
Street Journal, plus two percent per annum from the date such amounts were
required to be paid until the date actually received by Capital One. Hibernia
acknowledges that it is obligated to pay to Capital One any amounts due
pursuant to this Section 8.3 whether or not the stockholders of Hibernia have
approved this Agreement.   

 8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with Merger by the stockholders of Hibernia; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that after any approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the stockholders of Hibernia, there may not be, without further approval of such stockholders, any amendment of this Agreement that (a) alters or changes the amount or the form of the consideration to be delivered under this Agreement to the holders of Hibernia Common Stock, (b) alters or changes any term of the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation to be effected by the Surviving Corporation or (c) alters or changes any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement if such alteration or change would adversely affect the holders of any class or series of capital stock of Hibernia or Capital One, in each case other than as contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.   

 8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Board of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

Ladies and Gentlemen:    

 I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of Hibernia Corporation, a Louisiana corporation (" _Hibernia_ "), as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the Rules and Regulations (the " _Rules and Regulations_ ") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _Commission_ ") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Act_ "). I have been further advised that pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of March 6, 2005 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), by and between Capital One Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Capital One_ "), and Hibernia, Hibernia shall be merged with and into Capital One (the " _Merger_ "). All terms used in this letter but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement.   

 I represent, warrant and covenant to Capital One that in the event I receive any Capital One Common Stock as a result of the Merger:   

 (a) I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of Capital One Common Stock in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations.   

 (b) I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and discussed its requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Capital One Common Stock to the extent I believed necessary with my counsel or counsel for Hibernia.   

 (c) I have been advised that the issuance of Capital One Common Stock to me pursuant to the Merger will be registered with the Commission under the Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, I have also been advised that, since at the time the Merger will be submitted for a vote of the stockholders of Hibernia I may be deemed to have been an affiliate of Hibernia and the distribution by me of Capital One Common Stock has not been registered under the Act, I may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Capital One Common Stock issued to me in the Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under the Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under the Act, or (iii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to Capital One, such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the Act.   

 (d) I understand that Capital One is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer or other disposition of Capital One Common Stock by me or on my behalf under the Act or to take any other action necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration available.    ##### 

  

  

 _Exhibit A_    

 (e) I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to Capital Ones transfer agents with respect to Capital One Common Stock and that there will be placed on the certificates for Capital One Common Stock issued to me, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance:    

"The securities represented by this certificate have been issued in a
transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933
applies and may only be sold or otherwise transferred in compliance with the
requirements of Rule 145 or pursuant to a registration statement under said
act or an exemption from such registration."   

 (f) I also understand that unless the transfer by me of my Capital One Common Stock has been registered under the Act or is a sale made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145, Capital One reserves the right to put the following legend on the certificates issued to my transferee:    

"The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under
the Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from a person who received such
shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities
Act of 1933 applies. The shares have been acquired by the holder not with a
view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof within
the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be sold, pledged or
otherwise transferred except in accordance with an exemption from
the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933."   

 It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend, and/or the issuance of a letter to Capital Ones transfer agent removing such stop transfer instructions, and the above restrictions on sale will cease to apply, if (A) one year (or such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(2) under the Securities Act or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the Closing Date and the provisions of such Rule are then available to me; or (B) if two years (or such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(3) under the Securities Act or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the Effective Date and the provisions of such Rule are then available to me; or (C) I shall have delivered to Capital One (i) a copy of a letter from the staff of the Commission, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Capital One, or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to Capital One, to the effect that such legend and/or stop transfer instructions are not required for purposes of the Securities Act or (ii) reasonably satisfactory evidence or representations that the securities represented by such certificates are being or have been transferred in a transaction made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145 under the Securities Act or pursuant to an effective registration under the Securities Act.   

 I recognize and agree that the foregoing provisions also apply to (i) my spouse, (ii) any relative of mine or my spouse occupying my home, (iii) any trust or estate in which I, my spouse or any such relative owns at least 10% beneficial interest or of which any of us serves as trustee, executor or in any similar capacity and (iv) any corporate or other organization in which    ##### 

  

  

 _Exhibit A_   

I, my spouse or any such relative owns at least 10% of any class of equity
securities or of the equity interest.    

 It is understood and agreed that this Letter Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect if the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.   

 Execution of this letter should not be construed as an admission on my part that I am an "affiliate" of Hibernia as described in the first paragraph of this letter or as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to any claim that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.        |   |   |   |
