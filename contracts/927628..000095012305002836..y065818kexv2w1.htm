best interests of their respective companies and their stockholders to consummate the strategic
business combination transaction provided for in this Agreement in which Hibernia will, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, merge with and into Capital One
(the &#147;<U>Merger</U>&#148;), so that Capital One is the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes
referred to in such capacity as the &#147;<U>Surviving Corporation</U>&#148;); and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, for federal income Tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a
reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the &#147;<U>Code</U>&#148;), and this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a &#147;plan of
reorganization&#148; for purposes of Sections&nbsp;354 and 361 of the Code; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in
connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and
agreements contained in this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and

agree as follows:

providing for the merger of Hibernia and a wholly owned subsidiary
of Capital One) if and to the extent requested by Capital One and consented to by Hibernia
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld); <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that no such
change shall (i)&nbsp;alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration provided for in

thereafter mail or deliver the Proxy Statement to its stockholders. Capital One shall also use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or &#147;Blue Sky&#148; permits and
approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Hibernia shall
furnish all information concerning Hibernia and the holders of Hibernia Common Stock as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; The parties shall cooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable best
efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all applications,

advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), and
to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such Governmental Entities. Hibernia and
Capital One shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will
consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the confidentiality of
information, all the information relating to Hibernia or Capital One, as the case may be, and any
of their respective Subsidiaries, which appear in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties shall act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties shall consult with each other with respect
to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Ladies and Gentlemen:



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an &#147;affiliate&#148; of
Hibernia Corporation, a Louisiana corporation (&#147;<U>Hibernia</U>&#148;), as the term &#147;affiliate&#148; is
defined for purposes of paragraphs (c)&nbsp;and (d)&nbsp;of Rule&nbsp;145 of the Rules and Regulations (the
&#147;<U>Rules and Regulations</U>&#148;) of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
&#147;<U>Commission</U>&#148;) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;<U>Act</U>&#148;). I have
been further advised that pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of
March&nbsp;6, 2005 (the &#147;<U>Merger Agreement</U>&#148;), by and between Capital One Financial Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (&#147;<U>Capital One</U>&#148;), and Hibernia, Hibernia shall be merged with and into
Capital One (the &#147;<U>Merger</U>&#148;). All terms used in this letter but not defined herein shall
have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I represent, warrant and covenant to Capital One that in the event I receive any Capital One
Common Stock as a result of the Merger:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of Capital One Common Stock in
violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and discussed its requirements
and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Capital
One Common Stock to the extent I believed necessary with my counsel or counsel for Hibernia.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;I have been advised that the issuance of Capital One Common Stock to me pursuant to the
Merger will be registered with the Commission under the Act on a Registration Statement on Form
S-4. However, I have also been advised that, since at the time the Merger will be submitted for a
vote of the stockholders of Hibernia I may be deemed to have been an affiliate of Hibernia and the
distribution by me of Capital One Common Stock has not been registered under the Act, I may not
sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Capital One Common Stock issued to me in the Merger unless
(i)&nbsp;such sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under the Act, (ii)&nbsp;such sale,
transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule
145 promulgated by the Commission under the Act, or (iii)&nbsp;in the opinion of counsel reasonably
acceptable to Capital One, such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from
registration under the Act.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;I understand that Capital One is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer or
other disposition of Capital One Common Stock by me or on my behalf under the Act or to take any
other action necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration
available.

<P align="right" style="font-size: 10pt"><u>Exhibit&nbsp;A</u>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to Capital One&#146;s transfer
agents with respect to Capital One Common Stock and that there will be placed on the certificates
for Capital One Common Stock issued to me, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in
substance:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 10pt">&#147;The securities represented by this certificate have been issued in
a transaction to which Rule&nbsp;145 promulgated under the Securities Act
of 1933 applies and may only be sold or otherwise transferred in
compliance with the requirements of Rule&nbsp;145 or pursuant to a
registration statement under said act or an exemption from such
registration.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;I also understand that unless the transfer by me of my Capital One Common Stock has been
registered under the Act or is a sale made in conformity with the provisions of Rule&nbsp;145, Capital
One reserves the right to put the following legend on the certificates issued to my transferee:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 10pt">&#147;The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered
under the Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from a person who
received such shares in a transaction to which Rule&nbsp;145 promulgated
under the Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares have been
acquired by the holder not with a view to, or for resale in
connection with, any distribution thereof within the meaning of the
Securities Act of 1933 and may not be sold, pledged or otherwise
transferred except in accordance with an exemption from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth above shall be removed by delivery of
substitute certificates without such legend, and/or the issuance of a letter to Capital One&#146;s
transfer agent removing such stop transfer instructions, and the above restrictions on sale will
cease to apply, if (A)&nbsp;one year (or such other period as may be required by Rule&nbsp;145(d)(2) under
the Securities Act or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the Closing Date and the
provisions of such Rule are then available to me; or (B)&nbsp;if two years (or such other period as may
be required by Rule&nbsp;145(d)(3) under the Securities Act or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed
from the Effective Date and the provisions of such Rule are then available to me; or (C)&nbsp;I shall
have delivered to Capital One (i)&nbsp;a copy of a letter from the staff of the Commission, or an
opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Capital One, or other evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Capital One, to the effect that such legend and/or stop transfer
instructions are not required for purposes of the Securities Act or (ii)&nbsp;reasonably satisfactory
evidence or representations that the securities represented by such certificates are being or have
been transferred in a transaction made in conformity with the provisions of Rule&nbsp;145 under the
Securities Act or pursuant to an effective registration under the Securities Act.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recognize and agree that the foregoing provisions also apply to (i)&nbsp;my spouse, (ii)&nbsp;any
relative of mine or my spouse occupying my home, (iii)&nbsp;any trust or estate in which I, my spouse or
any such relative owns at least 10% beneficial interest or of which any of us serves as trustee,
