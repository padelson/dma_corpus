                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER


         This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of December 23, 2003 (this
"AGREEMENT"), is entered into by and among Partners Trust Financial Group, Inc.,
a federal corporation ("PARENT"), SBU Bank, a federally chartered savings bank
and majority owned subsidiary of Parent ("SBU BANK"), Wicked Acquisition
Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of SBU Bank
("NEWCO"), Partners Trust, MHC, a federally-chartered mutual holding company
("MHC"), and BSB Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("COMPANY").

         WHEREAS, each of Parent, SBU Bank, Newco, MHC and Company desire to
consummate the business combination transaction as provided for in this
Agreement, subject to and following the Conversion (as defined below), in which
(i) Company will merge (the "MERGER") with and into Newco, with Newco being the
Surviving Corporation (as defined in Section 1.1), upon the terms and conditions
set forth herein, and each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par
value $.01 per share, of Company (the "COMPANY COMMON STOCK") will be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (as defined in Section 2.1(b)
hereof); (ii) immediately following the Merger, BSB Bank & Trust Company, a New
York-chartered commercial bank and trust company and wholly-owned subsidiary of
Company ("BSB BANK"), will merge with and into SBU Bank, with SBU Bank being the
Surviving Bank (as defined in Section 1.1(b));

         WHEREAS, in connection with the Merger, it is intended that MHC will
convert from the mutual form of organization to the capital stock form of
organization pursuant to certain transactions (the "CONVERSION") as the result
of which, inter alia, SBU Bank will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Newco,
and that in connection with such Conversion, Newco will conduct a subscription
offering of its common stock, and if necessary a community and/or syndicated
community offering, and an exchange offering to the existing public stockholders
of Parent, all pursuant to a plan of conversion and reorganization,
substantially in the Form attached at Exhibit A hereto and subject to regulatory
review and amendment in connection with such review as provided therein (the
"PLAN OF CONVERSION");

         WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, SBU Bank, Newco
and MHC (collectively, the "PARENT PARTIES") and the Board of Directors of the
Company have each approved this Agreement and the Merger in accordance with the
provisions of applicable law, including without limitation, the rules and
regulations of the Office of Thrift Supervision ("OTS") and the Delaware General
Corporation Law, as amended (the "DGCL"), and have each determined that the
Merger is advisable and in the best interests of their respective stockholders;
and

         WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the
Merger will qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a)
of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE"), and
that this Agreement be, and it hereby is, adopted as a plan of reorganization
for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as
follows:



<PAGE>

                                    ARTICLE I
                                   THE MERGER

     1.1 THE MERGER.

       (a)      Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, Company shall be merged with and
into Newco at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3). Following the
Effective Time, Newco shall be the surviving corporation (the "SURVIVING
CORPORATION") and shall succeed to and assume all of the rights and obligations
of Company in accordance with the DGCL. Upon consummation of the Merger, the
corporate existence of Company shall cease and the Surviving Corporation shall
continue to exist as a Delaware corporation.

       (b)      Immediately following the Merger, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement (as defined in
Section 5.3(c)), and in accordance with applicable law, BSB Bank shall merge
with and into SBU Bank, with SBU Bank being the surviving bank (hereinafter
sometimes called the "SURVIVING BANK"). Upon consummation of the Bank
Combination (as defined in Section 5.3), the separate existence of BSB Bank
shall cease and the Surviving Bank shall continue to exist as a federal savings
bank.

     1.2 CLOSING. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions
to closing contained in Article VI hereof (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment
or waiver of those conditions), the closing of the Merger (the "CLOSING") will
take place on the date of the closing of the Conversion (the "CLOSING DATE"),
immediately following the completion of the Conversion, unless another time or
date is agreed to by the parties hereto.

     1.3 EFFECTIVE TIME. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the
Closing, the parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a
certificate of merger in accordance with the DGCL (the "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER")
and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL to
effectuate the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such date and time
as the parties shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time
the Merger becomes effective being hereinafter referred to as the "EFFECTIVE
TIME") filed by the parties with the Office of the Delaware Secretary of State.

     1.4 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
Sections 259 and 261 of the DGCL.

     1.5 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BY-LAWS OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION.
The certificate of incorporation and the by-laws of Newco, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of
incorporation and the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law.

     1.6 DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.

       (a)      From and after the Effective Time, the directors of Newco shall
consist of the directors of Newco in office immediately prior to the Effective
Time, together with three directors designated by Company (the "COMPANY
DESIGNEES"), one of whom shall be William Craine, who will also be appointed to
serve as Chairman of Newco's Board of Directors, as provided in Section 5.14,
and the remaining two of whom shall be non-management directors of Company as of
the date hereof, until their successors shall have been duly elected, appointed
or qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the certificate of incorporation and the by-laws of Newco. Each of the
Company Designees shall be nominated and elected to serve in a class of
directors of Newco whose terms expire not less than two years from the date of
the Effective Time.


                                      -2-
<PAGE>

       (b)      From and after the Effective Time, except as provided in
paragraph (a) of this Section 1.6 with respect to the Chairman of the Board of
Directors, the officers of Newco shall become the officers of the Surviving
Corporation until their successors shall have been duly elected, appointed or
qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the certificate of incorporation and the by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation.

     1.7 POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE STRUCTURES. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, prior to the Effective Time, Parent or
Newco shall be entitled to revise the structure of the Merger, the Bank
Combination or the Conversion, provided that (i) there are no adverse federal or
state income tax consequences to Company stockholders as a result of the
modification; (ii) the consideration to be paid to the holders of Company Common
Stock (as defined below) under this Agreement is not thereby changed in kind or
value or reduced in amount as a result of such change in structure and, in the
case of any revision to the structure of the Conversion, the pro forma
capitalization of Newco (or the corporation issuing its capital stock to Company
shareholders giving effect to such revision) shall not be materially different
than that contemplated by the Plan of Conversion); and (iii) such modification
will not materially delay or jeopardize receipt of any required regulatory
approvals or other consents and approvals relating to the consummation of the
Merger. Each of the parties hereto agree to appropriately amend this Agreement
and any related documents in order to reflect any such revised structure.

     1.8 THE CONVERSION. Contemporaneous with the adoption of this Agreement,
the Board of Directors of MHC is adopting the Plan of Conversion to convert into
the capital stock form of organization. Newco is being organized to become the
parent of SBU Bank and to offer for sale shares of common stock to the
Participants (as defined in the Plan of Conversion) in the Conversion, based on
the Independent Valuation (as defined in Section 8.3). The price per share of
the shares of common stock, par value $.0001 per share, of Newco (the "NEWCO
COMMON STOCK") to be issued in the Conversion is referred to as the "CONVERSION
PRICE PER SHARE." The Conversion Price Per Share is expected to be $10.00. The
shares of Newco Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger may be
either shares unsubscribed for in the Conversion subscription or community
offerings, or to the extent such shares are unavailable, authorized but unissued
shares of Newco Common Stock, which shares shall be issued immediately following
completion of the Conversion.

                                   ARTICLE II
                    EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK
                        OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS;
                            EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

     2.1 EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof:

       (a)      CANCELLATION OF TREASURY STOCK; CONVERSION OF SHARE OWNED BY
SUBSIDIARIES. Each share of Company capital stock (including the Company Common
Stock) that is owned by Company (other than shares held in a fiduciary or agency
capacity or in satisfaction of debts previously contracted) or by Newco shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. Each share of Company
Common Stock that is owned by any Subsidiary (as defined in Section 8.3) of
Company or Newco shall be converted into a number of shares of Newco Common
Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (as defined in Section 2.1(b)(ii)).

       (b) CONVERSION OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK. Subject to the provisions of this
Article II, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares cancelled and retired
or converted pursuant to Section 2.1(a), and other than Dissenting Shares (as
defined in Section 2.6)) shall be converted, at the election of the


                                      -3-
<PAGE>


holder thereof, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.4 and
subject to Sections 2.2 and 2.5, into the right to receive the following,
without interest:

          (i) for each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an
election to receive cash has been effectively made and not revoked or lost,
pursuant to Section 2.4 (a "CASH ELECTION" and collectively, the "CASH ELECTION
SHARES"), the right to receive in cash from Newco, without interest, the amount
of $36.00 (the "CASH CONSIDERATION");

          (ii) for each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an
election to receive Newco Common Stock has been effectively made and not revoked
or lost, pursuant to Section 2.4 (a "STOCK ELECTION" and collectively, the
"STOCK ELECTION SHARES"), the right to receive from Newco 3.6 shares, or if the
Conversion Price Per Share is not $10.00 then such other number of shares as is
equal to 36 divided by the Conversion Price Per Share (the "EXCHANGE RATIO"), of
Newco Common Stock (the "STOCK CONSIDERATION"); and

          (iii) for each share of Company Common Stock other than shares as to
which a Cash Election or a Stock Election has been effectively made and not
revoked, pursuant to Section 2.4 (collectively, "NON-ELECTION SHARES"), the
right to receive from Newco such Stock Consideration or Cash Consideration, as
determined in accordance with Section 2.2(b). The Cash Consideration and Stock
Consideration are sometimes referred to herein collectively as the "MERGER
CONSIDERATION".

For purposes of this Agreement, references to Company Common Stock shall be
deemed to include, where appropriate, references to the right to receive shares
of Company Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock pursuant to the Rights
Agreement, dated as of May 24, 1999, as amended between Company and American
Stock Transfer & Trust Company ("AST") (the "COMPANY RIGHTS AGREEMENT").

     2.2 PRORATION.

       (a)      Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement,
the total number of shares of Company Common Stock to be converted into Stock
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(b) (the "STOCK CONVERSION NUMBER") shall
be equal (subject to rounding in the discretion of Newco) to the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) .60, it being
understood that all of the other shares of Company Common Stock shall be
converted into Cash Consideration (in each case, excluding shares of Company
Common Stock to be canceled as provided in Section 2.1(a) and Dissenting
Shares); provided, however, that in the event counsel for Newco reasonably
determines that the Merger may not satisfy the continuity of interest
requirements applicable to reorganizations under Section 368(a) of the Code,
Newco shall reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to
receive the Cash Consideration and correspondingly increase the number of shares
of Company Common Stock entitled to receive the Stock Consideration by the
minimum amount necessary to enable the Merger to satisfy such continuity of
interest requirements.

       (b)      Within five business days after the Effective Time (as defined
in Section 1.3), Newco shall cause the Exchange Agent (as defined in Section
2.4) to effect among holders of Company Common Stock the allocation of rights to
receive the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration as follows:

          (i)   If the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock with
respect to which Stock Elections shall have been made (the "STOCK ELECTION
NUMBER") exceeds the Stock Conversion Number, then all Cash Election Shares and
all Non-Election Shares of each holder thereof shall be converted into the right
to receive the Cash Consideration, and Stock Election


                                      -4-
<PAGE>

Shares of each holder thereof will be converted into the right to receive the
Stock Consideration in respect of that number of Stock Election Shares equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Stock Election Shares held
by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Stock Conversion
Number and the denominator of which is the Stock Election Number, with the
remaining number of such holder's Stock Election Shares being converted into the
right to receive the Cash Consideration; and

          (ii) If the Stock Election Number is less than the Stock Conversion
Number (the amount by which the Stock Conversion Number exceeds the Stock
Election Number being referred to herein as the "SHORTFALL NUMBER"), then all
Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration and the Non-Election Shares and Cash Election Shares shall be
treated in the following manner:

             (A) If the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of
Non-Election Shares, then all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Cash Consideration and the Non-Election Shares of each
holder thereof shall convert into the right to receive the Stock Consideration
in respect of that number of Non-Election Shares equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held by such holder by (y)
a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number and the denominator
of which is the total number of Non-Election Shares, with the remaining number
of such holder's Non-Election Shares being converted into the right to receive
the Cash Consideration; or

             (B) If the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election
Shares, then all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive the Stock Consideration and Cash Election Shares of each holder thereof
shall convert into the right to receive the Stock Consideration in respect of
that number of Cash Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(x) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction,
the numerator of which is the amount by which (1) the Shortfall Number exceeds
(2) the total number of Non-Election Shares and the denominator of which is the
total number of Cash Election Shares, with the remaining number of such holder's
Cash Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration.

     2.3 COMPANY STOCK OPTIONS. (a) As of the Effective Time, each Company Stock
Option (as defined in Section 3.1(c)) representing a right to receive Company
Common Stock upon exercise of such Company Stock Option outstanding at the
Effective Time, whether or not exercisable or vested, shall be canceled and
converted into the right to receive from Newco replacement stock options in
accordance with this Section 2.3: At the Effective Time, each Company Stock
Option which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto shall be
converted automatically into an option to purchase shares of Newco Common Stock
in an amount and at an exercise price determined as provided below (and
otherwise subject to the terms of Company's 1996 Long Term Incentive and Capital
Accumulation Plan, as amended, or the Directors' Stock Option Plan, as
applicable, and the stock option agreements granted thereunder (the "COMPANY
OPTION PLANS"));

       (i) The number of shares of Newco Common Stock to be subject to the
option immediately after the Effective Time shall be equal to the product of the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the option immediately
before the Effective Time, multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, provided that any
fractional shares of Newco Common Stock resulting from such multiplication shall
be rounded to the nearest share; and

       (ii) The exercise price per share of Newco Common Stock under the option
immediately after the Effective Time shall be equal to the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock under the option immediately before the Effective
Time divided by the Exchange Ratio, provided that such exercise price shall be
rounded to the nearest cent.



                                      -5-
<PAGE>

The adjustment provided herein shall be and is intended to be effected in a
manner which is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code. The duration and
other terms of the option immediately after the Effective Time shall be the same
as the corresponding terms in effect immediately before the Effective Time,
except that all references to Company or BSB Bank in the Company Stock Plan (and
the corresponding references in the option agreement documenting such option)
shall be deemed to be references to Newco or SBU Bank. Nothing herein shall be
construed as preventing option or warrant holders from exercising the same prior
to the Effective Time in accordance with the terms thereof.

       (b)      Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall take any and all
actions necessary to effectuate this Section 2.3. Parent, Newco or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall take, or shall cause to be taken, the
necessary action to reserve and continue to reserve adequate shares of Newco
Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of any converted options. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent, Newco or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall file, or shall cause to be filed, a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate
forms), with respect to the shares of Newco Common Stock subject to converted
options and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain, or shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause to be maintained, the effectiveness of such
registration statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such converted options remain
outstanding.

     2.4 ELECTION AND EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. Each holder of record of shares of
Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares) ("HOLDER") shall have the
right, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article II, to submit an
election in accordance with the following procedures:

       (a) Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 2.4 (herein called an "ELECTION") (x) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such
Holder desires to make a Stock Election, in which case such Holder shall be
deemed to have made a Stock Election with respect to such shares and a Cash
Election with respect to the balance, or (y) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder desires to
make a Cash Election, in which case such Holder shall be deemed to have made a
Cash Election with respect to such shares and a Stock Election with respect to
the balance.

       (b) Newco shall prepare an election form reasonably acceptable to Company
(the "FORM OF ELECTION") which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Company Stock Certificate(s) (as defined
below) theretofore representing Company Common Stock shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of such certificates to such bank or trust company designated by
Newco and reasonably satisfactory to Company (the "EXCHANGE AGENT"). The
Election Form shall be mailed to Company's stockholders entitled to vote at the
meeting of the stockholders of Company at which the stockholders of Company
consider and vote on this Agreement (the "COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS MEETING") so as
to permit Company's stockholders to exercise their right to make an Election
prior to the Election Deadline (as defined in Section 2.4(d)).

       (c)      Newco shall mail the Form of Election on or about the time that
the Proxy Statement (as defined herein) is mailed to the stockholders of
Company, to such stockholders, and shall use all reasonable efforts to make
available as promptly as possible a Form of Election to any stockholder of
Company who requests such Form of Election following the initial mailing of the
Forms of Election and prior to the Election Deadline. In no event shall the Form
of Election be made available less than 20 business days prior to the Election
Deadline.

       (d)      Any Election shall have been made properly only if the Exchange
Agent shall have received, by 5:00 p.m. local time in the city in which the
principal office of such Exchange Agent


                                      -6-
<PAGE>

is located, on the date of the Election Deadline, a Form of Election properly
completed and signed and accompanied by certificates of the shares of Company
Common Stock (the "COMPANY STOCK CERTIFICATES") to which such Form of Election
relates or by an appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such
certificates, as set forth in such Form of Election, from a member of any
registered national securities exchange or a commercial bank or trust company in
the United States; provided, that such certificates are in fact delivered to the
Exchange Agent by the time required in such guarantee of delivery. Failure to
deliver shares of Company Stock Certificates covered by such a guarantee of
delivery within the time set forth on such guarantee shall be deemed to
invalidate any otherwise properly made Election, unless otherwise determined by
Newco, in its sole discretion. As used herein, "ELECTION DEADLINE" means 5:00
p.m. on the date that, as reasonably determined by Newco, is as close as
possible to the fifth business day prior to date on which the Effective Time
occurs. Company and Newco shall cooperate to issue a press release reasonably
satisfactory to each of them announcing the date of the Election Deadline not
more than 10 business days before, and at least five business days prior to, the
Election Deadline.

       (e)      Any Company stockholder may, at any time prior to the Election
Deadline, change or revoke his, her or its Election by written notice received
by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly
completed and signed, revised Form of Election. If Newco shall determine in its
reasonable discretion that any Election is not properly made with respect to any
shares of Company Common Stock, such Election shall be deemed to be not in
effect, and the shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Election shall,
for purposes hereof, be deemed to be Non-Election Shares, unless a proper
Election is thereafter timely made.

       (f)      Any Company stockholder may, at any time prior to the Election
Deadline, revoke his, her or its Election by written notice received by the
Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to the
Election Deadline of his or her Company Stock Certificate or of the guarantee of
delivery of such certificates previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. All
Elections shall be revoked automatically if the Exchange Agent is notified in
writing by Newco or Company, upon exercise by Newco or Company of its respective
or their mutual rights to terminate this Agreement to the extent provided under
Article VII, that this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Article
VII.

       (g)      If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name a Company Stock Certificate so
surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that such
Company Stock Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other similar Taxes (as defined in Section
3.1(j)(xvii)) required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Company Stock Certificate, or establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is
not payable. The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the twelve-month anniversary
of the Effective Time, Newco) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
Merger Consideration (including cash in lieu of fractional shares of Newco
Common Stock) otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Company Common Stock such amounts as the Exchange Agent or Newco, as the case
may be, is required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law with respect to the making of such payment. To
the extent the amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or Newco, as the
case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of Company Common Stock in
respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or
Newco, as the case may be.

       (h)      After the Effective Time there shall be no further registration
or transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Company Stock Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger


                                      -7-

Consideration in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II.

     (i)    At any time following the twelve-month anniversary of the Effective
Time, Newco shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to Newco
any remaining portion of the Merger Consideration not distributed to Holders of
shares of Company Common Stock that was deposited with the Exchange Agent at the
Effective Time (the "EXCHANGE FUND") (including any interest received with
respect thereto and other income resulting from investments by the Exchange
Agent, as directed by Newco), and Holders shall be entitled to look only to
Newco (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) with
respect to the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Newco Common Stock and any dividends or other distributions with respect to
Newco Common Stock payable upon due surrender of their Company Stock
Certificates, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither Newco nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Holder of a Company
Stock Certificate for Merger Consideration (or dividends or distributions with
respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund in each case delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.

       (j)       In the event any Company Stock Certificates shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Company Stock Certificate(s) to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Newco or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such
Person of a bond in such sum as Newco may reasonably direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect
to such Company Stock Certificate(s), the Exchange Agent will issue the Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificates.

       (k)      No dividends or other distributions with respect to Newco Common
Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to the shares of Newco
Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional
shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to subsection (l) below, and
all such dividends, other distributions and cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Newco Common Stock shall be paid by Newco to the Exchange Agent and shall be
included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender of such Company
Stock Certificate in accordance with subsection (l) below. Subject to the effect
of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, following surrender
of any such Company Stock Certificate there shall be paid to the holder of a
certificate for Newco Common Stock (a "NEWCO STOCK CERTIFICATE") representing
whole shares of Newco Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without
interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with
respect to such whole shares of Newco Common Stock and the amount of any cash
payable in lieu of a fractional share of Newco Common Stock to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to subsection (l), and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date
subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Newco
Common Stock. Newco shall make available to the Exchange Agent cash for these
purposes, if necessary.

       (l)        No Newco Stock Certificates representing fractional shares of
Newco Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Company
Stock Certificates; no dividend or distribution by Newco shall relate to such
fractional share interests; and such fractional share interests will not entitle
the owner thereof to vote or to any rights as a stockholder of Newco. In lieu of
any such fractional shares, each Holder of a Company Stock Certificate who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fractional share interest in exchange
for such Company Stock Certificate shall receive from the Exchange Agent an
amount in cash determined by


                                      -8-
<PAGE>

multiplying the price for which the Newco Common Stock is sold in the Exchange
Offering by the fraction of a share of Newco Common Stock which such Holder
would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(ii) above. No
interest will be paid on the cash that the Holders of such fractional shares
shall be entitled to receive upon such delivery.

       (m)       Newco, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, shall have
the right to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this
Agreement, governing (A) the validity of the Forms of Election and compliance by
any stockholder of Company with the Election procedures set forth herein, (B)
the manner and extent to which Elections are to be taken into account in making
the determinations prescribed by Section 2.4, (C) the issuance and delivery of
Newco Stock Certificates into which shares of Company Common Stock are converted
in the Merger and (D) the method of payment of cash for shares of Company Common
Stock converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Newco Common Stock where the holder of the
applicable Company Stock Certificate has no right to receive whole shares of
Newco Common Stock.

       (n)        Prior to the Effective Time, Newco will deposit with the
Exchange Agent certificates representing shares of Newco Common Stock sufficient
to pay in a timely manner, and Newco shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely
pay, the aggregate Stock Consideration. In addition, prior to the Effective
Time, Newco shall deposit with the Exchange Agent sufficient cash to permit
prompt payment of the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Newco Common Stock, and Newco shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay
the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Newco Common
Stock where the holder of the applicable Company Stock Certificate has no right
to receive whole shares of Newco Common Stock.

       (o)        As soon as reasonably practicable, and in any case within 10
business days, after the Effective Time, Newco shall cause the Exchange Agent to
mail to each Holder of Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1 and any cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Newco Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor who did not complete an Election Form, (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to Company Stock Certificate(s) shall pass, only upon delivery of
Company Stock Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such
certificates)) (the "LETTER OF TRANSMITTAl") to the Exchange Agent and shall be
substantially in such form and have such other provisions as shall be determined
by Newco and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering Company Stock
Certificate(s) in exchange for the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Newco Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.4(k)
and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.4(j).

       (p)        Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Company Stock
Certificate(s), accompanied by a properly completed Form of Election or a
properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a Holder of Company Common Stock will
be entitled to receive promptly after the Effective Time the Merger
Consideration (elected or deemed elected by the Holder, subject to Sections 2.1
and 2.2) in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by the
Holder's Company Stock Certificate. Until so surrendered, each such Company
Stock Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes,
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Newco Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.4(l)
and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.4(k).

     2.5 CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS. If after the date hereof and on or prior to the
Effective Time the outstanding shares of Newco Common Stock shall be changed
into a different number of shares by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization or combination, stock split, reverse stock split,


                                      -9-
<PAGE>

stock dividend or rights issued in respect of such stock, or any similar event
shall occur (any such event, a "NEWCO ADJUSTMENT EVENT"), the Exchange Ratio
shall be proportionately adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common
Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
Newco Adjustment Event.

     2.6 SHARES OF DISSENTING STOCKHOLDERS. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Company Common Stock that are issued
and outstanding as of the Effective Time and that are held by a stockholder who
has properly exercised appraisal rights under the DGCL (the "DISSENTING SHARES
") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
unless and until the holder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost, the right to dissent from the Merger under the
DGCL and to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with
respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to and subject to the requirements of
the DGCL. If any such holder shall have so failed to perfect or have effectively
withdrawn or lost such right after the Election Deadline, each share of such
holder's Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted
into and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive, without
any interest thereon, the Stock Election Consideration or the Cash Election
Consideration, or a combination thereof, as determined by Newco, in its sole
discretion. Company shall give Newco (i) prompt notice of any notice or demands
for appraisal or payment for shares of Company Common Stock received by Company
and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any such demands or notices. Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Newco, make any payment with respect to, or
settle, offer to settle or otherwise negotiate, any such demands.

                                   ARTICLE III
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     3.1 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY. Except as set forth on the
Disclosure Schedule delivered by Company to the Parent Parties prior to the
execution of this Agreement (the "COMPANY DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE") and making
reference to the particular subsection of this Agreement to which exception is
being taken, Company represents and warrants to the Parent Parties as follows:

       (a) Organization, Standing and Corporate Power.

          (i) Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, is duly registered as a
bank holding company under the BHC Act (as defined in Section 3.1d)), and has
the requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its business as now
being conducted. Company is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed or to be in good standing would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect (as
defined in Section 8.3) on Company. The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws
of Company set forth as exhibits to the Company Filed SEC Documents (as defined
in Section 3.1(g)) are true and complete copies of such documents as of the date
hereof.

          (ii) BSB Bank is duly registered as a New York-chartered commercial
bank and trust company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the State of New York and has the requisite corporate or other
power, as the case may be, and authority to carry on its business as now being
conducted. BSB Bank is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so
qualified, or licensed or to be in good standing


                                      -10-
<PAGE>

would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in
a Material Adverse Effect on BSB Bank. Section 3.1(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule contains a true and complete copy of the Certificate of Organization
and Bylaws of BSB Bank, as currently in effect.

          (iii) Each Subsidiary (as defined in Section 8.3) of Company is a
corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing (with respect to jurisdictions which recognize such concept) under the
laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has the requisite
corporate or other power, as the case may be, and authority to carry on its
business as now being conducted. Each Subsidiary of Company is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for those
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in good
standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect on such Subsidiary.

          (iv) Company has delivered or made available to Newco prior to the
execution of this Agreement complete and correct copies of the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws or other organizational documents, as amended to date,
of Company and all Subsidiaries of Company.

          (v) Except as set forth in Section 3.1(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the minute books of Company, BSB Bank, and each other
Subsidiary of Company (collectively, the "COMPANY PARTIES"), in all material
respects contain accurate records of all meetings and accurately reflect all
other material actions taken by the stockholders of the Company Parties, the
Boards of Directors of the Company Parties and all standing committees of the
Boards of Directors of the Company Parties.

       (b)       SUBSIDIARIES. Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
lists all the Subsidiaries of Company, whether consolidated or unconsolidated,
and sets forth the issued and outstanding securities of each of such
Subsidiaries and its jurisdiction of incorporation. Except as set forth in
Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, all outstanding shares of
capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each such Subsidiary: (i) have
been validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable; (ii) and except for
the preferred interests in BSB Capital Trust, L.L.C., BSB Capital Trust II,
L.L.C. and BSB Capital Trust III, L.L.C. (the "TRUST PREFERRED SUBSIDIARIES"),

claims, liens, charges, encumbrances and security interests of any kind or
nature whatsoever, other than those imposed generally on similar entities under
applicable law (collectively, "LIENS") and other than Company Permitted Liens
(as defined in this Section 3.1(b)); and (iii) other than Company Permitted
Liens, are free of any other material restriction (including any restriction on
the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other
ownership interests) that would prevent the operation by the Surviving
Corporation of such Subsidiary's business as currently conducted. Neither
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any employees located in workplaces, or
any branches, offices or other facilities located outside of the United States.
Other than the Subsidiaries of Company, Company does not own or control,
directly or indirectly, a five percent or greater equity interest in any
corporation, company, association, partnership, joint venture or other entity.
For purposes of this Section 3.1(b) (except as indicated) and elsewhere through
this Agreement: (i) "COMPANY PERMITTED LIENS" shall mean (A) Liens described in
Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule; (B) restrictions on
transferability pursuant to federal and state securities laws; and (C) Liens for
Taxes not yet due. Deposit accounts in BSB Bank are insured by the Federal

present or future services.

         (ii) With respect to each Plan, Company has delivered or made available
to Parent a true, correct and complete copy of each of the following documents:
(A) each Plan, and any amendments thereto (or if the Plan is not a written plan,
a description thereof), (B) the most recent Annual Report (Form 5500 Series) and
accompanying schedule, if any, (C) the most recent Summary Plan Description
(required under ERISA, if any), (D) the most recent annual financial report, if
any; (E) the most recent actuarial report, if any, and (F) the most recent
determination letter from the IRS, if any. Company has delivered or made
available to Parent a true, correct and complete copy of each Employment
Agreement. Except as specifically provided in the foregoing documents delivered
to Parent or as contemplated by the transactions under the Agreement, there are
no amendments to any Plan or Employment Agreement that have been adopted or
approved nor has Company or any of its Subsidiaries undertaken to make any such
amendments or to adopt or approve any new Plan or Employment Agreement. As used
herein, (A) "PLAN" means any Company Plan other than a Multiemployer Plan or a
Multiple Employer Plan (as defined in Section 3.1(k)(x)) and (B) "MULTIEMPLOYER
Plan" means any "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of
ERISA.

         (iii) Section 3.1(k)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies
each Plan that is intended to be a "qualified plan" within the meaning of
Section 401(a) of the Code ("QUALIFIED PLANS"). The Internal Revenue Service has
issued a favorable determination letter with respect to each Qualified Plan and
the related trust that has not been revoked, and to Company's knowledge no
circumstances exist that could adversely affect the qualified status of any
Qualified Plan or the related trust. No trust funding any Plan is intended to
meet the requirements of Code Section 501(c)(9).

         (iv) All contributions required to be made with respect to any Plan by
applicable law or regulation or by any plan document or other contractual
undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies
funding any Plan, for any period through the date hereof have been timely made
or paid in full or, to the extent not required to be made or paid on or before
the date hereof, have been fully reflected on the Company financial statements
to the extent required by GAAP. Each Plan that is an employee welfare benefit
plan under Section 3(1) of ERISA either (A) is funded through an insurance
company contract and is not a "welfare benefit fund" with the meaning of Section
419 of the Code or (B) is unfunded.

         (v) With respect to each Plan, Company and its Subsidiaries have
complied, and are now in compliance, in all material respects, with all
provisions of ERISA, the Code and all laws and regulations applicable to such
Plans, and each Plan has been administered in all material respects in
accordance with its terms. There is not now, nor, to the knowledge of Company,
do any circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected to give rise to,
any requirement for the posting of security with respect to a Plan or the
imposition of any lien on the assets of Company or any of its Subsidiaries under
ERISA or the Code.

         (vi) Except as disclosed in Section 3.1(k)(vi) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, no Plan is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or
Section 412 or 4971 of the Code (a "COMPANY TITLE IV PLAN").

         (vii) With respect to any Company Title IV Plan to which Company or any
trade or business, whether or not incorporated, that together with Company is a
"single employer" within the meaning of Section 4001(b) of ERISA (a "COMPANY
ERISA AFFILIATE") made, or was required to make, contributions on behalf of any
current or former employee or director during the five (5) year period ending on
the last day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the date hereof, (a) no
liability under Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA has been incurred by Company or
any

                                      -22-
<PAGE>

Company ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full, except where
failure to satisfy such liability would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Company, and
(b) to the knowledge of Company, no condition exists that presents a risk to
Company or any Company ERISA Affiliate of incurring any such liability, other
than liability for premiums due to the PBGC (which premiums have been paid when
due), except insofar as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company.

         (viii) The PBGC has not, to the knowledge of Company, instituted
proceedings to terminate any Company Title IV Plan and, to the knowledge of
Company, no condition exists that presents a material risk that such proceedings
will be instituted, except insofar as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company.
No Company Title IV Plan or any trust established thereunder has incurred any
"accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA of Section
412 of the Code), whether or not waived, as of the last day of the most recently
ended fiscal year, except insofar as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company.

         (ix) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of Company, threatened
or anticipated claims by or on behalf of any Plan by any employee or beneficiary
covered under any such Plan, or otherwise involving any such Plan (other than
routine claims for benefits), except for claims which, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect on Company.

         (x) No Company Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a plan that has two or
more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control,
within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a "MULTIPLE EMPLOYER PLAN"). None
of Company and its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates
has, at any time during the last six years, contributed to or been obligated to
contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan. None of Company
and its Subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliates has incurred any Withdrawal
Liability that has not been satisfied in full. As used herein, (A) "ERISA
AFFILIATE" means, with respect to any entity, trade or business, any other
entity, trade or business that is, or was at the relevant time, a member of a
group described in Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or Section
4001(b)(1) of ERISA that includes or included the first entity, trade or
business, or that is, or was at the relevant time, a member of the same
"controlled group" as the first entity, trade or business pursuant to Section
4001(a)(14) of ERISA and (B) "WITHDRAWAL LIABILITY" means liability to a
Multiemployer Plan or a Multiple Employer Plan as a result of a complete or
partial withdrawal from such Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan, as
those terms are defined in Subtitle D and in Part I of Subtitle E of Title IV of
ERISA.

         (xi) There does not now exist, nor, to the knowledge of Company, do any
circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected to result in, any
Controlled Group Liability that would be a material liability of Company or any
of its Subsidiaries following the Closing. As used herein, "CONTROLLED GROUP
LIABILITY" means any and all liabilities (i) under Title IV of ERISA, (ii) under
Section 302 of ERISA, (iii) under Sections 412 and 4971 of the Code, (iv) as a
result of a failure to comply with the continuation coverage requirements of
Section 601 et seq. of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code and (v) under
corresponding or similar provisions of foreign laws or regulations. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates, has engaged in any
transaction described in Section 4069 or Section 4204 or 4212 of ERISA.

         (xii) Except as set forth in Section 3.1(k)(xii) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, Company and its Subsidiaries have no liability for life,
health, medical or other welfare

                                      -23-
<PAGE>

benefits to former employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof, except for
health continuation coverage as required by Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6
of Title I of ERISA and at no expense to Company and its Subsidiaries. Company
and each of its Subsidiaries has reserved the right to amend, terminate or
modify at any time all plans or arrangements providing for retiree health or
life insurance coverage.

         (xiii) Section 3.1(k)(xiii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
forth an accurate list of any Plan or Employment Agreement under which the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby could reasonably be expected to (either along or in
conjunction with any other event) (A) result in, cause the accelerated vesting,
funding or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any payment or
benefit to any Employee, officer or director of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (B) limit the right of Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Plan or
related trust or any Employment Agreement or related trust, or (C) result in any
"excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code that
could become payable by Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

         (xiv) None of Company and its Subsidiaries nor any other person,
including any fiduciary, has engaged in any "prohibited transaction" (as defined
in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA), which could reasonably be
expected to subject any of the Plans or their related trusts, Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any person that Company or any of its Subsidiaries has an
obligation to indemnify, to any material tax or penalty imposed under Section
4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

         (xv) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of Company, threatened
claims (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or
arbitrations which have been asserted or instituted, and, to Company's
knowledge, no set of circumstances exists which may reasonably give rise to a
claim or lawsuit against the Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to
their duties to the Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the
Plans which could reasonably be expected to result in any material liability of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the United States Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation (the "PBGC"), the United States Department of Treasury, the United
States Department of Labor, any Multiemployer Plan, any Plan, any participant in
a Plan or any other party.

         (xvi) Company, its Subsidiaries and each member of their respective
business enterprises have complied in all material respects with the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act and all similar state, local and
foreign laws.

         (xvii) Each individual who renders services to Company or any of its
Subsidiaries who is classified by Company or such Subsidiary, as applicable, as
having the status of an independent contractor or other non-employee status for
any purpose (including for purposes of taxation and tax reporting and under
Company Plans) is properly so characterized.

         (xviii) With respect to each Company Plan that is a Multiple Employer
Plan, (i) none of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates, has received any notification, nor has any
knowledge, that if Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates were to experience a withdrawal or partial withdrawal from such
plan, it would incur Withdrawal Liability that would be reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Company; and (ii) none of Company and its
Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has received any
notification, nor has any knowledge, that any such Company Plan is in
reorganization, has been terminated, is insolvent, or may reasonably be expected
to be in reorganization, to be insolvent, or to be terminated.

the knowledge of the Company, threatened against Company or any Subsidiary of
Company. There is no unfair labor practice or labor arbitration proceeding

Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all applicable laws
respecting employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of
employment and wages and hours, and are not engaged in any unfair labor

duties in any loan in which it acts as the lead lender or servicer and has
complied in all material respects with its duties as required under applicable
regulatory requirements.

         (iv) Company and each Subsidiary of Company have properly perfected or

interests in any material collateral securing any material loans made by it.

         (v) There is no material pending or threatened cancellation or

      (y) REAL PROPERTY.

         (i) Section 3.1(y)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
list of all real property owned by each of Company and its Subsidiaries (the
"OWNED PROPERTIES"), other than the Owned Properties identified in the Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2002 filed by Company with the SEC on March 28,
2003. Each of Company and its Subsidiaries has good title free and clear of all
Liens to all Owned Properties, except for Company Permitted Liens.

         (ii) Section 3.1(y)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
list of each agreement pursuant to which Company or any of its Subsidiaries
leases any real property (such agreements, together with any amendments,
modifications and other supplements thereto, collectively, the "LEASES"), other
than the Leases for which the subject property is identified in the Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2002 filed by Company with the SEC on March 28,
2003. A true and complete copy of each Lease has heretofore been made available
to Newco. Each Lease is valid, binding and enforceable against Company or its
applicable Subsidiary in accordance with its terms and is in full force and
effect, except that (x) such enforceability may be subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect
affecting creditors' rights generally and (y) the availability of the remedy of
specific performance or injunction or other forms of equitable relief may be
subject to equitable defenses and would be subject to the discretion of the
court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought. There are no defaults
by Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, under any of the Leases,
which, in the aggregate, would result in the termination of such Leases and a
Material Adverse Effect on Company. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not cause defaults under the Leases, except
for any such default that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect on Company.

         (iii) The Owned Properties and the properties leased pursuant to the
Leases (the "LEASED PROPERTIES") constitute all of the real estate on which
Company and its Subsidiaries maintain their facilities or conduct their business
as of the date of this Agreement, except for locations the loss of which would
not constitute a Material Adverse Effect on Company. The Owned Properties and
the Leased Properties are in compliance with all laws, except where
non-compliance would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Company. Neither any
agreement relating to the Owned Properties nor any of the Leases requires
consent of any third party for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby except for (i) such consents which will be obtained prior to Closing and
are listed in Section 3.1(y)(iii) to the Company Disclosure Schedule or (ii)
such consents the failure of which to obtain would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on
Company.

         (iv) A true and complete copy of each agreement pursuant to which
Company or any of its Subsidiaries leases real property to a third party (such
agreements, together with any amendments, modifications and other supplements
thereto, collectively, the "THIRD PARTY LEASES") has heretofore been made
available to Newco. Each Third Party Lease is valid, binding and enforceable in
accordance with its terms and is in full force and effect, except that (x) such
enforceability may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other
similar laws now or hereafter in effect affecting creditors' rights generally
and (y) the availability of the remedy of specific performance or injunction or
other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and would
be subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor
may be brought. To the knowledge of Company, there are no existing defaults by
the tenant under any Third Party Lease, which, in the aggregate, would result in
the termination of such Third Party Leases except for any such default that
would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on
Company. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement


                                      -30-
<PAGE>


will not cause defaults under the Third Party Leases, except for any such
default which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on Company.

      (z) ADMINISTRATION OF ACCOUNTS. Company and each of its
Subsidiaries has properly administered all accounts for which it acts as a
fiduciary or agent, including but not limited to accounts for which it serves as
a trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator or
investment advisor, in accordance with the terms of the governing documents and
applicable state and federal law and regulation and common law, except where the
failure to do so would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Company. Neither Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their directors, officers, agents or
Employees, has committed any breach of trust with respect to any such fiduciary
or agency account, and the accountings for each such fiduciary or agency account
are true and correct and accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary or
agency account, except for such breaches and failures to be true, correct and
accurate which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Company.

      (aa) INTERNAL CONTROLS. None of Company or its Subsidiaries'
records, systems, controls, data or information are recorded, stored,
maintained, operated or otherwise wholly or partly dependent on or held by any
means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) which (including all means of access thereto and therefrom)
are not under the exclusive ownership and direct control of it or its
Subsidiaries or accountants except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a materially adverse effect on
the system of internal accounting controls described in the next sentence.
Company and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.

      (bb) RESERVES FOR LOSSES. All reserves or other allowances for
possible losses reflected in Company's financial statements referred to in
Section 3.1(e) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2002 and the quarter
ended September 30, 2003, as of the dates of such financial statements complied
with the standards established by applicable Governmental Entities and were
adequate under GAAP. Neither Company nor BSB Bank has been notified by the
Federal Reserve, NYSBD, the FDIC or Company's independent auditor, in writing or
otherwise, that such reserves are inadequate or that the practices and policies
of Company or BSB Bank, as the case may be, in establishing its reserves for the
year ended December 31, 2002 and the quarter ended September 30, 2003, and in
accounting for delinquent and classified assets generally fail to comply with
applicable accounting or regulatory requirements, or that the Federal Reserve,
NYSBD, the FDIC or Company's independent auditor believes such reserves to be
inadequate or inconsistent with the historical loss experience of Company.
Company has previously furnished Newco with a complete list of all extensions of
credit and other real estate owned ("OREO") that have been classified by any
bank or trust examiner (regulatory or internal) as other loans specially
mentioned, special mention, substandard, doubtful, loss, classified or
criticized, credit risk assets, concerned loans or words of similar import.
Company agrees to update such list at the request of Parent (but no more
frequently than monthly) after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of
the Closing Date or the date that this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with its terms. All OREO held by Company is being carried net of reserves at the
lower of cost or net realizable value.

      (cc) RIGHTS AGREEMENT. The Board of Directors of Company
has taken such action as is necessary to render the Series A junior
participating preferred stock purchase rights of Company under the Company
Rights Agreement inapplicable to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

      (d) PARENT DOCUMENTS; UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES.

supplemented by a subsequent Parent Filed SEC Document (as defined in Section
3.2 (l)), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, and no Parent SEC Document filed subsequent to the date hereof
will contain as of its date, any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to

after the date hereof in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries subject to reporting under Section 13
or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act makes any representation or warranty with

         (ii) The financial statements of Parent and its consolidated

complied as to form, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted
by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in
all material respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject in the
case of unaudited statements, to the absence of footnotes and to recurring
year-end audit adjustments normal in nature and amount).

         (iii) Except (A) as reflected in Parent's unaudited balance sheet as of
November 30, 2003 or liabilities described in any notes thereto (or liabilities
for which neither accrual nor footnote disclosure is required pursuant to GAAP)
or (B) for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice since November 30, 2003 or in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a

whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise.

         (iv) The Parent Parties' books and records fairly reflect in all

bound. Such books and records have been properly kept and maintained and are in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable legal and accounting
requirements.

      (e) INFORMATION SUPPLIED. None of the information supplied or to

the Securities Act and through the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except that

<PAGE>


      (g) VOTING REQUIREMENTS. The affirmative vote of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding and entitled to
vote with respect to this Agreement and the Conversion is the only vote of the
holders of any class or series of Parent's capital stock necessary to approve
and adopt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger.

      (h) OPINIONS OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR. Parent has received the written
opinion of SOP dated the date hereof, to the effect that, as of such date, the
Merger Consideration is fair from a financial point of view to the stockholders
of Parent (the "SOP OPINION") and SOP has consented to the inclusion of the SOP
Fairness Opinion in the Form S-4.

      (i) TAX MATTERS. For purposes of this Section 3.2(i) any reference
to Parent, SBU Bank or the Parent Parties shall be deemed to include a reference
to such persons' predecessors, except where inconsistent with the language of
this Section 3.2(i).

         (i) As of the date hereof, none of the Parent Parties have taken or
agreed to take any action, have failed to take any action or know of any fact,
agreement, plan or other circumstance that could reasonably be expected to
prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

         (ii) Each of Parent and SBU Bank has (A) timely filed (or there have
been timely filed on Parent's or SBU Bank's behalf) with the appropriate
Governmental Entities all income and other material Tax Returns required to be
filed by Parent or SBU Bank (giving effect to all extensions), all of which are
true, correct and complete in all material respects; (B) timely paid in full (or
there has been timely paid in full on its behalf) all material Taxes required to
be paid by it and (C) made adequate provision in accordance with GAAP in all
material respects (or adequate provision in accordance with GAAP in all material
respects has been made on its behalf) for all accrued Taxes not yet due. The
accruals and reserves for Taxes reflected in Parent's audited consolidated
balance sheet as of December 31, 2002 (and the notes thereto) and the most
recent quarterly financial statements (and the notes thereto) are adequate in
accordance with GAAP in all material respects to cover all Taxes accrued or
accruable through the date thereof.

         (iii) Neither Parent nor SBU Bank has received any written notice of
deficiency or assessment from any Governmental Entity for any material amount of
Tax that has not been fully settled or satisfied.

         (iv) Neither Parent nor SBU Bank has been a party to a "listed
transaction" or other "reportable transaction" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations section 1.6011-4(b)(2).

         (j) COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS.

         (i) Section 3.2(j) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true
and complete listing of all states in which the Parent Parties
are licensed to conduct business. To the knowledge of Parent, each of the Parent
Parties and their respective employees hold all material permits, licenses,
variances, authorizations, exemptions, orders, registrations and approvals of
all Governmental Entities (the "PARENT PERMITS") that are required for the
operation of the respective businesses of the Parent Parties as presently
conducted. To the knowledge of Parent, each of the Parent Parties is, and for
the last five years has been, in compliance with the terms of such Parent
Permits and all such Parent Permits are in full force and effect and no
suspension, modification or revocation of any such Parent Permit is pending or,
to the knowledge of Parent, threatened nor, to the knowledge of Parent, do
grounds exist for any such action, except where non-compliance or such
suspension, modification or revocation would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be

                                      -36-
<PAGE>


expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on any Parent Party.

         (ii) Except where failure to comply would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on any
Parent Party, to the knowledge of Parent, each of the Parent Parties is, and for
the last five years has been, in compliance with all applicable statutes, laws,
regulations, ordinances, permits, rules, judgments, orders, decrees or
arbitration awards of any Governmental Entity applicable to such Parent Party.

         (iii) None of the Parent Parties is subject to any outstanding order,
injunction or decree or is a party to any written agreement, consent agreement
or memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter or
similar undertaking to, or is subject to any written (or, to the knowledge of
Parent, unwritten) order or directive by, or is a recipient of any supervisory
letter from or has adopted any resolutions at the request of (in each case other
than orders, directives, supervisory letters and the like of general
application) any Governmental Entity that restricts in any respect the conduct
of its business or, that in any manner currently relates to its capital
adequacy, its policies, its management or its business (each, a "PARENT
REGULATORY AGREEMENT"), nor has any Parent Party or its respective Subsidiaries
or Affiliates (A) to its knowledge, been advised since January 1, 2001 by any
Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing or requesting any Parent
Regulatory Agreement or (B) had knowledge of any pending or threatened
investigation by any Governmental Entity. None of the Parent Parties are in
breach or default under any Parent Regulatory Agreement in any material respect.
Prior to the date hereof, the Parent Parties have made available to Company true
and complete copies of all Parent Regulatory Agreements.

         (iv) Except for filings with the SEC, which are the subject of Section
3.2(d), since January 1, 2001, each of the Parent Parties has timely filed all
regulatory reports, schedules, forms, registrations and other documents,
together with any amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that they
were required to file with any Governmental Entity (the "OTHER PARENT
DOCUMENTS"), and have timely paid all fees and assessments due and payable in
connection therewith, except where the failure to make such payments and filings
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in
a Material Adverse Effect on any such Parent Party. There is no material
unresolved violation or exception by any of such Governmental Entities with
respect to any report or statement relating to any examinations of any of the
Parent Parties. Parent has delivered or made available to Company a true and
complete copy of each material Other Parent Document requested by Company.

         (v) None of the Parent Parties, nor any of their respective directors,
officers or Employees has been the subject of any disciplinary proceedings or
orders of any Governmental Entity arising under applicable laws or regulations
which would be required to be disclosed in any Other Parent Document except as
disclosed therein, and no such disciplinary proceeding or order is pending, nor
to the knowledge of Parent threatened, except where non-disclosure, or such
preceding or order, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

         (vi) SBU Bank is "well-capitalized" and "well managed" under applicable
regulatory definitions, and its examination rating under the Community
Reinvestment Act of 1977 is "satisfactory."

         (vii) Neither Parent or any of its Affiliates, nor, to the knowledge of
Parent, any "affiliated person" (as defined in the Investment Company Act) of
Parent or any of its Affiliates, is ineligible pursuant to Section 9(a) or 9(b)
of the Investment Company Act of 1940 to act as, or subject to any
disqualification which would form a reasonable basis for any denial, suspension
or revocation of the registration of or licenses or for any limitation on the
activities of Parent or any


                                      -37-
<PAGE>


of its Affiliates as, an investment advisor (or in any other capacity
contemplated by said Act) to a registered investment company. Neither Parent nor
any of its Affiliates, nor to the knowledge of Parent, any "associated person of
a broker or dealer" (as defined in the Exchange Act) of Company or any of its
Affiliates, is ineligible pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act to act
as a broker-dealer or as an associated person to a registered broker-dealer or
is subject to a "statutory disqualification" as defined in Section 3(a)(39) of
the Exchange Act or otherwise ineligible to serve as a broker-dealer or as an
associated person to a registered broker-dealer.

         (viii) The business and operations of Parent and of each of the Parent
Parties through which Parent conducts its finance activities have been conducted
in compliance with all applicable Finance Laws, and have complied with all
applicable collection practices in seeking payment under any loan or credit
extension of such Parent Parties, except in each case where non-compliance would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent. In addition, there is no pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent, threatened charge by any Governmental Entity that any of
the Parent Parties has violated any applicable Finance Laws, except insofar as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in
a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

         (ix) Since January 1, 2001, none of the Parent Parties, nor to the
knowledge of any other Person acting on behalf of any Parent Party that
qualifies as a "financial institution" under the U.S. Anti-Money Laundering
laws, has knowingly acted, by itself or in conjunction with another, in any act
in connection with the concealment of any Unlawful Gains, nor knowingly
accepted, transported, stored, dealt in or brokered any sale, purchase or any
transaction of other nature for Unlawful Gains except insofar as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect on any Parent Party. Each of the Parent Parties that qualifies as
a "financial institution" under the U.S. Anti-Money Laundering laws has, during
the past three years, implemented such anti-money laundry mechanisms and kept
and filed all material reports and other necessary material documents as
required by, and otherwise complied with, the U.S. Anti-Money Laundering laws
and the rules and regulations issued thereunder, except insofar as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect on any such Parent Party.

      (k) LITIGATION. Except as set forth in Section 3.2(k) of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, which contains a true and current (as of the date hereof)
list of any pending and, to Parent's knowledge, threatened litigation, action,
suit, proceeding, investigation or arbitration, no action, demand, charge,
requirement or investigation by any Governmental Entity and no litigation,
action, suit, proceeding, investigation or arbitration by any Person or
Governmental Entity, in each case with respect to any of the Parent Parties or
any of their respective properties or Permits, is pending or, to the knowledge
of any Parent Party, threatened, except insofar as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on any
such Parent Party.

      (l) ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS. Except for liabilities
incurred in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated

Schedule, or as disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents filed and publicly
available prior to the date hereof ("PARENT FILED SEC DOCUMENTS"), since
December 31 2002, the Parent Parties have conducted their respective businesses,
in all material respects, only in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice and (1) with respect to subsections (i), (iii), (iv), (v),
(vi) and (vii) (in the case of subsection (vii), as it pertains to subsection
(ii)) below, since December 31, 2002, and (2) with respect to subsections (ii)
and (vii) (in the case of subsection (vii), as it pertains to such other
subsections) below, from September 30, 2003 to the date hereof, there has not
been:

         (i) any Material Adverse Change in Parent,

         (ii) any issuance of stock options to acquire shares of Parent Common
Stock ("PARENT STOCK OPTIONS") or restricted shares of Parent Common Stock, or
any other equity-based award, to any directors, officers, Employees or

vesting schedule, as applicable, for issuances thereto since December 31, 2002),

         (iii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or

the capital stock of the Parent Parties, other than regular quarterly cash
dividends not in excess of $0.10 per share on Parent Common Stock, and other
than dividends paid by any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent to Parent or any
other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent,

         (iv) any split, combination or reclassification of any of Parent's
capital stock, or any issuance or the authorization of any issuance of any other
securities in respect of, in lieu of or in substitution for shares of Parent's
capital stock, except for issuances of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Parent
Stock Plans or upon the exercise of Parent Stock Options awarded prior to the
date hereof in accordance with their present terms,

         (v) other than as described in Parent Filed SEC Documents, any change
in any material respect in accounting methods, principles or practices by Parent
affecting its assets, liabilities or business, including any reserving, renewal
or residual method, or estimate of practice or policy, other than changes after
the date hereof to the extent required by a change in GAAP or regulatory
accounting principles,

         (vi) any material change in investment policies, or

         (vii) any agreement or commitment (contingent or otherwise) to do any
of the foregoing.

      (m) INTERNAL CONTROLS. None of the Parent or SBU Bank records, systems,
controls, data or information are recorded, stored, maintained, operated or
otherwise wholly or partly dependent on or held by any means (including any
electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not)
which (including all means of access thereto and therefrom) are not under the
exclusive ownership and direct control of it or its accountants except as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect on the system of internal accounting controls described
in the next sentence. Each of the Parent and SBU Bank has devised and maintain a
system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.

        (n) Employee Benefit Plans.

         (i) For purposes of this Section 3.2(n), "PARENT PLANS" shall mean
Parent's deferred compensation and each bonus or other incentive compensation,
stock purchase, stock option and other equity compensation plan, program or
arrangement; each severance or termination pay, medical, surgical,
hospitalization, life insurance and other "welfare" plan, fund or program
(within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA; each profit-sharing, stock bonus
or other "pension" plan, fund or program (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of
ERISA); each employment, termination or severance agreement or arrangement with
any director or former director of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any
employee or executive officer thereof and each other material employee benefit
plan, fund or program, or arrangement applicable to current and former
directors, executive officers or employees or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
in each case that is sponsored, maintained or contributed to or required to be
contributed to by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or to which Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party for, the benefit of any current or former
employee, executive officer or director of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries;
each Parent Plan that is subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section
412 of the Code, being the "PARENT TITLE IV PLANS".

         (ii) All contributions required to have been made with respect to any
Parent Plan have been paid when due, except insofar as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent.

         (iii) Each Parent Plan has been operated and administered in accordance
with its terms and applicable law, including but not limited to ERISA and the
Code, except insofar as the failure to do so would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent.

         (iv) The IRS has issued a favorable determination letter with respect
to each Parent Plan intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section
401(a) of the Code that has not been revoked, and, to the knowledge of Parent,
no circumstances exist that could adversely affect the qualified status of any
such plan and the exemption under Section 501(a) of the Code of the trust
maintained thereunder. Each Parent Plan intended to satisfy the requirements of
Section 510(c)(9) of the Code has satisfied such requirements in all material
respects.

         (v) With respect to any Parent Title IV Plan to which Parent or any
trade or business, whether or not incorporated, that together with Parent is a
"single employer" within the meaning of Section 4001(b) of ERISA (a "PARENT
ERISA AFFILIATE") made, or was required to make, contributions on behalf of any
current or former employee or director during the five (5) year period ending on
the last day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the date hereof, (a) no
liability under Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA has been incurred by Parent or
any Parent ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full, except where
failure to satisfy such liability would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, and (b)
to the knowledge of Parent, no condition exists that presents a risk to Parent
or any Parent ERISA Affiliate of incurring any such liability, other than
liability for premiums due to the PBGC (which premiums have been paid when due),
except insofar as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

         (vi) The PBGC has not, to the knowledge of Parent, instituted
proceedings to terminate any Parent Title IV Plan and, to the knowledge of
Parent, no condition exists that presents a material risk that such proceedings
will be instituted, except insofar as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.
No Parent Title IV Plan or any trust established thereunder has incurred any
"accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA of Section
412 of the Code), whether or not

                                      -40-
<PAGE>

waived, as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal year, except
insofar as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

         (vii) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened
or anticipated claims by or on behalf of any Parent Plan by any employee or
beneficiary covered under any such Parent Plan, or otherwise involving any such
Parent Plan (other than routine claims for benefits), except for claims which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in
a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

         (viii) No Parent Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a Multiple Employer
Plan. None of Parent and its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates has, at any time during the last six years, contributed to or been
obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan.
None of Parent and its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates
has incurred any Withdrawal Liability that has not been satisfied in full.

         (ix) There does not now exist, nor, to the knowledge of Parent, do any
circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected to result in, any
Controlled Group Liability that would be a liability of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries following the Closing. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates, has engaged in any transaction described in Section
4069 or Section 4204 or 4212 of ERISA.

         (x) Section 3.2(n)(x) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule sets forth an
accurate list of any Parent Plan under which the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby could
reasonably be expected to (either along or in conjunction with any other event)
(A) result in, cause the accelerated vesting, funding or delivery of, or
increase the amount or value of, any payment or benefit to any employee, officer
or director of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or (B) limit the right of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a
reversion of assets from any Parent Plan or related trust.

      (o) LABOR MATTERS. There are no labor or collective bargaining
agreements to which any Parent Party is a party. To the knowledge of Parent,
there is no union organizing effort pending or threatened against any Parent
Party. There is no labor strike, labor dispute (other than routine Employee
grievances that are not related to union Employees), work slowdown, stoppage or
lockout pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against any Parent
Party. There is no unfair labor practice or labor arbitration proceeding pending
or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against any Parent Party (other than
routine Employee grievances that are not related to union Employees) which
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent. The Parent Parties are in compliance with all
applicable laws respecting employment and employment practices, terms and
conditions of employment and wages and hours, and are not engaged in any unfair
labor practice, except insofar as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

      (p) INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS. Except as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, all Derivative
Transactions entered into by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries were entered into
in accordance with applicable rules, regulations and policies of all regulatory
authorities, and in accordance with the investment, securities, commodities,
risk management and other Policies, Practices and Procedures employed by such
Parent Party, and were entered into with counter-parties believed at the time to
be financially responsible and able to understand (either alone or in
consultation with their advisers) and to bear the risks of such Derivative
Transactions; and each such Parent Party has duly performed their obligations
under the Derivative Transactions to the extent that such obligations to perform
have accrued, and, to such

                                      -41-
<PAGE>

Parent Party's knowledge, there are no material breaches, violations or defaults
or allegations or assertions of such by any party thereunder.

      (q) LOAN PORTFOLIO; SERVICING.

         (i) All loans owned by any of the Parent Parties, or in which any of
the Parent Parties has an interest, comply in all material respects with all
applicable laws, including, but not limited to, applicable usury statutes,
underwriting and recordkeeping requirements and all Finance Laws and other
applicable consumer protection statutes and the regulations thereunder.

         (ii) All loans owned by any of the Parent Parties, or in which any of
the Parent Parties has an interest, have been made or acquired by Parent in
accordance with board of director-approved loan policies. As of the date hereof,
each of the Parent Parties holds mortgages contained in its loan portfolio for
its own benefit to the extent of its interest shown therein; such mortgages
evidence liens having the priority indicated by the terms of such mortgages,
including the associated loan documents, subject, as of the date of recordation
or filing of applicable security instruments, only to such exceptions as are
discussed in attorneys' opinions regarding title or in title insurance policies
in the mortgage files relating to the loans secured by real property or are not
material as to the collectability of such loans; and all loans owned by each of
the Parent Parties are with full recourse to the borrowers, and each of the
Parent Parties has taken no action which would result in a waiver or negation of
any rights or remedies available against the borrower or guarantor, if any, on
any loan. All applicable remedies against all borrowers and guarantors are
enforceable except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or
other similar applicable laws affecting creditors' rights and except as may be
limited by the exercise of judicial discretion in applying principles of equity.
All loans purchased or originated by any of the Parent Parties and subsequently
sold by any of the Parent Parties have been sold without recourse to any of the
Parent Parties and without any liability under any yield maintenance or similar
obligation. True, correct and complete copies of loan delinquency reports as of
September 30, 2003 prepared by each of the Parent Parties, which reports include
all loans delinquent or otherwise in default, have been furnished to Company.
True, correct and complete copies of the currently effective lending policies
and practices of each of the Parent Parties also have been furnished or made
available to Company.

         (iii) Each of the Parent Parties has properly perfected or caused to be
properly perfected all security interests, liens, or other interests in any
material collateral securing any loans made by it.

      (r) ADMINISTRATION OF ACCOUNTS. Each of the Parent Parties has
properly administered all accounts for which it acts as a fiduciary or agent,
including but not limited to accounts for which it serves as a trustee, agent,
custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator or investment advisor,
in accordance with the terms of the governing documents and applicable state and
federal law and regulation and common law, except where the failure to do so
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in
a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. None of the Parent Parties, nor any of
their directors, officers, agents or Employees, has committed any breach of
trust with respect to any such fiduciary or agency account, and the accountings
for each such fiduciary or agency account are true and correct and accurately
reflect the assets of such fiduciary or agency account, except for such breaches
and failures to be true, correct and accurate which would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent.

      (s) RESERVES FOR LOSSES. All reserves or other allowances for possible
losses reflected in Parent's financial statements referred to in Section 3.2(d)
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2002 and the quarter ended September
30, 2003, as of the date of such financial statements, complied with the
standards established by applicable Governmental Entities and were

                                      -42-
<PAGE>

adequate under GAAP. Parent has not been notified by the OTS, the FDIC or
Parent's independent auditor, in writing or otherwise, that such reserves are
inadequate or that the practices and policies of Parent in establishing its
reserves for the year ended December 31, 2002 and the quarter ended September
30, 2003 and in accounting for delinquent and classified assets generally fail
to comply with applicable accounting or regulatory requirements, or that the
OTS, the FDIC or Parent's independent auditor believes such reserves to be
inadequate or inconsistent with the historical loss experience of Parent. Parent
has made available to Company a true and complete list of all extensions of
credit and OREO that have been classified by any bank or trust examiner
(regulatory or internal) as other loans specially mentioned, special mention,
substandard, doubtful, loss, classified or criticized, credit risk assets,
concerned loans or words of similar import. Parent agrees to update such list at
the request of Company (but no less frequently than monthly) after the date of
this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing Date or the date that this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. All OREO held by Parent is
being carried net of reserves at the lower of cost or net realizable value.

      (t) ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY.

         (i) Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries is in material compliance with
all applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to pollution or
protection of the environment (including without limitation, laws and
regulations relating to emissions, discharges, releases and threatened releases
of Hazardous Materials (as hereinafter defined)), or otherwise relating to the
manufacture, processing, distribution, use, treatment, storage, disposal,
transport or handling by each of Parent and its Subsidiaries of Hazardous
Materials;

         (ii) There is no suit, claim, action, proceeding, investigation or
notice pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened (or past or present
actions or events that, to the knowledge of Parent, could form the basis of any
such suit, claim, action, proceeding, investigation or notice), in which Parent
or any Subsidiary of Parent has been or, with respect to threatened suits,
claims, actions, proceedings, investigations or notices may be, named as a
defendant (x) for alleged material noncompliance (including by any predecessor)
with any environmental law, rule or regulation or (y) relating to any material
release or threatened release into the environment of any Hazardous Material,
occurring at or on a site owned, leased or operated by Parent or any Subsidiary
of Parent, or to the knowledge of Parent, relating to any material release or
threatened release into the environment of any Hazardous Material, occurring at
or on a site not owned, leased or operated by Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent;

         (iii) During the period of Parent's or any of its Subsidiaries'
ownership or operation of any of its properties, there has not been any material
release by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of Hazardous Materials in, on,
under or affecting any such property;

         (iv) To the knowledge of Parent, neither Parent nor any Subsidiary of
Parent has made or participated in any loan to any person who is subject to any
suit, claim, action, proceeding, investigation or notice, pending or threatened,
with respect to (i) any alleged material noncompliance as to any property
securing such loan with any environmental law, rule or regulation or (ii) the
release or the threatened release into the environment of any Hazardous Material
at a site owned, leased or operated by such person on any property securing such
loan.

      (u) MERGER CONSIDERATION. Following the completion of the transactions
contemplated by the Plan of Conversion and immediately prior to the Closing,
Newco shall have sufficient immediately available cash on hand to fund the Cash
Consideration and sufficient shares of Newco Common Stock reserved for issuance
to the holders of Company Common Stock to provide the Stock Consideration in
connection with the Merger, collectively to enable the Merger Consideration to
be paid in full in accordance with the terms hereof.

duties to Company's stockholders under applicable law in light of a bona fide

Person pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement consistent with the

(the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT"), (B) participate in discussions and
negotiations with such Person and (C) effect a Change in Company Recommendation

revenues or net income, or that represent 20% or more of the total assets, of
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (y) 20% or more of any class
of equity securities of Company, (B) any tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning 20% or more of any
class of any equity securities of Company, or (C) any merger, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving Company (or any one or more Subsidiaries of Company,

thereof shall (i) withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw,
modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent and Newco, the approval of the
Agreement, the Merger or Company Recommendation (as defined in Section 5.1(d))
or take any action or make any statement in connection with Company Stockholders
Meeting inconsistent with such approval or Company Recommendation (collectively,
a "CHANGE IN THE COMPANY RECOMMENDATION"), or (ii) approve or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve or recommend, or fail to recommend against, any
Company Takeover Proposal.

      (c) In addition to the obligations of Company set forth in

taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making a Change in company
Recommendation or any other disclosure if, in the good faith judgment of the
Board of Directors of Company, after consultation with outside counsel, failure
so to disclose would violate its obligations under applicable law; provided,

deemed to be a Change in Company Recommendation unless the Board of Directors of
Company reaffirms Company Recommendation in such disclosure.

Article VI to the obligation of any Parent Party to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby (other than the delivery of certificates to Newco by
officers of the Company) have been satisfied or, where legally permissible,
waived.

any action which would result in any of the conditions of Article VI not being
satisfied;

Newco and Company shall prepare, and Newco shall file with the SEC, the Form
S-4, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of
Newco and Company shall use all reasonable efforts to have the Form S-4 declared
effective under the Securities Act, and for the Proxy Statement to be cleared
under the Exchange Act, as promptly as practicable after such filing. Without
limiting any other provision hereinabove contained, the Form S-4 and the Proxy
Statement will contain, without limitation, such information and disclosure
reasonably requested by either Newco or Company so that (i) the Form S-4
conforms in both form and substance to the requirements of the Securities Act,
and (ii) the Proxy Statement conforms in both form and substance to the
requirements of the Exchange Act. Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to holders of Company Common Stock as
promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective.

       (b)      If at any time prior to the Effective Time there shall occur (i)
any event with respect to Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or with respect to
other information supplied by Company for inclusion in the Form S-4 or the Proxy
Statement or (ii) any event with respect to Newco, or with respect to
information supplied by Newco for inclusion in the Form S-4 or the Proxy
Statement, in either case, which event is required to be described in an
amendment of, or a supplement to, the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement, such
event shall be so described, and such amendment or supplement shall be promptly
filed with the SEC and, as required by law, disseminated to the stockholders of
Company.

       (c)      Each of Company and Newco shall promptly notify the other of the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any other appropriate
government official and of any requests by the SEC or its staff or any other
appropriate government official for amendments or supplements to any of the
filings with the SEC in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby or for additional information and shall supply the other
with copies of all correspondence between Company or any of its representatives,
or Newco or any of its representatives, as the case may be, on the one hand, and
the SEC or its staff or any other appropriate government official, on the other
hand, with respect thereto. Company and Newco shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to respond to any comments of the SEC with respect to


                                      -51-

<PAGE>

the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable. Company and
Newco shall cooperate with each other and provide to each other all information
necessary in order to prepare the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement, and shall
provide promptly to the other party any information such party may obtain that
could necessitate amending any such document.

       (d)      Company shall, as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is
declared effective under the Securities Act, duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold Company Stockholders Meeting in accordance with the DGCL for the
purpose of obtaining Company Stockholder Approval and subject to Section 4.3,
the Board of Directors of Company shall recommend to Company's stockholders the
approval and adoption of this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby (the "COMPANY RECOMMENDATION"); provided, however, that
Company's Board of Directors shall not be required to make such Company
Recommendation to the extent that it is permitted to effect a Change in Company
Recommendation pursuant to Section 4.3. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to the first sentence of
this Section 5.1(d) shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal,
public disclosure or communication to Company of any Company Takeover Proposal.
Notwithstanding any Change in Company Recommendation, unless otherwise directed
in writing by Newco, this Agreement and the Merger shall be submitted to the
stockholders of Company at Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of
approving the Agreement and the Merger and nothing contained herein shall be
deemed to relieve Company of such obligation, provided, however, that if the
Board of Directors of Company shall have effected a Change in Company
Recommendation in accordance with this Agreement, then in submitting this
Agreement to Company's stockholders, the Board of Directors of Company may
submit this Agreement to Company's stockholders without recommendation (although
the resolutions adopting this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be
rescinded or amended), in which event the Board of Directors of Company may
communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to Company's stockholders
in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the
extent required by law. If required by applicable law or stock exchange
requirements, or if Parent elects in its discretion to submit this Agreement to
its stockholders or Newco stockholders for approval, Parent and/or Newco, as
applicable, shall submit this Agreement to their respective shareholders for
approval at a special meeting to be held as promptly as practicable following
effectiveness of the Form S-4 and on the timing described in Section 5.1(e), and
by approving execution of this Agreement the Board of Directors of Parent agrees
that it shall, at the time any proxy statement soliciting approval of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby is mailed to the stockholders
of Parent, recommend that Parent's stockholders vote for such approval, and it
shall cause the Board of Directors of Newco to recommend that Newco's
stockholder vote for such approval; provided that Parent's determination as to
whether it shall submit this Agreement to its and/or Newco's stockholders for
approval shall be made prior to the initial filing of the Form S-4.

       (e)      Company, Newco and Parent shall coordinate and cooperate with
respect to the timing of their respective stockholders meeting, and shall use
reasonable best efforts to hold each of such meetings within five business days
of each other.

disclose any such information or documents, the Receiving Party agrees to
provide, if practicable, the Disclosing Party with reasonable advance notice
under the circumstances prior to any such disclosure to enable the Disclosing
Party to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. In addition, each
party may, at any time, with advance notice to the other party, make disclosures
of such information and documents as may be required or requested by such
party's applicable regulatory authorities. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, any party to this Agreement (and each employee, representative, or
other agent of such party) may disclose to any and all persons, without
limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions
and all materials of any kind (including opinions and other tax analyses) that
are provided to the party relating to such tax treatment and tax structure.

     5.3 REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS.

       (a)      Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts (subject to,
and in accordance with, applicable law) to take promptly, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective
the Merger and the other


                                      -53-
<PAGE>

transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, in the case of MHC,
Parent and Newco, the Conversion), including (i) obtaining all necessary actions
or non-actions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities and
the making of all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all
steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an
action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) obtaining all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) defending any lawsuits
or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iv) publicly supporting this Agreement and the Merger and (iv)
executing and delivering any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this
Agreement.

       (b)      In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, Company
shall (i) use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that no state takeover
statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this
Agreement or the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby,
and (ii) if any state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation becomes
applicable to this Agreement or the Merger or any other transaction contemplated
hereby, take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize the
effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

       (c)      In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Conversion to occur as
promptly as practicable. In addition, Parent and Company shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts prior to the Effective Time to effect upon
the Effective Time, or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, the
combination (the "BANK COMBINATION") of BSB Bank with SBU Bank, including
causing such banks to enter into a customary plan of bank merger on terms and
conditions reasonably satisfactory to each of the Company and Parent, which
terms and conditions shall not conflict with any of the agreements set forth in
this Agreement (the "BANK MERGER AGREEMENT"), obtaining all necessary actions or
non-actions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities
(including all applicable Bank Regulators(as defined in Section 8.3)) and making
all necessary registrations and filings and taking all steps as may be necessary
to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by,
any Governmental Entity (including all applicable Bank Regulators), with such
Bank Combination to be effective immediately following the Effective Time or at
such later time as Parent may determine.

     5.4 RULE 16B-3 ACTIONS. Newco and Company agree that, in order to most
effectively compensate and retain Company Insiders (as defined below) in
connection with the Merger, both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is
desirable that Company Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law in connection with the conversion of shares of Company Common Stock and
Company Stock Options in connection with the Merger, and for that compensatory
and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section 5.4. Prior to the
Effective Time, Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause
any dispositions of Company Common Stock or acquisitions of Newco Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock or Newco
Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by Article I and II
of this Agreement by each Company Insider to be exempt under Section 16(b) under
the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Assuming
that Company delivers to Newco Company Section 16 Information (as defined below)
in a timely fashion prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of
Newco, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term is defined
for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly
thereafter and in any event prior to the Effective Time adopt a resolution
providing in substance that the receipt by Company Insiders (as defined below)
of Newco Common Stock in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant


                                      -54-
<PAGE>

to the transactions contemplated hereby, and to the extent such securities are
listed in Company Section 16 Information, are intended to be exempt from
liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law. "COMPANY SECTION 16 INFORMATION" shall mean
information accurate in all material respects regarding Company Insiders, the
number of shares of Company Common Stock held by each such Company Insider and
expected to be exchanged for Newco Common Stock in the Merger. "COMPANY
INSIDERS" shall mean those officers and directors of Company who are subject to
the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
Company and, in with respect to the foregoing obligations of Newco, who are
listed in Company Section 16 Information and who will be subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, immediately
following the Effective Time, with respect to Newco.

     5.5 INDEMNIFICATION AND EXCULPATION.

       (a)      All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities
for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing
in favor of the current or former directors or officers of Company and its
Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or
by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) and any existing
indemnification agreements or arrangements of Company and its Subsidiaries shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms, and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a
period of six years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of such individuals for acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time.

       (b)      In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative,
including any such claim, action suit, proceeding or investigation in which any
individual who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this
Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES"), is, or is
threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole
or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that such individual is or was
a director, officer or employee of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective predecessors or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the
Effective Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their best efforts
to defend against and respond thereto.

       (c)      Newco shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Indemnified Parties to be covered for a period of three years after the
Effective Time by the directors' and officers' liability insurance policy
currently maintained by Company, provided that Newco may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions that are not less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than such
policy, with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time
that were committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as such.

       (d)      The provisions of this Section 5.5 shall survive the Effective
Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each Indemnified Party and other Person named herein and his or her heirs and
representatives.

     5.6 FEES AND EXPENSES. Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.2, all
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, this Agreement, and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated,
except that the filing and other fees paid to the SEC in connection with this
Agreement and printing fees in connection with the Proxy Statement and the Form
S-4 shall be borne by Newco.

and concur with and use reasonable efforts to agree on, any press release or
other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as either
party may in good faith determine is required by applicable law, court process

other the reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of any
stockholder litigation against Company or Parent, as applicable, and its

however, that this Section 5.10 will not require any party to take any action
that would reasonably be expected to violate any law or result in the loss of
the attorney-client or other material privilege.

party and which relates to the confidentiality of information regarding Company
or its Subsidiaries or which relates to securities of Company, other than client

ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. During such period,
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to enforce, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law, the provisions of any such agreement, including
by using reasonable best efforts to obtain injunctions to prevent any breaches
of such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof
in any court having jurisdiction.

       (a)      Following the Closing, Newco shall use its reasonable best
efforts to ensure that qualified branch-level employees of Company who are
employed by Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time will remain
employed in a comparable position on and immediately following the Closing Date;
provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to be a

right of employment or any right under any specific benefit plan, program,
policy or arrangement. All employees of Company who continue employment with
Newco or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time shall be referred to
as "CONTINUING EMPLOYEES".

       (b)      A true and correct copy of Company's severance plan (the
"COMPANY SEVERANCE PLAN") is included in Section 5.12(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. Newco agrees to honor all obligations under the Company
Severance Plan for Continuing Employees (other than Continuing Employees who are
party to an employment agreement with Parent entered into in connection with
this Agreement) whose employment is terminated during the one-year period
following the Effective Time, and the Company Severance Plan shall not be

Continuing Employees will be eligible for the employee benefits and compensation
that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or such Subsidiary of Parent or Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, provides to its employees generally and, except
as otherwise required by this Agreement, on substantially the same terms and
basis as is applicable to such employees, provided that nothing in this
Agreement shall require any duplication of benefits. From and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, give Continuing Employees full credit for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit accruals (other than for purposes of benefit
accruals under any defined benefit pension plan maintained by Parent, the

employee benefit and compensation plans (including the section 401(k) plan
maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation), programs, or arrangements maintained by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
(other than any plan, program or arrangement that is frozen to new participants
as of the date hereof or, prior to January 1, 2005, any employee stock ownership

Subsidiaries to, waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions
and waiting periods with respect to

<PAGE>

participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees
under any welfare plan that such employees may be eligible to participate in

benefits maintained for the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and provide, for the year in which the Effective Time occurs (or
the Continuing Employees' participation commences), credit under any such
welfare plan for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenditures for
the remainder of the coverage period during which any transfer of coverage
occurs to the extent credited by Company or its Subsidiaries for such Continuing
Employees as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (or the Continuing
Employees' participation commences).

       (e)      Parent, Newco and the Surviving Corporation shall honor all
obligations under the employment and change-in-control agreements set forth in
Section 5.12(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, in each case except to the
extent superseded by agreements entered into in connection with entering into
this Agreement. For purposes of all Company plans and employment agreements
containing "change in control" (or any derivation of such term) provisions, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall constitute a change in
control.

     5.13 TAX MATTERS.  Company and the Parent Parties shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code, and shall not take or cause to be taken any actions

three directors and (b) each of the Company Designees shall be nominated for
election and appointed to fill such vacancies; with William Craine being
appointed to serve as the Chairman of the Newco Board of Directors.

conditions set forth in Section 6.1(g) shall not have been satisfied; (y) by
either party pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iv), provided that (1) the basis for
such termination is the failure to receive a Requisite Regulatory Approval with
respect to the Conversion or (2) the reason for the failure to receive a
Requisite Regulatory Approval is not primarily attributable to Company; or (z)
by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(e) based on a breach by a Parent Party of
its obligations under Section 5.3 or Section 5.16, then Parent shall pay to
Company a fee equal to $8,000,000 by wire transfer of same day funds no later
than the third business day after Company shall have delivered a notice of such
termination to Parent. The Parent Parties acknowledge that the agreements
contained in this Section 7.2(c) are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Company
would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Parent fails promptly to
pay the amount(s) due pursuant to this Section 7.2(c), and, in order to obtain
such payment, Company commences a suit which results in a judgment against
Parent for the fee set forth in this Section 7.2(c), Parent shall pay to Company

approval by the stockholders of Company without the further approval of such
stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of all of the parties.

warranties of the other party contained in this Agreement or in any document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) subject to the proviso of Section
7.3, waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements or
conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

                              AFFILIATES AGREEMENT


                  This AFFILIATES AGREEMENT, dated as of December __, 2003, is
entered into by and between Wicked Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware
corporation ("NEWCO"), and the stockholders of BSB Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("COMPANY"), identified on Schedule I hereto (collectively, the
"STOCKHOLDERS").

                  WHEREAS, Partners Trust Financial Group, Inc., a federal
corporation ("PARENT"), SBU Bank, a federally chartered savings bank and
majority owned subsidiary of Parent ("SBU BANK"), Newco, Partners Trust, MHC
("MHC"), and Company have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as
of December 23, 2003 (the "AGREEMENT"), which is conditioned upon the
execution of this Affiliates Agreement and which provides for, among other
things, the merger of Company with and into Newco, with Newco being the
surviving corporation (the "MERGER"); and

                  WHEREAS, in order to induce Newco to enter into and consummate
the Agreement, each of the Stockholders agrees to, among other things, vote in
favor of the Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
the Agreement in his or her capacity as a stockholder of Company;

                  NOW, THEREFORE in consideration of the premises, the mutual
covenants and agreements set forth herein and other good and valuable
consideration, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties
hereto agree as follows:

         1. Ownership of Company Common Stock. Each Stockholder represents and
warrants, severally as to such Stockholder only and not jointly, that the number
of shares of Company common stock, par value $.01 per share ("COMPANY COMMON
STOCK"), set forth opposite such Stockholder's name on Schedule I hereto is the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock over which such person has
"beneficial ownership" within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except that the provisions of Rule
13d-3(d)(1)(i) shall be considered without any limit as to time.

         2. Agreements of the Stockholders. Each Stockholder covenants and
agrees that:

                  (a) Such Stockholder shall, at any meeting of the holders of
any or all classes or series of Company Common Stock called for the purpose (or
in connection with any action taken by written consent), vote or cause to be
voted all shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which such Stockholder
has voting power (including the power to vote or to direct the voting of)
whether owned as of the date hereof or hereafter acquired (the "SHARES") (i) in
favor of the Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
the Agreement and (ii) against any plan or proposal pursuant to which Company is
to be acquired by or merged with, or pursuant to which Company proposes to sell
all or substantially all of its assets and liabilities to, any person, entity or
group (other than Newco or any affiliate thereof) or any other action that is
inconsistent with the Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, or any other provision of this Affiliates
Agreement, Newco shall have no agreement, arrangement or understanding with any
Stockholder as to directing the voting of any shares of Company Common Stock to
the extent it would result in Newco, individually or with any of their
Affiliates (as defined in the next sentence) or Associates (as defined in the
next sentence) becoming the Beneficial Owner (as defined in the next sentence)
of five percent or more of the Voting Stock (as defined in the next sentence) of
Company. The terms "AFFILIATES", "ASSOCIATES", "BENEFICIAL OWNER", and "VOTING
STOCK" are as defined or referenced in Article 14 of the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company. In determining which, if any, Stockholder with
whom Newco shall have no agreement, arrangement or understanding as to directing
the voting of any shares of Company Common Stock, reference shall


<PAGE>


be made to the Stockholders in order of the amount of Company Common Stock set
forth opposite such Stockholder's name on Schedule I hereto, beginning with the
Stockholder who reports the fewest number of shares, and continuing in ascending
order therefrom.

                  (b) Each Stockholder hereby grants to Newco a proxy to vote
such Stockholder's Shares as indicated Section 2(a) above. Such Stockholder
intends this proxy to be irrevocable and coupled with an interest and will take
such further action or execute such other instruments as may be reasonably
necessary to effect the intent of this proxy. Such Stockholder hereby revokes
any proxy previously granted by him or her with respect to the Shares.

                  (c) Prior to the Effective Time (as defined in the Agreement),
except as otherwise expressly permitted hereby, such Stockholder shall not sell,
pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of his, her or its shares of Company
Common Stock.

                  (d) Such Stockholder shall not in his or her capacity as a
stockholder of Company directly or indirectly encourage or solicit, initiate or
hold discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to, any
person, entity or group (other than Newco or an affiliate thereof) concerning
any merger, sale of all or substantially all of the assets or liabilities not in
the ordinary course of business, sale of shares of capital stock or similar
transaction involving Company or otherwise inconsistent with the Agreement or
the transactions contemplated thereby. Nothing in this document shall impair
such Stockholder's ability to act or omit to act in accordance with such
Stockholder's fiduciary obligations, or to act or omit to act in any manner
permitted by the Agreement, as a director of Company.

                  (e) Such Stockholder shall not, prior to the public release by
Newco of an earnings report to its stockholders covering at least one month of
operations after consummation of the Merger (the "RESTRICTED PERIOD"), sell,
pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of the shares of common stock, par value
$.0001 per share (the "NEWCO COMMON STOCK"), of Newco.

                  (f) Such Stockholder shall comply with all applicable federal
and state securities laws in connection with any sale of Newco Common Stock
received in exchange for Company Common Stock in the Merger, including the
trading and volume limitations as to sales by affiliates contained in Rule 145
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

         3. Successors and Assigns. A Stockholder may sell, pledge, transfer or
otherwise dispose of his or her shares of Company Common Stock only with the
prior written consent of Newco and if the acquirer of such Company Common Stock
agrees in writing to be bound by this Affiliates Agreement.

         4. Termination. The parties agree and intend that this Affiliates
Agreement be a valid and binding agreement enforceable against the parties
hereto and that damages and other remedies at law for the breach of this
Affiliates Agreement are inadequate. This Affiliates Agreement may be terminated
at any time prior to the consummation of the Merger by the written consent of
the parties hereto and shall be automatically terminated in the event that the
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.

         5. Notices. Notices may be provided to Newco and the Stockholders in
the manner specified in the Agreement, with all notices to the Stockholders
being provided to them at the addresses set forth at Schedule I.

         6. Governing Law. This Affiliates Agreement shall be governed by the
laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the principles of
conflicts of laws thereof.

         7. Counterparts. This Affiliates Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same and each of
which shall be deemed an original.

         8. Headings. The Section headings contained herein are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Affiliates Agreement.

         9. Regulatory Approval. If any provision of this Affiliates Agreement
requires the approval of any regulatory authority in order to be enforceable,
then such provision shall not be effective until such approval is obtained;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not affect the enforceability of any
other provision of this Affiliates Agreement.
