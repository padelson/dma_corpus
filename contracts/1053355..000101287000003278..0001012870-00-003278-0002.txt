     This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (this "Agreement") is made and

corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), Chili!Soft,
Inc., a California corporation (the "Company"), Warren J. Packard and [Scot E.

"Securityholder Agents").

                                    RECITALS

     A.   Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to effect a merger (the
"Merger") of Merger Sub with and into the Company in accordance with this
Agreement and the California Corporations Code (the "California Law").  Upon
consummation of the Merger, the Merger Sub will cease to exist, and the Company
will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

     B.   It is intended that the Merger qualify as a tax-free reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code").  For accounting purposes, it is intended that the Merger
be treated as a "purchase."

     C.   The Board of Directors of the Company has (i) determined that the
Merger is consistent with and in furtherance of the long-term strategy of the
Company and fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its
shareholders, (ii) approved this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) determined to unanimously
recommend that the shareholders of the Company adopt and approve the principal
terms of this Agreement and approve the Merger.

     D.   The respective Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub have
approved this Agreement and the Merger.

     E.   Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition
and inducement to Parent's willingness to enter into this Agreement, each of the
shareholders of the Company listed on Schedule 6.17 hereto (including but not
                                      -------------
limited to, the executive officers and directors of the Company and all
shareholders affiliated with those officers and directors) is entering into a
Voting Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the
                                                              ---------
"Voting Agreement").

     F.    Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition
and inducement to Parent's willingness to enter into this Agreement, the
employees of the Company listed on Schedule 6.15 hereto are entering into Non-
                                   -------------
Competition Agreements substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B
                                                                    ---------
(the "Non-Competition Agreements").

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises and
representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration,
intending to be legally bound hereby the parties agree as follows:

acquisition by Parent of all outstanding capital stock of the Company ("Company
Capital Stock") and all outstanding unexpired and unexercised options, warrants
or other rights to acquire or receive shares of Company Capital Stock shall be
referred to herein as the "Aggregate Share Number." The Aggregate Share Number
shall be 1,150,000 shares. No adjustment shall be made in the number of shares
of Parent Common Stock issued in the Merger as a result of any cash proceeds
received by the Company from the date hereof to the Closing Date pursuant to the
exercise of options or warrants to acquire Company Capital Stock. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, as of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the
holder of any shares of Company Capital Stock, the holder of any options,
warrants or other rights to acquire or receive shares of Company Capital Stock,
the following shall occur (which is intended to comply fully with the
liquidation preference provisions set forth in the Articles of Incorporation of
the Company, as amended through the date hereof):

          (a)  Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of common stock of
               ----------------------------------
the Company, no par value per share, ("Company Common Stock") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of
Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(e) and any
"Dissenting Shares" (as defined and to the extent provided in Section 1.7(a))
will be canceled and extinguished and be converted automatically into the right
to receive that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Common
Exchange Ratio (as defined in Section 1.6(c) below) upon surrender of the
certificate representing such share of Company Common Stock in the manner
provided in Section 1.8.

          (b)  Conversion of Company Preferred Stock.
               -------------------------------------

               (i)  Series A Preferred Stock. Each share of Series A Preferred
                    ------------------------
Stock of the Company, no par value per share, ("Series A Preferred") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of
Series A Preferred to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(e) and any Dissenting
Shares (as defined and to the extent provided in Section 1.7(a)) will be
canceled and extinguished and be converted automatically into the right to
receive that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient
computed by dividing (A) the sum of $0.85 (the "Series A Preference Amount")
plus the Per Share Amount (as defined in Section 1.6(c) below), by (B) the
Average Closing Price upon surrender of the certificate representing such share
of Series A Preferred in the manner provided in Section 1.8. In the event that
the aggregate of the Total Preference Amount less the Key Employee Amount
exceeds the amount equal to the Net Consideration, the Series A Preference
Amount shall be reduced proportionately by a number equal to the ratio of (A)
the Net Consideration divided by (B) the Total Preference Amount less the Key
Employee Amount.

              (ii) Series B Preferred Stock. In the event that the fair market
                   ------------------------
value of the Parent Common Stock to be issued on the Closing Date is less than
$43 million, each share of

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

Series B Preferred Stock of the Company, no par value per share, ("Series B
Preferred") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than any shares of Series B Preferred to be canceled pursuant to Section
1.6(e) and any Dissenting Shares (as defined and to the extent provided in
Section 1.7(a)) will be canceled and extinguished and be converted automatically
into the right to receive that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the quotient computed by dividing (A) the sum of $2.42 (the "Series B Preference
Amount") plus the Per Share Amount, by (B) the Average Closing Price upon
surrender of the certificate representing such share of Series B Preferred in
the manner provided in Section 1.8. In the event that the aggregate of the Total
Preference Amount less the Key Employee Amount exceeds the amount equal to the
Net Consideration, the Series B Preference Amount shall be reduced
proportionately by a number equal to the ratio of (A) the Net Consideration
divided by (B) the Total Preference Amount less the Key Employee Amount. If the
Aggregate Share Number multiplied by the fair market value of such Parent Common
Stock is greater than or equal to $43 million, then each share of Series B
Preferred issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than any shares of Series B Preferred to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(e)
and any Dissenting Shares (as defined and to the extent provided in Section
1.7(a)) will be canceled and extinguished and be converted automatically into
the right to receive the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
Common Exchange Ratio (as defined in Section 1.6(c) below).

be issued, delivered or sold any Company Capital Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time; minus (E) any shares of Company Capital Stock issued or issuable

without any conversion thereof.

                                      -5-
<PAGE>

     (f)  Stock Options.  At the Effective Time, all options to purchase Company
          -------------
Common Stock (each a "Company Option") then outstanding (whether or not
exercisable at such time) under the Company's 1997 Stock Option Plan, 1998 Stock
Option Plan and 1999 Stock Option Plan (collectively, the "Option Plan"), a Key
Employee Option (as defined in Section 1.6(i) below) or otherwise, shall remain
outstanding following the Effective Time and shall be assumed by Parent in
accordance with provisions described below.

          (i) Each Company Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement
shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set
forth in the Option Plan and/or as provided in the respective option agreement
governing such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, except
that (A) such Company Option shall be exercisable for that number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of
Company Common Stock that were issuable (in the event of full vesting) upon
exercise of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Common Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole
number of shares of Parent Common Stock and (B) the per share exercise price for
the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company
Option shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price
per share of Company Common Stock at which such Company Option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Common Exchange Ratio, rounded up
to the nearest whole cent.

          (ii) In the case of any Company Option to which Section 421 of the
Code applies by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code
("qualified stock option"), the option price, the number of shares purchasable
pursuant to such assumed Parent Common Stock option and the terms and conditions
of exercise of such assumed Parent Common Stock option shall be determined in
order to comply with Section 424(a) of the Code.

          (iii) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
deliver to the holders of Company Options appropriate notices setting forth such
holders' rights pursuant to the Option Plan, and the agreements evidencing the
grants of such Company Options shall be deemed to be appropriately amended so
that such Company Options shall represent rights to acquire Parent Common Stock
on the same terms and conditions as contained in the outstanding Company Options
(subject to the adjustments required by this Section 1.6(f) after giving effect
to the assumption by Parent as set forth above). Parent shall comply with the
terms of the Company Stock Plan and use commercially reasonable efforts to
ensure, to the extent permitted by the Code and to the extent required by, and
subject to the provisions of, the Option Plan, that Company Options which
qualified as qualified stock options prior to the Effective Time continue to
qualify as qualified stock options of Parent after the Effective Time.

          (iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.6, in
lieu of assuming outstanding Company Options in accordance with this Section
1.6(f), Parent may, at its election, cause such outstanding Company Options to
be replaced by issuing substantially similar replacement stock options in
substitution therefor pursuant to a stock option plan of Parent, which is
substantially similar to the Option Plan.

     (g)  Common Warrants. To the extent the warrant to purchase shares of
          ---------------
Company Common Stock (the "Common Warrants") remain exercisable immediately
prior to the Effective Time, the Common Warrants shall, in connection with the
Merger and pursuant to its terms, be

                                      -6-
<PAGE>

terminated and shall not be assumed by Parent. After the Effective Time, any
unexercised portion of the Common Warrants shall not represent any right to
purchase any Company Capital Stock or any Parent Common Stock.

     (h)  Convertible Debt.  To the extent there is debt of the Company that is
          ----------------
convertible to Capital Stock of the Company (the "Convertible Debt") immediately
prior to the Effective Time, the Convertible Debt shall, in connection with the
Merger, be canceled and will no longer be a debt obligation of the Parent or the
Company. After the Effective Time, any unconverted portion of the Convertible
Debt shall not represent any right to purchase any Company Capital Stock or any
Parent Common Stock.

     (i)  Key Employee Options.  To the extent that each of Bryan Grummon, Rick
          --------------------
Kennewick, Russ Ryan and Chris Hogan are entitled to the payments set forth in
the Retention and Bonus Agreements dated as of January 12, 2000 attached hereto
as Schedule 2.8 (collectively, the "Sale Payment Agreements") pursuant to the
   ------------
terms of such Sale Payment Agreements immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each such person will hold an option to purchase that number of shares of
Company Common Stock equal to the greater of $400,000 or 28,750 shares of Parent
Common Stock multiplied by the Average Closing Price less any applicable
withholding taxes required to be paid in connection therewith (collectively, the
"Key Employee Options"). At the Effective Time, any Key Employee Options
outstanding shall be assumed by the Parent as set forth in Section 1.6(f)
hereof.

     (j)  Capital Stock of Merger Sub.  Each share of common stock of Merger Sub
          ---------------------------
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each stock
certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares shall continue
to evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

     (k)  Adjustments to Exchange Ratios. The Per Share Amount shall be adjusted
          ------------------------------
to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent
Common Stock or Company Capital Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or
other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Capital Stock
occurring after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

     (l)  Fractional Shares. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will
          -----------------
be issued at the Effective Time, but in lieu thereof, each holder of shares of
Company Capital Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share
of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock to be received by such holder) shall be entitled to receive from Parent an
amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i)
such fraction multiplied by (ii) the Average Closing Price.

                                      -7-

     1.7  Dissenters' Rights.
          ------------------

          (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
any shares of Company Capital Stock held by a holder who has demanded and
perfected dissenters' rights for such shares in accordance with Chapter 13 of
the California Law and who, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively
withdrawn or lost such appraisal or dissenters' rights ("Dissenting Shares"),
shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive Parent Common Stock
pursuant to Section 1.6, but the holder thereof shall only be entitled to such
rights as are granted by California Law. From and after the Effective Time, a
holder of Dissenting Shares shall not be entitled to exercise any of the voting
rights or other rights of a shareholder of the Surviving Corporation.

         (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 1.6(a) and (b) hereof,
if any holder of shares of Company Capital Stock who demands appraisal of such
shares under California Law shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure
to perfect or otherwise) the right to appraisal, then, as of the later of the
Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holder's shares shall
automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive Parent
Common Stock and fractional shares as provided in Section 1.6(a) or (b), as the
case may be, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate
representing such shares.

          (c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written
demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Capital Stock, withdrawals of
such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to California Law and
received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
California Law. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, which will not be unreasonably withheld, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal of capital stock of the Company or
offer to settle or settle any such demands.

     1.8  Surrender of Certificates.
          -------------------------

          (a)  Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
               --------------
designate BankBoston, N.A. to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in
the Merger.

          (b)  Parent to Provide Parent Common Stock. No later than one business
               -------------------------------------
day after the Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent
for exchange in accordance with this Article I, the aggregate number of shares
of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.6 in exchange for
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock; provided, however, that, on behalf
                                             --------  -------
of the holders of Company Capital Stock, and pursuant to Article VIII hereof,
Parent shall deposit into an escrow account a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the Escrow Amount out of the aggregate number of shares of Parent
Common Stock otherwise issuable pursuant to Section 1.6. The portion of the
Escrow Amount contributed on behalf of each holder of Company Capital Stock
shall be in proportion to the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock
which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive under Section 1.6 by
virtue of ownership of outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock.

          (c)  Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, the
               -------------------
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each holder of
record of a certificate or certificates (the "Certificates") which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of

                                      -8-
<PAGE>

Company Capital Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive
shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.6, (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as Parent and the Company may agree) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates
representing shares of Parent Common Stock; provided, however, that to the
                                            --------  -------
extent that the number of shares of Parent Common Stock into which the shares of
Company Capital Stock held by a holder of record of a Certificate is
definitively ascertainable following the Closing Date but prior to the Effective
Time, the Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to distribute the letters of transmittal and instructions for
exchange prior to the Effective Time. Upon the later of the Effective Time or
the surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing the number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock (less the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
to be deposited in the Escrow Fund on such holder's behalf pursuant to Article
VIII hereof), plus cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section
1.6, to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.6, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. On the Effective Time,
and subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Article VIII hereof,
Parent shall cause to be distributed to the Escrow Agent (as defined in Article
VIII) a certificate or certificates representing that number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the Escrow Amount which shall be registered in the name of
the Escrow Agent. As set forth in Section 8.2(c)(iii), such shares shall be
beneficially owned by the holders on whose behalf such shares were deposited in
the Escrow Fund and such shares shall be available to compensate Parent as
provided in Article VIII. Until so surrendered, each outstanding Certificate
that, prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of Company Capital Stock
will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes,
other than the payment of dividends, to evidence the ownership of the number of
full shares of Parent Common Stock into which such shares of Company Capital
Stock shall have been so converted and the right to receive an amount in cash in
lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.6.

          (d)  Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or
               ------------------------------------------------
other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to
the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock represented thereby until the holder of record of such Certificate
shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to applicable law, following surrender
of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the
certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange
therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

          (e)  Transfers of Ownership. If any certificate for shares of Parent
               ----------------------
Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition of the
issuance thereof that the certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed
and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or
other taxes required

                                      -9-
<PAGE>

by reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock in
any name other than that of the registered holder of the certificate
surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent
designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

          (f)  No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
               ------------
Section 1.8, none of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or any party
hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock or Company
Capital Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

     1.9  No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock. All shares of
          ----------------------------------------------------
Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Company
Capital Stock in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid in
respect thereof) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares of Company Capital Stock, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of
shares of Company Capital Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article I.

     1.10  Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any certificates
           --------------------------------------
evidencing shares of Company Capital Stock shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof, such shares of Parent Common Stock and cash for fractional
shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 1.6; provided, however,
                                                            --------  -------
that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance
thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to
deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against Parent or the Exchange Agent with respect to the
certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

     1.11  Tax and Accounting Consequences.  It is intended by the parties
           -------------------------------
hereto that the Merger shall (a) constitute a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code (and this Agreement is intended to constitute a
plan of reorganization for purposes of Section 368(a) of the Code) and (b)
qualify for accounting treatment as a "purchase."

     1.12  Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action.  If, at any time after
           ------------------------------------------
the Effective Time, any such further action is necessary or desirable to carry
out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with
full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the officers and directors
of the Company and Merger Sub are fully authorized in the name of their
respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and
necessary action.

        ----------------------------------------------------------------
Agreements.  Each shareholder and optionee of the Company, by virtue of the
----------
Merger and the conversion into Parent Common Stock of the Company Capital Stock
or Company Option held by such shareholder or optionee, as the case may be,
shall be subject to any agreement (the "Parent Lockup Agreements") in effect at
the Effective Time between the Parent or its underwriters and its shareholders
and optionees with respect to such shareholders and optionees agreement not to
sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the shares of Parent Common Stock held by
such persons until the later of May 6, 2000 or such date the Parent Lockup
Agreement shall expire by its terms. In particular, each holder of Company
Capital Stock and Company Options shall execute the form of Parent Lockup
Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit E and be bound by the following provisions:
                             ---------

         (a) Each holder of Company Capital Stock or rights to acquire Company
Capital Stock agrees that, during the period beginning from the Effective Time
and continuing to and including the later of (i) May 5, 2000 or (ii) such later
date as shall also apply to the Company, its officers and directors pursuant to
agreements with the Parent's underwriters in effect at the Effective Time, each
holder of Company Capital Stock or rights to acquire Company Capital Stock will
not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, grant any option to purchase, make
any short sale or otherwise dispose of any shares of Common Stock of the Parent,
or any options or warrants to purchase any shares of Common Stock of the Parent,
or any securities convertible into, exchangeable for or that represent the right
to receive shares of Common Stock of the Parent (other than pursuant to employee
stock purchase plans existing on, or upon the conversion or exchange of
convertible or exchangeable securities outstanding as of, the date of this
Agreement), whether now owned or hereinafter acquired, owned directly by each
holder of Company Capital Stock or rights to acquire Company Capital Stock
(including holding as a custodian) or with respect to which each holder of
Company Capital Stock or rights to acquire Company Capital Stock has beneficial
ownership within the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (collectively the "Shares").

         (b) The foregoing restriction is expressly agreed to preclude each
holder of Company Capital Stock or rights to acquire Company Capital Stock from
engaging in any hedging or other transaction which is designed to or reasonably
expected to lead to or result in a sale or disposition of the Shares even if
such Shares would be disposed of by someone other than each holder of Company
Capital Stock or rights to acquire Company Capital Stock. Such prohibited
hedging or other transactions would include without limitation any short sale or
any purchase, sale or grant of any right (including without limitation any put
or call option) with respect to any of the Shares or with respect to any
security that includes, relates to, or derives any significant part of its value
from such Shares.

         (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each holder of Company Capital Stock
or rights to acquire Company Capital Stock may transfer such Shares of Parent
Common Stock (i) as a bona fide gift or gifts, provided that the donee or donees
thereof agree to be bound by the restrictions set forth herein, (ii) to any
trust for the direct or indirect benefit of each holder of Company Capital Stock
or rights to acquire Company Capital Stock or the immediate family of each
holder of Company Capital Stock or rights to acquire Company Capital Stock,
provided that the trustee of the

                                      -37-
<PAGE>

trust agrees to be bound by the restrictions set forth herein, and provided
further that any such transfer shall not involve a disposition for value, or
(iii) with the prior written consent of Goldman, Sachs & Co. on behalf of the
underwriters. For purposes of this Agreement, "immediate family" shall mean any
relationship by blood, marriage or adoption, not more remote than first cousin.
In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, if each holder of Company Capital
Stock or rights to acquire Company Capital Stock is a corporation, the
corporation may transfer the capital stock of the Parent to any wholly-owned
subsidiary of such corporation; provided, however, that in any such case, it
                                -------- -------
shall be a condition to the transfer that the transferee execute an agreement
stating that the transferee is receiving and holding such capital stock subject
to the provisions of this Agreement and there shall be no further transfer of
such capital stock except in accordance with this Agreement, and provided
further that any such transfer shall not involve a disposition for value. Each
holder of Company Capital Stock or rights to acquire Company Capital Stock now
has, and, except as contemplated by clause (i), (ii), or (iii) above, for the
duration of the restrictions set forth in this Section 4.4 will have, good and
marketable title to such Parent Common Stock, free and clear of all liens,
encumbrances, and claims whatsoever. Each holder of Company Capital Stock or
rights to acquire Company Capital Stock also agrees and consents to the entry of
stop transfer instructions with the Parent's transfer agent and registrar
against the transfer of such shares of Parent Common Stock except in compliance
with the foregoing restrictions.

         (d) Each share of Parent Common Stock issued in connection with the
Merger or upon exercise of a Company Option assumed pursuant to this Agreement
shall bear a legend restricting the transfer of such shares prior to May 6, 2000
or such later date as may be applicable without the prior written consent of
Goldman, Sachs & Co. and the Company.

         (e) Each holder of Company Capital Stock or rights to acquire Company
Capital Stock understands and agrees that the agreements set forth in this
Section 4.4 are irrevocable and shall be binding upon such holder's heirs, legal
representatives, successors, and assigns.

        6.1  Information Statement and Section 3(a)(10) Permit
             -------------------------------------------------

           (a) Preparation of Information Statement. As soon as practicable
               ------------------------------------
after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare, with the
cooperation of Parent, an information statement and form of proxy for the
shareholders of the Company to approve the principal terms of this Agreement and
the Merger (such information statement, together with any amendments thereof or
supplements thereto, in each case in the form or forms mailed to the Company's
shareholders, the "Information Statement"). The Information Statement shall also
constitute a disclosure document for the offer and issuance of the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be received by the holders of Company Capital Stock in

and state securities laws requirements. Each of Parent and the Company agrees to
provide promptly to the other such information concerning its business and
financial statements and affairs as, in the reasonable judgment of the providing
party or its counsel, may be required or appropriate for inclusion in the
Information Statement, or in any amendments or supplements

                                      -42-
<PAGE>

counsel and auditors in the preparation of the Information Statement. The
Company will promptly advise Parent and Parent will promptly advise the Company,
in writing if at any time prior to the Effective Time either the Company or

shares of Parent Common Stock in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of
the Securities Act and to register such shares for resale pursuant to Form S-1
under the Securities Act (as set forth in the Declaration of Registration Rights

                   ---------
necessary, the Company will obtain from its shareholders holding a majority of
the Company Capital Stock their consent to the jurisdiction of the California
Department of Corporations. With regard to any exemptions from the Securities
Act or state securities laws, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts
to identify and obtain the approval of those of its shareholders, who are not
"accredited" within the meaning of Rule 501 promulgated under the Securities
Act, to appoint an accredited investor to act as a "purchasers representative"
as such term is defined in Rule 501 for each such unaccredited stockholder. Such
purchasers representative shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent, and Parent's
consent to the selection of such "purchasers representative" shall not be

attached hereto as Exhibit G (the "Affiliate Agreement"). Pursuant to such
                   ---------
Affiliate Agreements, each of the Company Affiliates will agree to dispose of
any shares of

Securities Act.

            --------------------

request shall be timed so as not to conflict with the Parent's efforts to obtain
the Section 3(a)(10) Permit), the Company shall use its best efforts, in
accordance with California Law and the Company's Articles of Incorporation and
Bylaws, to obtain the approval of the Company's shareholders of the principal
terms of this Agreement and the Merger. The Company shall use its best efforts
to ensure that the shareholder approval is solicited in compliance with

other applicable legal requirements. The Company agrees to use its best efforts
and to take all action necessary or advisable to secure the necessary votes
required by California Law to effect the Merger. Parent, promptly upon request
by the Company, shall make a representative available to shareholders to answer
any questions Company shareholders may have regarding the Parent's business,
management and financial affairs.

(b) all other information concerning the business, properties, and personnel of
the Company as Parent may reasonably request. The Company agrees to provide

internal financial statements promptly upon request. No information or knowledge
obtained in any investigation pursuant to this Section 6.3 shall affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained herein or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger.

            ---------------

this Agreement shall be made by any party hereto (other than disclosures to
Company shareholders pursuant to Section 6.2) unless approved by Parent and the
Company prior to release, provided that such approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld. If any such press release or public announcement is so required, the
party making such disclosure shall consult with the other party prior to making
such disclosure, and the parties shall use all reasonable efforts, acting in
good faith, to agree when a text for such disclosure that is satisfactory to
both parties. The parties have agreed to the text of the joint press release
announcing the signing of this Agreement, attached hereto as Exhibit H, which
                                                             ---------
press release shall be made available to the public as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the execution of this Agreement.

                                 ARTICLE VIII

               SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; ESCROW


        8.1 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All of the Company's
            ------------------------------------------
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement (each as modified by the Company Schedules) shall
survive the Merger and continue until 5:00 p.m., California time, on the date
which is one year following the Closing Date (the "Expiration Date"). The
representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub in this Agreement or in
any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall not survive the
Effective Time or be of any further force and effect thereafter.

        8.2  Escrow Arrangements and Indemnification.
             ---------------------------------------

           (a) Escrow Fund and Indemnification by the Company. At the Effective
               ----------------------------------------------
Time the Company's shareholders will be deemed to have received and deposited
with the Escrow Agent (as defined below) the Escrow Amount (plus any additional
shares as may be issued upon any stock split, stock dividend or recapitalization
effected by Parent after the Effective Time) without any act of any shareholder
pursuant to an Escrow Agreement to be negotiated by the Parent, Company and the
Escrow Agent in a form reasonably satisfactory to them, consistent with this
Article VIII and in the form set forth as Exhibit K hereto (the "Escrow
                                          ---------
Agreement"). As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Escrow Amount,
without any act of any Company shareholder, will be deposited by Parent with The
Bank of New York, a New York banking corporation (or other institution
acceptable to Parent and the Securityholder Agents (as defined in Section 8.2(g)
below)) as Escrow Agent (the "Escrow Agent"), such deposit to constitute an
escrow fund (the "Escrow Fund") to be governed by the terms set forth herein and
in the Escrow Agreement. The portion of the Escrow Amount contributed on behalf
of each shareholder of the Company shall be in proportion to the aggregate
Parent Common Stock, which such holder would otherwise be entitled under
Sections 1.6(a) and (b) and shall be in the respective share amounts and
percentages listed on the Closing Date Payment Schedule opposite each Company
shareholder's name. All shares of Parent Common Stock contributed to the Escrow
Fund shall not be unvested or subject to any right of repurchase, risk of
forfeiture or other condition in favor of the Surviving Corporation. The Escrow
Fund shall be available to compensate Parent and its affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation) for any claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
deficiencies, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses, and expenses of investigation and defense (hereinafter individually a
"Loss" and collectively "Losses") incurred by Parent, its officers, directors,
or affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) directly or indirectly as a
result of (i) any inaccuracy or breach of a representation or warranty of the
Company contained herein (or in any certificate, instrument,

                                      -54-
<PAGE>

schedule or document attached to this Agreement and delivered by the Company in
connection with the Merger) without regard to any materiality qualifiers,
including without limitation Material Adverse Effect or (ii) any failure by the
Company to perform or comply with any covenant contained herein (or in any
certificate, instrument, schedule or document attached to this Agreement and
delivered by the Company in connection with the Merger); provided any such
claims must be asserted on or before 5:00 p.m. (California Time) on the
Expiration Date. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Escrow Agent shall not
pay claims for Losses received from the Parent from the Escrow Fund unless and
until the Parent has made claims for Losses pursuant to Section 8.2(d) hereof
that exceed the Allowed Deductible (as defined below). After the claims for
Losses equal to the Allowed Deductible have been made, then the Allowed
Deductible and any additional Losses incurred by the Parent shall be satisfied
by the Escrow Fund in accordance with the procedures set forth in Sections
8.2(d) and 8.2(e) of this Agreement. In addition, Parent shall be entitled to
immediate reimbursement as Losses from the Escrow Fund for any Third Party
expenses (as defined in Section 10.2) incurred by the Company that exceed
$1,500,000, without regard as to whether the Allowed Deductible has been
satisfied. For purposes of this Agreement, the "Allowed Deductible" shall be the
first $500,000 of Losses that (i) are submitted by an officer of the Parent to
the Escrow Agent in accordance with Section 8.2(d) hereof, and (ii) are not
subject to any objections by the Securityholder Agents pursuant to Section
8.2(e) hereof, or (iii) were subject to an objection that has been resolved in
accordance with the provisions of this Article VIII. However, Third Party
expenses shall not be included in the $500,000 of Losses that comprise the
Allowed Deductible.

           (b) Escrow Period; Distribution upon Termination of Escrow Periods.
               --------------------------------------------------------------
Subject to the following requirements, the Escrow Fund shall be in existence
immediately following the Effective Time and shall terminate at 5:00 p.m.,
California time, on the Expiration Date (the "Escrow Period"); provided,
however, that the Escrow Period shall not terminate with respect to such amount
(or some portion thereof), that is necessary in the reasonable judgment of
Parent, subject to the objection of the Securityholder Agents and the subsequent
arbitration of the matter in the manner provided in Section 8.2(f) hereof, to
satisfy any unsatisfied claims concerning facts and circumstances existing prior
to the termination of such Escrow Period specified in any Officer's Certificate
delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to termination of such Escrow Period. As
soon as all such claims have been resolved, as evidenced by written memorandum
of the Securityholder Agents and Parent, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the
shareholders of the Company the remaining portion of the Escrow Fund not
required to satisfy such claims. Deliveries of Escrow Amounts to the
shareholders of the Company pursuant to this Section 8.2(b) shall be made in
proportion to their respective original contributions to the Escrow Fund (as set
forth on the Closing Date Payment Schedule). At all times during the Escrow
Period, the Company shareholders shall be deemed to be the record holders of
their respective amounts of the Parent Common Stock comprising the Escrow
Amount.

           (c)  Protection of Escrow Fund.
                -------------------------

                (i) The Escrow Agent shall hold and safeguard the Escrow Fund
during the Escrow Period, shall treat such fund as a trust fund in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and not as the property of Parent and shall
hold and dispose of the Escrow Fund only in accordance with the terms hereof.

                                      -55-
<PAGE>

                (ii) Any shares of Parent Common Stock or other equity
securities issued or distributed by Parent (including shares issued upon a stock
split or stock dividend) ("New Shares") in respect of Parent Common Stock in the
Escrow Fund which have not been released from the Escrow Fund shall be added to
the Escrow Fund and become a part thereof. New Shares issued in respect of
shares of Parent Common Stock which have been released from the Escrow Fund
shall not be added to the Escrow Fund but shall be distributed to the
recordholders thereof. Cash dividends on Parent Common Stock shall not be added
to the Escrow Fund but shall be distributed to the recordholders thereof.

                (iii) Each Company shareholder shall be deemed the record holder
of, and shall have voting, dividend, distribution and all other rights with
respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock contributed to the Escrow Fund by
such shareholder (and on any voting securities and other equity securities added
to the Escrow Fund in respect of such shares of Parent Common Stock).

           (d)  Claims Upon Escrow Fund.
                -----------------------

                (i) Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent at any time on or before
the Expiration Date of a certificate signed by any officer of Parent (an
"Officer's Certificate"): (A) stating that Parent has paid or properly accrued
or reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay or accrue Losses, and (B)
specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of Losses included in the
amount so stated, the date each such item was paid or properly accrued, or the
basis for such anticipated liability, and the nature of the misrepresentation,
breach of warranty or covenant to which such item is related, the Escrow Agent
shall, subject to the provisions of Section 8.2(e) hereof, deliver to Parent out
of the Escrow Fund, as promptly as practicable, shares of Parent Common Stock
held in the Escrow Fund in an amount equal to such Losses.

                (ii) For the purposes of determining the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock to be delivered to Parent out of the Escrow Fund pursuant to
Section 8.2(d)(i) hereof, the shares of Parent Common Stock shall be valued at
the Average Closing Price. Parent and the Securityholder Agents shall certify
such determined value in a certificate signed by both Parent and the
Securityholder Agents, and shall deliver such certificate to the Escrow Agent.

           (e) Objections to Claims. At the time of delivery of any Officer's
               --------------------
Certificate to the Escrow Agent, Parent shall deliver a duplicate copy of such
certificate to the Securityholder Agents and for a period of thirty (30) days
after such delivery, the Escrow Agent shall not deliver to Parent any Escrow
Amounts pursuant to Section 8.2(d) hereof unless the Escrow Agent shall have
received written authorization from the Securityholder Agents to make such
delivery. After the expiration of such thirty (30) day period, the Escrow Agent
shall make delivery of shares of Parent Common Stock from the Escrow Fund in
accordance with Section 8.2(d) hereof, provided that no such payment or delivery
may be made if the Securityholder Agents shall object in a written statement to
the claim made in the Officer's Certificate, and such statement shall have been
delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to the expiration of such thirty (30) day
period.

                                      -56-

           (f)  Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration.
                ------------------------------------

                (i) In case the Securityholder Agents shall so object in writing
to any claim or claims made in any Officer's Certificate, the Securityholder
Agents and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the
respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Securityholder
Agents and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement
shall be prepared and signed by both parties and shall be furnished to the
Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum
and distribute shares of Parent Common Stock from the Escrow Fund in accordance
with the terms thereof.

                (ii) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith
negotiation, and in any event not later than sixty (60) days after receipt of
the written objection of the Securityholder Agents, either Parent or the
Securityholder Agents may demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of
the damage or loss is at issue in pending litigation with a third party, in
which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained
or both parties agree to arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall
be settled by arbitration conducted by three arbitrators. Any such arbitration
shall be held in Santa Clara County, California under the American Arbitration
Association Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect. Parent and the
Securityholder Agents shall each select one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators
so selected shall select a third arbitrator, each of which arbitrators shall be
independent, meaning that they may not be current or former employees or
consultants or the Parent, Merger Sub, Company or Surviving Corporation. The
arbitrators must disclose any circumstances likely to affect their independence
pursuant to Rule 19 of the American Arbitration Association Commercial
Arbitration Rules. The period of discovery shall be limited to 60 days and
limited to relevant information from the opposing parties about the subject
matter of the dispute. The arbitrators shall rule upon motions to compel or
limit discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including
attorneys fees and costs, to the extent as a court of competent law or equity,
should the arbitrators determine that discovery was sought without substantial
justification or that discovery was refused or objected to without substantial
justification. The decision of a majority of the three arbitrators as to the
validity and amount of any claim in such Officer's Certificate shall be binding
and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement, and notwithstanding anything
in Section 8.2(e) hereof, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act in
accordance with such decision and make or withhold payments out of the Escrow
Fund in accordance therewith. Such decision shall be written and shall be
supported by written findings of fact and conclusions which shall set forth the
award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrators.

                (iii) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction. For purposes of this Section 8.2(f),
in any arbitration hereunder in which any claim or the amount thereof stated in
the Officer's Certificate is at issue, Parent shall be deemed to be the Non-
Prevailing Party in the event that the arbitrators award Parent the sum of one-
half ( 1/2) or less of the disputed amount plus any amounts not in dispute;
otherwise, the shareholders of the Company as represented by the Securityholder
Agents shall be deemed to be the Non-Prevailing Party. Each party to an
arbitration shall pay its own expenses and one half of (i) the fees of each
arbitrator and (ii) the administrative costs of the arbitration.

           (g)  Securityholder Agents of the Shareholders; Power of Attorney.
                ------------------------------------------------------------

                (i) In the event that the Merger is approved, effective upon
such vote, and without further act of any shareholder, Warren J. Packard and
Scot E. Land shall be appointed as agents and attorneys-in-fact (each such
natural person a "Securityholder Agent" and collectively, the "Securityholder
Agents") for each shareholder of the Company (except such shareholders, if any,
as shall have perfected their dissenters' rights under California Law and a list
of whom shall be provided to the Escrow Agent with evidence of the exercise of
such dissenters' rights), for and on behalf of shareholders of the Company, to
give and receive notices and communications, to authorize delivery to Parent of
shares of Parent Common Stock from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by
Parent, to object to such deliveries, to agree to, negotiate, enter into
settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of
courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, and to take all
actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of Securityholder Agents for
the accomplishment of the foregoing. Such agency may be changed by the
shareholders of the Company from time to time upon not less than thirty (30)
days prior written notice to Parent; provided that the each of the persons
acting as Securityholder Agents may not be removed unless holders of a majority
in interest of the Escrow Fund agree to such removal and to the identity of the
substituted agent. Any vacancy in either of the positions of Securityholder
Agents may be filled by approval of the holders of a majority in interest of the
Escrow Fund. No bond shall be required of the Securityholder Agents, and the
Securityholder Agents shall not receive compensation for their services. The
reasonable legal fees and expenses and other professional fees incurred by the
Securityholder Agents in connection with the performance of such persons' duties
hereunder shall be reimbursed from the Escrow Fund upon written request pursuant
to Section 8.2(d) hereof; provided, however, that such expenses shall be paid
                          --------  -------
from the Escrow Fund after all allowed claims shall have been paid or sufficient
amounts thereof have been set aside. Notices or communications to or from the
Securityholder Agents shall constitute notice to or from each of the
shareholders of the Company.

                (ii) Neither or the Securityholder Agents shall be liable for
any act done or omitted hereunder as Securityholder Agents while acting in good
faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment. The shareholders of the
Company on whose behalf the Escrow Amount was contributed to the Escrow Fund
shall jointly and severally indemnify each of the Securityholder Agents and hold
each of the Securityholder Agents harmless against any loss, liability or
expense incurred without negligence or bad faith on the part of such
Securityholder Agent and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of the Securityholder Agents' duties hereunder, including the
reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by the Securityholder
Agents.

           (h) Actions of the Securityholder Agents. A decision, act, consent or
               ------------------------------------
instruction of both of the Securityholder Agents shall constitute a decision of
all the shareholders for whom a portion of the Escrow Amount otherwise issuable
to them are deposited in the Escrow Fund and shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon each of such shareholders, and the Escrow Agent and Parent may
rely upon any such written decision, consent or instruction of the
Securityholder Agents as being the decision, consent or instruction of each
every such shareholder of the Company. The Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby
relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done by them in
accordance with such decision, consent or instruction of the Securityholder
Agents.

                                      -58-
<PAGE>

           (i)  Third Party Claims.
                ------------------

                (i) If any third party shall notify Parent or its affiliates
hereto with respect to any matter (hereinafter referred to as a "Third Party
Claim"), which may give rise to a claim by Parent against the Escrow Fund, then
Parent shall give notice to the Securityholder Agents within 30 days of Parent
becoming aware of any such Third Party Claim or of facts upon which any such
Third Party Claim will be based (but in all events, at least five business days
prior to the date that an answer to such Third Party Claim is due to be filed)
setting forth such material information with respect to the Third Party Claim as
is reasonably available to Parent; provided, however, that no delay or failure
                                   --------  -------
on the part of Parent in notifying the Securityholder Agents shall relieve the
Securityholder Agents and the Company shareholders from any obligation hereunder
unless the Securityholder Agents and the Company shareholders are thereby
materially prejudiced (and then solely to the extent of such prejudice). The
Securityholder Agents and the Company shareholders shall not be liable for any
attorneys fees and expenses incurred by Parent prior to Parent's giving notice
to the Securityholder Agents of a Third Party Claim. The notice from Parent to
the Securityholder Agents shall set forth such material information with respect
to the Third Party Claim as is then reasonably available to Parent.

                (ii) In case any Third Party Claim is asserted against Parent or
its affiliates, and Parent notifies the Securityholder Agents thereof pursuant
to Section 8.2(i)(a) hereinabove, the Securityholder Agents and the Company
shareholders will be entitled, if the Securityholder Agents so elect by written
notice delivered to Parent within 30 days after receiving Parent's notice, to
assume the defense thereof, at the expense of the Company shareholders
independent of the Escrow Fund, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent,
so long as:

                     (1) Parent has reasonably determined that Losses which may
be incurred as a result of the Third Party Claim do not exceed either
individually, or when aggregated with all other Third Party Claims, the total
dollar value of the Escrow Fund determined in accordance with Section 8.2(d)(ii)
hereof;

                     (2) the Third Party Claim involves only money damages and
does not seek an injunction or other equitable relief; and

                     (3) settlement of, or an adverse judgment with respect to,
the Third Party Claim is not, in the good faith judgment of Parent, likely to
establish a precedential custom or practice materially adverse to the continuing
business interests of Parent.

     If the Securityholder Agents and the Company shareholders so assume any
such defense, the Securityholder Agents and the Company shareholders shall
conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently.  The
Securityholder Agents and the Company shareholders shall not compromise or
settle such Third Party Claim or consent to entry of any judgment in respect
thereof without the prior written consent of Parent and/or its affiliates, as
applicable.

                (iii) In the event that the Securityholder Agents assume the
defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 8.2(i)(ii) above,
Parent or its affiliates may retain separate counsel and participate in the
defense of the Third Party Claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
shall be at the expense of Parent unless Parent or its affiliates shall
reasonably

                                      -59-
<PAGE>

determine that there is a material conflict of interest between or among Parent
or its affiliates and the Securityholder Agents and the Company shareholders
with respect to such Third Party Claim, in which case the reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel will be borne by the Securityholder Agents and the
Company shareholders out of the Escrow Fund. Parent or its affiliates will not
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect
to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Securityholder
Agents. Parent will cooperate in the defense of the Third Party Claim and will
provide full access to documents, assets, properties, books and records
reasonably requested by Securityholder Agents and material to the claim and will
make available all officers, directors and employees reasonably requested by
Securityholder Agents for investigation, depositions and trial.

                (iv) In the event that the Securityholder Agents fail or elect
not to assume the defense of Parent or its affiliates against such Third Party
Claim, which Securityholder Agents had the right to assume under Section
8.2(i)(ii) above, Parent or its affiliates shall have the right to undertake the
defense and Parent shall not compromise or settle such Third Party Claim or
consent to entry of any judgment in respect thereof without the prior written
consent of Securityholder Agents. In the event that the Securityholder Agents
are not entitled to assume the defense of Parent or its affiliates against such
Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 8.2(i)(ii) above, Parent or its affiliates
shall have the right to undertake the defense, consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim in
any manner it may deem appropriate (and Parent or its affiliates need not
consult with, or obtain any consent from, the Securityholder Agents in
connection therewith); provided, however, that except with the written consent
                       --------  -------
of the Securityholder Agents, no settlement of any such claim or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim shall alone be
determinative of the validity of the claim against the Escrow Fund. In each
case, Parent or its affiliates shall conduct the defense of the Third Party
Claim actively and diligently, and the Securityholder Agents will cooperate with
Parent or its affiliates, and will use its best efforts to cause the Company's
shareholders, to cooperate in the defense of that claim and will provide full
access to documents, assets, properties, books and records reasonably requested
by Parent and material to the claim and will make available all individuals
reasonably requested by Parent for investigation, depositions and trial.

           (j)  Escrow Agent's Duties.
                ---------------------

                (i) The Escrow Agent shall be obligated only for the performance
of such duties as are specifically set forth herein, and as set forth in any
additional written escrow instructions which the Escrow Agent may receive after
the date of this Agreement which are signed by an officer of Parent and the
Securityholder Agent, and may rely and shall be protected in relying or
refraining from acting on any instrument reasonably believed to be genuine and
to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The Escrow
Agent shall not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Escrow Agent
while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any
act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive
evidence of such good faith.

                (ii) The Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized to
disregard any and all warnings given by any of the parties hereto or by any
other person, excepting only orders or process of courts of law, and is hereby
expressly authorized to comply with and obey orders,

                                      -60-
<PAGE>

judgments or decrees of any court. In case the Escrow Agent obeys or complies
with any such order, judgment or decree of any court, the Escrow Agent shall not
be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other person by reason of such
compliance, notwithstanding any such order, judgment or decree being
subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or found to have
been entered without jurisdiction.

                (iii) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable in any respect on
account of the identity, authority or rights of the parties executing or
delivering or purporting to execute or deliver this Agreement or any documents
or papers deposited or called for hereunder.

                (iv) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for the expiration of
any rights under any statute of limitations with respect to this Agreement or
any documents deposited with the Escrow Agent.

                (v) In performing any duties under the Agreement, the Escrow
Agent shall not be liable to any party for damages, losses, or expenses, except
for gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent. The
Escrow Agent shall not incur any such liability for (A) any act or failure to
act made or omitted in good faith, or (B) any action taken or omitted in
reliance upon any written instrument, including any written statement or
affidavit provided for in this Agreement that the Escrow Agent shall in good
faith believe to be genuine, nor will the Escrow Agent be liable or responsible
for forgeries, fraud, impersonations, or determining the scope of any
representative authority. In addition, the Escrow Agent may consult with the
legal counsel in connection with Escrow Agent's duties under this Agreement and
shall be fully protected in any act taken, suffered, or permitted by him/her in
good faith in accordance with the advice of counsel. The Escrow Agent is not
responsible for determining and verifying the authority of any person acting or
purporting to act on behalf of any party to this Agreement.

                (vi) If any controversy arises between the parties to this
Agreement, or with any other party, concerning the subject matter of this
Agreement, its terms or conditions, the Escrow Agent will not be required to
determine the controversy or to take any action regarding it. The Escrow Agent
may hold all documents and shares of Parent Common Stock and may wait for
settlement of any such controversy by final appropriate legal proceedings or
other means as, in the Escrow Agent's discretion, the Escrow Agent may be
required, despite what may be set forth elsewhere in this Agreement. In such
event, the Escrow Agent will not be liable for damage. Furthermore, the Escrow
Agent may at its option, file an action of interpleader requiring the parties to
answer and litigate any claims and rights among themselves. The Escrow Agent is
authorized to deposit with the clerk of the court all documents and shares of
Parent Common Stock held in escrow, except all cost, expenses, charges and
reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Escrow Agent due to the interpleader
action and which the parties jointly and severally agree to pay. Upon initiating
such action, the Escrow Agent shall be fully released and discharged of and from
all obligations and liability imposed by the terms of this Agreement.

                (vii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation agree jointly and
severally to indemnify and hold Escrow Agent harmless against any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses, including reasonable costs
of investigation, counsel fees, and disbursements that may be imposed on Escrow
Agent or incurred by Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of his/her
duties under this Agreement, including but not limited to any litigation arising
from this

                                      -61-

Agreement or involving its subject matter; provided, however, that in the event
                                           --------  -------
the Securityholder Agents shall be the Non-Prevailing Party in connection with
any claim or action initiated by a Company shareholder or Company shareholders,
then Parent and the Surviving Corporation (1) shall jointly and severally
indemnify and hold the Escrow Agent harmless and (2) shall have a right to
reimbursement from the Escrow Fund, or if the amounts available therein are
insufficient, from such Company shareholder or Company shareholders, in an
amount equal to all amounts paid by the Parent or the Surviving Corporation to
the Escrow Agent for the indemnification of the Escrow Agent to the full extent
provided by this paragraph.

                (viii) The Escrow Agent may resign at any time upon giving at
least thirty (30) days written notice to the parties; provided, however, that no
                                                      --------  -------
such resignation shall become effective until the appointment of a successor
escrow agent which shall be accomplished as follows: the parties shall use their
best efforts to mutually agree on a successor escrow agent within thirty (30)
days after receiving such notice. If the parties fail to agree upon a successor
escrow agent within such time, the Escrow Agent shall have the right to appoint
a successor escrow agent authorized to do business in the state of California.
The successor escrow agent shall execute and deliver an instrument accepting
such appointment and it shall, without further acts, be vested with all the
estates, properties, rights, powers, and duties of the predecessor escrow agent
as if originally named as escrow agent. The Escrow Agent shall be discharged
from any further duties and liability under this Agreement.

           (k) Fees. All fees of the Escrow Agent for performance of its duties
               ----
hereunder shall be paid by Parent. It is understood that the fees and usual
charges agreed upon for services of the Escrow Agent shall be considered
compensation for ordinary services as contemplated by this Agreement. In the
event that the conditions of this Agreement are not promptly fulfilled, or if
the Escrow Agent renders any service not provided for in this Agreement, or if
the parties request a substantial modification of its terms, or if any
controversy arises, or if the Escrow Agent is made a party to, or intervenes in,
any litigation pertaining to this escrow or its subject matter, the Escrow Agent
shall be reasonably compensated for such extraordinary services and reimbursed
for all costs, attorneys' fees, and expenses occasioned by such default, delay,
controversy or litigation. Parent promises to pay these sums upon demand.

           (l) Maximum Liability and Remedies. Except for intentional fraud and
               ------------------------------
willful misconduct, (i) the rights of Parent to make claims upon the Escrow Fund
in accordance with this Article VIII shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation after the Closing with respect to any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Company under this
Agreement and (ii) no former shareholder, option holder, warrant holder,
director, officer, employee or agent of Company shall have any personal
liability to Parent or the Surviving Corporation after the Closing in connection
with the Merger.

                       TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

        9.1 Termination. Except as provided in Section 9.2 below, this Agreement
            -----------
may be terminated and the Merger abandoned at any time prior to the Closing
Date:

                (a) by mutual written consent duly authorized by the Board of
Directors of the Company and Parent;

                (b) by either Parent or the Company if: (i) the Closing Date has
not occurred by May 31, 2000 (or July 31, 2000 if HSR Approval has not been
obtained or the Parent has not obtained a permit for the issuance of the Parent
Common Stock from the California Department of Corporations prior to May 31,
2000) (provided that the right to terminate this Agreement under this clause
9.1(b)(i) shall not be available to any party whose willful failure to fulfill
any obligation hereunder has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of
the Effective Time to occur on or before such date and such action or failure
constitutes a breach of this Agreement); (ii) there shall be a final
nonappealable order of a federal or state court in effect preventing
consummation of the Merger; or (iii) there shall be any statute, rule,
regulation or order enacted, promulgated or issued or deemed applicable to the
Merger by any Governmental Entity that would make consummation of the Merger
illegal;

                (c) by Parent if there shall be any action taken, or any
statute, rule, regulation or order enacted, promulgated or issued or deemed
applicable to the Merger, by any Governmental Entity, which would: (i) prohibit
Parent's or the Company's ownership or operation of any portion of the business
of the Company or (ii) compel Parent or the Company to dispose of or hold
separate, as a result of the Merger, any portion of the business or assets of
the Company or Parent;

                (d) by Parent if it is not in material breach of its obligations
under this Agreement and there has been a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement on the part of the
Company and as a result of such breach the conditions set forth in Section
7.3(a) or 7.3(b), as the case may be, would not then be satisfied; provided,
                                                                   --------
however, that if such breach is curable by the Company within 10 days through
-------
the exercise of its reasonable best efforts, then for so long as the Company
continues to exercise such reasonable best efforts Parent may not terminate this
Agreement under this Section 9.1(d) unless such breach is not cured within 10
days (but no cure period shall be required for a breach which by its nature
cannot be cured);

                (e) by the Company if it is not in material breach of its
obligations under this Agreement and there has been a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement on
the part of Parent or Merger Sub and as a result of such breach the conditions
set forth in Section 7.2(a) or 7.2(b), as the case may be, would not then be
satisfied; provided, however, that if such breach is curable by Parent or Merger
           --------  -------
Sub within 10 days through the exercise of its reasonable best efforts, then for
so long as Parent or Merger Sub continues to exercise such reasonable best
efforts the Company may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(e)
unless such breach is not cured within 10 days (but no cure period shall be
required for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured).

                                      -63-
<PAGE>

     Where action is taken to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1,
it shall be sufficient for such action to be authorized by the Board of
Directors (as applicable) of the party taking such action.

        9.2 Effect of Termination. Except as set forth in Section 10.2, any
            ---------------------
termination of this Agreement under Section 9.1 above will be effective
immediately upon the delivery of written notice of the terminating party to the
other parties hereto. In the event of the termination of this Agreement as
provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect,
except (a) as set forth in this Section 9.2 and Article X (general provisions,
including expenses), each of which shall survive the termination of this
Agreement, and (b) nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any
breach of this Agreement. No termination of this Agreement shall affect the
obligations of the parties contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of
which obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement.

        9.3 Amendment. Except as is otherwise required by applicable law, prior
            ---------
to the Closing, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any time
by execution of an instrument in writing signed by Parent and the Company;
provided, however, that after the approval of the Merger Agreement by the
--------  -------
shareholders of the Company, no amendment may be made which reduces the Merger
Consideration or which effects any changes which would materially adversely
affect the shareholders of the Company without the further approval of the
shareholders of the Company. Except as is otherwise required by applicable law,
after the Closing, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any
time by execution of an instrument in writing signed by Parent, the
Securityholder Agents and by Company shareholders who receive more than 50% of
the Parent Common Stock issued or to be issued pursuant to Section 1.6, or by
all of the Company shareholders in the case of an amendment to Articles VIII.

        9.4 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent
            -----------------
and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other, may, to the
extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations of the other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
party.

expenses incurred in connection with the Merger including, without limitation,
all legal, accounting, financial advisory, consulting and all other fees and
expenses of third parties ("Third Party Expenses") incurred by a party in

        10.3 Interpretation. The words "include," "includes" and "including"
             --------------
when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The word "agreement" when used herein shall be deemed in

in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

<PAGE>

        10.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
             ------------
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of
the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart.

        10.5 Entire Agreement; Assignment. Except for the Confidentiality
             ----------------------------
Agreement, this Agreement, the schedules and Exhibits hereto, and the documents
and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto referenced herein:
(a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof; (b) are not intended to confer upon any other person any rights or
remedies hereunder; and (c) shall not be assigned by operation of law or
otherwise except as otherwise specifically provided, except that Parent and
Merger Sub may assign their respective rights and delegate their respective
obligations hereunder to their respective affiliates.

        10.6 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or
             ------------
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably
to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace
such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and
enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic,
business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

        10.7 Other Remedies. Except as otherwise provided herein (including as
             --------------
set forth in Section 8.2(l)), any and all remedies herein expressly conferred

        10.8 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
             -------------
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof;
provided, however, that the Merger Agreement shall be governed by California
--------  -------
Law. Each of the parties hereto agrees that process may be served upon them in
any manner authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware for such persons and
waives and covenants not to assert or plead any objection which they might
otherwise have to such jurisdiction and such process.

        10.9 Rules of Construction. The parties hereto agree that they have been
             ---------------------
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of
construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will
be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

        10.10 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
              --------------------
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce

                                      -67-
<PAGE>

specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States
or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity.
