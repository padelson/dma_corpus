2.2 Closing; Effective Time.

  



  

The closing ("Closing") shall occur no later than the close of business on
the fifth Business Day following the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted
by applicable law) waiver of the conditions set forth in Article IX (other
than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable law)
waiver of those conditions), or such other date that may be agreed to in
writing by the parties. The Merger shall be effected by the filing of a

and articles of merger with the Secretary of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts on the day of the Closing (the "Closing Date"), in accordance
with the DGCL and MGL, respectively. The "Effective Time" means the date and

the DGCL and MGL. A pre-closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the
"Pre-Closing") shall take place at the offices of Luse Gorman, PC, at 10:00
a.m. on the day prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

2.3 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.

  



  

The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of BHLB as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended as provided
therein and by applicable law.

  



  

2.4 Directors of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

Effective immediately after the Closing Date, Pamela Massad and David
Brunelle (the "New Board Members") shall be appointed and elected to the BHLB
and Berkshire Bank Boards of Directors; provided, however, that if, prior to
the Effective Time, Ms. Massad or Mr. Brunelle are unable or unwilling to
serve as members of the BHLB and Berkshire Bank Board of Directors, BHLB, in
consultation with Commerce, shall designate a New Board Member from the
remaining existing members of the Commerce Board of Directors.

2.7 Possible Alternative Structures.

  



  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement and
subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article IX prior to

 | 9| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Merger described in Section 2.1 or the Bank Merger including, without
limitation, (A) by substituting a wholly owned subsidiary for BHLB or
Berkshire Bank, as applicable, or (B) entering into a stock purchase
agreement with certain stockholders of Commerce and immediately thereafter
effectuating a short-form merger between parent and subsidiary pursuant to
MGL Ch. 156D, §11.05, provided that, in any revision to the structure: (i)
any such subsidiary shall become a party to, and shall agree to be bound by,
the terms of this Agreement; (ii) there are no adverse Federal or state
income tax consequences to BHLB, Berkshire Bank, Commerce, CBTC or to the BHLB
or Commerce stockholders, and nothing would prevent the rendering of the
opinions contemplated in Sections 9.2.5 and 9.3.5, as a result of the
modification; (iii) the consideration to be paid to the holders of Commerce
Common Stock under this Agreement is not thereby changed in kind, value or
reduced in amount, other than as contemplated in the Shareholder Agreement in
connection with the Merger; and (iv) such modification will not materially
delay the Closing or materially jeopardize or delay (x) the calling and
holding of the Commerce Stockholders Meeting, the solicitation of proxies in
connection therewith, or stockholder consent in lieu of a meeting of
stockholders, to the extent permissible or (y) the receipt of any Regulatory
Approvals or other consents and approvals relating to the consummation of the
Merger or otherwise cause any condition to Closing set forth in Article IX not
to be capable of being fulfilled. The parties hereto agree to appropriately
amend this Agreement and any related documents in order to reflect any such
revised structure.

  



  

2.8 Additional Actions.

  



  

If, at any time after the Effective Time, BHLB shall consider or be advised
that any further deeds, documents, assignments or assurances in law or any
other acts are necessary or desirable to (i) vest, perfect or confirm, of
record or otherwise, in BHLB its right, title or interest in, to or under any
of the rights, properties or assets of Commerce or any Commerce Subsidiary, or
(ii) otherwise carry out the purposes of this Agreement, Commerce and its
officers and directors shall be deemed to have granted to BHLB an irrevocable
power of attorney to execute and deliver, in such official corporate
capacities, all such deeds, assignments or assurances in law or any other
acts as are necessary or desirable to (a) vest, perfect or confirm, of record
or otherwise, in BHLB its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties or assets of Commerce or (b) otherwise carry out the
purposes of this Agreement, and the officers and directors of the BHLB are
authorized in the name of Commerce or otherwise to take any and all such
action.

  



  

ARTICLE III 
 CONVERSION OF SHARES

  



  

3.1 Conversion of Commerce Common Stock; Merger Consideration.

  



  

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of BHLB, Commerce or the holders of any of the shares of Commerce Common
Stock, the Merger shall be effected in accordance with the following terms:

  



  

3.1.1 Each share of BHLB Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and
outstanding following the Effective Time and shall be unchanged by the
Merger.

  



  

3.1.2 All shares of Commerce Common Stock held in the treasury of
Commerce prior to the Effective Time (other than shares held in a
fiduciary capacity or in connection with debts previously contracted)
("Treasury Stock") cease to exist, and such shares, including any
Certificates therefor, shall be canceled as promptly as practicable
thereafter, and no payment or distribution shall be made in consideration
therefor.

  



  

3.1.3 Subject to a potential adjustment as provided in Section 10.1.9,
each outstanding share of Commerce Common Stock (other than Treasury Stock
and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive 0.93 (the
"Exchange Ratio") shares of BHLB Common Stock (the "BHLB Common Stock
Consideration"); provided, however, that no Commerce stockholder shall
receive, as aggregated with such stockholder's immediate family members and
affiliates for purposes of 12 C.F.R. § 225.41 of Regulation Y (the "Acting in
Concert Group"), BHLB Common Stock Consideration that would exceed 9.9% of
the outstanding BHLB Common Stock as of the Effective Time (the "Voting Stock
Consideration Limit"). In the event that any Commerce stockholder, as
aggregated with such stockholder's Acting in Concert Group, would otherwise
exceed the Voting Stock Consideration Limit, such

  



    

 | 10| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Commerce stockholder shall receive 0.465 shares of non-voting, participating
BHLB preferred stock as defined by the Certificate of Designation attached as
_Exhibit C_ hereto ("BHLB Preferred Stock Consideration") for every share of
Commerce Common Stock that may not be converted into BHLB Common Stock as a
consequence of the Voting Stock Consideration Limit.

  



  

3.1.4 Each outstanding share of Commerce Common Stock, the holder of
which has perfected his right to appraisal under applicable law and has not
effectively withdrawn or lost such right as of the Effective Time (the
"Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into or represent a right to
receive the Merger Consideration hereunder, and the holder thereof shall be
entitled only to such rights as are granted by applicable law. Commerce shall
give BHLB prompt notice upon receipt by Commerce of any such demands for
payment of the fair value of such shares of Commerce Common Stock and of
withdrawals of such notice and any other related communications (any
shareholder duly making such demand being hereinafter called a "Dissenting
Shareholder"), and BHLB shall have the right to participate in all
discussions, negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands.
Commerce shall not, except with the prior written consent of BHLB,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demand for payment, or waive any failure to timely deliver a
written demand for appraisal or the taking of any other action by such
Dissenting Shareholder as may be necessary to perfect appraisal rights under
applicable law. Any payments made in respect of Dissenting Shares shall be
made by BHLB as the surviving company.

  



  

3.1.5 If any Dissenting Shareholder withdraws or loses (through failure
to perfect or otherwise) his right to such payment at or prior to the
Effective Time, such holder's shares of Commerce Common Stock shall be
converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with
the applicable provisions of this Agreement. If such holder withdraws or loses
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) his right to such payment after the
Effective Time, each share of Commerce Common Stock of such holder shall be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration.

  



  

3.1.6 Upon the Effective Time, outstanding shares of Commerce Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter by operation of this Section 3.1
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto or any dividends or
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that were
declared or made by Commerce on such shares of Commerce Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement on or prior to the Effective Time
and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time.

  



  

3.1.7 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of BHLB Common Stock
or BHLB Preferred Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to BHLB Common Stock
or BHLB Preferred Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional
share interests, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of BHLB. In
lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, BHLB shall pay to each
former holder of Commerce Common Stock who otherwise would be entitled to
receive a fractional share of BHLB Common Stock or BHLB Preferred Stock, an
amount in cash, rounded to the nearest cent and without interest, equal to
the product of (i) the fraction of a share to which such holder
would otherwise have been entitled and (ii) the average of the daily closing
sales prices of a share of BHLB Common Stock as reported on the NYSE for the
five (5) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Closing Date. For
purposes of determining any fractional share interest, all shares of Commerce
Common Stock owned by a Commerce stockholder shall be combined so as to
calculate the maximum number of whole shares of BHLB Common Stock and BHLB
Preferred Stock issuable to such Commerce stockholder.

  



  

3.1.8 If BHLB changes (or the BHLB Board sets a related record date
that will occur before the Effective Time for a change in) the number or kind
of shares of BHLB Common Stock outstanding by way of a stock split, stock
dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, reorganization or similar
transaction, then the Merger Consideration (and any other dependent items)
will be adjusted proportionately to account for such change. If Commerce
changes (or the Commerce Board sets a related record date that will occur
before the Effective Time for a change in) the number or kind of shares of
Commerce Common Stock (or Rights thereto) outstanding by way of a stock
split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, reorganization or
similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration (and any other dependent
items) will be adjusted proportionately to account for such change.

3.2 Procedures for Exchange of Commerce Common Stock.

  



  

3.2.1 _BHLB to Make Merger Consideration Available_. After the Closing
and at or prior to the Effective Time, BHLB shall deposit, or shall cause to
be deposited, with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of
Commerce Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section 3.2, an
aggregate amount of cash sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of the cash
payable in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares pursuant to this Article
III and shall instruct the Exchange Agent to issue such cash and shares of
BHLB Common Stock and BHLB Preferred Stock for exchange in accordance with
this Section 3.2 (such cash and shares of BHLB Common Stock and BHLB
Preferred Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto (without any interest thereon) being hereinafter referred to
as the "Exchange Fund").

  



  

3.2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. BHLB shall take all steps necessary
to cause the Exchange Agent, not later than five (5) Business Days after the
Effective Time, to mail to each holder of a Certificate or Certificates a form
letter of transmittal for return to the Exchange Agent and instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the Commerce
Common Stock represented by such Certificates shall have been converted as a
result of the Merger, if any. The letter of transmittal shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent. Upon
proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal,
duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration and the Certificate so surrendered
shall be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash payable in
lieu of fractional shares or any unpaid dividends and distributions, if any,
payable to holders of Certificates.

  



  

3.2.3 _Rights of Certificate Holders after the Effective Time_. The
holder of a Certificate that prior to the Merger represented issued
and outstanding Commerce Common Stock shall have no rights, after the
Effective Time, with respect to such Commerce Common Stock except to
surrender the Certificate in exchange for the Merger Consideration as provided
in this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions declared after the
Effective Time with respect to BHLB Common Stock shall be paid to the holder
of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender
such Certificate in accordance with this Section 3.2. After the surrender of a
Certificate in accordance with this Section 3.2, the record holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other
distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become
payable with respect to shares of BHLB Common Stock represented by
such Certificate.

  



  

3.2.4 _Surrender by Persons Other than Record Holders_. If the Person
surrendering a Certificate and signing the accompanying letter of
transmittal is not the record holder thereof, then it shall be a condition of
the payment of the Merger Consideration that: (i) such Certificate is
properly endorsed to such Person or is accompanied by appropriate stock
powers, in either case signed exactly as the name of the record holder
appears on such Certificate, and is otherwise in proper form for transfer, or
is accompanied by appropriate evidence of the authority of the Person
surrendering such Certificate and signing the letter of transmittal to do so
on behalf of the record holder; and (ii) the Person requesting such exchange
shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other
similar taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or required for any other
reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such
tax has been paid or is not payable.

  



  

3.2.5 _Closing of Transfer Books_. From and after the Closing Date,
there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Commerce of the
Commerce Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are
presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be exchanged for the
Merger Consideration and canceled as provided in this Section 3.2.

  



  

3.2.6 _Return of Exchange Fund_. At any time following the nine (9)
month period after the Effective Time, BHLB shall be entitled to require the
Exchange Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Exchange Fund which had
been made available to the Exchange Agent and not disbursed to holders of
Certificates (including, without limitation, all interest and other income
received by the Exchange Agent in respect of all funds made available to it),
and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to BHLB (subject
to abandoned property, escheat

  



    

 | 12| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

and other similar laws) with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither BHLB nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any
holder of a Certificate for any Merger Consideration delivered in respect of
such Certificate to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property,
escheat or other similar law.

  



  

3.2.7 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount
as the Exchange Agent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof.

  

 _ _

  

3.2.8 Withholding. BHLB or the Exchange Agent will be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to any holder of Commerce
Common Stock such amounts as BHLB (or any Affiliate thereof) or the Exchange
Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any applicable provision of U.S. federal, state,
local or non-U.S. tax law. To the extent that such amounts are properly
withheld by BHLB or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts will be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
the Commerce Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding
were made by BHLB or the Exchange Agent.

  



  

3.3 Bank Merger.

  



  

BHLB intends to cause the merger of CBTC with and into Berkshire Bank, with
Berkshire Bank as the surviving institution, but retains the right to hold
CBTC as a separate subsidiary or as a division of Berkshire Bank. Subject to
the foregoing and in BHLB's sole determination, following the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, BHLB will cause Berkshire Bank, and Commerce
will cause CBTC, to execute and deliver an agreement and plan of merger in
respect of the Bank Merger. Berkshire Bank will make its commercially
reasonable best efforts to utilize the name and brand of CBTC in Worcester
market area, subject to Regulatory Approval, following the completion of the
Bank Merger.

  



  

3.4 Reservation of Shares.

Common Stock for the purpose of issuing shares of BHLB Common Stock to the
Commerce stockholders in accordance with this Article III.

compliance with any conditions contained therein, the receipt of the Commerce
Stockholder Approval, and compliance by BHLB with the terms and conditions of

Regulatory Condition, or that (ii) any public body or authority having

 | 15| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

affairs of Commerce or CBTC, the consent or approval of which is not required
or pursuant to the rules of which a filing is not required, will object to the
completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

4.6 Financial Statements.

  



  

4.6.1 The Commerce Regulatory Reports have been prepared in all
material respects in accordance with applicable regulatory accounting
principles and practices throughout the periods covered by such reports, and
fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position,
results of operations and changes in shareholders' equity of Commerce as of
and for the periods ended on the dates thereof, in accordance with applicable
regulatory accounting principles applied on a consistent basis.

  



  

4.6.2 Commerce has previously made available to BHLB the Commerce
Financial Statements. The Commerce Financial Statements have been prepared
in accordance with GAAP in all material respects, and (including the related
notes where applicable) fairly present in each case in all material respects
(subject in the case of the unaudited interim statements to normal year-end
adjustments) the consolidated financial position, results of operations and
cash flows of Commerce and the Commerce Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis
as of and for the respective periods ending on the dates thereof, in
accordance with GAAP during the periods involved, except as indicated in the
notes thereto.

  



  

4.6.3 Except as provided in _Commerce Disclosure Schedule 4.6.3_ , at
the date of the most recent consolidated statement of financial
condition included in the Commerce Financial Statements or in the Commerce
Regulatory Reports, Commerce did not have any liabilities, obligations or
loss contingencies of any nature (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise) of a type required to be reflected in such Commerce Financial
Statements or in the Commerce Regulatory Reports or in the footnotes thereto
which are not fully reflected or reserved against therein or fully disclosed
in a footnote thereto, except for liabilities, obligations and loss
contingencies which are not material individually or in the aggregate or
which are incurred in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past
practice, and subject, in the case of any unaudited statements, to normal,
recurring audit adjustments and the absence of footnotes.

  



  

4.7 Taxes.

  



  

Commerce and the Commerce Subsidiaries are members of the same affiliated
group within the meaning of Code Section 1504(a). Commerce, on behalf of
itself and its Subsidiaries, has timely filed or caused to be filed all Tax
Returns (including, but not limited to, those filed on a consolidated,
combined or unitary basis) required to have been filed by Commerce and the
Commerce Subsidiaries prior to the date hereof, or requests for extensions to
file such returns and reports have been timely filed. All such Tax Returns are
true, correct, and complete in all material respects. Commerce and the
Commerce Subsidiaries have timely paid or, prior to the Effective Time will
pay, all Taxes, whether or not shown on such returns or reports, due or
claimed to be due to any Governmental Entity prior to the Effective
Time other than Taxes which are being contested in good faith. Commerce and
the Commerce Subsidiaries have declared on their Tax Returns all positions
taken therein that could give rise to a substantial underpayment of United
States Federal Income Tax within the meaning of Section 6662 of the Code (or
any corresponding provision of state or local laws). The accrued but unpaid
Taxes of Commerce and the Commerce Subsidiaries did not, as of the most
recent Commerce Financial Statements, exceed the reserve for Tax
liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect
timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the
most recent Commerce balance sheet (rather than in any notes thereto).
Commerce and its Subsidiaries are subject to Tax audits in the ordinary
course of business. Commerce management does not believe that an adverse
resolution to any of such audits of which it has Knowledge would be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Commerce. Commerce and
the Commerce Subsidiaries have not been notified in writing by any
jurisdiction that the jurisdiction believes that Commerce or any of the
Commerce Subsidiaries were required to file any Tax Return in such
jurisdiction that was not filed. Neither Commerce nor any of the
Commerce Subsidiaries (A) has been a member of a group with which they have
filed or been included in a combined, consolidated or unitary income Tax
Return other than a group the common parent of which was Commerce or (B) has
any liability for the Taxes of any Person (other than Commerce or any of the
Commerce Subsidiaries) under Treas. Reg. § 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision
of state, local, or non-U.S. law), as a transferee or successor, by contract,
or otherwise. As of the date hereof, all deficiencies proposed in writing as
a result of any audits have been paid or settled. There are no written claims
or assessments pending against Commerce or any Commerce Subsidiary

  



    

 | 16| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

for any alleged deficiency in any Tax, and neither Commerce nor any Commerce
Subsidiary has been notified in writing of any proposed Tax claims or
assessments against Commerce or any Commerce Subsidiary. Commerce and the
Commerce Subsidiaries each have duly and timely withheld, collected and paid
over to the appropriate taxing authority all amounts required to be so
withheld and paid under all applicable laws, and have duly and timely filed
all Tax Returns with respect to such withheld Taxes, within the time
prescribed under any applicable law. Commerce and the Commerce Subsidiaries
have delivered to BHLB true and complete copies of all Income Tax Returns of
Commerce and the Commerce Subsidiaries for taxable periods ending on or after
January 1, 2014. Neither Commerce nor any of the Commerce Subsidiaries is or
has been a party to any "reportable transaction," as defined in Code §
6707A(c)(1) and Treas. Reg. § 1.6011-4(b). Neither Commerce nor any of the
Commerce Subsidiaries has distributed stock of another Person, or has had its
stock distributed by another Person, in a transaction that was purported or
intended to be governed in whole or in part by Code § 355 or Code § 361\.
Neither Commerce nor any of the Commerce Subsidiaries has been a United States
real property holding corporation within the meaning of Code § 897(c)(2)
during the applicable period specified in Code § 897(c)(1)(A)(ii).

  



  

4.8 No Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Neither Commerce nor any Commerce Subsidiary has suffered any Material
Adverse Effect since March 31, 2017 and, to Commerce's Knowledge, no event has
occurred or circumstance arisen since that date which, in the aggregate, has
had or reasonably would be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Commerce.

  



  

4.9 Material Contracts; Leases; Defaults.

  



  

4.9.1 Except as set forth in _Commerce Disclosure Schedule 4.9.1_,
neither Commerce nor any Commerce Subsidiary is a party to or subject to: (i)
any employment, consulting or severance contract or arrangement with any past
or present officer, director, employee or consultant of Commerce or any
Commerce Subsidiary, except for "at will" arrangements; (ii) any plan,
arrangement or contract providing for bonuses, pensions, options, deferred
compensation, retirement payments, profit sharing or similar arrangements for
or with any past or present officers, directors, employees or consultants of
Commerce or any Commerce Subsidiary; (iii) any collective bargaining
agreement with any labor union relating to employees of Commerce or any
Commerce Subsidiary; (iv) any agreement which by its terms limits or affects
the payment of dividends by Commerce or any Commerce Subsidiary; (v) any
instrument evidencing or related to indebtedness for borrowed money in excess
of $100,000, whether directly or indirectly, by way of purchase money
obligation, conditional sale, lease purchase, guaranty or otherwise, in
respect of which Commerce or any Commerce Subsidiary is an obligor to any
Person, which instrument evidences or relates to indebtedness other than
deposits, FHLB advances with a term to maturity not in excess of one (1)
year, repurchase agreements, bankers' acceptances, and transactions in
"federal funds" or which contains financial covenants or other non-customary
restrictions (other than those relating to the payment of principal and
interest when due) which would be applicable on or after the Closing Date to
Commerce or any Commerce Subsidiary; (vi) any other agreement, written or
oral, which is not terminable without cause on sixty (60) days' notice
or less without penalty or payment, or that obligates Commerce or any
Commerce Subsidiary for the payment of more than $60,000 annually or for the
payment of more than $100,000 over its remaining term; or (vii) any agreement
(other than this Agreement), contract, arrangement, commitment or
understanding (whether written or oral) that materially restricts or limits
the conduct of business by Commerce or any Commerce Subsidiary.

  



  

4.9.2 Each real estate lease that will require the consent of the
lessor or its agent as a result of the Merger or the Bank Merger by virtue of
the terms of any such lease, is listed in _Commerce Disclosure Schedule
4.9.2_ identifying the section of the lease that contains such prohibition or
restriction. Subject to any consents that may be required as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to its Knowledge neither
Commerce nor any Commerce Subsidiary is in material default under any material
contract, agreement, commitment, arrangement, lease, insurance policy or
other instrument to which it is a party, by which its assets, business, or
operations may be bound or affected, or under which it or its assets,
business, or operations receive benefits, and, to Commerce's Knowledge, there
has not occurred any event that, with the lapse of time or the giving of
notice or both, would constitute such a default and all such material
contracts, agreements, commitments, arrangements, leases, insurance policies
and other instruments are listed on _Commerce Disclosure Schedule 4.9.2_.

  



  

4.9.3 True and correct copies of agreements, contracts, arrangements
and instruments referred to in Section 4.9.1 and 4.9.2 (each a
"Commerce Material Contract," and collectively, the "Commerce Material

  



    

 | 17| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Contracts") have been made available to BHLB on or before the date hereof,
are listed on _Commerce Disclosure Schedules 4.9.1 and 4.9.2_ and are in full
force and effect without modification on the date hereof. Except as set forth
in _Commerce Disclosure Schedule 4.9.3_, no Commerce Material Contract (i)
provides for acceleration of the vesting of benefits or payments due
thereunder upon the occurrence of a change in ownership or control of
Commerce or any Commerce Subsidiary or upon the occurrence of a subsequent
event; (ii) requires Commerce or any Commerce Subsidiary to provide a benefit
in the form of Commerce Common Stock or determined by reference to the value
of Commerce Common Stock or (iii) contains provisions which permit an
employee, director or independent contractor to terminate such agreement or
arrangement without cause and continue to accrue future benefits thereunder.

  



  

4.10 Ownership of Property; Insurance Coverage.

  



  

4.10.1 Commerce and each Commerce Subsidiary has good and, as to real
property, marketable title to all assets and properties owned by Commerce or
such Commerce Subsidiary, as applicable, in the conduct of its businesses,
whether such assets and properties are real or personal, tangible or
intangible, including assets and property reflected in the most recent
consolidated statement of financial condition contained in the Commerce
Financial Statements or acquired subsequent thereto (except to the extent that
such assets and properties have been disposed of in the ordinary course of
business, since the date of such consolidated statement of financial
condition), subject to no encumbrances, liens, mortgages, security interests
or pledges, except (i) those items which secure liabilities for public or
statutory obligations or any discount with, borrowing from or other
obligations to FHLB, inter-bank credit facilities, reverse repurchase
agreements or any transaction by a Commerce Subsidiary acting in a fiduciary
capacity, and (ii) statutory liens for amounts not yet delinquent or which
are being contested in good faith. Commerce and the Commerce Subsidiaries, as
lessee, have the right under valid and existing leases of real and personal
properties used by Commerce and the Commerce Subsidiaries in the conduct of
their businesses to occupy or use all such properties as presently occupied
and used by each of them. Such existing leases and commitments to lease
constitute or will constitute operating leases for both tax and financial
accounting purposes and the lease expense and minimum rental commitments with
respect to such leases and lease commitments are as disclosed in all
material respects in the notes to the Commerce Financial Statements.

  



  

4.10.2 With respect to all material agreements pursuant to which Commerce
or any Commerce Subsidiary has purchased securities subject to an agreement
to resell, if any, Commerce or such Commerce Subsidiary, as the case may be,
has a lien or security interest (which to Commerce's Knowledge is a valid,
perfected first lien) in the securities or other collateral securing the
repurchase agreement, and the value of such collateral equals or exceeds the
amount of the debt secured thereby.

  



  

4.10.3 Commerce and each Commerce Subsidiary currently maintain insurance
considered by each of them to be reasonable for their respective
operations. Neither Commerce nor any Commerce Subsidiary, has received notice
from any insurance carrier on or before the date hereof that (i) such
insurance will be canceled or that coverage thereunder will be reduced or
eliminated, or (ii) premium costs with respect to such policies of insurance
will be substantially increased. Except as listed on _Commerce Disclosure
Schedule 4.10.3_, there are presently no claims pending under such policies
of insurance and no notices of claim have been given by Commerce or
any Commerce Subsidiary under such policies. All such insurance is valid and
enforceable and in full force and effect (other than insurance that expires
in accordance with its terms), and within the last three (3) years Commerce
and each Commerce Subsidiary has received each type of insurance coverage for
which it has applied and during such periods has not been denied
indemnification for any claims submitted under any of its insurance policies.
_Commerce Disclosure Schedule 4.10.3_ identifies all policies of
insurance maintained by Commerce and each Commerce Subsidiary, including the
name of the insurer, the policy number, the type of policy and any applicable
deductibles, as well as the other matters required to be disclosed under this
Section 4.10.3. Commerce has made available to BHLB copies of all of the
policies listed on _Commerce Disclosure Schedule 4.10.3_.

  



  

4.11 Legal Proceedings.

  



  

There is no suit, action, investigation or proceeding pending or, to its
Knowledge, threatened against or affecting Commerce or any of its Subsidiaries
(and it is not aware of any facts that reasonably would be expected to be the
basis for any such suit, action or proceeding) (1) that involves a
Governmental Entity or Bank Regulator, or (2) that, individually or in the
aggregate, is (A) material to it and its Subsidiaries' businesses or, after
the Effective Time, BHLB's or any of its Subsidiaries' businesses, or (B)
reasonably likely to prevent or delay it from performing

  



    

 | 18|

its obligations under, or consummating the transactions contemplated by, this
Agreement. Except as set forth on _Commerce Disclosure Schedule 4.11_ , there

restriction imposed upon or entered into by Commerce, any of its
Subsidiaries or the assets of it or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

4.12 Compliance with Applicable Law.

  



  

Except as set forth on _Commerce Disclosure Schedule 4.12_ and in Section
4.15:

  



  

4.12.1 To Commerce's Knowledge, Commerce and each Commerce Subsidiary is
in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal, state,
local and foreign statutes, laws, regulations, ordinances, rules, judgments,
orders or decrees applicable to it, its properties, assets and deposits, its

relating to discriminatory business practices, and neither Commerce nor any
Commerce Subsidiary has received any written notice to the contrary.

  



  

4.12.2 Commerce and each Commerce Subsidiary has all material permits,
licenses, authorizations, orders and approvals of, and has made all
filings, applications and registrations with, all Governmental Entities and
Bank Regulators that are required in order to permit it to own or lease its
properties and to conduct its business as presently conducted; all such
permits, licenses, certificates of authority, orders and approvals are in
full force and effect and, to the Knowledge of Commerce, no suspension or
cancellation of any such permit, license, certificate, order or approval is
threatened or will result from the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, subject to obtaining the Regulatory
Approvals.

  



  

4.12.3 For the period beginning January 1, 2014, neither Commerce nor any

Commerce Subsidiary is not in material compliance with any of the statutes,
regulations or ordinances which such Bank Regulator enforces; (ii) threatening
to revoke any license, franchise, permit or governmental authorization; (iii)
requiring or threatening to require Commerce or any Commerce Subsidiary, or

which is charged with the supervision or regulation of banks, or engages in
the insurance of bank deposits, restricting or limiting, or purporting to
restrict or limit the operations of Commerce or any Commerce Subsidiary,
including without limitation any restriction on the payment of dividends; or
(iv) directing, restricting or limiting, or purporting to direct, restrict or

hereinafter referred to as a "Regulatory Agreement"). Except as disclosed in
_Commerce Disclosure Schedule 4.12.3_ , neither Commerce nor any Commerce
Subsidiary has consented to or entered into any Regulatory Agreement that is
currently in effect. Commerce has disclosed to BHLB its most recent
regulatory ratings.

  



  

4.13 Employee Benefit Plans.

written and unwritten pension, retirement, profit-sharing, thrift,
savings, deferred compensation, phantom stock awards, stock appreciation
rights, stock option, employee stock ownership, employee stock purchase,

plans, all employment, change in control, consulting, severance and retention
agreements, all other written employee programs, arrangements or agreements,

all other employee benefit or fringe benefit plans, including "employee
benefit plans" as that term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, currently
adopted, maintained by, sponsored in whole or in part by, or contributed to by
Commerce or any of the Commerce Subsidiaries for the benefit of employees,
former employees, retirees (or the dependents, including spouses, of the
foregoing), directors, independent contractors or other service providers to
Commerce and under

  



    

 | 19| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

which employees, former employees, retirees, dependents, spouses, directors,
or other service providers of Commerce are eligible to participate
(collectively, the "Commerce Benefit Plans"). Commerce has made available to
BHLB true and complete copies of (i) the plan documents and summary
plan descriptions for each written Commerce Benefit Plan, (ii) a summary of
each unwritten Commerce Benefit Plan (if applicable), (iii) the actuarial
valuation reports with respect to each tax-qualified Commerce Benefit Plan
that is a defined benefit pension plan for the three (3) most recent years,
(iv) all related trust agreements, insurance contracts or other funding
agreements which currently implement the Commerce Benefit Plans (if
applicable), (v) the most recent IRS determination letter with respect to
each tax-qualified Commerce Benefit Plan (or, for a Commerce Benefit Plan
maintained under a pre-approved prototype or volume submitter plan, the IRS
determination letter on such pre-approved plan) and (vi) all substantive
correspondence relating to any liability of or non-compliance relating to any
Commerce Benefit Plan addressed to or received from the IRS, the
Department of Labor or any other Governmental Entity within the past three
(3) years. Each Commerce Benefit Plan that may be subject to Section 409A of
the Code ("Commerce Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan") has been
maintained and operated in compliance with Section 409A of the Code.

  



  

4.13.2 All Commerce Benefit Plans are in material compliance with (and
have been managed and administrated in all material respects in
accordance with) the applicable terms of ERISA, the Code and any other
applicable laws. Except as set forth on _Commerce Disclosure Schedule
4.13.2_, each Commerce Benefit Plan governed by ERISA that is intended to be
a qualified retirement plan under Section 401(a) of the Code has either (i)
received a favorable determination letter from the IRS (and Commerce is not
aware of any circumstances likely to result in revocation of any such
favorable determination letter) or timely application has been made therefore,
or (ii) is maintained under a prototype plan which has been approved by the
IRS and is entitled to rely upon the IRS National Office opinion letter
issued to the prototype plan sponsor. To the Knowledge of Commerce and the
Commerce Subsidiaries, there exists no fact which would adversely affect the
qualification of any of the Commerce Benefit Plans intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code, or any threatened or pending claim against
any of the Commerce Benefit Plans or their fiduciaries by any
participant, beneficiary or Governmental Entity (other than routine claims
for benefits).

  



  

4.13.3 No "defined benefit plan" (as defined in Section 414(j) of the
Code) has been maintained within the last six (6) years by Commerce or any of
its ERISA Affiliates for the benefit of the employees or former employees of
Commerce or its Subsidiaries.

  



  

4.13.4 Within the last six (6) years, neither Commerce nor any of its
ERISA Affiliates maintained or had any obligation to contribute to a
Commerce Benefit Plan which is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of
Section 3(37) of ERISA, and within the last six (6) years neither Commerce
nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has incurred any withdrawal liability within
the meaning of Section 4201 of ERISA to any such "multiemployer plan." Within
the last six (6) years, neither Commerce nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has
incurred any unsatisfied liability (other than PBGC premiums) to the PBGC, the
IRS or any other individual or entity under Title IV of ERISA or Section 412
of the Code, with respect to any Commerce Benefit Plan, and, to Commerce's
Knowledge, no event or condition exists that would reasonably be expected to
result in the imposition of any liability on Commerce or any of its ERISA
Affiliates under such provisions or that could reasonably be expected to have
an adverse effect on BHLB or Berkshire Bank.

  



  

4.13.5 Commerce has complied in all material respects with the notice and
continuation requirements of Parts 6 and 7 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA
and Section 4980B of the Code ("COBRA"), and the regulations thereunder. All
reports, statements, returns and other information required to be furnished
or filed with respect to Commerce Benefit Plans have been timely
furnished, filed or both in accordance with Sections 101 through 105 of ERISA
and Sections 6057 through 6059 of the Code, and they are true, correct and
complete. To Commerce's Knowledge, records with respect to Commerce Benefit
Plans have been maintained in compliance with Section 107 of ERISA. To
Commerce's Knowledge, neither Commerce nor any other fiduciary (as that term
is defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA) with respect to any of Commerce Benefit
Plans has any liability for any breach of any fiduciary duties under Sections
404, 405 or 409 of ERISA. No Commerce Benefit Plan fails to meet the
applicable requirements of Section 105(h)(2) of the Code.

  



  

4.13.6 Commerce has not, with respect to any Commerce Benefit Plan, nor,
to Commerce's Knowledge, has any administrator of any Commerce Benefit Plan,
the related trusts or any trustee thereof, engaged

  



    

 | 20| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

in any non-exempt prohibited transaction which would subject Commerce, any

 | 28| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

imposition of any condition (financial or otherwise) or requirement that
could reasonably be expected by BHLB to result in a Materially Burdensome
Regulatory Condition or that (ii) any public body or authority having
jurisdiction over the affairs of BHLB and Berkshire Bank, the consent or
approval of which is not required or pursuant to the rules of which a filing
is not required, will object to the completion of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

5.6 Financial Statements.

  



  

5.6.1 The BHLB Regulatory Reports have been prepared in all material
respects in accordance with applicable regulatory accounting principles and
practices throughout the periods covered by such statements, and fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated financial position, results
of operations and changes in shareholders' equity of BHLB as of and for the
periods ended on the dates thereof, in accordance with applicable regulatory
accounting principles applied on a consistent basis.

  



  

5.6.2 BHLB has previously made available to Commerce the BHLB Financial
Statements covering periods ended prior to the date hereof. The
BHLB Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP in all
material respects, and (including the related notes where applicable) fairly
present in each case in all material respects (subject in the case of the
unaudited interim statements to normal year-end adjustments) the consolidated
financial position, results of operations and cash flows of BHLB and the
Berkshire Bank on a consolidated basis as of and for the respective periods
ending on the dates thereof, in accordance with GAAP during the
periods involved, except as indicated in the notes thereto, or in the case of
unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q.

  



  

5.6.3 At the date of the most recent consolidated statement of
financial condition included in the BHLB Financial Statements or in the
BHLB Regulatory Reports, BHLB did not have any liabilities, obligations or
loss contingencies of any nature (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise) of a type required to be reflected in such BHLB Financial
Statements or in the footnotes thereto which are not fully reflected or
reserved against therein or fully disclosed in a footnote thereto, except for
liabilities, obligations and loss contingencies which are not material
individually or in the aggregate or which are incurred in the ordinary course
of business, consistent with past practice, and subject, in the case of any
unaudited statements, to normal, recurring audit adjustments and the absence
of footnotes.

  



  

5.7 Taxes.

  



  

5.7.1 Neither BHLB nor any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates has taken
or agreed to take any action, has failed to take any action or knows of any
fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance that could reasonably be expected
to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries are
members of the same affiliated group within the meaning of Code Section
1504(a). BHLB, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, has timely filed or
caused to be filed all Tax Returns (including, but not limited to, those
filed on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis) required to have
been filed by BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries prior to the date hereof, or
requests for extensions to file such returns and reports have been timely
filed. All such Tax Returns are true, correct, and complete in all material
respects. BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries have timely paid or, prior to the
Effective Time will pay, all Taxes, whether or not shown on such returns or
reports, due or claimed to be due to any Governmental Entity prior to the
Effective Time other than Taxes which are being contested in good faith.
BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries have declared on their Tax Returns all
positions taken therein that could give rise to a substantial underpayment of
United States Federal Income Tax within the meaning of Section 6662 of the
Code (or any corresponding provision of state or local laws). The unpaid
accrued but unpaid Taxes of BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries did not, as of the
most recent BHLB Financial Statements, exceed the reserve for Tax liability
(rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect
timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the
most recent BHLB balance sheet (rather than in any notes thereto). BHLB and
its Subsidiaries are subject to Tax audits in the ordinary course of business.
BHLB management does not believe that an adverse resolution to any of such
audits of which it has Knowledge would be reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on BHLB. BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries have not been notified
in writing by any jurisdiction that the jurisdiction believes that BHLB or
any of the BHLB Subsidiaries were required to file any Tax Return in such
jurisdiction that was not filed. Neither BHLB nor any of the BHLB
Subsidiaries (A) has been a member of a group with which they have filed or
been included in

  



    

 | 29| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

a combined, consolidated or unitary income Tax Return other than a group the
common parent of which was BHLB or (B) has any liability for the Taxes of any
Person (other than BHLB or any of the BHLB Subsidiaries) under Treas. Reg. §
1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S. law), as a
transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise. As of the date hereof, all
deficiencies proposed in writing as a result of any audits have been paid or
settled. There are no written claims or assessments pending against BHLB or
any BHLB Subsidiary for any alleged deficiency in any Tax, and neither BHLB
nor any BHLB Subsidiary has been notified in writing of any proposed
Tax claims or assessments against BHLB or any BHLB Subsidiary. BHLB and the
BHLB Subsidiaries each have duly and timely withheld, collected and paid over
to the appropriate taxing authority all amounts required to be so withheld and
paid under all applicable laws, and have duly and timely filed all Tax
Returns with respect to such withheld Taxes, within the time prescribed under
any applicable law. BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries have delivered to Commerce
true and complete copies of all Tax Returns of BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries
for taxable periods ending on or after December 31, 2014. Neither BHLB nor any
of the BHLB Subsidiaries is or has been a party to any "reportable
transaction," as defined in Code § 6707A(c)(1) and Treas. Reg. §
1.6011-4(b). Neither BHLB nor any of the BHLB Subsidiaries has distributed
stock of another Person, or has had its stock distributed by another Person,
in a transaction that was purported or intended to be governed in whole or in
part by Code § 355 or Code § 361. Neither BHLB nor any of the BHLB
Subsidiaries has been a United States real property holding corporation within
the meaning of Code § 897(c)(2) during the applicable period specified in
Code § 897(c)(1)(A)(ii).

  



  

5.8 No Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Neither BHLB nor any BHLB Subsidiary has suffered any Material Adverse Effect
since March 31, 2017 and, to BHLB's Knowledge, no event has occurred or
circumstance arisen since that date which, in the aggregate, has had or is
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on BHLB.

  



  

5.9 Ownership of Property; Insurance Coverage.

  



  

5.9.1 Except as set forth on _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.9.1_ , BHLB
and each BHLB Subsidiary has good and, as to real property, marketable title
to all assets and properties owned by BHLB or such BHLB Subsidiary, as
applicable, in the conduct of its businesses, whether such assets and
properties are real or personal, tangible or intangible, including assets and
property reflected in the most recent consolidated statement of financial
condition contained in the BHLB Financial Statements or acquired subsequent
thereto (except to the extent that such assets and properties have been
disposed of in the ordinary course of business, since the date of
such consolidated statement of financial condition), subject to no
encumbrances, liens, mortgages, security interests or pledges, except (i)
those items which secure liabilities for public or statutory obligations or
any discount with, borrowing from or other obligations to FHLB, inter-bank
credit facilities, reverse repurchase agreements or any transaction by an BHLB
Subsidiary acting in a fiduciary capacity, and (ii) statutory liens for
amounts not yet delinquent or which are being contested in good faith. BHLB
and the BHLB Subsidiaries, as lessee, have the right under valid and existing
leases of real and personal properties used by BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries
in the conduct of their businesses to occupy or use all such properties as
presently occupied and used by each of them. Such existing leases and
commitments to lease constitute or will constitute operating leases for
both tax and financial accounting purposes and the lease expense and minimum
rental commitments with respect to such leases and lease commitments are as
disclosed in all material respects in the notes to the BHLB Financial
Statements.

  



  

5.9.2 With respect to all material agreements pursuant to which BHLB or
any BHLB Subsidiary has purchased securities subject to an agreement to
resell, if any, BHLB or such BHLB Subsidiary, as the case may be, has a lien
or security interest (which to BHLB's Knowledge is a valid, perfected first
lien) in the securities or other collateral securing the repurchase agreement,
and the value of such collateral equals or exceeds the amount of the debt
secured thereby.

  



  

5.9.3 BHLB and each BHLB Subsidiary currently maintain insurance
considered by each of them to be reasonable for their respective
operations. Neither BHLB nor any BHLB Subsidiary, has received notice from
any insurance carrier on or before the date hereof that (i) such insurance
will be canceled or that coverage thereunder will be reduced or eliminated, or
(ii) premium costs with respect to such policies of insurance will be
substantially increased. Except as listed on _BHLB Disclosure Schedule
5.9.3_, there are presently no claims pending under such policies of
insurance and no notices of claim have been given by BHLB or any BHLB
Subsidiary under

  



    

 | 30| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

such policies. All such insurance is valid and enforceable and in full force
and effect (other than insurance that expires in accordance with its terms),
and within the last three (3) years BHLB and each BHLB Subsidiary has
received each type of insurance coverage for which it has applied and
during such periods has not been denied indemnification for any claims
submitted under any of its insurance policies. _BHLB Disclosure Schedule
5.9.3_ identifies all policies of insurance maintained by BHLB and each BHLB
Subsidiary, including the name of the insurer, the policy number, the type of
policy and any applicable deductibles, as well as the other matters required
to be disclosed under this Section 5.9.3. BHLB has made available to Commerce
copies of all of the policies listed on _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.9.3_.

  



  

5.10 Legal Proceedings.

  



  

Except as set forth on _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.10_ , there is no suit,
action, investigation or proceeding pending or, to its knowledge, threatened
against or affecting BHLB or any of its Subsidiaries (and it is not aware of
any facts that reasonably could be expected to form the basis for any such
suit, action or proceeding) (1) that involves a Governmental Entity or Bank
Regulator, or (2) that, individually or in the aggregate, is (A) material to
it and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or reasonably likely to result in a
restriction on its or any of its Subsidiaries' businesses or, or after the
Effective Time, BHLB's or any of its Subsidiaries' businesses, or (B)
reasonably likely to prevent or delay it from performing its obligations
under, or consummating the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement.
There is no injunction, order, award, judgment, settlement, decree or
regulatory restriction imposed upon or entered into by BHLB, any of its
Subsidiaries or the assets of it or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

5.11 Compliance with Applicable Law.

  



  

Except as set forth on _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.11_:

  



  

5.11.1 To BHLB's Knowledge, BHLB and each BHLB Subsidiary is in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal, state, local
and foreign statutes, laws, regulations, ordinances, rules, judgments, orders
or decrees applicable to it, its properties, assets and deposits, its
business, its conduct of business and its relationship with its employees,
including, without limitation, the Uniting and Strengthening America by
Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act

Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Consumer Credit Protection Act, the
Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collections Act, the Fair Housing
Act, the CRA, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and all other applicable fair
lending laws and other laws relating to discriminatory business practices, and
neither BHLB nor any BHLB Subsidiary has received any written notice to the
contrary.

  



  

5.11.2 BHLB and each BHLB Subsidiary has all material permits, licenses,
authorizations, orders and approvals of, and has made all
filings, applications and registrations with, all Governmental Entities and
Bank Regulators that are required in order to permit it to own or lease its
properties and to conduct its business as presently conducted; all such
permits, licenses, certificates of authority, orders and approvals are in
full force and effect and, to the Knowledge of BHLB, no suspension or
cancellation of any such permit, license, certificate, order or approval is
threatened or will result from the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, subject to obtaining the approvals set forth
in Section 8.3.

  



  

5.11.3 For the period beginning January 1, 2014, neither BHLB nor any
BHLB Subsidiary has received any written notification or any
other communication from any Bank Regulator or Insurance Regulator (i)
asserting that BHLB or any BHLB Subsidiary is not in material compliance with
any of the statutes, regulations or ordinances which such Bank Regulator or
Insurance Regulator enforces; (ii) threatening to revoke any license,
franchise, permit or governmental authorization; (iii) requiring or
threatening to require BHLB or any BHLB Subsidiary, or indicating that BHLB
or any BHLB Subsidiary may be required, to enter into a cease and desist
order, agreement or memorandum of understanding or any other agreement with
any federal or state governmental agency or authority which is charged with
the supervision or regulation of banks, bank holding companies or insurance
agencies, or engages in the insurance of bank deposits, restricting or
limiting, or purporting to restrict or limit the operations of BHLB or any
BHLB Subsidiary, including without limitation any restriction on the payment
of dividends; or (iv) directing, restricting or limiting, or purporting to
direct, restrict or limit the operations of BHLB or any BHLB Subsidiary.
Neither BHLB nor any BHLB Subsidiary has consented to or entered into any
Regulatory

  



    

 | 31|

Agreement that is currently in effect. The most recent regulatory rating
given to Berkshire Bank as to compliance with the CRA is "Satisfactory" or
better.

  



  

5.11.4 Berkshire Bank is, and immediately after the Effective Time will
be, "well capitalized," as such term is defined in the rules and regulations
promulgated by the FDIC, as amended from time to time. BHLB is, and
immediately after the Effective Time will be, "well capitalized," as such
term is defined in the rules and regulations promulgated by the FDIC, as
amended from time to time.

  



  

5.12 Employee Benefit Plans.

  



  

5.12.1 _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.12.1_ contains a list of all written
and unwritten pension, retirement, profit-sharing, thrift, savings, deferred
compensation, phantom stock awards, stock appreciation rights, stock option,
employee stock ownership, employee stock purchase, restricted stock,
severance pay, retention, vacation, bonus or other incentive plans, all
employment, change in control, consulting, severance and retention
agreements, all other written employee programs, arrangements or agreements,
all medical, vision, dental, disability, life insurance, workers'
compensation, employee assistance or other health or welfare plans, and
all other employee benefit or fringe benefit plans, including "employee
benefit plans" as that term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, currently
adopted, maintained by, sponsored in whole or in part by, or contributed to by
BHLB or any of its ERISA Affiliates for the benefit of employees, former
employees, retirees (or the dependents, including spouses, of the foregoing),
directors, independent contractors or other service providers to BHLB and
under which employees, former employees, retirees, dependents, spouses,
directors, or other service providers of BHLB are eligible to participate
(collectively, the "BHLB Benefit Plans"). BHLB has furnished or otherwise
made available to Commerce true and complete copies of (i) the plan documents
and summary plan descriptions for each written BHLB Benefit Plan, (ii) a
summary of each unwritten BHLB Benefit Plan (if applicable), (iii)
the actuarial valuation reports with respect to each tax-qualified BHLB
Benefit Plan that is a defined benefit pension plan for the three (3) most
recent years, (iv) all related trust agreements, insurance contracts or other
funding agreements which currently implement the BHLB Benefit Plans (if
applicable), (v) the most recent IRS determination letter with respect to each
tax-qualified BHLB Benefit Plan (or, for a BHLB Benefit Plan maintained under
a pre-approved prototype or volume submitter plan, the IRS
determination letter on such pre-approved plan) and (vi) all substantive
correspondence relating to any liability of or non-compliance relating to any
BHLB Benefit Plan addressed to or received from the IRS, the Department of
Labor or any other Governmental Entity within the past three (3) years. Each
BHLB Benefit Plan that may be subject to Section 409A of the Code ("BHLB Non-
qualified Deferred Compensation Plan") has been maintained and operated in
compliance with Section 409A of the Code.

  



  

5.12.2 All BHLB Benefit Plans are in material compliance with (and have
been managed and administrated in all material respects in accordance with)
the applicable terms of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable laws. Except
as set forth on _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.12.2_, each BHLB Benefit Plan
governed by ERISA that is intended to be a qualified retirement plan under
Section 401(a) of the Code has either (i) received a favorable determination
letter from the IRS (and BHLB is not aware of any circumstances likely to
result in revocation of any such favorable determination letter) or timely
application has been made therefore, or (ii) is maintained under a prototype
plan which has been approved by the IRS and is entitled to rely upon the IRS
National Office opinion letter issued to the prototype plan sponsor. To the
Knowledge of BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries, there exists no fact which would
adversely affect the qualification of any of the BHLB Benefit Plans intended
to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, or any threatened or
pending claim against any of the BHLB Benefit Plans or their fiduciaries by
any participant, beneficiary or Governmental Entity (other than routine
claims for benefits).

  



  

5.12.3 Except as set forth on _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.12.3_, no
"defined benefit plan" (as defined in Section 414(j) of the Code) has been
maintained within the last six (6) years by BHLB or any of its ERISA
Affiliates for the benefit of the employees or former employees of BHLB or
its Subsidiaries.

  



  

5.12.4 Within the last six (6) years, neither BHLB nor any of its ERISA
Affiliates maintained or had any obligation to contribute to a BHLB
Benefit Plan which is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section
3(37) of ERISA, and within the last six (6) years neither BHLB nor any of its
ERISA Affiliates has incurred any withdrawal liability within the meaning of
Section 4201 of ERISA to any such "multiemployer plan." Within the last six
(6) years, neither BHLB nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has incurred any
unsatisfied liability (other than

  



    

 | 32| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

PBGC premiums) to the PBGC, the IRS or any other individual or entity under
Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code with respect to any BHLB Benefit
Plan, and no event or condition exists that would reasonably be expected to
result in the imposition of any liability on BHLB or any of its
ERISA Affiliates under such provisions or that could reasonably be expected
to have an adverse effect on BHLB or Berkshire Bank.

  



  

5.12.5 BHLB has complied in all material respects with the notice and
continuation requirements of Parts 6 and 7 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA
and Section 4980B of the Code, and the regulations thereunder. All reports,
statements, returns and other information required to be furnished or filed
with respect to BHLB Benefit Plans have been timely furnished, filed or both
in accordance with Sections 101 through 105 of ERISA and Sections 6057
through 6059 of the Code, and they are true, correct and complete. To BHLB's
Knowledge, records with respect to BHLB Benefit Plans have been maintained in
compliance with Section 107 of ERISA. To BHLB's Knowledge, neither BHLB nor
any other fiduciary (as that term is defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA) with
respect to any of BHLB Benefit Plans has any liability for any breach of any
fiduciary duties under Sections 404, 405 or 409 of ERISA. No BHLB Benefit
Plan fails to meet the applicable requirements of Section 105(h)(2) of the
Code (determined without regard to whether such BHLB Benefit Plan is self-
insured).

  



  

5.12.6 BHLB has not, with respect to any BHLB Benefit Plan, nor, to
BHLB's Knowledge, has any administrator of any BHLB Benefit Plan, the related
trusts or any trustee thereof, engaged in any non-exempt prohibited
transaction which would subject BHLB, any ERISA Affiliate of BHLB, or any
BHLB Benefit Plan to a Tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by
ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code, or to any other liability under ERISA.

  



  

5.12.7 Except as set forth on _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.12.7_, BHLB
has no liability for retiree health and life benefits under any BHLB Benefit
Plan other than any benefits required under COBRA or similar state laws.

  



  

5.12.8 Except as set forth on _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.12.8_, neither
the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (A) result in any payment (including
severance) becoming due to any director or any employee of BHLB from BHLB
under any BHLB Benefit Plan, (B) increase any benefits otherwise payable under
any BHLB Benefit Plan or (C) result in any acceleration of the time of
payment or vesting of any such benefit. Except as set forth on
_BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.12.8_, no payment which in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is or may reasonably be expected
to be made by, from or with respect to any BHLB Benefit Plan, either alone or
in conjunction with any other payment will or could properly be characterized
as an "excess parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code on which an
excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code is payable or will or could, either
individually or collectively, provide for any payment by BHLB or any of its
ERISA Affiliates that would not be deductible under Code Section 162(m).

  



  

5.12.9 The actuarial present values of all accrued BHLB Non-qualified
Deferred Compensation Plans (including, to the extent applicable,
entitlements under any executive compensation, supplemental retirement, or
employment agreement) of employees and former employees of BHLB and their
respective beneficiaries, other than entitlements accrued pursuant to funded
retirement plans subject to the provisions of Section 412 of the Code or
Section 302 of ERISA, have been fully reflected on the BHLB Financial
Statements to the extent required by and in accordance with GAAP.

  



  

5.12.10 There is not, and has not been, any trust or fund maintained by or
contributed to by BHLB or its employees to fund an employee benefit plan
which would constitute a Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary Association or a
"welfare benefit fund" within the meaning of Section 419(a) of the Code.

  



  

5.12.11 No claim, lawsuit, arbitration or other action has been asserted or
instituted or, to the Knowledge of BHLB, has been threatened or is
anticipated, against any BHLB Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for
benefits and appeals of such claims), BHLB or any BHLB Subsidiary or any
director, officer or employee thereof, or any of the assets of any trust of
any BHLB Benefit Plan or any fiduciary thereof.

5.13 Brokers, Finders and Financial Advisors.

  



  

Neither BHLB nor any BHLB Subsidiary, nor any of their respective officers,
directors, employees or agents, has employed any broker, finder or financial
advisor in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
or incurred any liability or commitment for any fees or commissions to
any such Person in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except for the retention of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC by BHLB and
the fee payable thereto.

  



  

5.14 Environmental Matters.

  



  

5.14.1 Except as may be set forth in _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.14_,
with respect to BHLB and each BHLB Subsidiary:

  



  

(A) To the Knowledge of BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries, each of BHLB
and the BHLB Subsidiaries, and the BHLB Loan Properties (as defined in
Section 5.14.2) are, and have been, in material compliance with any
Environmental Laws;

  



  

(B) Neither BHLB nor any BHLB Subsidiary has received written notice
in the last five (5) years that there is any material suit, claim,
action, demand, executive or administrative order, directive, request for
information, investigation or proceeding pending and, to the Knowledge of
BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries, no such action is threatened, before any
court, governmental agency or other forum against them or any BHLB Loan
Property (x) for alleged noncompliance (including by any predecessor) with, or
liability under, any Environmental Law or (y) relating to the presence of or
release into the environment of any Materials of Environmental Concern,
whether or not occurring at or on a site owned, leased or operated by BHLB, or

preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. BHLB has designed
and implemented disclosure controls and procedures (within the meaning of

information relating to it and its Subsidiaries is made known to its
management by others within those entities as appropriate to allow

required by the Exchange Act and Section 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act.

effective. It has previously disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation
prior to the date hereof, to its auditors and the audit committee of the
Commerce Board; (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting and (B)
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in its internal controls over financial
reporting.

  



  

5.17.3 Since December 31, 2014, (A) neither BHLB nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor, to its knowledge, any director, officer, employee,

received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the
accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods
(including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and
accruals) of it or any of its subsidiaries or their respective internal
accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion
or claim that it or any of its subsidiaries has engaged in questionable
accounting or auditing practices, and (B) no attorney representing BHLB or
any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by it or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities
laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by BHLB or any of its
officers, directors, employees or agents to its board of directors or any

and compensation) without prior consultation with BHLB and, to the extent
relating to post-Closing employment, benefit or compensation information
without the prior consent of BHLB (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) or issue any broadly distributed communication of a
general nature to customers without the prior approval of BHLB (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as required by
law or for communications in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice that do not relate to the Merger or other transactions
contemplated hereby;

  



  

(AA) make, change or rescind any material election concerning Taxes or
Tax Returns, file any amended Tax Return, enter into any closing
agreement with respect to Taxes, settle or compromise any material Tax claim

commit to do, any of the foregoing.

6.3 Current Information.

  



  

6.3.1 During the period from the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time, Commerce will cause one or more of its representatives to
confer with representatives of BHLB to inform BHLB regarding Commerce's
operations at such times as BHLB may reasonably request. Commerce will
promptly notify BHLB of any change in the ordinary course of its business or
in the operation of its properties and, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, of any governmental complaints, investigations or hearings (or
communications indicating that the same may be contemplated), or the
institution or the threat of material litigation involving Commerce or any
Commerce Subsidiary. Without limiting the foregoing, senior officers of BHLB
and Commerce shall meet monthly to review, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, the financial and operational affairs of Commerce and the
Commerce Subsidiaries, and Commerce shall give due consideration to BHLB's
input on such matters, with the understanding that, notwithstanding any other
provision contained in this Agreement, neither BHLB nor Berkshire Bank shall
under any circumstance be permitted to exercise control of Commerce or any
Commerce Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

6.3.2 Commerce and BHLB shall cooperate regarding a plan for the
conversion of data processing and related electronic informational systems
of Commerce to those used by BHLB, which planning shall include, but not be
limited to, discussion of the possible termination by Commerce of third-party
service provider arrangements effective at the Effective Time or at a date
thereafter, non-renewal of personal property leases and software licenses
used by Commerce in connection with its systems operations, retention of
outside consultants and additional employees to assist with the conversion,
and outsourcing, as appropriate, of proprietary or self-provided
system services, it being understood that Commerce shall not be obligated to
take any such action prior to the Effective Time and, unless Commerce
otherwise agrees and provided it is permitted by applicable law, no conversion
shall take place prior to the Effective Time. BHLB and Berkshire Bank shall
indemnify Commerce for any reasonable out-of-pocket fees, expenses, or charges
that Commerce or any Commerce Subsidiary may incur as a result of taking, at
the request of BHLB or any BHLB Subsidiary, any action to facilitate the
conversion.

  



  

6.3.3 Commerce shall provide BHLB, within fifteen (15) Business Days of
the end of each calendar month, a written list of nonperforming assets (the
term "nonperforming assets," for purposes of this subsection, means (i) loans
that are "troubled debt restructuring" as defined in Accounting Standards
Codification 310-40, (ii) loans on nonaccrual, (iii) real estate owned, (iv)
all loans ninety (90) days or more past due as of the end of such month and
(v) and impaired loans. On a monthly basis, Commerce shall provide BHLB with
a schedule of all (x) loan grading changes and (y) loan approvals, which
schedule shall indicate the loan amount, loan type and other material features
of the loan. Commerce will promptly prepare and provide BHLB with the minutes
of all Commerce and CBTC officer and director loan committee meetings.

  



  

6.3.4 Commerce shall promptly inform BHLB, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, upon receiving notice of any legal, administrative,
arbitration or other proceedings, demands, notices, audits or investigations
(by any federal, state or local commission, agency or board) relating to the
alleged liability of Commerce or any Commerce Subsidiary under any labor or
employment law.

  



  

6.4 Access to Properties and Records.

  



  

Subject to Section 11.1, Commerce shall permit BHLB access upon reasonable
notice and at reasonable times to its properties and those of the Commerce
Subsidiaries, and shall disclose and make available to BHLB during normal
business hours all of its books and records relating to the assets,
properties, operations, obligations and liabilities, including, but not
limited to, all books of account (including the general ledger), tax records,
minute books of directors' and stockholders' meetings (other than minutes that
discuss any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other
subject matter that Commerce reasonably determines should be kept
confidential), organizational documents, bylaws, material contracts and
agreements, filings with any regulatory authority, litigation files, plans
affecting employees, and any other business activities or prospects in which
BHLB may have a reasonable interest; _provided, however,_  that Commerce
shall not be required to take any action that would provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure, in Commerce's
reasonable judgment, would interfere with the normal conduct of Commerce's
business or would violate or prejudice the rights or business interests or
confidences of any customer or other Person or entity or would result in the
waiver by it of the privilege protecting communications between it and any of
its counsel or contravene any applicable law. Commerce shall

  



    

 | 42| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

provide and shall request its auditors to provide BHLB with such historical
financial information regarding it (and related audit reports and consents) as
BHLB may reasonably request for Securities Law disclosure purposes. BHLB
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any interference with
Commerce's regular business operations during any such access to Commerce's
property, books and records. Commerce and each Commerce Subsidiary shall
permit BHLB, at BHLB's expense, to (i) cause a Phase I environmental
assessment to be performed at any physical location owned or occupied by
Commerce or any Commerce Subsidiary and (ii) cause an appraisal to be
performed in respect of any real property owned by Commerce or any Commerce
Subsidiary.

  



  

6.5 Financial and Other Statements.

  



  

6.5.1 Promptly upon receipt thereof, Commerce will furnish to BHLB
copies of each annual, interim or special audit of the books of Commerce
and the Commerce Subsidiaries made by its independent registered public
accountants and copies of all internal control reports submitted to Commerce
by such accountants, or by any other accounting firm rendering internal audit
services, in connection with each annual, interim or special audit of the
books of Commerce and the Commerce Subsidiaries made by such accountants.

  



  

6.5.2 As soon as reasonably available, but in no event later than the
date such documents are filed with the MDOB, FRB or FDIC, Commerce will
deliver to BHLB the Commerce Regulatory Report filed by Commerce or CBTC.
Within twenty-five (25) days after the end of each month, CBTC will deliver
to BHLB a consolidating balance sheet and a consolidating statement of
operations, without related notes, for such month prepared in accordance with
current financial reporting practices, as well as a month-end and year to date
comparison to budget.

  



  

6.5.3 To the extent permitted by applicable law, Commerce promptly will
advise upon receipt and permit review by BHLB of any inquiry or examination
report of any Bank Regulator with respect to the condition or activities of
Commerce or CBTC.

  



  

6.5.4 With reasonable promptness, Commerce will furnish to BHLB its
quarterly and annual reports and such additional financial data that
Commerce possesses and as BHLB may reasonably request, including without
limitation, detailed monthly financial statements and loan reports and
detailed deposit reports.

  



  

6.6 Maintenance of Insurance.

  



  

Commerce shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain, and to cause
the Commerce Subsidiaries to maintain, insurance in such amounts as are
reasonable to cover such risks as are customary in relation to the character
and location of its properties and the nature of its business, with such
coverage and in such amounts not less than that maintained by Commerce and
the Commerce Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement and set forth in
_Commerce Disclosure Schedule 4.10.3_. Commerce will promptly inform BHLB if
Commerce or any Commerce Subsidiary receives notice from an insurance carrier
that (i) an insurance policy will be canceled or that coverage thereunder will
be reduced or eliminated, or (ii) premium costs with respect to any policy of
insurance will be substantially increased.

  



  

6.7 Disclosure Supplements.

  



  

From time to time prior to the Effective Time, Commerce will promptly
supplement or amend the Commerce Disclosure Schedule delivered in connection
herewith with respect to any matter hereafter arising which, if existing,
occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
be set forth or described in such Commerce Disclosure Schedule or which is
necessary to correct any information in such Commerce Disclosure Schedule
which has been rendered materially inaccurate thereby. No supplement or
amendment to such Commerce Disclosure Schedule shall have any effect for the
purpose of determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article IX.

  



    

 | 43| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

6.8 Consents and Approvals of Third Parties.

  



  

Commerce shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, and shall cause each
Commerce Subsidiary to use its commercially reasonable efforts, to obtain as
soon as practicable all consents and approvals of any other Persons or
entities necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

  



  

6.9 All Reasonable Efforts.

  



  

Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, Commerce agrees to use,
and agrees to cause each Commerce Subsidiary to use, all commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary under applicable laws and regulations
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

6.10 Failure to Fulfill Conditions.

  



  

In the event that Commerce determines that a condition to its obligation to
complete the Merger cannot be fulfilled and that it will not waive that
condition, it will promptly notify BHLB.

  



  

6.11 No Solicitation.

  



  

6.11.1 From and after the date hereof until the termination of this
Agreement, neither Commerce, nor any Commerce Subsidiary, nor any of
their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents and
affiliates including, without limitation, any investment banker, attorney or
accountant retained by Commerce or any of the Commerce Subsidiaries
(collectively, "Representatives"), will, directly or indirectly, initiate,
solicit or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public
information or assistance) any inquiries or the making of any proposal that
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal (as defined by Section 6.11.4), or enter into or
maintain or continue discussions or negotiate with any Person in
furtherance of such inquiries or to obtain an Acquisition Proposal or agree
to or endorse any Acquisition Proposal, or authorize or permit any of its
officers, directors, or employees or any of its Subsidiaries or any investment
banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative
retained by any of its Subsidiaries to take any such action, and Commerce
shall notify BHLB orally and in writing (as promptly as practicable but no
later than one business day of receipt of such inquiry or proposal) of all of
the relevant details relating to all inquiries and proposals which Commerce or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors or
employees, or, to Commerce's Knowledge, investment bankers, financial
advisors, attorneys, accountants or other representatives of Commerce may
receive relating to any of such matters; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing contained in this Section 6.11 shall prohibit the Board of Directors
of Commerce from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under federal
or state law; or (ii) prior to the time of the Commerce Stockholder vote to
approve this Agreement at the Commerce Stockholder Meeting, furnishing
information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, any Person
or entity that makes an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal, if, and only to the
extent that (A) such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of
this Section 6.11 by Commerce, (B) the Board of Directors of Commerce or any
appropriate committee thereof has determined in its good faith judgment,
after consultation with Commerce's financial advisor and outside
counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to be
consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into account all
legal, financial (including the financing terms thereof) and regulatory
aspects of the proposal and the Person making the proposal, and (C) such
Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to result in a transaction more
favorable to Commerce stockholders from a financial point of view than the
Merger (taking into account all relevant factors, including, without
limitation, the timing of consummation as compared to the Merger and after
giving effect to all of the adjustments, if any, which may be offered by BHLB
pursuant to Section 10.1.8) (such proposal that satisfies clauses (A), (B)
and (C) being referred to herein as a "Superior Proposal");  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that a Superior Proposal may consist of multiple Acquisition
Proposals that, taken together, satisfy all of the requirements set forth in
this definition; _provided_ , _further_ , nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prohibit Commerce and, if applicable, any of its Representatives from
(i) informing any Person of the existence of the provisions of this Section
6.11, (ii) contacting any Person solely to clarify the terms and conditions of
an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) otherwise disclosing any information to its
stockholders that the Commerce Board of Directors determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that (i) it is required
to disclose to Commerce's stockholders under applicable law, or (ii) for the
Board of Directors to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law,
subject to compliance with the

  



    

 | 44| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

requirements of this Section 6.11 and Section 6.13. Commerce shall promptly,
but in no event later than one (1) calendar day, notify BHLB of such
inquiries, proposals or offers received by, any such information requested
from, or any such discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated or
continued with Commerce or any of its representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the material
terms and conditions of any inquiries, proposals or offers, and receives from
such Person an executed confidentiality agreement in form and substance
identical in all material respects to the Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

6.11.2 "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any proposal or offer as to any
of the following (other than the transactions contemplated
hereunder) involving Commerce or any of its Subsidiaries: (i) any merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, or other similar
transactions; (ii) any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or
other disposition of 25% or more of the assets of Commerce and the Commerce
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a single transaction or series of
transactions; (iii)  any tender offer or exchange offer for 25% or more of
the outstanding shares of capital stock of Commerce or the filing of a
registration statement under the Securities Act in connection therewith; or
(iv) any public announcement of a proposal, plan or intention to do any of
the foregoing or any agreement to engage in any of the foregoing.

  



  

6.12 Reserves and Merger-Related Costs.

  



  

Prior to the Effective Time, each of Commerce and its Subsidiaries shall,
consistent with GAAP and applicable U.S. banking laws and regulations, modify
or change its loan, OREO, accrual, reserve, tax, litigation and real estate
valuation policies and practices (including loan classifications and levels
of reserves) so as to be applied on a basis that is consistent with that of
BHLB, provided, however, that no such modifications or changes need be made
prior to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 9.1.1 and
9.1.3; _provided further,_  that in any event, no accrual or reserve made by
Commerce or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 6.12 shall
constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation of or failure to satisfy
any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, condition or other
provision of this Agreement or otherwise be considered in determining whether
any such breach, violation or failure to satisfy shall have occurred. The
recording of any such adjustments shall not be deemed to imply any
misstatement of previously furnished financial statements or information and
shall not be construed as concurrence of Commerce or its management with any
such adjustments.

  



  

6.13 Board of Directors and Committee Meetings.

  



  

Following the receipt of all Regulatory Approvals (without regard to any
waiting periods associated therewith), Commerce and the Commerce Subsidiaries
shall permit two (2) representatives of BHLB to attend any meeting of their
Board of Directors, executive committee, loan (or credit) committee and asset
liability committee as observers (together, the "BHLB Observers"), provided
that neither Commerce nor any Commerce Subsidiary shall be required to permit
the BHLB Observers to remain present during any confidential discussion of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or any Acquisition
Proposal or during any other matter that the respective Board of Directors has
been advised of by counsel that such attendance by the BHLB Observers may
violate or be inconsistent with a confidentiality obligation or
fiduciary duty or any legal or regulatory requirement.

  



  

6.14 401(k) Plan Termination.

  



  

If requested by BHLB in writing prior to the Effective Time, and subject to
the occurrence of the Effective Time, Commerce shall cause to be adopted prior
to the Closing Date resolutions of the Board of Directors of Commerce and any
necessary amendments to cease all contributions to any and all 401(k) plans
maintained or sponsored by Commerce or any of its Subsidiaries (the "401(k)
Plan"), and to prohibit the entry of new participants to the 401(k) Plan as
of the day preceding the Closing Date, or to terminate the 401(k) Plan as of
the day preceding the Closing Date. In the sole discretion of BHLB, the 401(k)
Plan may be merged into the BHLB 401(k) Plan or terminated immediately prior
to the Effective Time. The form and substance of such resolutions and any
necessary amendments shall be subject to the review and approval of BHLB,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Commerce shall deliver to BHLB
an executed copy of such resolutions and any necessary amendments as soon as
practicable following their adoption by the Board of Directors of Commerce
and shall fully comply with such resolutions and any necessary amendments. If,
in accordance with this Section 6.14, BHLB requests in writing that Commerce
freeze entry of new participants into the 401(k) Plan, or terminate the 401(k)
Plan, Commerce shall take such actions as BHLB may reasonably require in
furtherance of the assumption of the 401(k) Plan by BHLB,

  



    

 | 45| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

including, but not limited to, adopting such amendments to the 401(k) Plan as
may be necessary to effect such assumption or termination.

  



  

6.15 Commerce Long-Term Incentive Plan.

  



  

 _Commerce Disclosure Schedule 6.15_ sets forth all of the outstanding
phantom stock awards or stock appreciation rights and any other right,
contingent or accrued, granted under the Commerce Long-Term Incentive Plan
("Commerce Phantom Stock Awards") as of the date hereof. Upon the later of
either the receipt of final Regulatory Approval or the receipt of Commerce
Stockholder Approval (the "Trigger Event"), each Commerce Phantom Stock
Award, subject to Commerce's receipt of a phantom stock award surrender
agreement in the form set forth in Section 6.15 of the Company Disclosure
Schedules, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be terminated and
the holder thereof shall be paid by Commerce, no later than ten business days
following the Trigger Event, an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i)
the excess, if any, of $34.00 less the applicable per share exercise price of
that Commerce Phantom Stock Award by (ii) the number of shares of Commerce
Common Stock subject to that Commerce Phantom Stock Award, less any required
tax withholding. The Commerce Long-Term Incentive Plan shall be amended, to
the extent required and permitted by applicable laws, to effectuate this
Section 6.15 and all Commerce Phantom Stock Awards issued thereunder shall
terminate at the Effective Time.

  



  

ARTICLE VII 
 COVENANTS OF BHLB

  



  

7.1 Conduct of Business.

  



  

7.1.1 _Affirmative Covenants_.

  



  

(A) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time, except with the written consent of Commerce, which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, BHLB will, and it
will cause each BHLB Subsidiary to: operate its business only in the usual,
regular and ordinary course of business; use reasonable best efforts to
preserve intact its business organization and assets and maintain its rights
and franchises; and voluntarily take no action which would (i) materially
adversely affect its ability to perform its covenants and agreements under
this Agreement; or (ii) prevent or impede, or be reasonably likely to prevent
or impede, the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code.

  



  

(B) Promptly after the Closing and prior to the Effective Time, BHLB
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent the
Exchange Fund.

  



  

7.2 Disclosure Supplements.

  



  

From time to time prior to the Effective Time, BHLB will promptly supplement
or amend the BHLB Disclosure Schedule delivered in connection herewith with
respect to any matter hereafter arising which, if existing, occurring or
known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set
forth or described in such BHLB Disclosure Schedule or which is necessary to
correct any information in such BHLB Disclosure Schedule which has been
rendered materially inaccurate thereby. No supplement or amendment to such
BHLB Disclosure Schedule shall have any effect for the purpose of determining
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article IX.

  



  

7.3 Consents and Approvals of Third Parties.

  



  

BHLB shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, and shall cause each BHLB
Subsidiary to use its commercially reasonable efforts, to obtain as soon as
practicable all consents and approvals of any other Persons necessary for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

7.4 Reasonable Best Efforts.

  



  

Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, BHLB agrees to use and
agrees to cause each BHLB Subsidiary to use reasonable best efforts in good
faith to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to

  



    

 | 46| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

be done, all things necessary under applicable laws and regulations to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable.

  



  

7.5 Employee Benefits.

  



  

Following the Closing Date, BHLB may choose to maintain any or all of the
Commerce Benefit Plans in its sole discretion and Commerce shall cooperate
with BHLB in order to effect any plan terminations to be made as of the
Effective Time. Nothing herein shall limit the ability of BHLB to amend or
terminate any of the Commerce Benefit Plans.

  



  

7.5.1 _Benefit Plans Covering Commerce Employees_. For any Commerce
Benefit Plan which is terminated and for which there is a comparable
BHLB Benefit Plan of general applicability, BHLB shall take all reasonable
action so that eligible Commerce employees at the Closing Date and who remain
so employed immediately following the Effective Time (the "Continuing Commerce
Employees") shall be entitled to participate in such BHLB Benefit Plan to the
same extent as similarly-situated employees of BHLB (it being understood that
inclusion of Continuing Commerce Employees in the BHLB Benefit Plans may occur
at different times with respect to different plans). BHLB shall cause each
BHLB Benefit Plan in which Continuing Commerce Employees are eligible to
participate to take into account for purposes of eligibility and vesting
under the BHLB Benefit Plans (but not for purposes of benefit accrual) the
service of such employees with Commerce to the same extent as such service was
credited for such purpose by Commerce; _provided, however,_ that such service
shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits. Nothing herein shall limit the ability of BHLB to
amend or terminate any of the Commerce Benefit Plans in accordance with
their terms at any time; _provided, however,_ that BHLB shall continue to
maintain the Commerce Benefit Plans (other than the Commerce Long-Term
Incentive Plan or incentive plans) for which there is a comparable BHLB
Benefit Plan until the Commerce employees are permitted to participate in the
BHLB Benefit Plans, unless such BHLB Benefit Plan has been frozen or
terminated with respect to similarly-situated employees of BHLB or any
Subsidiary of BHLB.

  



  

7.5.2 _Bank 401(k) Plan Participation_. All Continuing Commerce
Employees, that are current Commerce participants as of the Closing
Date, shall be eligible to participate in BHLB's 401(k) plan on the later of
the day after the Closing Date or the date the Commerce 401(k) Plan is
merged, frozen or terminated. All rights to participate in BHLB's 401(k) Plan
are subject to BHLB's right to amend or terminate BHLB's 401(k) plan in its
sole and absolute discretion and are subject to the terms of BHLB's 401(k)
plan including, but not limited to, the eligibility and vesting provisions of
such plan. Continuing Commerce Employees shall continue to participate in the
Commerce 401(k) Plan or its successor, subject to Section 6.14 of this
Agreement and as the plan may be further amended in the sole discretion of
BHLB.

  



  

7.5.3 _Welfare Benefits_. If Continuing Commerce Employees become
eligible to participate in a medical, dental or health plan of BHLB
upon termination of such plan of Commerce, BHLB shall make all commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each such plan to (i) waive any preexisting
condition limitations to the extent such conditions are covered under the
applicable medical, health or dental plans of BHLB, (ii) honor under such
plans any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
employees and their beneficiaries during the portion of the calendar year
prior to such participation and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or
evidence of insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable to
such employee on or after the Effective Time, in each case to the extent such
employee had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an
analogous Commerce Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time. Continuing
Commerce Employees will continue to be covered by medical, dental and
health plans as maintained by Commerce prior to the Closing Date, and the
Commerce benefit plan may be amended or terminated in the sole discretion of
BHLB.

  



  

7.5.4 _Paid Time Off Programs_. BHLB will give Continuing Commerce
Employees credit, for purposes of BHLB's vacation and/or other paid leave
benefit programs, for such individuals accrued and unpaid vacation and/or paid
leave balance with Commerce as of the Closing Date. Continuing Commerce
Employees may continue to be covered by paid time off programs maintained by
Commerce prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

7.5.5 _BHLB to Honor Agreements_. Subject to any required regulatory
approval or satisfaction of a condition in any Regulatory Approval, BHLB
agrees to honor all employment agreements, change in control agreements,
severance agreements, deferred compensation agreements and consulting
agreements that Commerce

  



    

 | 47| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

has with its current and former employees and which have been identified in
_Commerce Disclosure Schedule 4.13.1_, except to the extent any such
agreements shall be superseded or terminated at the Closing Date or following
the Closing Date with the written consent of the affected parties
and provided that: (a) no payments made under such agreements would be
characterized as an "excess parachute payment" as such term is defined in
Code Section 280G, and (b) if shareholders of Commerce approve the proposed
payments to the Commerce executives specified in the employment agreements in
accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1, QandA: 7, then such
executives will be entitled to payments set forth in _BHLB Disclosure
Schedule 7.5.5_. In the event that the shareholder approval requirements of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1, QandA: 7 are not satisfied, each Commerce
executive who is a party to an employment agreement shall accept a reduction
in benefits under said employment agreement to avoid an excess parachute
payment under Code Section 280G and an excise tax under Code Section 4999 and
such reduced payments are as set forth in _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 7.5.5_.
Commerce shall, prior to the Effective Time, use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain from each individual receiving such payments and listed in _BHLB
Disclosure Schedule 7.5.5_ an agreement, in the form of _Exhibit B_
hereto, setting forth the method in which his or her rights under the
specified programs will be settled in the event such individuals are entitled
to payment or benefits (each, a "Settlement Agreement"). Each Commerce
executive who is a party to an employment agreement shall execute and deliver
to BHLB, immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement, an
acknowledgement agreement regarding the above conditions, in the form
attached to _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 7.5.5_.

  



  

7.5.6 _No Guarantee of Employment, Severance_. Except to the extent of
commitments herein or other contractual commitments, if any,
specifically made or assumed by BHLB hereunder or by operation of law, BHLB
shall have no obligation arising from and after the Closing Date to continue
in its employ or in any specific job or to provide to any specified level of
compensation or any incentive payments, benefits or perquisites to any Person
who is an employee of Commerce or any Commerce Subsidiary as of the Closing
Date. Each Person who is an employee of Commerce or any Commerce Subsidiary
as of the Closing Date and who is terminated by BHLB for a reason other than
cause within twelve (12) months subsequent to the Closing Date or is not
offered employment with BHLB as of the Effective Time or resigns for Good
Reason, excluding those employees who are entitled to benefits under
employment or change of control arrangements, shall be entitled to severance
benefits pursuant to Commerce's severance plan or policy, as applicable, or
BHLB's current severance plan or policy, if such payments would be more
favorable to such Person; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall such
severance payments exceed six month's pay and; _provided_ , _further_ , if
such benefits pursuant to Commerce or Commerce's plan or policy, as
applicable, will result in an excise tax under Code Section 4980D, such plan
or policy shall be modified to the extent necessary so as to avoid the
imposition of such excise tax and the affected participant under such plan or
policy shall be paid an additional amount such that his or her benefit, net
applicable taxes, equals the value of the benefit reduced or eliminated by
such action. In addition, each Person who is an employee of Commerce or any

claims reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after
the Effective Time, from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as Commerce's current insurance carrier with respect to directors' and
officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance (collectively, "DandO Insurance" and such insurance carrier, the
"Insurance Carrier") with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are at least as favorable as Commerce's existing policies
with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading
statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed
against any Person covered thereby that arose, existed, or occurred at or
prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall BHLB be required to expend for such "tail" policy a
premium amount in excess of an amount equal to 175% of the annual premiums
paid by Commerce for DandO Insurance in effect as of the date of this Agreement.
In connection with the foregoing, Commerce agrees, in order for BHLB to
fulfill its agreement, to provide the Insurance Carrier with such
representations as such insurer may request with respect to the reporting of
any prior claims.

  



  

7.6.2 In addition to Section 7.6.1, BHLB shall, from and after the
Effective Date, to the fullest extent that would have been permitted to
Commerce under DGCL and the Commerce Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws
(to the extent not prohibited by federal law), indemnify, defend and hold
harmless each Person who is now, or who has been at any time before the date
hereof or who becomes before the Effective Time, an officer or director of
Commerce or any Commerce Subsidiary (the "Indemnified Parties") against all
losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including attorneys' fees),
liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement (which
settlement shall require the prior written consent of BHLB, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of or in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, or administrative (each, a "Claim") in which an Indemnified
Party is or is threatened to be made a party or witness in whole or in part
or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such Person is or was an
Indemnified Party if such Claim pertains to any matter of fact arising,
existing, or occurring before the Effective Time (including, without
limitation, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby),
regardless of whether such Claim is asserted or claimed before, or after, the
Effective Time and will pay all costs and expenses (including reasonable fees
and expenses of counsel) as they are incurred in connection with any such
Claim. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification or advancement
under this Section 7.6.2 upon learning of any Claim, shall notify BHLB (but
the failure so to notify BHLB shall not relieve it from any liability
which it may have under this Section 7.6.2, except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices BHLB). In the event of any such Claim (whether arising
before or after the Effective Time) (1) BHLB shall have the right to assume
the defense thereof (in which event the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in
the defense of any such matter) and upon such assumption BHLB shall not
be liable to any Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or
any other expenses subsequently incurred by any Indemnified Party in
connection with the defense thereof, except that if BHLB elects not to assume
such defense, or counsel for the Indemnified Parties reasonably advises the
Indemnified Parties that there are or may be (whether or not any have yet
actually arisen) issues which raise conflicts of interest between BHLB and
the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel
satisfactory to them, and BHLB shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
such counsel for the Indemnified Parties, (2) except to the extent required
due to conflicts of interest as described above, BHLB shall be obligated
pursuant to this paragraph to pay for only one (1) firm of counsel for all
Indemnified Parties unless there is a conflict of interest that necessitates
more than one law firm, and (3) BHLB shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  



  

7.6.3 In the event that either BHLB or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving company or entity of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of BHLB shall assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 7.6.

  



  

7.6.4 The obligations of BHLB provided under this Section 7.6 are
intended to be enforceable against BHLB directly by any of the
Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on all respective successors and
permitted assigns of BHLB.

7.8 Reservation of Stock.

  



  

BHLB agrees at all times from the date of this Agreement until the Merger
Consideration has been paid in full to reserve a sufficient number of shares

BHLB and Commerce agree that as promptly as practicable following the
execution of this Agreement, meetings with employees of Commerce and the
Commerce Subsidiaries shall be held at such locations as BHLB and Commerce
shall mutually agree, provided that representatives of Commerce shall be
permitted to attend such meetings. BHLB and Commerce shall mutually agree in
advance as to the scope and content of all communications to the employees of
Commerce and the Commerce Subsidiaries. At mutually agreed upon times
following execution of this Agreement, representatives of BHLB shall be
permitted to meet with the employees of Commerce and the Commerce Subsidiaries
to discuss employment opportunities with BHLB, provided that representatives
of Commerce shall be permitted to attend any such meeting. From and after the
first date on which all Regulatory Approvals (and waivers, if applicable) and
the Commerce Stockholder Approval necessary for the consummation of the
Merger and Bank Merger (disregarding any waiting period) have been obtained,
BHLB shall also be permitted to conduct training sessions outside of normal
business hours or at other times as Commerce may agree, with the employees of
Commerce and the Commerce Subsidiaries and may conduct such training seminars
at any branch location of Commerce Bank; provided that BHLB will in good
faith attempt to schedule such training sessions in a manner which does not
unreasonably interfere with CBTC's normal business operations.

  



  

7.10 Current Information.

  



  

During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, BHLB
will cause one or more of its representatives to confer with representatives
of Commerce to inform Commerce regarding BHLB's operations at such times as
Commerce may reasonably request. BHLB will promptly notify Commerce of any
change in the ordinary course of its business or in the operation of its
properties and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, of any

indicating that the same may be contemplated), or the institution or the
threat of material litigation involving BHLB or any BHLB Subsidiary.

  



  

7.11 Access to Properties and Records.

  



  

Subject to Section 11.1, BHLB shall permit Commerce access upon reasonable

business hours all of its books and records relating to the assets,
properties, operations, obligations and liabilities, including, but not
limited to, all books of account (including the general ledger), tax records,
minute books of directors' and stockholders' meetings (other than minutes that
discuss any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other
subject matter that BHLB reasonably determines should be kept confidential),
organizational documents, bylaws, material contracts and agreements, filings
with any regulatory authority, litigation files, plans affecting employees,
and any other business activities or prospects in which Commerce may have a
reasonable interest; _provided, however,_  that BHLB shall not be required to
take any action that would provide access to or to disclose information where
such access or disclosure, in BHLB's reasonable judgment, would interfere
with the normal conduct of BHLB's business or would violate or prejudice the
rights or business interests or confidences of any customer or other Person or
entity or would result in the waiver by it of the privilege protecting
communications between it and any of its counsel or contravene any applicable
law. BHLB shall provide and shall request its auditors to provide Commerce
with such historical financial information regarding it (and related audit
reports and consents) as Commerce may reasonably request for Securities Law
disclosure purposes. Commerce shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
minimize any interference with BHLB's regular business operations during any
such access to BHLB's property, books and records. BHLB and each BHLB
Subsidiary shall

  



    

 | 50|

permit Commerce, at Commerce's expense, to (i) cause a Phase I environmental
assessment to be performed at any physical location owned or occupied by BHLB
or any BHLB Subsidiary and (ii) cause an appraisal to be performed in respect

accountants, or by any other accounting firm rendering internal audit
services, in connection with each annual, interim or special audit of the
books of BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries made by such accountants.

  



  

7.12.2 As soon as reasonably available, but in no event later than the
date such documents are filed with the MDOB, FRB or FDIC, BHLB will deliver
to Commerce the BHLB Regulatory Report filed by BHLB or Berkshire Bank. Within
twenty-five (25) days after the end of each month, Berkshire Bank will
deliver to Commerce a consolidating balance sheet and a consolidating
statement of operations, without related notes, for such month prepared in
accordance with current financial reporting practices, as well as a month-end
and year to date comparison to budget.

  



  

7.12.3 BHLB promptly will advise upon receipt and permit review by
Commerce of any inquiry or examination report of any Bank Regulator

with the solicitation of proxies with respect to the Commerce Stockholders

may fail to make such a recommendation referred to in clause (ii) above, or
withdraw, modify or change any such recommendation only if such Board of
Directors, after having consulted with and considered the advice of its
financial and legal advisors, has determined that such action is required to
comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law ("Commerce Change of
Recommendation").

  



  

8.2 Proxy Statement-Prospectus; Merger Registration Statement.

  



  

8.2.1 For the purposes (i) of registering BHLB Common Stock and BHLB
Preferred Stock to be offered to holders of Commerce Common Stock in

the Commerce

  



    

 | 51|

stockholders, together with any and all amendments or supplements thereto,
being herein referred to as the "Proxy Statement-Prospectus"). BHLB shall
provide Commerce and its counsel with reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Proxy Statement-Prospectus, and shall incorporate

the Merger Registration Statement or Proxy Statement/Prospectus, as the case
may be, to comply in all material respects in form and substance with the
rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and to respond promptly to and

Statement or Proxy Statement/Prospectus, as the case may be. Each of BHLB and

action. If BHLB or Commerce become aware of any information that, pursuant to
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, should be disclosed in an amendment or
supplement to the Merger Registration Statement or Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, as the case may be, then such party, as the case maybe,
shall promptly inform the other parties thereof and shall cooperate with such
other parties in filing such amendment or supplement with the SEC and, if
appropriate, in mailing such amendment or supplement to the Stockholders.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above, prior to filing and
mailing, as applicable, the Merger Registration Statement or Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding
to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the party responsible for
filing or mailing such document shall provide the other parties a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and shall
discuss with the other parties and include in such document or response,
comments reasonably and promptly proposed by the other parties. BHLB
will advise Commerce, promptly after BHLB receives notice thereof, of the
time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement
or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order or the
suspension of the qualification of BHLB Common Stock for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threat of any proceeding for any such
purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the amendment or supplement of the
Registration Statement or for additional information.

of the time when the Merger Registration Statement has become effective or
any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order
or the suspension of the registration of the shares of BHLB Common Stock

threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC
for the amendment or supplement of the Merger Registration Statement, or for
additional information, and BHLB will provide Commerce with as many copies of
such Merger Registration Statement and all amendments thereto promptly upon
the filing thereof as Commerce may reasonably request.

  



  

8.2.3 Commerce and BHLB shall promptly notify the other party if at any
time it becomes aware that the Proxy Statement-Prospectus or the
Merger Registration Statement contains any untrue statement of a material
fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements contained therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. In such event,
Commerce shall cooperate with BHLB in the preparation of a supplement or
amendment to such Proxy Statement-Prospectus that corrects such misstatement
or omission, and BHLB shall file an amended Merger Registration

Statement with the SEC, and Commerce and BHLB shall mail an amended Proxy
Statement-Prospectus to their respective stockholders.

Each of Commerce and BHLB will cooperate with the other and use reasonable
efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation to obtain all
necessary permits, consents, waivers, approvals and authorizations of the
MDOB, the FDIC, the FRB, the Department of Justice and any other third
parties and Governmental Entities or Bank Regulators necessary to consummate

Agreement with any Governmental Entity. In addition, Commerce and BHLB shall
each furnish to the other for review a copy of each such filing made in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with any
Governmental Entity prior to its filing. Each of Commerce and BHLB will
cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best efforts to address
any conditions in any regulatory approval to allow for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that BHLB
shall not be required to comply with any such condition that would result in
a Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition.

ARTICLE X 
 TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

  



  

10.1 Termination.

  



  

This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing Date,
whether before or after approval of the Merger by the stockholders of Commerce
and, if required, the stockholders of BHLB (except as otherwise indicated
below):

  



  

10.1.1 At any time by the mutual written agreement of BHLB and Commerce;

  



  

10.1.2 By either party (provided, that the terminating party is not then
in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of the
representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of the
other party, which breach by its nature cannot be cured prior to the Closing
Date or shall not have been cured within thirty (30) days after written
notice of such breach by the terminating party to the other party, conditioned
upon the defaulting party promptly commencing to cure the default and
thereafter continuing to cure the default; provided, however, that neither
party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 10.1.2 unless the breach of representation or warranty, together with
all other such breaches, would entitle the terminating party not to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby under Section 9.2.1 (in the case of a
breach of a representation or warranty by Commerce) or Section 9.3.1 (in
the case of a breach of a representation or warranty by BHLB);

  



  

10.1.3 By either party (provided, that the terminating party is not then
in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a failure to perform or
comply with any of the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement on
the part of the other party or its Subsidiaries, which failure by its nature
cannot be cured prior to the Closing Date or shall not have been cured within
thirty (30) days after written notice of such failure by the terminating party
to the other party, conditioned upon the defaulting party promptly commencing
to cure the default and thereafter continuing to cure; provided, however,
that neither party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 10.1.3 unless the breach of covenant or agreement, together
with all other such breaches, would entitle the terminating party not to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby under Section 9.2.2 (in the
case of a breach of covenant by Commerce) or Section 9.3.2 (in the case of a
breach of covenant by BHLB);

  



  

10.1.4 At the election of either party, if the Closing shall not have
occurred by the Termination Date, or such later date as shall have been
agreed to in writing by BHLB and Commerce; provided, that no party may
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1.4 if the failure of
the Closing to have occurred on or before said date was due to such party's
material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement
contained in this Agreement;

  



  

10.1.5 By either party, if the stockholders of Commerce shall have voted
at the Commerce Stockholders Meeting, or Commerce shall have failed to obtain
a stockholder consent in lieu of a meeting, on the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and such vote, either through the Commerce Stockholders
Meeting or through a consent in lieu of a stockholders meeting, shall not have
been sufficient to approve and adopt such transactions.

  



  

10.1.6 By either party if (i) final action has been taken by a Bank
Regulator whose approval is required in order to satisfy the conditions to
the parties' obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as
set forth in Article IX, which final action (x) has become unappealable and
(y) does not approve this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby;
(ii) the other party has not obtained all Regulatory Approvals required to be
obtained by such party to consummate the Merger and Bank Merger prior to the
Termination Date, or (iii) any court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, decree, ruling or taken any
other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger and
such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and
unappealable; provided, that no party may terminate this Agreement pursuant
clause (ii) of this Section 10.1.6 if the failure to obtain all Regulatory
Approvals before the Termination Date was due to such party's material breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in this
Agreement;

  



    

 | 56| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

10.1.7 By the Board of Directors of BHLB if any of the following
conditions are satisfied: (i) Commerce has received a Superior Proposal and
the Board of Directors of Commerce has entered into an acquisition agreement
with respect to the Superior Proposal in accordance with the provisions of
Section 6.11 withdrawn its recommendation of this Agreement, has failed to
make such recommendation, or has modified or qualified its recommendation in
a manner adverse to BHLB, (ii) either (x) the Board of Directors of Commerce
submits this Agreement to its stockholders without a recommendation for
approval or (y) a Commerce Change of Recommendation shall have occurred, or
(iii) the Commerce stockholders do not approve this Agreement.

  



  

10.1.8 By the Board of Directors of Commerce if Commerce has received a
Superior Proposal and the Board of Directors of Commerce has made a
determination to accept such Superior Proposal; provided that Commerce shall
not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1.8 and enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to the Superior Proposal until the
expiration of three (3) Business Days following BHLB's receipt of written
notice advising BHLB that Commerce has received a Superior Proposal,
specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (and
including a copy thereof with all accompanying documentation, if in
writing) identifying the Person making the Superior Proposal and stating
whether Commerce intends to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to
the Superior Proposal (a "Notice of Superior Proposal"). After providing such
Notice of Superior Proposal, Commerce shall provide a reasonable opportunity
to BHLB during the three (3)-day period to make such adjustments in the terms
and conditions of this Agreement as would enable Commerce to proceed with the
Merger on such adjusted terms. Any material amendment of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and Commerce shall be
required to comply again with the requirements of this Section 10.1.8;
_provided_ , _however_ , that references to the three (3) Business Day
period above shall be deemed to be references to a two (2) Business Day
period.

  



  

10.1.9 By the Board of Directors of Commerce if it so determines by a
majority vote of the members of the entire Board of Directors of Commerce, at
any time during the five-day period commencing on the Determination Date, such
termination to be effective on the 30th day following such Determination
Date, if and only if both of the following conditions are satisfied:

  



  

(1) The BHLB Market Value on the Determination Date is less than 0.80
multiplied by the Initial BHLB Market Value; and

  



  

(2) the number obtained by dividing the BHLB Market Value on the
Determination Date by the Initial BHLB Market Value shall be less than the
number obtained by dividing (x) the Final Index Price by (y) the Initial Index
Price minus 0.20;

  



  

 _subject_ , _however_ , to the following three sentences.

  



  

If Commerce elects to exercise its termination right pursuant to this Section
10.1.9, it shall give prompt written notice thereof to BHLB. During the five
Business Day period commencing with its receipt of such notice, BHLB shall
have the option of increasing the consideration to be received by the holders
of Commerce Common Stock hereunder, by adjusting the Exchange Ratio
(calculated to the nearest one one-thousandth) to equal the lesser of (x) a
number (rounded to the nearest one one-thousandth) obtained by dividing (A)
the product of the Initial BHLB Market Value, 0.80 and the Exchange Ratio (as
then in effect) by (B) the BHLB Market Value as of the Determination Date or
(y) a number (rounded to the nearest one one-thousandth) obtained by
dividing (A) the product of the Index Ratio and the Exchange Ratio (as then
in effect) minus 0.20 by (B) the BHLB Market Value as of the Determination
Date divided by the Initial BHLB Market Value. If within such five Business
Day period, BHLB delivers written notice to Commerce that it intends to
proceed with the Merger by paying such additional consideration as
contemplated by the preceding sentence, then no termination shall have
occurred pursuant to this Section 10.1.9, and this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms (except that the Exchange
Ratio shall have been so modified and, thereafter, any reference in this
Agreement to "Merger Consideration" shall be deemed to refer to the
Merger Consideration reflecting the Exchange Ratio as modified pursuant to
this Section 10.1.9).

  



  

For purposes of this Section 10.1.9, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated below:

  



  

"Acquisition Transaction" means (i) a merger or consolidation, or any similar
transaction, involving the relevant companies, (ii) a purchase, lease or
other acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of the relevant
companies, (iii) a purchase or other acquisition (including by way of merger,
consolidation, share exchange or otherwise) of securities representing 10% or
more of the voting power of the relevant companies; or (iv) agree or commit
to take any action referenced above.

  



    

 | 57| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

"Determination Date" means the first date on which Commerce Stockholder
Approval and all Requisite Regulatory Approvals (and waivers, if applicable)
necessary for consummation of the Merger and the Bank Merger have been
received (disregarding any waiting period).

  



  

"Index" means the Nasdaq Bank Index.

  



  

"Index Ratio" means the Final Index Price divided by the Initial Index Price.

  



  

"Initial BHLB Market Value" means $35.55, adjusted as indicated in the last
sentence of this Section 10.1.9.

  



  

"Initial Index Price" means the sum of the per share closing sales price of
the common stock of each company comprising the Index.

  



  

"Final Index Price" means the sum of the Final Prices of each company
comprising the Index.

  



  

"Final Price" with respect to any company belonging to the Index, means the
average of the daily closing sales prices of a share of common stock of such
company (and if there is no closing sales price on any such day, then the
mean between the closing bid and the closing asked prices on that day), as
reported on the consolidated transaction reporting system for the market or
exchange on which such common stock is principally traded, for the ten
consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Determination Date.

  



  

"BHLB Market Value" means, as of any specified date, the average of the daily
closing sales prices of a share of BHLB Common Stock as reported on the
NYSE for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding such
specified date.

  



  

10.2 Effect of Termination.

  



  

10.2.1 In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to any
provision of Section 10.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and

11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.5, 11.6, 11.8, 11.9, 11.10, 11.11, and any other section
which, by its terms, relates to post-termination rights or obligations, shall
survive such termination of this Agreement and remain in full force and
effect.

  



  

10.2.2 If this Agreement is terminated, expenses and damages of the
parties hereto shall be determined as follows:

  



  

(A) Except as provided below, whether or not the Merger is
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid
by the party incurring such expenses.

  



  

(B) In the event of a termination of this Agreement because of a
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement, the breaching party shall remain liable for any and all
damages, costs and expenses, including all reasonable attorneys' fees,
sustained or incurred by the non-breaching party as a result thereof or in
connection therewith or with respect to the enforcement of its rights
hereunder.

  



  

(C) As used in this Agreement, "Termination Fee" shall mean $8.6
million. As a condition of BHLB's willingness, and in order to induce BHLB to
enter into this Agreement, and to reimburse BHLB for incurring the costs and
expenses related to entering into this Agreement and consummating the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Commerce hereby agrees to pay
BHLB, and BHLB shall be entitled to payment of, the Termination Fee by wire
transfer of same day funds on the earlier of (x) the date of termination or,
if such date is not a Business Day, on the next following Business Day or (y)
within three (3) Business Days after written demand for payment is made by
BHLB, as applicable, following the occurrence of any of the events set forth
below:

  



    

 | 58| 
---|---|---

BHLB terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1.7; or

  



  

(ii) The entering into a definitive agreement by Commerce relating to
an Acquisition Proposal or the consummation of an Acquisition
Proposal involving Commerce within one (1) year after the occurrence of any
of the following: (i) the termination of this Agreement by BHLB pursuant to
Section 10.1.2 or 10.1.3 because of a breach by Commerce or any Commerce
Subsidiary after the occurrence of a bona fide Acquisition Proposal has been
publicly announced or otherwise made known to the senior management or board
of directors of Commerce; or (ii) the termination of this Agreement by BHLB
or Commerce pursuant to Section 10.1.5 because of the failure of the
stockholders of Commerce to approve this Agreement at the Commerce
Stockholders Meeting or through a consent of stockholder in lieu of a meeting
after the occurrence of an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced or
otherwise made known to the stockholders of Commerce.

  



  

(D) If (i) this Agreement is terminated by Commerce pursuant to
Section 10.1.6, and (ii) a Bank Regulator has issued a final, non-appealable
order that does not approve the Merger solely as a result of BHLB's operations
or financial condition, then BHLB shall be liable to Commerce for $4.3
million. As a condition of Commerce's willingness, and in order to induce
Commerce to enter into this Agreement, and, in part, to reimburse Commerce
for incurring the costs and expenses related to entering into this Agreement
and consummating the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, BHLB hereby
agrees to pay Commerce, and Commerce shall be entitled to payment of $4.3
million by wire transfer of same day funds on the earlier of (x) the date of
termination or, if such date is not a Business Day, on the next following
Business Day or (y) within three (3) Business Days after written demand for
payment is made by Commerce, as applicable, following the termination by
Commerce pursuant to Section 10.1.6. The payment of $4.3 million shall
constitute an exclusive remedy with respect to Section 10.1.6 and upon
delivery of such payment, BHLB shall have no further obligations to Commerce
pursuant to Section 10.1.6 of this Agreement.

  



  

(E) Commerce and BHLB acknowledge that the agreements contained in
this Section 10.2.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, BHLB would not enter into
this Agreement. The amount payable by Commerce pursuant to this Section
10.2.2 constitutes liquidated damages and not a penalty and shall be the sole
and exclusive monetary remedy of such party in the event of termination of
this Agreement on the bases specified in such section.

  



  

10.3 Amendment, Extension and Waiver.

  



  

Subject to applicable law, at any time prior to the Effective Time (whether
before or after approval thereof by the stockholders of Commerce or BHLB), the
parties hereto by action of their respective Boards of Directors, may (a)
amend this Agreement, (b) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of any other party hereto, (c) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto, or (d) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein; provided, however, that after any
approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by
the stockholders of Commerce, there may not be, without further approval of
such stockholders, any amendment of this Agreement which decreases the amount
or value, or changes the form of, the Merger Consideration to be delivered to
Commerce's stockholders pursuant to this Agreement. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of
the parties hereto. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party, but such waiver or failure to insist
on strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition
shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent
or other failure. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Article
XI may only be effected upon a vote of a majority of the entire Board of
Directors of the terminating party.

Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The recitals hereto constitute an
integral part of this Agreement. References to sections include subsections,
which are part of the related Section (e.g., a section numbered "Section

otherwise requires, shall be deemed to refer to the date set forth in the
Preamble to this Agreement. The parties have participated jointly in

authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. Each party agrees that it will not seek and will
agree to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of a bond in
connection with the other party's seeking or obtaining such relief.
