development of a prototype and dissolution profile upon  delivery by Sellers
of a written notice describing in reasonable detail  the product that will be
the subject of the termination, provided that  in no event will the
termination with respect to the   22    Purchased Intellectual Property
or New Purchased Intellectual Property  restrict Purchaser\'s rights to any
Product, any New Product Purchaser  has elected to acquire under Section 3.3,
any Derivative Lynxorb  Product, any Derivative Darvocet Product, the Odyssey
Product or any  product that Purchaser is legally authorized to develop under
the  license granted in Section 2.2(b)(ii)(A). The scope of the termination 
shall be automatically conformed to apply only to the specific product 
marketed once that product has reached final formulation.   (e) Lynxorb
License.   (i) Sellers hereby grant to Purchaser, and Purchaser  accepts a
worldwide, exclusive, perpetual, transferable license under  the Lynxorb
Licensed Assets and New Licensed Intellectual Property  necessary or useful
for the Lynxorb Product or Derivative Lynxorb  Products in order to develop,
make, have made, distribute, use, sell,  offer to sell, have sold, market,
co-market, import, promote and  co-promote the Lynxorb Product and Derivative
Lynxorb Products, which  license is irrevocable for all assets other than the
ProSorb Trademark,  but which as to the ProSorb Trademark may be terminated
as set forth in  Section -------- 2.2(e)(ii). For the avoidance of doubt,
Sellers retain  all rights to exploit the ProSorb Trademark for products
other than  with respect to the Lynxorb Product and Derivative Lynxorb
Products and  Purchaser is prohibited from exploiting its trademark rights
under this  Section 2.2(e)(i) except with respect to the Lynxorb Product
and  Derivative Lynxorb Products.   (ii) All uses by Purchaser, its
Affiliates and their  respective sublicensees and assigns of the ProSorb
Trademark (whether  on Lynxorb Products or Derivative Lynxorb Products, in
marketing  materials or otherwise) shall be in an appropriate manner,
without  jeopardizing the significance, distinctiveness or validity of such 
trademarks; shall use the designation "(R)" with such trademarks and  labeled
as a registered trademark of Parent; and shall only be in such  form and
manner as approved in writing by Sellers. Purchaser shall only  use the
ProSorb Trademark on products of high quality that do not  tarnish, dilute or
diminish the current value of such trademarks. All  trademark rights from the
use of the ProSorb Trademark by Purchaser,  its Affiliates and their
respective sublicensees and assigns will inure  to the benefit of Sellers.
Neither Purchaser, its Affiliates nor their  respective sublicensees and
assigns shall contest or challenge the  validity of, or Sellers\' ownership
of, the ProSorb Trademark. All  Lynxorb Products and Derivative Lynxorb
Products and related marketing  materials featuring the ProSorb Trademark
must be manufactured,  labeled, sold, distributed and advertised in
accordance with all  Applicable Laws. Once each calendar year upon the
written request of  Sellers, in order that Sellers can assure themselves of
the maintenance  of the above-described quality standards, Purchaser and its
Affiliates  will, and shall cause their respective sublicensees and assigns
to: (i)  provide to Sellers at cost (not to exceed $10.00) two (2) then-
current  production samples of each Lynxorb Product or Derivative Lynxorb 
Product featuring the ProSorb Trademark (with the current packaging) to  the
extent not   23    manufactured by AAI DS, together with two (2) copies
of all marketing  materials, and (ii) permit Sellers to inspect the
manufacturing process  for each Lynxorb Product and Derivative Lynxorb
Product not  manufactured by AAI DS featuring the ProSorb Trademark upon five
(5)  Business Days prior notice, which inspection shall be scheduled during 
normal business hours. If Sellers reasonably determine that Purchaser  has
breached the provisions of this Section 2.2(e)(ii) with respect to  the
ProSorb Trademark and such breach is not materially cured within  sixty (60)
days after Purchaser\'s receipt of written notice thereof,  Sellers may
terminate the license granted in Section 2.2(e)(i) above  with respect to the
ProSorb Trademark subject to such violation  immediately upon written notice
to Purchaser.   (f) Darvocet-N XR License.   (i) Sellers hereby grant to
Purchaser, and Purchaser  accepts a worldwide, exclusive, perpetual,
irrevocable, transferable  license under the Darvocet-N XR Know How,
Darvocet-N XR IDM and New  Licensed Intellectual Property necessary or useful
for Darvocet-N XR  Product or Derivative Darvocet Products in order to
develop, make, have  made, distribute, use, sell, offer to sell, have sold,
market,  co-market, import, promote and co-promote the Darvocet-N XR Product
and  Derivative Darvocet Products.   (ii) Sellers hereby grant to
Purchaser, and Purchaser  accepts a worldwide, exclusive, perpetual,
irrevocable, transferable  license under any patent that solely and
exclusively relates to the  Darvocet-N XR Product (the "Darvocet-N XR
Patents") with respect to the  full scope of rights provided by such
patent.   (g) Azathioprine Product License. Sellers hereby grant
to Purchaser, and Purchaser accepts a worldwide, exclusive, perpetual,
irrevocable, transferable license under the Azathioprine Product Assets in
order to develop, make, have made, distribute, use, sell, offer to sell, have
sold, market, co-market, import, promote and co-promote the Azathioprine
Product. For the avoidance of doubt, no right is granted hereunder to use the
Azathioprine Product Assets in connection with any dosages other than the 50
mg dose of the Azathioprine Product.   (h) Patent Prosecution.   (i)
Platform Patents. Sellers shall prepare and file,  at Sellers\' expense,
subject to the review and approval of Purchaser,  one or more patent
applications claiming the invention disclosed in the  Darvocet-N XR IDM or as
further developed to the final Darvocet-N XR  Product. Once filed,
prosecution of that patent application shall be  under the control and the
expense of Sellers. Purchaser agrees to  coordinate with Sellers in the
prosecution of those applications to  ensure consistency with Sellers\' other
patent filing efforts regarding  similar and "platform" inventions. Sellers
shall give due consideration  to Purchaser\'s input in the prosecution of
these applications.   24    (ii) Lynxorb. Purchaser shall prepare and
file, to  the extent possible, at Purchaser\'s expense, subject to the review
of  Sellers, one or more patent applications claiming potentially 
patentable subject matter to the extent solely and directly related to  the
Lynxorb Product.   (iii) Other Licensed Patents. Sellers shall prepare  and
file, at Sellers\' expense, to the extent practicable, subject to  the
review, but not approval, of Purchaser, all other patent  applications that
are contained within the Licensed Intellectual  Property with a scope that
allows at a minimum for protection of the  final Darvocet-N XR Product and
Lynxorb Product. Once filed,  prosecution of these applications shall be
under the control of and at  the expense of Sellers. Sellers agree to
coordinate with Purchaser in  the prosecution of those applications to ensure
consistency with  Purchaser\'s other patent filing efforts and the
development of the  products acquired hereunder. Sellers shall give due
consideration to  Purchaser\'s input in the prosecution of these
applications.   (iv) Purchaser Prosecution Rights. Sellers hereby  appoint
Purchaser its agent to file patent applications claiming the  inventions
contained within the Licensed Intellectual Property and  prosecute such
applications and any other patent applications contained  within the Licensed
Intellectual Property that solely pertain to Pain  Products. Purchaser
covenants, however, not to exercise its right to so  file and prosecute while
Sellers are making commercially reasonable  efforts to file and prosecute
such inventions.   (i) Orange Book. Purchaser hereby agrees that if
Sellers request that any Patents contained in the Purchased Intellectual
Property or New Purchased Intellectual Property be listed in the Orange Book
and such listing would protect products of Sellers other than those acquired
hereunder, it will consent to such listing so long as it does not reasonably
believe, in good faith, that such listing would give rise to a claim of
patent misuse. Sellers hereby agree that if Purchaser requests that any
Patents contained in the Licensed Intellectual Property or New Licensed
Intellectual Property be listed in the Orange Book and such listing would
protect products acquired hereunder, it will consent to such listing so long
as it does not reasonably believe, in good faith, that such listing would
give rise to a claim of patent misuse.   (j) Third Party Infringement.  
(i) If either party learns of any actual or  threatened infringement,
misappropriation, dilution, tarnishment, or  unauthorized use of the
Purchased Intellectual Property or Licensed  Intellectual Property by any
third Person, such party shall notify the  other party of such infringement
in writing. Either party shall have  the right, but not the obligation, to
take any action against such  third Person to stop the same, or otherwise
enforce Purchaser\'s rights  in the Purchased Intellectual Property and
Seller\'s rights in the  Licensed Intellectual Property. If a party initiates
suit as  contemplated in this Section 2.2(j)(i), such party shall have the 
exclusive right to employ counsel of its own selection and to   25   
direct and control the litigation or any settlement thereof. The party  that
initiates suit shall notify the other party in writing. In the  event either
party initiates suit, (A) the other party shall cooperate  in such action,
(B) the other party shall have the right to retain  separate counsel in
connection with any such action (the costs of such  separately-retained
counsel at that party\'s expense, provided, that if  the other party is a
necessary party to such action, the costs of such  separately retained
counsel shall be at the expense of the party  bringing the action), and (C)
the party bringing the action shall  reimburse the other party for all
reasonable costs, attorneys\' fees and  other expenses incurred by the other
party in connection with such  action, including appropriate reimbursement
for time of that party\'s  personnel involved in discovery, trial and other
related matters,  except as provided in Section 2.2(j)(i)(B). Nothing herein
shall be  construed to prevent Sellers and Purchaser from taking action
jointly  in any infringement suit or other action with respect to the
Purchased  Intellectual Property.   (ii) Each party shall be entitled to
any recovery of  damages (including payments received in any settlement)
resulting from  a lawsuit brought solely in its own name and, in the event
both Sellers  and Purchaser are joint parties to any lawsuit, Sellers and
Purchaser  shall share in any recovery, after reimbursement of each
party\'s  expenses in connection with the action, including appropriate 
reimbursement for time of that party\'s personnel involved in discovery, 
trial and other related matters, in proportion to the expenses it  incurred.
Neither party may settle with an infringer in a manner which  could
reasonably be considered to negatively impact any rights of the  other
without the other\'s prior written approval, which approval shall  not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.   (k) Sellers agree that they will not,
during or after the term of this Agreement, in any way challenge the validity
of the Purchased Intellectual Property or Purchaser\'s ownership thereof.
Purchaser agrees that if Purchaser challenges the validity of the Licensed
Intellectual Property, Purchaser will pay Sellers\' expenses in connection
therewith.   (l) Any license granted pursuant to this Section 2.2 shall be
freely transferable and sub licensable, and may be assumed and/or assigned in
whole or in part without the consent of any Party, so long as the transfer,
sublicense, assumption and/or assignment is subject to the obligation and
restrictions contained in this Agreement.   (m) Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that a breach of Sections 2.2(d)(i) (second sentence) or 3.4(b) (last
paragraph) would cause irreparable damage to Sellers not compensable by
monetary damages and that Sellers will not have an adequate remedy at law.
Therefore, Purchaser\'s obligations under Section 2.2(d)(i) (second sentence)
or 3.4(b) (last paragraph) shall be enforceable by, and Sellers shall be
entitled to seek, temporary, preliminary and/or permanent equitable or
injunctive relief (including a decree of specific performance) from any court
of competent jurisdiction, without the necessity of posting bond. Sellers\'
remedies under this Section 2.2(m) shall,   26   however, be cumulative
and not exclusive and shall be in addition to any other remedies which any
party may have under this Agreement or otherwise.   2.3 Excluded Assets.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to transfer, assign or convey the
Excluded Assets to Purchaser, and Sellers shall retain all right, title and
interest to, in and under the Excluded Assets. "Excluded Assets" means each
of the following assets:   (a) the Excluded Contracts;   (b) cash, cash
equivalents, all prepayments (including all prepayments made to third party
manufacturers, suppliers and contractors), deferred assets, refunds, credits
or overpayments or other receivables for Taxes;   (c) all accounts

in respect of matters occurring prior to the Closing Date;   (h) any refund
or credit of (i) Taxes that relate to the Purchased Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities attributable to any period or portion thereof ending prior to the
Closing Date, including any Taxes allocated to Sellers pursuant to Section
12.2 and (ii) Taxes of Sellers that are not Assumed Liabilities;   (i) all

the extent not related to the Purchased Assets or the Licensed Assets subject
to Section 2.2(j).   (k) all manufacturing and laboratory facilities;  
(l) all computers, software and office equipment, personal property,
furniture, fixtures and equipment;   (m) all real estate and leasehold

Affiliates other than the Business.   2.4 Assumption of Liabilities. On the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the
Closing Purchaser shall (or shall cause its designated Affiliate or

and   (c) all Liabilities relating to amounts required to be paid by
Purchaser hereunder.   2.5 Excluded Liabilities. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser shall not assume, and shall be
deemed not to have assumed, any Liabilities relating to the Business of
Sellers or any Affiliate of Sellers except as expressly provided in Section
2.4 hereof or elsewhere in this Agreement, and Sellers and their Affiliates
shall be solely and exclusively liable with respect to all such Liabilities,
other than the Assumed Liabilities (collectively, the "Excluded

relating to amounts required to be paid by Sellers hereunder.   2.6 Cure
Amounts. At Closing and pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code,
Sellers shall assume and assign to Purchaser the Purchased Contracts. The
cure amounts, as determined by the Bankruptcy Court, if any (the "Cure
Amounts"), necessary to cure all defaults, if any, and to pay all actual or
pecuniary losses that have resulted from such defaults under the
Purchased Contracts, shall be paid by Sellers, on or before Closing, and not
by Purchaser and Purchaser shall have no liability therefor. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event the actual Cure Amounts for all Purchased
Contracts required to be paid by Sellers on the Closing Date in accordance
with this Section 2.6 exceed the aggregate of the estimated Cure Amounts set
forth on Schedule 1.1(i) for such Purchased Contracts (such excess, the
"Excess Cure Amount") by $6,000,000 or more, then Purchaser may, by written
notice to Sellers, elect to (i) pay the amount by which the Excess Cure
Amount exceeds $6,000,000 and/or (ii) cause Sellers to reject any Purchased
Contract or (iii) to the extent the failure to assume the Purchased Contract
would result in a Material Adverse Effect, terminate this Agreement  
29   in accordance with Section 4.4(f). If Purchaser elects to proceed
pursuant to clause (i) and/or (ii) above, then Sellers shall pay, in addition
to the aggregate Cure Amounts specified in Schedule 1.1(i), the first
$6,000,000 of the Excess Cure Amount.   2.7 Services Agreement,
Manufacturing Agreement and Odyssey Co-Development Agreement. At the Closing,
Purchaser and Sellers shall enter into and deliver to each other the (i)
Services Agreement, (ii) Manufacturing Agreement and (iii) Odyssey Co-
Development Agreement.   2.8 Further Conveyances and Assumptions. From time
to time following the Closing, Sellers and Purchaser shall, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such
further conveyances, notices, assumptions, releases and acquaintances and
such other instruments, and shall take such further actions, as may be
necessary or appropriate to assure fully to Purchaser and its respective
successors or assigns, all of the properties, rights, titles, interests,
estates, remedies, powers and privileges intended to be conveyed to Purchaser
under this Agreement and the Seller Documents and to assure fully to Sellers
and their Affiliates and their successors and assigns, the assumption of the
liabilities and obligations intended to be assumed by Purchaser under this
Agreement and the Seller Documents, and to otherwise make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.   2.9 Bulk Sales Law.
Purchaser hereby waives compliance by Sellers with the requirements and
provisions of any "bulk-transfer" Laws of any jurisdiction that may otherwise
be applicable with respect to the sale of any or all of the Purchased Assets
to Purchaser. Pursuant to Section 363(f) of the Bankruptcy Code, the transfer
of the Purchased Assets shall be free and clear of any security interests in
the Purchased Assets, including any Liens or claims arising out of the bulk
transfer laws, and the parties shall take such steps as may be necessary or
appropriate to so provide in the Sale Order.   ARTICLE III  
CONSIDERATION   3.1 Consideration. The aggregate consideration for the
Purchased Assets shall be (i) the payment by Purchaser to Seller, in the
manner provided in Section 3.9 hereof, of $170,000,000, less the Development
Costs, if any (the "Purchase Price"), provided that if the Closing Date does
not occur within the ninetieth (90th) day following the commencement of the
Chapter 11 Case (the "Adjustment Deadline"), the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by $1,500,000 on each weekly anniversary of the Adjustment Deadline
prior to the Closing Date (the "Purchase Price Adjustment"), provided that
the Purchase Price Adjustment shall not be applicable to any week (or portion
thereof) after the Adjustment Deadline in which (A) there shall be an uncured
breach by Purchaser of covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
which would result in a failure of a condition set forth in Section 10.2 or
10.3 and all other conditions set forth in Article X (other than conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) to have been
satisfied or (B) the waiting period under the HSR Act shall not have expired
or early   30   termination shall not have been granted; provided,
further, that in no event, shall the Purchase Price Adjustment exceed
$6,000,000 in the aggregate, (ii) the assumption by Purchaser of the Assumed
Liabilities, and (iii) the payment by Purchaser to Sellers of royalty
payments pursuant to Section 3.2. Commencing on the one hundred twentieth
(120th) day following the commencement of the Chapter 11 Case and provided
that the Closing Date has not yet occurred, Purchaser shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 4.4; provided, however, that in
the event Purchaser terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 4.4,
Purchaser shall be paid the Expense Reimbursement on the first (1st) Business
Day after such termination and Purchaser shall remain entitled to receive the
Break-Up Fee in accordance with Section 7.1 upon the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth therein.   3.2 Royalties on Lifecycle Products. From
the Closing Date through December 31, 2011, Purchaser shall pay to Parent
royalties on the aggregate Net Sales of the Lifecycle Products as
follows:   (a) 0% of Net Sales under $25,000,000 per calendar quarter,  
(b) 5% of Net Sales between $25,000,000 and $50,000,000 per calendar quarter
and   (c) 10% of Net Sales over $50,000,000 per calendar quarter.  Within
ten (10) Business Days after the end of each calendar quarter,
Purchaser shall provide to Parent a written statement (each, a "Lifecycle
Products Statement"), which shall set forth the aggregate Net Sales of the
Lifecycle Products for such quarter and the calculation of the corresponding
royalty payment. Purchaser shall pay to Parent such royalty payment reflected
in such Lifecycle Products Statement within twenty (20) Business Days after
the end of each calendar quarter.   3.3 Products Option.   (a) If at any
time between the Closing Date and the seventh (7th) anniversary of the
Closing Date (the "Seven Year Period") Sellers or any of their Subsidiaries
develop to the stage of creation of a prototype and dissolution profile any
new Pain Product (a "New Product") that contains propoxyphene and/or
diclofenac (a "New P/D Product"), then Sellers shall, or shall cause their
Subsidiaries to, offer in writing to Purchaser prior to any other Person the
option for a sixty (60) day period (as such time period may be extended as
provided for in Section 3.3(e), the "Period of Election") to acquire any such
New P/D Product. Purchaser shall accept or reject such offer by
Sellers during the Period of Election. If Purchaser notifies Sellers in
writing within the Period of Election that Purchaser declines to exercise
such option to acquire any such New P/D Product, then Sellers shall not sell,
license, transfer, assign, convey or deliver such New P/D Product to any
third party for the remainder of the Seven Year Period; provided, however,
that Purchaser acknowledges that Sellers may continue to develop (but not
commercialize) such New P/D Product during the Seven Year Period.  
31    (b) If during the Seven Year Period Sellers or any of their
Subsidiaries develop to the stage of creation of a prototype and dissolution
profile any New Product that (i) does not contain propoxyphene and/or
diclofenac, and (ii) is an opioid/APAP combination or an
opioid/NSAID combination (a "New Combo Product"), then Sellers shall, or
shall cause their Subsidiaries to, offer in writing to Purchaser prior to any
other Person the option for a Period of Election to acquire any such New
Combo Product. Purchaser shall accept or reject such offer by Sellers during
the Period of Election. If Purchaser notifies Sellers in writing within this
Period of Election that Purchaser declines to exercise such option to acquire
any such New Combo Product, then Purchaser shall have no further rights with
respect to the New Combo Product, and Sellers shall have no further
obligation to notify Purchaser with respect to such New Combo Product and may
continue to develop, make, have made, distribute, use, sell, offer to sell,
have sold, market, co-market, import, promote and co-promote such New Combo
Product or sublicense such New Combo Product to a third party.   (c) If at
any time between the Closing Date and the fifth (5th) anniversary of the
Closing Date (the "Five Year Period") Sellers or any of their Subsidiaries
develop to the stage of creation of a prototype and dissolution profile any
New Product for their own internal business purpose and not for any third
party, and such New Product (i) does not contain propoxyphene and/or
diclofenac and (ii) is not an opioid/APAP combination or an
opioid/NSAID combination (a "New Internal Product"), then Sellers shall, or
shall cause their Subsidiaries to, offer in writing to Purchaser prior to any
other Person the option for a Period of Election to acquire any such New
Internal Product. Purchaser shall respond to such offer by Sellers during the
Period of Election. If Purchaser notifies Sellers that Purchaser declines to
exercise such option to acquire any such New Internal Product, then Purchaser
shall have no further rights with respect to the New Internal Product, and
Sellers shall have no further obligation to notify Purchaser with respect to
such New Internal Product and may continue to develop, make, have made,
distribute, use, sell, offer to sell, have sold, market, co-market, import,
promote and co-promote such New Internal Product or sublicense such New
Internal Product to a third party.   (d) If Purchaser notifies Sellers in
writing that it elects to acquire any New Product, within the applicable
Period of Election, pursuant to Sections 3.3(a), 3.3(b) or 3.3(c), then:  
(i) Sellers will develop such New Product and, during  the period of time
between the commercial launch of such New Product  and the tenth (10th)
anniversary of such commercial launch (the "Ten  Year Period"), Purchaser
shall pay to Sellers or their Subsidiaries, as  the case may be, the amounts
specified in the Services Agreement in  connection with the development of
such New Product and royalties on  the aggregate Net Sales of such New
Product as follows:   (x) 7.5% of Net Sales up to and including 
$25,000,000 per calendar quarter, and   32    (y) 10% of the portion of
Net Sales, if any,  over $25,000,000 per calendar quarter;   or   (ii)
Sellers shall notify Purchaser within  twenty (20) Business Days after their
receipt of Purchaser\'s notice if  Sellers are unable or unwilling to
continue development and production  of any such New Product, and Sellers
shall promptly grant to Purchaser  a license to utilize any and all
intellectual property of Sellers  necessary or useful to any such New Product
to enable Purchaser to  either develop such New Product internally or utilize
a third party to  develop such New Product, and during the Ten Year Period
Purchaser  shall pay to Sellers or their Subsidiary, as the case may be,
royalties  on the aggregate Net Sales of such New Product as follows:   (x)
3.75% of Net Sales up to and including  $25,000,000 per calendar quarter,
and   (y) 5% of the portion of Net Sales, if any,  over $25,000,000 per
calendar quarter;  provided that for each Derivative Darvocet Product and
each Derivative Lynxorb Product that Sellers develop and license to Purchaser
in accordance with the terms of this Section 3.3, Purchaser shall pay to
Sellers or their Subsidiaries, as the case may be, royalties pursuant to
Section 3.2 prior to December 31, 2011 and royalties pursuant to Section
3.3(d)(i) from the period January 1, 2012 through the end of the Ten Year
Period for that product. For each Derivative Darvocet Product and each
Derivative Lynxorb Product that Purchaser develops and offer to Sellers and
that Sellers decline in accordance with the terms of this Section 3.3, or
that Purchaser otherwise develops on its own, Purchaser shall pay to Sellers
or their Subsidiaries, as the case may be, royalties pursuant to Section 3.2
prior to December 31, 2011 and royalties pursuant to Section 3.3(d)(ii) from
the period January 1, 2012 through the end of the Ten Year Period for that
product.   (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, with regard to the Period of
Election for an option of Purchaser to acquire a New Product pursuant to
Section 3.3(a), Section 3.3(b) or Section 3.3(c), no Period of Election
shall expire less than six (6) months after the expiration of the Period of
Election for the immediately preceding New Product (if any) in the event that
Purchaser has exercised its option to acquire such immediately preceding New
Product; provided, however, that in the event that Purchaser has declined
such immediately preceding New Product, the Period of Election for the then-
current New Product shall expire sixty (60) days after the later of the date
that Purchaser declined such immediately preceding New Product and the date
of submission of the then-current New Product.   (f) If Sellers or any of
their Subsidiaries are contracted to develop any New Product by and for any
unaffiliated third party and not for Sellers\' own internal  
33   business purpose, and such New Product (i) does not contain
propoxyphene and/or diclofenac and (ii) is not an opioid/APAP combination or
an opioid/NSAID combination, then Purchaser shall have no rights with respect
to the New Product and Sellers shall have no obligation to notify Purchaser
with respect to such New Product and may develop, make, have made,
distribute, use, sell, offer to sell, have sold, market, co-market, import,
promote and co-promote such New Product or sublicense such New Product to a
third party.   (g) To the extent Purchaser exercises an option under this
Section 3.3, if Purchaser notifies Sellers in writing that (y) it elects
to develop any such New Product internally or to utilize a third party to
develop such New Product and (z) it has determined that Sellers are or
reasonably could be impaired in their ability to perform in accordance with
Section 3.3 in a timely manner with respect to any such New Product, Sellers
shall promptly grant to Purchaser a license to utilize any and all
intellectual property of Sellers applicable to any such New Product to enable
Purchaser to either develop such product internally or utilize a third party
to develop such product, and during the Ten Year Period Purchaser shall pay
to Sellers or their Subsidiaries, as the case may be, royalties on the
aggregate Net Sales of such New Product as follows:   (i) 3.75% of Net
Sales up to and including  $25,000,000 per calendar quarter, and   (ii) 5%
of the portion of Net Sales, if any, over  $25,000,000 per calendar
quarter.   (h) Within ten (10) Business Days after the end of each calendar
quarter, Purchaser shall provide to Parent a written statement (each, a "New
Product Statement"), which shall set forth the aggregate Net Sales of
each such New Product for such calendar quarter and the calculation of
the corresponding royalty payment. Purchaser shall pay to Parent such
royalty payment reflected in such New Product Statement within twenty (20)
Business Days after the end of each calendar quarter.   (i) With respect to
each New Product that Purchaser elects to acquire, all royalty payments by
Purchaser with respect to such New Product pursuant to this Section 3.3 shall
be reduced by 50% upon the commercial launch of a generic version of such New
Product.   (j) Upon submission of a notice that Purchaser elects to acquire
a New Product, Sellers shall immediately assign to Purchaser all
New Purchased Intellectual Property associated with the New Product.   (k)
In the event that Purchaser elects to acquire a New Product pursuant to
Section 3.3(a), Section 3.3(b) or Section 3.3(c), Purchaser agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to develop or have developed, as applicable,
market such New Product; provided, however, that Purchaser shall have the
right to terminate its license to such New Product provided that Purchaser
assigns back the New Purchased   34   Intellectual Property. If Purchaser
terminates its license to such New Product, then Purchaser shall have no
further rights or obligations with respect to the New Product (including, but
not limited to, the obligation to market such New Product), and Sellers may
make, have made, distribute, use, sell, offer to sell, have sold, market, co-
market, import, promote and co-promote such New Product or sublicense such
New Product to a third party (subject to the restrictions regarding New P/D
Products during the Seven Year Period).   (l) Sellers and Purchaser shall
negotiate in good faith the focus of Sellers\' development efforts regarding
the New Products that may be submitted under this Section 3.3 for
Purchaser\'s option, which negotiation is anticipated to include the planned
identity and order of the first several New Products.   (m) Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, any Pain Product that has been developed to
the state of creation of a prototype and dissolution profile (i) prior to the
date hereof, (ii) during the period of time between the date hereof and the
Closing Date, or (iii) after the Closing Date, which is owned by Sellers or
their Subsidiaries and has not been licensed to a third party prior to the
date hereof, shall be considered a New Product which Sellers shall, or shall
cause their Subsidiaries to, offer in writing to Purchaser prior to any other
Person the option for a Period of Election to acquire any such New Product
pursuant to Section 3.3(a), Section 3.3(b) or Section 3.3(c), provided that
such new Pain Product contains or does not contain, as applicable, the
chemical ingredients or compounds required by such sections.   (n)
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, including this Section 3.3
and Section 8.9, this Agreement shall not prevent Sellers or their Affiliates
from providing any routine services to third parties, where Sellers or their
Affiliates are merely implementing such third parties\' instructions and
Sellers or their Affiliates are not engaged in providing formulating services
to such parties or otherwise performing inventive work (including conceiving
inventions for the third party or reducing the third party\'s inventions to
practice). Illustrative examples of such non-precluded routine services
include (i) chemical structure analysis and elucidation of compounds or
chemicals independently provided by third parties (without formulation by
Sellers or their Affiliates) (ii) clinical supply manufacturing on a contract
basis of compounds or chemicals independently provided by third parties;
(iii) clinical studies; (iv) validation services with respect to processes
and methods; (v) regulatory services; (vi) method development; and (vii)
stability testing.   (o) For the avoidance of doubt, the terms of
Sellers\' right to develop New Products as set forth herein shall be subject
to the Services Agreement.   3.4 Option on Purchaser Developed Products. If
at any time during the Seven Year Period Purchaser wants to internally
develop, or wants to utilize a third party to develop, any Pain Product
containing (i) propoxyphene and/or diclofenac or (ii) an opioid/APAP
combination or an opioid/NSAID combination (a "Purchaser Developed Product"),
then Purchaser shall offer in writing to Sellers prior to any other Person
the   35   option for a Period of Election to develop any such Purchaser
Developed Product. Sellers shall respond to such offer by Purchaser during
the Period of Election. If Sellers notify Purchaser that Sellers decline to
exercise such option to develop any such Purchaser Developed Product, then
Sellers shall have no further rights with respect to the Purchaser Developed
Product, and Purchaser shall have no further obligation to notify Sellers
with respect to such Purchaser Developed Product and may develop, or may
utilize a third party to develop, such Purchaser Developed Product. If Seller
notifies Purchaser in writing that it elects to develop any Purchaser
Developed Product within such Period of Election, then:   (a) Sellers will
develop such Purchaser Developed Product and, during the Ten Year Period,
Purchaser shall pay to Sellers or their Subsidiaries, as the case may be, the
amounts specified in the Services Agreement in connection with the
development of such New Product and royalties on the aggregate Net Sales of
such Purchaser Developed Product as follows:   (i) 7.5% of Net Sales up to
and including $25,000,000 per calendar quarter, and   (ii) 10% of the
portion of Net Sales, if any, over $25,000,000 per calendar quarter;  
or   (b) Sellers shall notify Purchaser within sixty (60) Business Days
after their receipt of Purchaser\'s notice if Sellers are unable or unwilling
to develop and produce any such Purchaser Developed Product;
provided, however, that Sellers shall have no right to any royalty payments
with respect to such Purchaser Developed Product pursuant to this Section
3.4(b).   Notwithstanding the foregoing, with regard to the Period
of Election for an option of Sellers to develop a Purchaser Developed
Product pursuant to this Section 3.4, no Period of Election shall expire less
than six (6) months after the expiration of the Period of Election for the
immediately preceding Purchaser Developed Product (if any) in the event that
Sellers have exercised their option to develop such immediately preceding
Purchaser Developed Product; provided, however, that in the event that
Sellers have failed to elect to develop such immediately preceding Purchaser
Developed Product, the Period of Election for the then-current Purchaser
Developed Product shall expire sixty (60) days after the end of the Period of
Election in which Sellers failed to make such election and the date of
submission of the then-current Purchaser Developed Product.   Purchaser
covenants not to develop any pharmaceutical products using the Patents and
Know How contained within the Licensed Assets and Purchased Assets during the
Seven Year Period except with respect to Lifecycle Products that Purchaser
requested Sellers to develop and Sellers were unable or unwilling to develop,
in which case Purchaser may develop such Lifecycle Products itself or retain
a third party to do the   36   same using, in the case of Derivative
Darvocet Products, the Darvocet-N Know How and the Darvocet-N XR IDM and, in
the case of Derivative Lynxorb Products, the ProSorb Patents and the ProSorb
Know How.   3.5 Odyssey.   (a) On the Closing Date, Purchaser and Sellers
shall enter into the Odyssey Co-Development Agreement for the development
and commercialization of the Odyssey Product. Pursuant to the Odyssey Co-
Development Agreement, Sellers shall grant to Purchaser an exclusive license
to the Odyssey Patents and Odyssey Know How for all pharmaceutical products
containing the Odyssey Ingredient as the sole active ingredient. The Odyssey
Co-Development Agreement shall further provide that Purchaser shall pay for
all costs and expenses relating to the development and commercialization of
the Odyssey Product, including costs arising from the defense and prosecution
of the Odyssey Patent application filed on May 26, 2004 and Odyssey Know How,
in each case solely as it relates to products containing the Odyssey
Ingredient.   (b) Each party shall retain fifty percent (50%) of any cash
proceeds from the development and commercial exploitation of the
Odyssey Product (net of Purchaser\'s and Sellers\' aggregate costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the development and commercial
exploitation of the Odyssey Product) (the "Net Cash Proceeds").   (c) If
Purchaser and Sellers mutually agree to sell the rights to the Odyssey
Product, then each party shall retain fifty percent (50%) of the sale
proceeds (net of Purchaser\'s and Sellers\' aggregate costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the development and commercial exploitation of
the Odyssey Product) (the "Net Sale Proceeds"). To the extent there is
any deferred consideration in such sale, including, but not limited to,
milestone payments and royalties, each party shall retain fifty percent (50%)
of any such deferred compensation.   (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event that Purchaser has not enrolled at least one (1) subject in a PK
Study on or prior to the later of six (6) months (i) from the Closing Date,
or (ii) after the date upon which delivery of the Odyssey Product formulation
and clinical supply thereof is made by Sellers to Purchaser, then thereafter
Purchaser shall only retain twenty-five percent (25%), rather than fifty
percent (50%), of any of the Net Sale Proceeds, deferred compensation and Net
Cash Proceeds referred to in Section 3.5(b) and Section 3.5(c); provided,
however, that in the event that Purchaser has enrolled at least one (1)
subject in a PK Study on or prior to the later of twelve (12) months (x) from
the Closing Date or (y) after the date upon which delivery of the Odyssey
Product formulation and clinical supply thereof is made (the "Cure
Deadline"), Purchaser shall regain its right to receive fifty percent (50%)
by Sellers to Purchaser of any of the Net Sale Proceeds,
deferred compensation and Net Cash Proceeds referred to in Section 3.5(b) and
Section 3.5(c); provided, further, however, if Purchaser fails to enroll at
least one (1) subject in a PK Study on or prior to the Cure Deadline, then
Purchaser\'s rights to the Odyssey Patents and Odyssey Know How shall revert
to Parent,   37   provided that (notwithstanding such reversion)
Purchaser shall retain the right to receive twenty-five percent (25%), of any
of the Net Sale Proceeds, deferred compensation and Net Cash Proceeds
referred to in Section 3.5(b) and Section 3.5(c) and Purchaser shall
thereafter pay for all costs and expenses relating to the development and
commercialization of the Odyssey Product.   (e) During any period Purchaser
retains the rights to the Odyssey Product in accordance with the foregoing,
Purchaser shall pursue the development and commercialization, including any
litigation, relating to the Odyssey Product and Purchaser shall bear all
costs and expenses in connection therewith; provided, however, that in the
event that Parent determines in good faith that Purchaser is not aggressively
pursuing the development, commercialization, and any litigation, Parent shall
have the right, upon five (5) Business Days written notice to Purchaser, to
assume the pursuit of all or any part of such development, commercialization,
or litigation at Sellers\' costs.   (f) Purchaser shall have the right to
assign its rights under the Odyssey Co-Development Agreement to a third party
without consent, provided that the third party agrees to be bound by the
obligations of Purchaser and perform Purchaser\'s obligations under that
agreement. Purchaser may, at any time, terminate the Odyssey Co-Development
Agreement, in which case Purchaser shall have no further obligations
regarding the Odyssey Product or that agreement, but shall also waive all
rights it received under that agreement.   3.6 Disputed Statements.   (a)
Purchaser will keep full and accurate books and records relating to the
performance required with respect to its obligations to pay royalties under
this Agreement and its Net Sales. For one (1) year after receipt of a
Lifecycle Products Statement or New Product Statement delivered pursuant to
Section 3.2 or Section 3.2(a) (each, a "Net Sales Statement"), as applicable
(the "Audit Termination Date"), Sellers shall have the right, during regular
business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, to have the books
and records of Purchaser relating to such Net Sales and royalty payments
audited no more frequently than once per year so as to verify the accuracy of
Purchaser\'s calculation of such Net Sales or royalty payment. If, upon the
inspection of the books and records of Purchaser, Sellers disagree with
Purchaser\'s calculation of Net Sales or royalty payments set forth in any
Net Sales Statement, Sellers may, prior to the expiration of the Audit
Termination Date, deliver written notice to Purchaser disagreeing with such
calculation and setting forth Sellers\' calculation of such amount. Any such
notice of disagreement shall specify those items or amounts as to which
Sellers disagree, and Sellers shall be deemed to have agreed with all other
items and amounts contained in the Net Sales Statement and the calculation of
Net Sales included in such Net Sales Statement. If Sellers do not deliver to
Purchaser a written notice of disagreement prior to the expiration of the
Audit Termination Date, then Sellers shall be deemed to have agreed to such
Net Sales Statement.   38    (b) If a notice of disagreement shall be
duly delivered pursuant to Section 3.6(a), Purchaser and Sellers shall,
during the ten (10) Business Days following such delivery, use their
commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or
amounts in order to determine, as may be required, the amount of Net Sales of
the Lifecycle Products, or New Products, as applicable, and the royalty
payments in connection therewith, which amount shall not be less than the
amount thereof shown in Purchaser\'s calculation set forth in the Net Sales
Statement nor more than the amount thereof set forth in Sellers\' calculation
delivered pursuant to Section 3.6(a). If during such period, Purchaser and
Sellers are unable to reach such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter
cause the Accountant to review this Agreement and the disputed items or
amounts for the purpose of calculating Net Sales of the Lifecycle Products,
or New Products, as applicable, and the amount of the royalty payments in
connection therewith included in such Net Sales Statement (it being
understood that in making such calculation, the Accountant shall
be functioning as an expert and not as an arbitrator). In making such
calculation, the Accountant shall consider only those items or amounts in the
Net Sales Statement and Sellers\' calculation of Net Sales included in such
Net Sales Statement as to which Sellers have disagreed. The Accountant shall
deliver to Purchaser and Sellers, as promptly as practicable (but in any case
no later than twenty (20) Business Days from the date of engagement of the
Accountant), a report setting forth such calculation. Such report shall be
final and binding upon Purchaser and Sellers. The cost of such review and
report shall be borne equally by Purchaser on one hand and Sellers on the
other hand; provided, however, that if the Accountant\'s report is in
agreement with either party\'s calculations included in the Net Sales
Statement, the cost of such review and report shall be borne solely by the
other party.   (c) Purchaser and Sellers shall, and shall cause
their respective representatives to, cooperate and assist in the preparation
of the Net Sales Statement and the calculation of the amount of Net Sales of
the Lifecycle Products, or New Products, as applicable, and the amount of
the royalty payments in connection therewith and in the conduct of the
review referred to in this Section 3.6(a), including making available, to the
extent necessary, books, records, work papers and personnel.   (d) If the
amount of Net Sales of the Lifecycle Products, or New Products, as
applicable, and the royalty payments in connection therewith, as determined
by the Accountant pursuant to Section 3.6(a), is greater than the calculation
provided for by Purchaser in the applicable Net Sales Statement, then
Purchaser shall promptly pay to Parent an amount equal to the difference
between the Accountant\'s calculation of such royalty payments
and Purchaser\'s calculation of such royalty payments.   3.7 Closing Date
Inventory Adjustment.   (a) As promptly as practicable, but no later
than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause to be
prepared and delivered to Sellers a statement calculating the Closing Date
Inventory (the "Closing Date Inventory Statement"), including copies of any
and all back-up or supporting data used in the preparation of the Closing
Date Inventory Statement.   39    (b) If Sellers disagree with
Purchaser\'s calculation of the Closing Date Inventory delivered pursuant to
Section 3.7(a), Sellers may, within ten (10) Business Days after delivery of
the Closing Date Inventory Statement, deliver a written notice to Purchaser
disagreeing with such calculation and setting forth Sellers\' calculation of
the Closing Date Inventory. Any such notice of disagreement shall specify
those items or amounts as to which Sellers disagree, and Sellers shall be
deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the
Closing Date Inventory Statement and the calculation of Closing Date
Inventory delivered pursuant to Section 3.7(a). If Sellers do not deliver to
Purchaser a written notice of disagreement within such ten (10) Business Day
period, then Sellers shall be deemed to have agreed to such the Closing Date
Inventory Statement.   (c) If a notice of disagreement shall be duly
delivered pursuant to Section 3.7(b), Purchaser and Sellers shall, during the
ten (10) Business Days following such delivery, use their commercially
reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in
order to determine, as may be required, the Closing Date Inventory. If during
such period, Purchaser and Sellers are unable to reach such agreement, they
shall promptly thereafter cause the Accountant to review this Agreement and
the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of calculating Closing Date
Inventory. In making such calculation, the Accountant shall consider only
those items or amounts in the Closing Date Inventory Statement and Sellers\'
calculation of Closing Date Inventory as to which Sellers have disagreed. The
Accountant shall deliver to Purchaser and Sellers, as promptly as practicable
(but in any case no later than twenty (20) Business Days from the date of
engagement of the Accountant), a report setting forth such calculation. Such
report shall be final and binding upon Purchaser and Sellers. The cost of
such review and report shall be borne equally by Purchaser on one hand and
Sellers on the other hand; provided, however, that if the Accountant\'s
report is substantially in agreement with either party\'s calculations
included in the Closing Date Inventory Statement, the cost of such review and
report shall be borne solely by the other party.   (d) Purchaser and Sellers
shall, and shall cause their respective representatives to, cooperate and
assist in the preparation of the Closing Date Inventory Statement and the
calculation of Closing Date Inventory and in the conduct of the review
referred to in this Section 3.7, including the making available to the extent
necessary of books, records, work papers and personnel.   (e) "Final
Closing Date Inventory" means Closing Date Inventory (i) as shown in
Purchaser\'s calculation delivered pursuant to Section 3.7(a) if no notice of
disagreement with respect thereto is duly delivered pursuant to Section
3.7(b); or (ii) if such a notice of disagreement is delivered, (A) as agreed
by Purchaser and Sellers pursuant to Section 3.7(c) or (B) in the absence of
such agreement, as shown in the Accountant\'s calculation delivered pursuant
to Section 3.7(c). If the Final Closing Date Inventory does not include each
item of Inventory and in the minimum quantities listed in Schedule 1.1(b),
then Parent shall be obligated to pay to Purchaser an amount in cash equal to
the Purchaser Closing Date Inventory Adjustment Amount (the "Purchaser
Inventory Payment") within three (3) Business Days after the Final Closing
Date   40   Inventory is determined; provided, however, that if the Final
Closing Date Inventory reflects any item of Inventory in quantities exceeding
the minimum quantities listed in Schedule 1.1(b), then the Purchaser
Inventory Payment shall be offset by an amount equal to the Parent Closing
Date Inventory Adjustment Amount (the "Parent Inventory Payment"); provided,
further, however, that if the Parent Inventory Payment exceeds the Purchaser
Inventory Payment, then Purchaser shall not be entitled to the Purchaser
Inventory Payment and Purchaser shall pay to Parent, within three (3)
Business Days after the Final Closing Date Inventory is determined, an amount
in cash equal to the amount that the Parent Inventory Payment exceeds the
Purchaser Inventory Payment. Any payment that any party is obligated to make
to the other party pursuant to this Section 3.7 shall be paid by wire
transfer of immediately available funds into an account designated by such
other party; provided, however, that such other party may (but shall not
be obligated to) elect, at any time, to withdraw the amount of any such
payment from the Purchaser\'s Indemnity Escrow Fund or the Sellers\'
Indemnity Escrow Fund, as applicable.   3.8 Adjustment for Excess
Shipments. As promptly as practical, but no later than sixty (60) days after
the Closing Date, Sellers shall cause to be prepared and delivered to
Purchaser a statement calculating the Post-Signing Shipment Values for each
Marketed Product (the "Post-Signing Shipments Statement"), including any and
all back-up or supporting data used in the preparation of the Post-Signing
Shipments Statement. If the sum of the Post-Signing Shipment Values of all of
the Marketed Products is greater than the sum of applicable IMS Product
Demand Average Values, then the Sellers shall pay to the Purchaser an amount
in cash equal to the Shipping Adjustment Amount within three (3) Business
Days after the Post-Signing Shipment Statement is delivered. Any payment
Sellers are obligated to make to Purchaser pursuant to this Section 3.8 shall
be paid by Sellers by wire transfer of immediately available funds into an
account designated by Purchaser; provided, however, that Purchaser may (but
shall not be obligated to) elect, at any time, to withdraw the amount of any
such payment from the Sellers\' Indemnity Escrow Fund.   3.9 Payment of
Purchase Price.   (a) On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall pay the
Purchase Price (less Sellers\' Indemnity Escrow Amount) to Sellers, which
shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds into an account
designated by Sellers.   (b) On the Closing Date, Purchaser, Sellers and
the Escrow Agent shall enter into the Indemnity Escrow Agreement and
Purchaser shall deliver to the Escrow Agent under the Indemnity Escrow
Agreement, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, Sellers\'
Indemnity Escrow Amount and Purchaser\'s Indemnity Escrow Amount.  
41    ARTICLE IV   CLOSING AND TERMINATION   4.1 Closing Date. Subject

written consent of Sellers and Purchaser;   (b) by Purchaser, if any of the
conditions to the obligations of Purchaser set forth in Sections 10.1 and

breach by Purchaser of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement,
and such condition is not waived by Purchaser;   (c) by Sellers, if any
condition to the obligations of Sellers set forth in Sections 10.2 and 10.3
shall have become incapable of fulfillment, other than as a result of a
breach by Sellers of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement,
and such condition is not waived by Sellers;   (d) by Sellers or Purchaser
if there shall be in effect a final nonappealable Order of a Governmental
Body of competent jurisdiction restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; it
being agreed that Sellers and Purchaser, as the case may be, shall promptly

efforts to pursue such appeal);   (e) by Purchaser, in accordance with
Section 3.1;   (f) by Purchaser, if there is a Material Adverse Effect;

Purchaser;   44    (m) by Purchaser, if (i) the Bankruptcy Court enters
an order appointing a trustee, examiner with expanded powers or responsible

dismissed;   (n) by Purchaser, if Purchaser shall have sent written notice
to Sellers at least three (3) Business Days prior to the hearing to approve
the Bidding Procedures Order that the condition set forth in Section 10.1(d)
has not been satisfied; or   (o) by Purchaser, if any secured creditor of
either Seller obtains relief from the stay to foreclose on a significant
portion of the Purchased Assets or Licensed Assets, the effect of which would
cause a Material Adverse Effect.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
Closing shall not have occurred by the close of business on one hundred
eighty (180) days after the date hereof, this Agreement shall automatically
terminate.   4.5 Payment of Development Costs. If this Agreement is
terminated, Sellers shall pay to Purchaser the Development Costs, if any, on
the fifth (5th) Business Day after such termination, which payment obligation
of Sellers shall be an administrative priority expense under Sections 503(b)
and 507(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code. The payment by Sellers to Purchaser of
the Development Costs shall be in addition to the payment of the Expense
Reimbursement and shall not be included in the calculation of the Expense

period of longer than the applicable expiration date for such products.  
(b) Neither Sellers nor any of their Subsidiaries have committed any act or
failed to commit any act, which would result in, and there has been no

or not) on the part of Sellers or any of their Subsidiaries with respect to
Marketed Products.   5.21 Financial Advisors. Except as set forth in

Notebooks included in the Purchased Assets, which shall be provided at
Purchaser\'s expense, shall be identical copies of the portions of the

data or any other information (written or oral) with respect to the Business,
the Purchased Assets, the Licensed Assets, or any other matter, including
those supplied in the Confidential Information Memorandum  
57   distributed by Rothschild, Inc. or presented in due diligence, and the
Purchaser takes full responsibility for making its own evaluation of such
matters, and (b) Sellers specifically disclaim any and all implied or
statutory warranties, including, without limitation, any warranty of
merchantability, warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, warrant of
noninfringement or warranty of title.   ARTICLE VI   REPRESENTATIONS AND

conditions contained in the Bidding Procedures, including the occurrence of
the events by the dates and times listed therein which are expressly
incorporated by reference herein as if set forth at length. Sellers agree to

appeal, petition or motion and shall use their reasonable best efforts to
obtain an expedited resolution of any such appeal, petition or motion.

any other court or Governmental Body with respect to the Bidding Procedures
Order or Sale Order without the consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed.   (e) Sellers shall cooperate with
Purchaser and its representatives in connection with the Sale Order, the
Bidding Procedures Order and the bankruptcy proceedings in connection
therewith. Such cooperation shall include, but not be limited to, consulting
with Purchaser at Purchaser\'s reasonable request concerning the status of
such proceedings and providing Purchaser with copies of requested pleadings,
notices, proposed orders and other documents relating to such proceedings as
soon as reasonably practicable prior to any submission thereof to the
Bankruptcy Court. Sellers further covenant and agree that the terms of any
plan it submits to the Bankruptcy Court for confirmation shall not conflict
with, supersede, abrogate, nullify or restrict the terms of this Agreement,
or in any way prevent or interfere with the consummation or performance of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without
limitation, any transaction contemplated by or approved pursuant to the Sale
Order or the Bidding Procedures Order.   (f) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, neither Purchaser nor Sellers shall be prohibited or
otherwise restrained from making any filing with the Bankruptcy Court to
challenge or object to the entry of an order by the Bankruptcy Court
approving the entry by Sellers into an Alternative Transaction or
Restructuring Transaction; provided, that nothing herein shall grant
Purchaser standing to the extent that Purchaser would not otherwise have
standing under Applicable Law.   ARTICLE VIII   COVENANTS   8.1 Access
to Information. Sellers agree that, prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall be entitled, through its officers, employees and representatives

as it reasonably requests and to make extracts and copies of such books and
records. Any such investigation and examination shall be conducted during
regular business hours and under reasonable circumstances, and Sellers shall
cooperate fully therein. No investigation by Purchaser prior to or after the
date of this Agreement shall diminish or obviate any of the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of Sellers contained in this Agreement or
the Seller Documents. In order that Purchaser may have full opportunity to
make such physical, business, accounting and legal review, examination or
investigation as it may reasonably request of the affairs of Sellers, Sellers

employees, consultants, agents, accountants, attorneys and
other representatives of Sellers to cooperate fully with such representatives

appropriate. Sellers shall promptly deliver to Purchaser all pleadings,
motions, notices, statements, schedules, applications, reports and other
papers filed in any other judicial or administrative proceeding as Purchaser
may reasonably request.   8.2 Permitted Sellers. To the extent any Permitted

competition or similar agreement to  which Sellers or any of their
Subsidiaries is a party;   (ii) make or rescind any election relating to 
Taxes or settle or compromise any claim, action, suit, litigation, 
proceeding, arbitration, investigation, audit or controversy relating  to

Product in accordance with a development plan mutually agreed upon by Sellers
and Purchaser, with such costs and expenses of development to be funded by
Purchaser (the "Development Costs") up to $1,000,000; provided, that

Purchaser\'s written notice, to develop the Darvocet-N XR Product or the
Lynxorb Product in the Ordinary Course of Business.   8.5 Rejection of
Contracts. Except as set forth in Schedule 8.5, Sellers shall not seek to

from the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice (the "Antitrust Division") or any other
Governmental Body in respect of such filings or such transactions, and (iii)
cooperate with each other in connection with any such filing (including, to
the extent permitted by Applicable Law, and at Purchaser\'s cost providing
copies of all such documents to the non-filing parties prior to filing and
considering all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in
connection therewith) and in connection with resolving any investigation
or other inquiry of any of the FTC, the Antitrust Division or other
Governmental Body under any Antitrust Laws with respect to any such filing or
any such transaction. Each such party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to furnish to each other all information required for any application
or other filing to be made pursuant to any applicable law in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each such party shall
promptly inform the other parties hereto of any oral communication with, and
provide copies of written communications with, any Governmental Body
regarding any such filings or any such transaction. No party hereto shall
independently participate in any formal meeting with any Governmental Body in
respect of any such filings, investigation, or other inquiry without giving

and/or participate. Subject to applicable law, the parties hereto
will consult and cooperate with one another in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions

to proceedings under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws. Sellers and
Purchaser may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate
any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this Section
8.7 as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the information contained

may be). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided herein, none of
Sellers, Purchaser nor any of their respective Affiliates shall be required
(i) to hold separate (including by trust or otherwise) or divest any of its

efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by
any Governmental Body with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton
Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other
United States federal or state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations,
orders, decrees, administrative or judicial doctrines or other laws that are
designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, the "Antitrust
Laws"). In connection therewith, if any Legal Proceeding is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement is in violation of any Antitrust Law, Sellers shall use reasonable
best efforts, and Purchaser shall cooperate with Sellers, to contest and
resist any such Legal Proceeding, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, or
restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including by pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial
appeal and all available legislative action, unless, by mutual agreement,
Purchaser and Sellers decide that litigation is not in their respective best
interests. Each of Purchaser and Sellers shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the expiration of the
notice periods under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to such
transactions as promptly as possible after the execution of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided herein, none of Sellers,
Purchaser nor any of their respective Affiliates shall be required (i) to
hold separate (including by trust or otherwise) or divest any of its
businesses, product lines or assets, or any of the Purchased Assets, (ii) to
agree to any limitation on the operation or conduct of the Business, or (iii)

their respective obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser or Sellers, as
applicable, shall cooperate in transferring Excluded Assets to Sellers or
Purchased Assets (including assets of Sellers intended to be Purchased
Assets) to Purchaser, including turning over any payments received by the
other party, and assisting in the collection of any Excluded Assets. Sellers
shall take all necessary actions to enforce all rights of Sellers with
respect to employees, consultants and agents of Sellers and their
Subsidiaries, who are contributors to the science of patentable inventions of
the Darvocet-N XR Product, the Lynxorb Product, the Darvocet-N Suspension
Product, and the New Products to effectuate the transactions contemplated
herein.   8.9 Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation; Confidentiality.   (a)

Sellers, directly or indirectly, of less than 2% of the outstanding capital

provided, further, however, that, except as otherwise provided for in Section
3.3, nothing contained herein shall preclude Sellers or their Affiliates from
developing or manufacturing products for third parties.   (b) For a period
of one (1) year from the Closing Date, Sellers shall not and shall cause

Business after the Closing) or any other Person who has a material
business relationship with the Business, to terminate or modify any such
relationship;   67   provided that the foregoing shall not apply to
general advertisements in newspapers, newsletters, magazines, commercials,
billboards, or other media outlets.   (c) For the period commencing on the
date hereof and continuing until one (1) year from the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall not and shall cause its Affiliates not to: (i) cause,

after the Closing) or any other Person who has a material
business relationship with the Sellers, their Affiliates or the Business, to
terminate or modify any such actual or prospective relationship.   (d) The
confidentiality agreement between Purchaser and Parent dated November 12,
2004 (the "Confidentiality Agreement") shall remain in effect and terminate
upon the earlier to occur of the Closing and as otherwise provided in the
Confidentiality Agreement. From and after the Closing Date, none of Sellers
or Purchaser shall, and each shall cause their respective
Affiliates, officers and directors (collectively, with Sellers or Purchaser,
as applicable, a "Receiving Party") not to, directly or indirectly, without
the prior written consent of the other (the "Disclosing Party"), disclose any
Confidential Information (as defined below) of the Disclosing Party to any
Person, except to a Receiving Party\'s or its Affiliates\' employees or
representatives who need to know such information for any reason contemplated
by this Agreement (and then only to the extent that such Persons are under an
obligation to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information),
or use any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for any reason
other than contemplated by this Agreement unless such Receiving Party has (i)
consulted with the Disclosing Party and obtained the Disclosing Party\'s
prior written consent or (ii) been advised by counsel that disclosure is
required to be made under Applicable Law, legal process, subpoena,
litigation, discovery requests or demands from a Governmental Body or other
legal compulsion, or the requirements of a national securities exchange or
another similar regulatory body. In the event that the Receiving Party is
required by subpoena, civil investigative demand, interrogatories, requests
for information, or other similar process, as provided for in the preceding
sentence, to disclose any Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall
provide the Disclosing Party with prompt written notice of such demands so
that the Disclosing Party may seek an appropriate protective order; provided,
however, to the extent that the Disclosing Party does not seek a protective
order or it is denied a protective order, such disclosure of Confidential
Information by the Receiving Party shall not constitute a breach of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall not make any filings
with the Bankruptcy Court or otherwise permit any filings to be made with
respect to any Confidential Information of Purchaser without the
reasonable prior written consent of Purchaser, and Sellers further agree that
any such filings shall be made under seal pursuant to section 107(b) of the
Bankruptcy Code and Bankruptcy Rule 9018 to the extent reasonably requested
by Purchaser. For purposes of   68   this Section 8.9(d), "Confidential
Information" means any confidential information with respect to the Business,
including, Licensed Assets, methods of operation, customers, customer lists,
Products, prices, fees, costs, technology, inventions, trade secrets, know
how, software, marketing methods, plans, personnel, suppliers, competitors,
markets or other specialized information or proprietary matters.
"Confidential Information" does not include, and there shall be no obligation
hereunder with respect to, information that (i) is generally available to the
public on the date of this Agreement or (ii) becomes generally available to
the public other than as a result of a disclosure not otherwise permissible
hereunder. This Section 8.9 shall not in any way limit the disclosure of
information (x) by Sellers in connection with the prosecution of the Chapter
11 Case or (y) regarding Sellers to other bidders or potential bidders, to
the extent specifically permitted by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
generality of the foregoing, Sellers agree that, without Purchaser\'s
prior written consent, Sellers shall not disclose the identity of
Purchaser\'s financing sources or the amount or terms of financing proposed
to be supplied by an such source, except as otherwise required by Applicable
Law or by the Bankruptcy Court with respect to filings to be made with the
Bankruptcy Court in connection with this Agreement.   (e) The covenants and
undertakings contained in this Section 8.9 relate to matters which are of a
special, unique and extraordinary character and a violation of any of the
terms of this Section 8.9 will cause irreparable injury to the parties, the
amount of which will be impossible to estimate or determine and which cannot
be adequately compensated. Therefore, Purchaser will be entitled to an
injunction, restraining order or other equitable relief from any court of
competent jurisdiction in the event of any breach of this Section 8.9. The
rights and remedies provided by this Section 8.9 are cumulative and in
addition to any other rights and remedies which Purchaser may have hereunder
or at law or in equity. In the event that Purchaser were to seek damages for
any breach of this Section 8.9, the portion of the Purchase Price which is
allocated by the parties to the foregoing covenant shall not be considered a
measure of or limit on such damages.   (f) The parties hereto agree that, if
any court of competent jurisdiction in a final nonappealable judgment
determines that a specified time period, a specified geographical area, a
specified business limitation or any other relevant feature of this Section
8.9 is unreasonable, arbitrary or against public policy, then a lesser time
period, geographical area, business limitation or other relevant feature
which is determined to be reasonable, not arbitrary and not against public
policy may be enforced against the applicable party.   8.10 Preservation of
Records. Sellers and Purchaser agree that each of them shall preserve and
keep the records held by it or their Affiliates relating to the Business for
a period of seven (7) years from the Closing Date and shall make such records
and personnel available to the other as may be reasonably required by such
party in connection with, among other things, any insurance claims by, legal
proceedings against or governmental investigations of Sellers or Purchaser or
any of their Affiliates or in order to enable Sellers or Purchaser to comply
with their respective obligations under this Agreement and each other
agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby or   69   thereby.
To the extent that any party provides the other with records relating to the
Business, such party providing the files shall have the right to duplicate
and maintain copies of such files. In the event Sellers or Purchaser wishes
to destroy such records before or after that time, such party shall
first give ninety (90) days prior written notice to the other and such other
party shall have the right at its option and expense, upon prior written
notice given to such party within such ninety (90) day period, to take
possession of the records within one hundred and eighty (180) days after the
date of such notice.   8.11 Publicity. Neither Sellers nor Purchaser shall
issue any press release or public announcement concerning this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby without obtaining the prior written
approval of the other party hereto, which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, unless, in the sole judgment of Purchaser or Sellers,
disclosure is otherwise required by Applicable Law or by the Bankruptcy Court
with respect to filings to be made with the Bankruptcy Court in connection
with this Agreement or by the applicable rules of any stock exchange on which
Purchaser or Sellers lists securities, provided that the party intending to
make such release shall use commercially reasonable efforts consistent with
such Applicable Law or Bankruptcy Court requirement to consult with the other
party with respect to the text thereof.   8.12 aaiPharma Name. From the
earlier to occur of (i) one (1) year following the Closing Date or (ii) until
exhaustion of packaging and promotional materials existing as of the Closing
Date ("AAI Packaging"), Purchaser shall have the right to use, in connection
with the AAI Packaging, the name "aaiPharma" or similar names or any service
marks, trademarks, trade names, identifying symbols, logos, emblems or signs
containing or comprising the foregoing, only to the extent that such right is
reasonably necessary or required for the limited use of the AAI
Packaging.   8.13 Cooperation with Financing. In order to assist with
obtaining Purchaser\'s acquisition financing in connection with this
Agreement, Sellers shall, and shall cause their Subsidiaries to, provide such
reasonable assistance and cooperation as Purchaser and its Affiliates may
reasonably request.   8.14 Returns, Rebates and Chargebacks.   (a) (i)
Sellers shall be financially responsible for returned Marketed Products sold
by Sellers prior to the Closing Date and Purchaser shall be financially
responsible for returned Marketed Products sold by Purchaser on or after the
Closing Date, provided that Sellers and Purchaser shall be financially
responsible for their own allocated percentage of Split Lots of returned
Marketed Products that will be set forth on a schedule of Split Lots to be
provided by Sellers within ten (10) Business Days after the Closing Date;
provided, however, that Sellers\' financial obligation for such returns shall
terminate two hundred seventy (270) days after the Closing Date.
Such allocated percentage of a Split Lot that Purchaser shall be responsible
for under this Section 8.14(a)(i) shall be equal to the percentage of such
Split Lot located at SPS Cord on the Closing Date and such allocated
percentage of a Split Lot that Sellers shall be   70   responsible for
under this Section 8.14(a)(i) shall equal the percentage of such Split Lot
not located at SPS Cord on the Closing Date.   (ii) As of the Closing,
Purchaser and Sellers  will use commercially reasonable efforts in requesting
that customers  direct all returned Marketed Products to Purchaser; provided,
however,  that except as set forth on Schedule 8.14(a)(ii), returned
Marketed  Products received by Purchaser or Sellers after the Closing Date
will  be handled by such party at its respective returns handling facility. 
Neither Purchaser nor Sellers shall issue credits or make any cash  payments
for returned Marketed Products for which the other party is  financially
responsible as set forth in Section 8.14(a)(i) above;  provided, however,
that such party shall destroy such returned Marketed  Product and invoice the
other party for the reasonable cost of  destruction. Each such invoice shall
set forth information as shall be  necessary to support the invoice. Sellers
and Purchaser shall, within  thirty (30) days of such party\'s receipt of
invoice, pay the other  party for the full invoiced amount. Notwithstanding
anything else  contained herein, if either Purchaser or Sellers issue
financial credit  or other reimbursement for returned Marketed Products and
related  administrative fees for which the other party was financially 
responsible as set forth in this Section 8.14(a), such party shall  invoice
the other party for such amount setting forth information as  shall be
reasonably necessary to support the invoice. Purchaser and  Sellers shall,
within thirty (30) days of Purchaser\'s or Sellers\'  receipt of invoice, pay
the other party for the full invoiced amount.   (iii) Neither Purchaser nor
Sellers shall  encourage Marketed Product returns or accept Marketed Product
returns  outside of its normal course of business without the prior written 
approval of the other party.   (b) Sellers shall be financially responsible
for all rebates pursuant to any rebate programs, including government rebate
programs, with respect to claims for the Marketed Products dispensed (the
dispense date contained in any report from a rebate program shall be used for
purposes of determining the date of such rebate) on or before thirty (30)
days after the Closing Date; provided, however, that Sellers\' financial
obligation for such rebates shall terminate one-hundred eighty (180) days
after the Closing Date (the "Rebates Termination Date"). Purchaser shall
assume financial responsibility for all rebates pursuant to any such rebate
programs with respect to claims for the Marketed Products dispensed after the
Rebates Termination Date. Purchaser and Sellers acknowledge that government
rebates are billed on a calendar quarter basis and to the extent that the
periods set forth in this Section 8.14(b) do not end on a calendar quarter,
the Purchaser and Seller shall make payments for such fractional periods of
any applicable quarter on a pro-rata basis based on the number of days for
which such party is responsible for rebates in the applicable quarter.
Purchaser acknowledges that Sellers will require certain information from
Purchaser in order to calculate the Medicaid rebate for Marketed Products
bearing Sellers\' NDC number. Accordingly, Purchaser agrees that, from and
after the Closing Date until the date which is one (1) calendar year after
the expiration date of the last lot of Marketed Products produced with
Sellers\' NDC   71   number, Purchaser will provide to Sellers,
concurrently with its timely delivery of related information to the Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services (or any successor agency), the following
information: (a) the "best price" (as defined under the Social Security Act,
42 U.S.C. Section 1396r-8(c)(1)(C)) for each Marketed Product identified by
NDC number, (b) on the twentieth (20th) day after the end of each calendar
quarter during such one (1) year period, all information reasonably necessary
for Sellers to calculate the "average manufacturer price" (as defined under
the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. Sections 1396r-8(k)(1)) for each Marketed
Product identified by NDC number, and (c) any additional data or other
information related to such Medicaid issues reasonably requested by
Sellers.   (c) Sellers shall be financially responsible for all chargeback
claims and related administrative service fees for the Marketed Products with
a chargeback invoice dated (i.e., the date of sale from the wholesaler to the
wholesaler customer) on or before forty-five (45) days after the Closing
Date; provided, however, that Sellers\' maximum financial obligation for
chargeback claims and related administrative service fees for the
Marketed Products shall terminate one-hundred eighty (180) days after the
Closing Date (the "Chargeback Termination Date"). Purchaser shall be
financially responsible for all chargeback claims and related administrative
service fees for the Marketed Products with a chargeback invoice dated after
the Chargeback Termination Date. If either Purchaser or Sellers issues
financial credit or other reimbursement for chargeback claims and related
administrative fees for which the other party was financially responsible as
set forth in this Section 8.14(c), such party shall invoice the other party
for such amount setting forth information as shall be reasonably necessary to
support the invoice. Purchaser and Sellers shall, within thirty (30) days of
Purchaser\'s or Sellers\' receipt of invoice, pay the other party for the
full invoiced amount.   (d) After the Closing Date, the Purchaser and
Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts and cooperate in good faith
to notify the wholesale trade customers that Purchaser will begin marketing
the Marketed Products, which notification shall include letters or other
communication as Purchaser and Sellers may mutually agree.   (e) In the
event that Purchaser increases the published Wholesaler Acquisition Cost
("WAC") of any of the Marketed Products prior to the last to expire of the
Rebates Termination Date or the Chargeback Termination Date, Purchaser shall
(i) promptly notify Sellers of such increase and (ii) reimburse Sellers the
increase in amounts associated with returns, rebates or chargebacks as a
result of such increase in WAC. Purchaser and Sellers acknowledge that a
percentage increase in WAC may result in a greater percentage increase in
rebates, in which case Sellers would invoice Purchaser for the full increase
in the rebate. Sellers shall invoice Purchaser on a monthly basis for amounts
due pursuant to this Section 8.14(e) and Purchaser shall pay such invoices
within thirty (30) days after receipt of same.   8.15 Adverse Experience
Reporting and Product Complaints. Sellers shall promptly submit to Purchaser
all adverse drug experience information and product   72   complaints

matters concerning or affecting the safety or efficacy of any of the
Products. Without limiting the foregoing, Sellers shall notify Purchaser of
any adverse or unexpected event brought to the attention of Sellers in
writing following the Closing in respect of any of the Products within three

for conducting all voluntary recalls, stop sales, field alerts, market

Purchaser\'s compliance with this Section 8.16, Sellers shall reimburse
Purchaser for all of its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses,
including notification, shipping and handling charges and amounts refunded or
credited to customers incurred in respect of any Recalls relating to the
Products sold by or on behalf of Sellers prior to the Closing Date and deemed
necessary by Purchaser in Purchaser\'s commercially reasonable judgment.
Purchaser shall reasonably consult with Sellers and take into consideration
Sellers\' reasonable recommendations regarding such Recalls; provided, that
Purchaser shall not be required to consult with Sellers in advance to the
extent circumstances preclude prior consultation. In addition, Purchaser
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the costs and expenses
associated with any such Recall.   8.17 Inventory. Sellers shall deliver the
Inventory to Purchaser FOB Sellers\' third party distribution center. Sellers
shall invoice Purchaser for reasonable storage fees with respect to Inventory

of its receipt of invoice.   8.18 Financial Statements. At Purchaser\'s cost
(and with Purchaser making direct arrangements with certified public
accountants), Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
furnish Purchaser and its representatives as soon as practicable, but no

registration statement (including, without limitation, any prospectus
supplement) of Purchaser under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), including using commercially reasonable efforts  
73   to furnish Purchaser, with financial information of the Business for
any period ending on or before the Closing Date that complies with any
requirements of the staff of the SEC applicable to the balance sheets and

accountants to provide their opinion, consents for the inclusion thereof in
any such registration statement and comfort letters that are customary for

Marketed Products manufactured, finished or sold by, or on behalf of,
Purchaser bear an NDC code different than that used by the Sellers for
the Marketed Products.   8.20 Resale Certificates. Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Sellers at the Closing resale
certificates with respect to the Inventory, in form and substance mutually
acceptable to Purchaser and Sellers, but in no event shall the failure to
deliver such resale certificates delay the Closing or the delivery of such
resale certificates be deemed a condition to the Closing.   8.21
Enforcement of Rights. Sellers shall enforce all rights of Sellers under non-
disclosure or confidentiality, non-compete, or non-solicitation agreements
(collectively, the "Restrictive Agreements") with employees and agents of
Sellers or with third parties to the extent relating to the Business, the
Purchased Assets (or any portion thereof) or the Licensed Assets (or any
portion thereof) and Sellers shall aggressively pursue all litigation in
connection with any breach of such Restrictive Agreements. If Sellers fail to
aggressively pursue any such litigation, then, at Purchaser\'s option,
Purchaser may send written notice to Sellers indicating Purchaser\'s desire
to take over such litigation, and Sellers shall, upon receipt of such written
notice, promptly assign their right to pursue such litigation to Purchaser
and Purchaser shall have the right pursue such litigation, at Purchaser\'s
cost.   8.22 Laboratory Notebooks. Within a commercially reasonable
time after the Closing Date, Sellers shall, at Purchaser\'s expense, create
and deliver copies of the Notebooks to Purchaser, provided that prior to

deal with any Indemnification Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified
against hereunder, it shall within fifteen (15) Business Days (or sooner, if
the nature of the Indemnification Claim so requires) notify the indemnified
party of its intent to do so. If the indemnifying party elects not to defend
against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Indemnification Claim
which relates to any Losses indemnified against hereunder, fails to notify
the indemnified party of its election as herein provided or contests its
obligation to indemnify the indemnified party for such Losses under this
Agreement, the indemnified party may defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with such Indemnification Claim. If the indemnified party
defends any Indemnification Claim, then the indemnifying party shall
reimburse the   79   indemnified party for the Expenses of defending such
Indemnification Claim upon submission of periodic bills. If the indemnifying
party shall assume the defense of any Indemnification Claim, the indemnified
party may participate, at his or its own expense, in the defense of such
Indemnification Claim; provided, however, that such indemnified party shall
be entitled to participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the
expense of the indemnifying party if (i) so requested by the indemnifying
party to participate or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the
indemnified party a conflict or potential conflict exists between the
indemnified party and the indemnifying party that would make such separate
representation advisable; and provided, further, that the indemnifying party
shall not be required to pay for more than one such counsel for all
indemnified parties in connection with any Indemnification Claim. The parties
hereto agree to cooperate fully with each other in connection with the
defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Indemnification
Claim. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11.3 to the contrary, neither
the indemnifying party nor the indemnified party shall, without the written
consent of the other party, settle or compromise any Indemnification Claim or
permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment unless the claimant and
such party provide to such other party an unqualified release from all
liability in respect of the Indemnification Claim. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if a settlement offer solely for money damages is made by the
applicable third party claimant, and the indemnifying party notifies the
indemnified party in writing of the indemnifying party\'s willingness to
accept the settlement offer and, subject to the applicable limitations of
Section 11.4, pay the amount called for by such offer, and the indemnified
party declines to accept such offer, the indemnified party may continue to
contest such Indemnification Claim, free of any participation by the
indemnifying party, and the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to
such Indemnification Claim that the indemnifying party has an obligation to
pay hereunder shall be limited to the lesser of (A) the amount of the
settlement offer that the indemnified party declined to accept plus the
Losses of the indemnified party relating to such Indemnification
Claim through the date of its rejection of the settlement offer or (B) the
aggregate Losses of the indemnified party with respect to such
Indemnification Claim. If the indemnifying party makes any payment on any
Indemnification Claim, the indemnifying party shall be subrogated, to the
extent of such payment, to all rights and remedies of the indemnified party
to any insurance benefits or other claims of the indemnified party with
respect to such Indemnification Claim.   (b) After any final judgment or
award shall have been rendered by a Governmental Body of competent
jurisdiction and the expiration of the time in which to appeal therefrom, or
a settlement shall have been consummated, or the indemnified party and the
indemnifying party shall have arrived at a mutually binding agreement with
respect to an Indemnification Claim hereunder, the indemnified party shall
forward to the indemnifying party notice of any sums due and owing by the
indemnifying party pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such matter and
the indemnifying party shall be required to pay all of the sums so due and
owing to the indemnified party by wire transfer of immediately available
funds within ten (10) Business Days after the date of such notice.  
80    (c) The failure of the indemnified party to give reasonably prompt
notice of any Indemnification Claim shall not release, waive or otherwise
affect the indemnifying party\'s obligations with respect thereto except to
the extent that the indemnifying party can demonstrate actual loss
and prejudice as a result of such failure.   11.4 Limitations on
Indemnification for Breaches of Representations and Warranties.   (a) An
indemnifying party shall not have any liability under Section 11.2(a)(i) or
Section 11.2(b)(i) hereof unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses and
Expenses to the indemnified parties finally determined to arise thereunder
based upon, attributable to or resulting from the failure of any
representation or warranty to be true and correct (unless such failure is the
result of the indemnifying party\'s fraud or willful misconduct), other than
the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.8, 5.16
and 6.1, 6.2 and 6.5 hereof, exceeds $1,700,000 (the "Basket"), in which
case, only the Losses in excess of such amount of Loss shall be covered.  
(b) Sellers shall not be required to indemnify any Person for an aggregate
amount of Losses and Expenses above the amount of Sellers\' Indemnity Escrow
Fund, which shall be the sole source of payment of such amounts, and
Purchaser shall not be required to indemnify any Person for an aggregate
amount of Expenses and Losses under Section 11.2(b)(i) above the amount of
Purchaser\'s Indemnity Escrow Fund.   (c) For purposes of calculating Losses
hereunder with respect to determining whether the Losses and Expenses exceed
$1,700,000 for purposes of Section 11.4(a), any materiality or material
adverse effect qualifications in the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements shall be ignored.   11.5 Indemnity Escrows.   (a)
Purchaser\'s Indemnity Escrow Amount. On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
pay to the Escrow Agent, in immediately available funds, to the account
designated by the Escrow Agent, the Purchaser\'s Indemnity Escrow Amount in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Indemnity
Escrow Agreement. Six (6) months after the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent
shall release fifty percent (50%) of (i) the then existing amount of the
Purchaser\'s Indemnity Escrow Fund to Purchaser, less (ii) the amount of
claims for indemnification under this Article XI asserted by Sellers prior to
the expiration of such six (6) month period but not yet resolved ("Unresolved
Claims"), and any unreleased amount shall be retained by the Escrow Agent.
Twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent shall release the
remaining amount of Purchaser\'s Indemnity Escrow Fund to Purchaser, except
that the Escrow Agent shall retain an amount equal to the amount of the
Unresolved Claims asserted prior to the expiration of such twelve (12) month
period. The Purchaser\'s Indemnity Escrow Fund retained for Unresolved Claims
shall be released by the Escrow Agent (to the extent not   81   utilized
to pay Sellers for any such claims resolved in favor of Sellers) upon their
resolution in accordance with this Article XI.   (b) Sellers\' Indemnity
Escrow Amount. On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall pay to the Escrow Agent,
in immediately available funds, to the account designated by the Escrow
Agent, the Sellers\' Indemnity Escrow Amount (which shall be deducted from
the Purchase Price) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
Indemnity Escrow Agreement. Any payment Sellers are obligated to make to any
Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article XI shall be paid from
the Sellers\' Indemnity Escrow Fund. Six (6) months after the Closing Date,
the Escrow Agent shall release fifty percent (50%) of (i) the then existing
amount of the Sellers\' Indemnity Escrow Fund to Sellers, less (ii) the
amount of the Unresolved Claims asserted by Sellers prior to the expiration
of such six (6) month period, and any unreleased amount shall be retained by
the Escrow Agent. Twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent
shall release the remaining amount of the Seller\'s Indemnity Escrow Fund to
Sellers, except that the Escrow Agent shall retain an amount equal to the
amount of the Unresolved Claims asserted prior to the expiration of
such twelve (12) month period. The Sellers\' Indemnity Escrow Fund retained
for Unresolved Claims shall be released by the Escrow Agent (to the extent
not utilized to pay Purchaser for any such claims resolved in favor of
Purchaser) upon their resolution in accordance with this Article XI.   11.6
Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. Sellers and Purchaser agree to treat any
indemnity payment made pursuant to this Article XI as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for all Tax purposes. If, notwithstanding the treatment
required by the preceding sentence, any indemnification payment is determined
to be taxable to the party receiving such payment by any Taxing Authority,
the paying party shall also indemnify the party receiving such payment for
any Taxes incurred by reason of the receipt of such payment and any Expenses
incurred by the party receiving such payment in connection with such Taxes
(or any asserted deficiency, claim, demand, action, suit,
proceeding, judgment or assessment, including the defense or settlement
thereof, relating to such Taxes). The amount of any Loss shall be reduced on
account of any Tax benefit actually realized by the party incurring such
Loss.  NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, IN NO
EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY OR THEIR AFFILIATES BE LIABLE UNDER ANY THEORY,
INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE,
EXEMPLARY OR INDIRECT DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS, DAMAGE TO REPUTATION, LOST
BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, INTERFERENCE WITH BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES OR
DIMINUTION OF VALUE.   82    ARTICLE XII   TAXES   12.1 Transfer
Taxes. (i) Purchaser and Sellers shall each be responsible for (and shall
indemnify and hold harmless each other against) half of any and all
Liabilities for any sales, use, stamp, documentary, filing, recording,
transfer, real estate transfer, stock transfer, gross receipts, registration,
duty, securities transactions or similar fees or taxes or governmental
charges (together with any interest or penalty, addition to tax or additional
amount imposed) as levied by any Taxing Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, "Transfer Taxes"),
regardless of the Person liable for such Transfer Taxes under Applicable Law
and (ii) Sellers or Purchaser, as required by Applicable Law, shall timely
file or caused to be filed all necessary documents (including all Tax
Returns) with respect to Transfer Taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Sellers shall seek to include in the Sale Order a provision that
Sellers\' sale, transfer, assignment and conveyance of the Purchased Assets
to Purchaser hereunder shall be entitled to the protections afforded under
Section 1146(c) of the Bankruptcy Code. The parties will reasonably cooperate
to minimize any such taxes, including with respect to delivery location.  
12.2 Prorations. All personal property taxes, or ad valorem obligations and
similar recurring taxes and fees on the Purchased Assets for taxable periods
beginning before, and ending after, the Closing Date, shall be prorated
between Purchaser and Sellers as of 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on the
Closing Date. With respect to Taxes described in this Section 12.2,
Sellers shall timely file all Tax Returns due before the Closing Date with
respect to such Taxes and Purchaser shall prepare and timely file all Tax
Returns due after the Closing Date with respect to such Taxes. If one party
remits to the appropriate Taxing Authority payment for Taxes, which are
subject to proration under this Section 12.2 and such payment includes the
other party\'s share of such Taxes, such other party shall promptly reimburse
the remitting party for its share of such Taxes.   12.3 Purchase Price
Allocation. Not later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall prepare and deliver to Sellers copies of Form 8594 and any required
exhibits thereto (the "Asset Acquisition Statement") allocating the purchase
price (including the Assumed Liabilities) among the Purchased Assets in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury regulations
thereunder. Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Sellers from time to time
revised copies of the Asset Acquisition Statement (the "Revised Statements")
so as to report any matters on the Asset Acquisition Statement that need
updating (including purchase price adjustments, if any). Sellers shall have a
period of ten (10) days after the delivery of the Asset Acquisition
Statement or, if applicable, the last Revised Statement (the "Allocation
Response Period") to present in writing to Purchaser notice of any objections
Sellers may have to the allocations set forth therein (an "Allocation
Objections Notice"). Unless Sellers object within such period, the Asset
Allocation Statement or, if applicable, the last Revised Statement shall be
binding on the parties. If Sellers shall raise any objections within the
Allocation Response Period, Purchaser and Sellers shall negotiate in good
faith   83   and use their commercially reasonable efforts to resolve
such dispute. If the parties fail to agree within fifteen (15) days after the
delivery of the Allocation Objections Notice, then Purchaser shall submit the
Asset Acquisition Statement or, if applicable, the last Revised Statement,
including modifications, if any, that Purchaser chooses to make as a result
of its negotiations with Sellers, to the Accountant for resolution by it. The
disputed items shall be submitted to the Accountant within fifteen (15) days
following such failure to agree. The determination of the Accountant shall be
final and binding on the parties and shall not be subject to appeal. The
Accountant shall resolve the dispute by selecting the proposed allocation
submitted by either Purchaser or Sellers which in the sole judgment of the
Accountant most accurately allocates the purchase price and the Assumed
Liabilities among the Purchased Assets in accordance with their relative fair
market values, but not by choosing any other formulation. The Accountant
shall render such decision and report to Purchaser and Sellers in writing,
specifying the reasons for its decision in reasonable detail, not later than
thirty (30) days after the item has been referred to it. The costs, fees and
expenses of the Accountant shall be borne equally by Sellers and Purchaser.
The purchase price for the Purchased Assets shall be allocated in accordance
with the Asset Acquisition Statement or, if applicable, the last Revised
Statements, as finally determined, and all income Tax Returns and reports
filed by Purchaser and Sellers shall be prepared consistently with such
allocation.   12.4 Cooperation on Tax Matters.   (a) Purchaser and Sellers
shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, as promptly as
practicable, such information and assistance relating to the Purchased Assets
and the Assumed Liabilities as is reasonably necessary for the preparation
and filing of any Tax Return, claim for refund or other required or optional
filings relating to Tax matters, for the preparation for any Tax audit, for
the preparation for any Tax protest, or for the prosecution or defense of any
suit or other proceeding relating to Tax matters.   (b) Purchaser shall
retain possession of all accounting, business, financial and Tax records and
information relating to the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities that
are in existence on the Closing Date and transferred to Purchaser hereunder
for a period of at least three (3) years from the Closing Date. Purchaser
shall give Sellers notice and an opportunity to retain any such records in
the event that Purchaser determines to destroy or dispose of them after such
period. In addition, from and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall provide
access to Sellers (after reasonably detailed prior notice and during normal
business hours), to the books, records, documents and other information
relating to the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities as is reasonably
necessary for Sellers to properly prepare for, file, prove, answer, prosecute
and/or defend any Tax Return, claim, filing, tax audit, tax protest, suit,
proceeding or answer.   84    ARTICLE XIII   MISCELLANEOUS   13.1
Expenses. Except for the Expense Reimbursement and as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, each of Sellers and Purchaser shall bear its own
expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and each other agreement, document and instrument contemplated by
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby.   13.2 Specific Performance. Sellers and Purchaser acknowledge
and agree that the breach of this Agreement would cause irreparable damage to
the other and that neither Sellers nor Purchaser will have an adequate remedy
at law. Therefore, the obligations of Sellers and Purchaser under this
Agreement shall be enforceable by a decree of specific performance issued by
any court of competent jurisdiction, and appropriate injunctive relief may be
applied for and granted in connection therewith. Such remedies shall,
however, be cumulative and not exclusive and shall be in addition to any
other remedies which any party may have under this Agreement or
otherwise.   13.3 Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of
Process.   (a) The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court over any dispute arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby and each party hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of
such dispute or any suit, action proceeding related thereto may be heard and
determined in the Bankruptcy Court; provided, however, that in the event the
Bankruptcy Court abstains from exercising or declines to exercise
jurisdiction with respect to any matter provided for in this sentence or is
without jurisdiction, such abstention, refusal or lack of jurisdiction shall
have no effect upon and shall not control, prohibit or limit the exercise of
jurisdiction of any other court having competent jurisdiction with respect to
any such matter. The parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent
permitted by Applicable Law, any objection which they may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any such dispute brought in such court or any
defense of inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such dispute. Each of
the parties hereto agrees that a judgment in any such dispute may be enforced
in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law.   (b) Each of the parties hereto hereby consents to
process being served by any party to this Agreement in any suit, action or
proceeding by the mailing of a copy thereof in accordance with the provisions
of Section 13.7.   13.4 Waiver of Right to Trial by Jury. Each party to this
Agreement waives any right to trial by jury in any action, matter or
proceeding regarding this Agreement or any provision hereof.   85   
13.5 Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement (including the
schedules and exhibits hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement represent
the entire understanding and agreement between the parties hereto
with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement can be
amended, supplemented or changed, and any provision hereof can be waived,
only by written instrument making specific reference to this Agreement signed
by the party against whom enforcement of any such amendment, supplement,
modification or waiver is sought. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement,
including without limitation, any investigation by or on behalf of any party,
shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of
compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
herein. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision of this
Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver
of such breach or as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure
on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right,
power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or remedy. All remedies hereunder are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any other remedies provided by law.   13.6 Governing Law. This
Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of New York applicable to contracts made and performed in such
State.   13.7 Notices. All notices and other communications under

Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any law or
public policy, all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.  
13.9 Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement shall create or be deemed to
create any third party beneficiary rights in any person or entity not a party
to this Agreement except as provided below. No assignment of this Agreement
or of any rights or obligations hereunder may be made by either Sellers or
Purchaser (by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto and any attempted assignment without the
required consents shall be void; provided, however, that Purchaser may assign
this Agreement and any or all rights or obligations hereunder (including,
without limitation, Purchaser\'s rights to purchase the Purchased Assets and
assume the Assumed Liabilities and Purchaser\'s rights to seek
indemnification hereunder) to any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Purchaser);
provided, further, however, in such event, Purchaser shall remain bound by
the terms of this Agreement. Upon any such permitted assignment, the
references in this Agreement to Purchaser shall also apply to any such
assignee unless the context otherwise requires.   87    13.10 Non-
Recourse. No past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, equityholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or
representative of Purchaser or Sellers or their respective Affiliates shall

of or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of,
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.   13.11 Time of Essence.

Agreement, including, without limitation, the deadline by which the Approval
Motion must be filed, the deadlines by which the Bidding Procedures Order and
Sale Order must be entered, and the deadline by which the Closing Date must

The failure to meet the foregoing deadlines shall constitute a default under
this Agreement.   13.12 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of
this Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to
constitute one and the same agreement.    88    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the
parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed by their respective
officers thereunto duly authorized, as of the date first written above.
