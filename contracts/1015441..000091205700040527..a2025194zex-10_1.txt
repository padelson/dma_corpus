Balance Sheet, exceed the reserve for Tax liability (rather than any reserve
for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and

in any notes thereto) and (ii) will not exceed that reserve as adjusted
for the passage of time through the Closing Date.   (k) The unpaid Taxes of
Subsidiary (i) did not, as of the date of its Interim Balance Sheet, exceed
the reserve for Tax liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes

thereto) and (ii) will not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of
time through the Closing Date.    14     (l) Holdings and Subsidiary
have each duly filed, in a timely fashion, all reports and returns required
to be filed by them and have duly paid or provided for all contributions and
other charges due or claimed to be due from them, to or by all social
security and related authorities. No social security or related filings of
either Holdings or Subsidiary have been audited by any social security or

contributions contained in the Financial Statements and carried on the books
of Holdings and Subsidiary on the Closing Date are adequate to cover the

chondrocytes (e.g., in autologous chondrocyte implantation procedures) or
suicide genes (e.g., in gene therapy procedures for treating graft-versus-
host disease or cancerous conditions), including, but not limited to, all
data prepared in anticipation of any marketing    17    application
of, or as support for, a product to be marketed that is to be used in a
clinical or medical study in patients. All such data are true, accurate, and
representative of the work. No material data in the possession or
knowledge of the Contributor Group exists that would undermine or void
these representations or warranties. All products, studies and data
manufactured, prepared, developed, conducted, gathered and generated by
Holdings and/or Subsidiary have been manufactured, prepared, developed,
conducted, gathered, and generated by Holdings and/or Subsidiary in
accordance with Good Laboratory Practices, Good Clinical Practices and Good
Manufacturing Practices, as those terms are commonly used by the appropriate
regulatory authorities and by the pharmaceutical industry generally, to the
extent of their applicability. The regulations and processes applicable to
the chondrocytes, the "TK" gene and gene therapy have the normal
uncertainties with regard to the regulatory policies, procedures and
agencies. The Contributors cannot guarantee approval or favorable action by
the applicable government regulatory agencies. The Contributors will use
their best efforts to cooperate with Recipient and relevant
regulatory agencies to obtain all necessary or desirable regulatory approvals
and authorizations. None of the individuals who have been involved with or
assisted in manufacturing, preparing, developing, conducting, gathering or
generating any or all such products, studies or data, or who have been
involved in the preparation of any regulatory dossiers, have ever been
involved in any criminal conduct of any nature, relating to the development
or approval of any drug or medical device, or a crime that involves bribery,
payment of illegal gratuities, fraud, perjury, false statement, racketeering,
blackmail, extortion, falsification or destruction of records, or
interference with, obstruction of an investigation into, or prosecution of
any criminal offense, or any conspiracy to commit, or aiding, or abetting
such a crime.   (d) Neither Holdings nor Subsidiary unlawfully infringes
or unlawfully or wrongly uses any Intellectual Property owned by any Person.
No process, method, machine, article of manufacture or composition of matter
made, used, sold, offered for sale or imported (or previously made, used,
sold, offered for sale or imported) by Holdings or Subsidiary infringes
any Intellectual Property of any Person. No process, method, machine, article
of manufacture or composition of matter made, used, sold, offered for sale
or imported (or previously made, used, sold, offered for sale or imported) in
a chondrocyte production, culture or implantation program of Holdings
or Subsidiary, including, without limitation, as described in patent
application FR 9911564 entitled "COMPOSITIONS DE CHONDROCYTES, PREPARATION ET
UTILISATIONS," or in Brittberg, Mats, Anders Lindahl, Anders Nilsson, et al.,
"Treatment of Deep Cartilage Defects in the Knee with Autologous Chondrocyte
Transplantation," THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE, Vol. 331, No. 14, pp.
889-895 (October 6, 1994), has unlawfully infringed or otherwise violated, or
does unlawfully infringe or otherwise violate, any Intellectual Property of
any Person. No process, method, machine, article of manufacture or
composition of matter made, used, sold, offered for sale or imported (or
previously made, used, sold, offered for sale or imported) in the area of

PCT/FR97/00385, has infringed or violated, or does infringe or violate, any
Intellectual Property of any Person. Furthermore, no process, method,
machine, article of manufacture or composition of matter made, used, sold,

sale or imported) in a gene therapy program or development of Holdings or
Subsidiary, including without limitation as described in patent application
FR 91 13430 or PCT/FR92/01016, or in U.S. Pat. No. 5,843,432 or EP 674 716,
or in patent application PCT/FR93/01259, has unlawfully infringed
or violated, or does unlawfully infringe or violate, any Intellectual
Property of any Person. The representations and warranties set forth in this
subparagraph 4.19(d) are made with respect to all business and activities now
conducted by Contributors, Holdings and Subsidiary and all business
activities to be conducted after the Closing Date as contemplated by the
activities described on EXHIBIT K hereto.   (e) The Holdings Intellectual
Property is sufficient to enable Holdings to conduct its business as
currently conducted. The Subsidiary Intellectual Property is sufficient to
enable Subsidiary to conduct    18    its business as currently
conducted. To the best knowledge of Contributors, Holdings and Subsidiary,
after a reasonable evaluation of information which any member of the
Contributor Group has become aware, the Holdings Intellectual Property and
Subsidiary Intellectual Property will enable Recipient to achieve, and will
not impede, the activities to be conducted after the Closing Date
as contemplated by the activities described on EXHIBIT K hereto, except that
the Holdings Intellectual Property and the Subsidiary Intellectual Property
are not represented to enable Recipient to achieve the MVAX and AC Vaccine
Technology Milestones.   (f) RESERVED   (g) None of Holdings, its legal
representatives, legal counsel, directors or employees has received any claim

make obsolete any product, process or development of Holdings or
Subsidiary.   (p) To the best knowledge of the Contributor Group, after
acting reasonably and with diligence to ascertain the verity of contrary
information if and when such information has been received by any member of
the Contributor Group, neither the contract between RPR and Subsidiary of
January 13, 1998 (CONTRAT DE RECHERCHE ENTRE RHONE POULENC RORER ET
GENOPOIETIC EN DATE DU 13 JANVIER 1998) nor any other contract or agreement
between individuals and/or associations of the Contributor Group provides
Aventis or RPR with access to or rights with respect to any or all vaccines
derived from plasmorviruses, such vaccine technology being disclosed in
international patent application PCT/FR97/00619 (i.e.- WO 97/38118) entitled
"NOUVEAUX VACCINS ISSUS DE PLASMOVIRUS."   (q) The UNIVERSITE DE NANTES
("UN") will promptly assign to the L\'UNIVERSITE PIERRE ET MARIE CURIE
("UPMC") all rights that UN may have, or will have, in patent application FR
99 11564 entitled "COMPOSITIONS DE CHONDROCYTES, PREPARATION ET
UTILISATIONS," additions in France (i.e., divisionals, continuations,
continuations-in-part, etc.), foreign extensions (i.e., counterpart
applications filed for patent protection outside of France), and any foreign
additions of these foreign extensions, as well as all intellectual property
rights that UN may have, or will have, concerning chondrocyte-
related technologies that result from research pursued under the CONTRAT DE
COOPERATION ENTRE GENOPOIETIC ET L\'UNIVERSITE DE NANTES EN DATE DU 21
OCTOBRE 1999. Recipient will be presented with a timely opportunity to
purchase these rights on the same terms that are available to AVAX (via
Subsidiary) for the purchase from UPMC of eighteen families of patents and
patent applications through Agreement No. W 20007 (between UPMC and
Subsidiary, and as completed by Subsidiary on April 20, 2000).   (r)
Subsidiary has developed and is developing media for storing (under cool, but
nonfreezing conditions, as well as under cryopreservation conditions)
chondrocytes. Such Subsidiary developed media includes media that
is disclosed and claimed in patent application FR 99 11564 entitled
"COMPOSITIONS DE CHONDROCYTES, PREPARATION ET UTILISATIONS." Such Subsidiary
developed media, as well as other media that Subsidiary is developing for
storing chondrocytes, is more effective in storing chondrocytes than the
media disclosed and claimed in international patent application WO 97/33975
(i.e., PCT/FR97/00385) entitled "MILIEU POUR LA CONSERVATION DE MATERIEL
BIOLOGIQUE." The manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale, or importation in
the United States, Europe and Australia of such media that Subsidiary has
developed and is developing would not infringe or otherwise violate any
current or future rights that Aventis or any other Person has or may
have.   (s) Recipient will have the opportunity to license exclusively
all rights in the patent application entitled "AAV Production" (filed in the
U.S. on March 5, 1999), additions in the U.S. (i.e., divisionals,
continuations, continuations-in-part, etc.), non-U.S. extensions (i.e.,
counterpart applications filed for patent protection outside of the U.S.),
and any non-U.S. additions of these non-U.S. extensions, as well as all
intellectual property rights concerning AAV-related technologies that result
from research pursued under the CONTRAT DE COLLABORATION ET DE RECHERCHE
ENTRE GENOPOIETIC ET L\'UNIVERSITE DE NANTES EN DATE DU 27 AVRIL 1999. The
opportunity for Recipient to license exclusively these rights will   
22    be made in a timely manner and in substance on the same terms that
are available to AVAX (via Subsidiary) for the purchase of eighteen families
of patents and patent applications of UPMC through Agreement No. W 20007
(between UPMC and Subsidiary, and as completed by GP on April 20, 2000).  
SECTION 4.20 LITIGATION.   (a) There is no claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation pending or threatened against or affecting (I) either
Holdings or Subsidiary, any of either company\'s legal representatives,
directors or employees or any of either company\'s assets or (II) any
transaction contemplated hereby.   (b) Neither Holdings nor Subsidiary has
received any notice, demand or claim, nor is there any action, suit, inquiry,
hearing, proceeding or investigation of a civil, criminal or administrative
nature or before any court or governmental or other regulatory or
administrative agency, commission or authority which is pending or
threatened, directly or indirectly concerning, relating to or resulting from
any accident, happening, condition or event caused by or allegedly caused by
an alleged hazard or alleged defect in manufacture, design, materials or
workmanship (including, without limitation, any alleged failure to warn or
any breach of any express or implied warranty or representation) with respect
to any product manufactured, produced, distributed, marketed, delivered or
sold by either Holdings or Subsidiary nor is there any valid basis
therefor.   SECTION 4.21 INSURANCE.   (a) Section 4.21(a) of the
Contributor Group Disclosure Schedule sets forth an accurate and complete
list of all policies of fire, liability, legal representatives, directors or
employees coverage, product liability, workmen\'s compensation, health, title

SECTION 5.1 RECEIPT OF AVAX STOCK.   (a) Each of the Contributors, the Other
Holdings Shareholders and the Other Subsidiary Shareholders intend to hold
AVAX Stock for investment for their own account and not with a view to, or
for sale in connection with, any resale or distribution thereof. Each of the
Contributors, the Other Holdings Shareholders and the Other Subsidiary
Shareholders, either alone or together with their advisors, has sufficient
knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so as to be
capable of evaluating the merits and risks of his investments in AVAX Stock
and is capable of bearing the economic risks of such investment. All of the
Contributors, the Other Holdings Shareholders and the Other Subsidiary
Shareholders are "accredited investors" as that term is defined in Rule
501(a) under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "SECURITIES
ACT").   (b) Each of the Contributors, the Other Holdings Shareholders and
the Other Subsidiary Shareholders is aware of AVAX\'s business affairs and
financial condition and have received and reviewed copies of the AVAX SEC
Reports (as defined in Section 6.7 below) and have acquired sufficient
information about AVAX to reach an informed and knowledgeable decision to
acquire shares of AVAX Stock. All of the Contributors, the Other Holdings
Shareholders and the Other Subsidiary Shareholders are able to bear the
economic risk of holding shares of AVAX Stock for an indefinite period,
including the loss of their entire investment.   (c) AVAX Stock was not
offered or sold to the Contributors, the Other Holdings Shareholders and/or
the Other Subsidiary Shareholders by any form of general solicitation or
advertising. All of the Contributors, the Other Holdings Shareholders and the
Other Subsidiary Shareholders understand that their acquisition of AVAX Stock
has not been registered under the Securities Act or registered or qualified
under any state securities law in reliance on specific exemptions therefrom,
which exemptions may depend upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of
the Contributors\', the Other Holdings Shareholders\' and the Other
Subsidiary Shareholders\' investment intent as expressed herein. All of
the Contributors, the Other Holdings Shareholders and the Other
Subsidiary Shareholders have, in connection with their decision to receive
AVAX Stock, relied solely upon information publicly available to the
Contributors, the Other Holdings Shareholders and the Other Subsidiary
Shareholders and filed by AVAX with the SEC (as defined in Article XII).  
(d) The Contributors, the Other Holdings Shareholders and the
Other Subsidiary Shareholders further acknowledge and understand that the
AVAX Stock will be required to be held by them for at least twenty-four (24)
months following their receipt of any such shares of AVAX Stock and may be
required to be held indefinitely, and it may not be resold or otherwise
transferred except in a transaction registered under the Securities Act or
where an exemption from such registration is available. The Contributors, the
Other Holdings Shareholders and the Other Subsidiary Shareholders understand
that the certificate(s) evidencing the AVAX Stock will be imprinted with a
legend that prohibits the transfer of such stock unless (i) it is registered
or such registration is not required, and (ii) if the transfer is pursuant to
an exemption from registration other than Rule 144 promulgated under the
Securities Act and, if Recipient    30    shall so request in writing,
an opinion of counsel satisfactory to Recipient is obtained to the effect
that the transaction is so exempt and in compliance with applicable state
law.   (e) The Contributors, the Other Holdings Shareholders and the
Other Subsidiary Shareholders understand that nothing in this Agreement or
any other materials presented to them in connection with their acquisition of
AVAX Stock constitutes legal, tax or investment advice. Contributors, the
Other Holdings Shareholders and the Other Subsidiary Shareholders are
represented by legal counsel sophisticated in financial and corporate
transactions and have each consulted such other legal, tax and investment
advisors as each of them, in their sole discretion, has deemed necessary or
appropriate in connection with their acquisition of AVAX Stock.   ARTICLE

other action by any Person under, constitute a default under, or give rise to

obligation of Recipient under, any agreement or other instrument binding upon
Recipient or its properties or assets, except to the extent that any such
violation, failure to obtain any such consent or other action, default, right

Klatzmann\'s relationship with Progenics or resulting from or arising under
the Consulting Agreement.   SECTION 11.2 INDEMNIFICATION OF CONTRIBUTORS.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Article XI, the
Recipient hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Contributors from and against all Claims asserted against, resulting to,
imposed upon or incurred by Contributors, directly or indirectly, by reason
of, relating to or resulting from a breach of any agreement, covenant,
representation or warranty of the Recipient contained in this Agreement or
any facts or circumstances constituting such a breach or by reason of the
ownership or operation of Holdings and/or Subsidiary after the Closing.   
47     SECTION 11.3 PROCEDURE.   (a) Whenever any Claim arises for which
indemnification is sought hereunder, the party seeking indemnification (the
"INDEMNIFIED PARTY") shall promptly notify each party from whom
indemnification is due (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") of the Claim and, when
known, the facts constituting the basis for such Claim. In the event any
party seeks indemnification hereunder resulting from or in connection with
any Claim or legal proceedings by a third person, the notice to the
Indemnifying Party shall specify, if known, the amount or an estimate of the
amount of the liability arising therefrom.   (b) In connection with any
Claim giving rise to indemnity hereunder, the Indemnifying Party at its sole
cost and expense may, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party, assume
the defense of any such Claim or legal proceeding with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to participate in (but not control) the defense of any such action,
with its counsel and at its own expense, and the Indemnifying Party shall not
settle or compromise such action without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense
of any such Claim or litigation resulting therefrom within twenty (20) days
after notice of such Claim is given, (i) the Indemnified Party may defend
against such Claim or litigation in such manner as it may deem appropriate,
including, but not limited to, settling such Claim or litigation on such
terms as the Indemnified Party may deem appropriate, and (ii) the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in (but not control) the
defense of such action, with its counsel and at its own expense.   (c) The
parties acknowledge that, although a tax examination or audit does not
necessarily constitute a Claim, such examination or audit may give rise to a
Claim. Accordingly, it is agreed that any party hereto receiving notice of an
examination or audit of any Tax Return, which Tax Return relates in whole
or in part to the period prior to the Closing, shall give notice thereof to
the others within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of such notice.  
(d) If any amount owed to Recipient pursuant to this Article XI is not paid
in full by the Contributors in immediately available funds within thirty (30)
days after such amount becomes due and payable under this Article XI (the
"OUTSTANDING BALANCE"), then Recipient shall have the right, to be exercised
by Recipient in Recipient\'s sole discretion, to take possession
and ownership of and title to and/or to cancel such number of shares (or
fractions thereof, or certificates representing such shares or fractions
thereof) of AVAX Stock that would otherwise be payable to either or both of
the Contributors pursuant to Sections 1.2(a) and 1.2(d) of this Agreement as
is equal to the Outstanding Balance divided by the fair market value of the
common stock of Recipient traded on the NASDAQ Small Cap Market (or such
other national market on which the AVAX Stock may be publicly traded) at the
time of the expiration of such thirty (30) day period (the "OFFSET SHARES")
(a "RIGHT OF OFFSET"); provided, however, that Recipient complies with the
procedures set forth below. For purposes of enabling Recipient to exercise
its Right of Offset, the Contributors, jointly and severally, hereby grant to
the President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of
Recipient such Contributors\' irrevocable powers of attorney to endorse
and/or transfer any and all stock certificates representing the Offset
Shares, to cancel any and all stock certificates representing such Offset
Shares and to take any and all such other action as is necessary or
desirable, in such officer\'s reasonable discretion, to enable Recipient to
exercise a Right of Offset and to vest all right, title and interest in and
to such Offset Shares in Recipient. In the event Recipient exercises a Right
of Offset, neither Contributor shall have any further right, title or
interest in or to the Offset Shares. If Recipient believes that it
is entitled to indemnity hereunder and desires to exercise its Right of
Offset pursuant to this Section 11.3(d), Recipient shall submit to the
Contributors and the Escrow Agent prior written notice of Recipient\'s intent
to exercise its Right of Offset (an "OFFSET NOTICE"), including a reasonably
detailed statement of the factual basis for such Claim. If the Contributors
do not deliver a written objection to such claim to Recipient and the Escrow
Agent within    48    thirty (30) days after the delivery of such
Offset Notice, stating in reasonable detail the factual basis for such
objection, then all right, title and interest that either or both
Contributors might otherwise have had in or to the Offset Shares shall
terminate and be of no force or effect, the Escrow Agent shall immediately
transfer and deliver the Offset Shares to Recipient and Recipient shall be
entitled to transfer, retain, dispose, cancel or otherwise exercise any and
all rights with respect to the Offset Shares. If the Contributors do
object in writing to such Claim within such thirty (30) day period, stating
in reasonable detail the factual basis for such objection, then either or
both of the parties may submit this dispute for judicial resolution. The
Escrow Agent shall retain the Offset Shares pending final judicial resolution
of the dispute. The exercise of the Right of Offset by Recipient in good
faith, whether or not ultimately determined to be justified, will not
constitute an event of default under this Agreement, any Consulting and
Assignment Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, any agreement for Rights, or
otherwise, nor will the exercise of or the failure to exercise such Right of
Offset constitute an election of remedies or limit Recipient in any manner in
the enforcement of other remedies that may be available to it.   (e) In no
event shall each of the Contributors\' aggregate obligation to indemnify
Recipient for Claims hereunder, under each such Contributor\'s Consulting and
Assignment Agreement, under the Escrow Agreement or each such Contributor\'s
Rights Agreement, as a result of either or both of the Contributor\'s
ordinary negligence, exceed the lesser of (i) Two Million Five Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars (US $2,500,000) or (ii) the fair market value
(as calculated as of the date any such indemnification obligation arises) of
all shares of AVAX Stock received by or held in escrow for such
Contributor at any time (both before and after the date any Claim arises)
pursuant to (A) this Agreement; (B) such Contributor\'s Rights Agreement; (C)
the Escrow Agreement; and (D) any other agreement contemplated by this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or such Rights Agreement, including, but not
limited to, all shares of AVAX Stock issued as a result of the achievement of
any Milestone. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit in any way the
Contributors\' indemnification obligations relating to either or both
Contributor\'s gross negligence or intentional misconduct.   (f) No
indemnification shall be required to be made by any party with respect to any
Claim for indemnity, which, when aggregated with any similar Claims is less
than Two Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (US $200,000), at which point
indemnity may be validly sought for the entire amount of any and all Claims
allowed hereunder, including without limitation, the initial Two
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (US $200,000).   (g) Each of the
parties agrees that to the extent another party indemnifies it from any
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall assign its rights to such Claim to the
Indemnifying Party to the extent of any amounts actually received by the
Indemnified Party from the Indemnifying Party.   (h) In the event the
Consulting Period (as defined in each Consulting and Assignment Agreement) of
either Contributor is terminated during the initial three (3) years of such
Consultant\'s Consulting and Assignment Agreement pursuant to Sections
7.01(c), 7.01(e) or 7.01(f) thereof, then any and all Escrow Stock
Consideration and Escrow Intellectual Property Stock Consideration otherwise
payable or deliverable (or which would or might otherwise become payable or
deliverable at some later date) to such Contributor shall be paid
and delivered to AVAX upon such termination and shall thereupon become the
sole and exclusive property of AVAX and neither of the Contributors shall
have any right, title or interest in or to such Escrow Stock Consideration or
Escrow Intellectual Property Stock Consideration.    49     ARTICLE
