the Buyer the full realization and value of every Assigned Contract, each of
the Owner and the Seller agree that on and after the Closing it will, and
will cause each Vertex Party as appropriate to, at the request and under the
direction of the Buyer and at the Buyer\'s sole cost and expense, in the name
of the Seller or otherwise as the Buyer shall specify, take all reasonable
actions (including the appointment of the Buyer as attorney-in-fact for the
Seller) and do or cause to be done all such things as shall in the reasonable
opinion of the Buyer or its counsel be necessary or proper (i) to assure that
the rights of the Seller and each applicable Vertex Party under such Assigned
Contracts shall be preserved for the benefit of or transferred or issued to
the Buyer, (ii) to facilitate receipt of the consideration to be received by
the Seller or the applicable Vertex Party in and under every such Assigned
Contract, which consideration shall be held for the benefit of, and shall be
delivered to, the Buyer, and (iii) to enforce provisions under such Assigned
Contracts restricting or prohibiting use, transfer or disclosure of any
confidential information relating to the Business or any Acquired Asset
against third parties bound by such provisions. Nothing in this Section
2.1(e) shall in any way diminish the Owner\'s and the Seller\'s obligations
under Sections 5.1(a)(i) and 6.1(h) hereof.     - 11 -   2.2 Purchase
Price and Related Matters.   (a) Purchase Price. In consideration of the
sale and transfer of the Seller\'s right, title and interest in the Business
Assets, the Buyer shall assume the Assumed Liabilities as provided in Section
2.1(c) and shall pay to the Seller an aggregate purchase price of Ninety Five
Million Dollars ($95,000,000) (the "Purchase Price"). At the Closing, the
Buyer shall pay the Purchase Price to the Seller by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated by the Seller in
writing at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.   (b)
Post-Closing Adjustment to Purchase Price.   (i) Within sixty (60) days
after the Closing, the Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Seller a
balance sheet (the "Closing Balance Sheet") of the Seller as of the Closing
Date, determined in accordance with the Applicable Accounting Principles
applied on a consistent basis and this Agreement, except that there shall be
no accrual for any Liabilities which are Excluded Liabilities under Sections
2.1(d)(ii) through (v), together with a calculation of the Adjustment Amount;
provided, that the value of the Investments as set forth on the Closing
Balance Sheet shall be the same as the value of the Investments as set forth
on the November 30 Balance Sheet. For purposes hereof (y) "Adjustment Amount"
means the dollar amount, if any, by which the net assets of the Seller as set
forth on the Closing Balance Sheet is greater or less than the Reference
Amount; and (z) "Reference Amount" means Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000),
less the amount set forth on the November 30 Balance Sheet with respect to
any Investment that is not conveyed to the Buyer hereunder on the Closing
Date as provided for in Section 2.2(c) below.   (ii) If within forty-five
(45) days following delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet, the Seller has not
given the Buyer written notice of its objection as to any item set forth or
reflected therein or omitted therefrom or as to the calculation of any amount
set forth or reflected therein (which notice shall state the basis of its
objection), then the Closing Balance Sheet shall be binding and conclusive on
the Parties and be used in computing the Adjustment Amount.   (iii) If the
Seller duly gives the Buyer such notice of objection, and if the Seller and
the Buyer fail to resolve the issues outstanding with respect to the Closing
Balance Sheet within thirty (30) days of the Buyer\'s receipt of the
Seller\'s objection notice, the Seller and the Buyer shall submit the matters
in dispute for resolution to KPMG (the "Accounting Firm"), which shall,
within thirty (30) days after such submission, determine and report to the
Parties upon such disputed matters, and such report shall be final, binding
and conclusive on the Parties with respect to the matters in dispute. The
fees and disbursements of the Accounting Firm shall be allocated between the
Buyer and the Seller so that the Seller\'s share of such fees
and disbursements shall be in the same proportion that the aggregate dollar
amount of the matters in dispute so submitted by the Seller to the Accounting
Firm that is unsuccessfully disputed by the Seller (as finally determined by
the Accounting Firm) bears to the total dollar amount of such disputed
matters so submitted by the Seller to the Accounting Firm.   (iv) The
Purchase Price shall be decreased (or increased, as the case may be), on a
dollar for dollar basis, by the Adjustment Amount as finally determined, and
the     - 12 -  Seller shall, and Owner shall cause the Seller to, pay
the Buyer (or, in the case of an increase in the Purchase Price, the Buyer
shall pay to the Seller) the Adjustment Amount in cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds. The Seller or the Buyer shall make any payment
required as a result of an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to this
Section 2.2(b) within ten (10) Business Days after the Adjustment Amount has
been finally determined in accordance with this Section 2.2(b).   (c)
Adjustment of Purchase Price for Investments.   (i) The right of the Seller
to sell and convey certain of the Investments to the Buyer pursuant hereto,
and the right of Vertex San Diego to convey certain of the Investments to
Seller, are subject to rights of first refusal, which, if exercised, will
result in Seller not being able to so sell and convey, or the Buyer to
purchase, such Investments. If any such right of first refusal is exercised,
then the Purchase Price shall be reduced, on a dollar for dollar basis, by
the value set forth in Schedule 2.1(a)(vi) with respect to the particular
Investment not conveyed to the Buyer hereunder due to the exercise of such
right of first refusal. Such reduction in the Purchase Price shall be made
prior to the Closing, and shall reduce the Purchase Price, if the right of
first refusal is exercised with respect to an Investment on or before the
Closing Date. If a right of first refusal is not exercised on or before the
Closing Date in accordance with its terms as in effect on the Closing Date,
but remains exercisable thereafter, the Investment in question shall not be
conveyed at the Closing pursuant to this Agreement, the Purchase Price
shall be reduced, and such Investment shall be conveyed to the Buyer upon
the expiration of such right of first refusal; at which time the Purchase
Price shall be increased, on a dollar for dollar basis, following the Closing
by the value of such Investment set forth in Schedule 2.1(a)(vi) and the
Buyer shall pay the Seller such amount in cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds promptly (and not more than three (3) Business
Days) following the conveyance of such Investment.   (ii) The Parties
acknowledge that as of the date of this Agreement Schedule 2.1(a)(vi) does
not contain a definitive value for one of the Investments that is subject to
a right of first refusal. To the extent the right of first refusal related to
such Investment has not been terminated or waived by the date thirty (30)
days from the date hereof, Buyer and the Seller shall negotiate in good faith
to agree on a value to ascribe to such Investment, and Schedule 2.1(a)(vi)
shall be amended to reflect the agreed to value. In the event Buyer and the
Seller have not been able to agree on a value to ascribe to such Investment
by the date forty (40) days from the date hereof, the value proposed by
Buyer, as determined by Buyer pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code, shall be
used for purposes of this Section 2.2(c) and Schedule 2.1(a)(vi) shall be
amended to reflect such value.   (d) Allocation of Purchase Price. The
aggregate amount of the Purchase Price paid by the Buyer hereunder and the
Assumed Liabilities shall be allocated among the Acquired Assets and the Non-
Competition Agreement for Tax purposes, in compliance with Section 1060 of
the Code, and any comparable provisions of state, local, foreign or other
applicable Tax laws.     - 13 -   2.3 The Closing.   (a) Time and
Location. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Closing") shall take place at the offices of Gray Cary Ware and Freidenrich
LLP on a mutually agreed date as soon as practicable, but in no event more
than three (3) Business Days after the first date on which the conditions to
the obligations of the Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby have been satisfied or waived (the "Closing Date"). A "Business Day"
shall mean any day other than (i) a Saturday or Sunday or (ii) a day on which
banking institutions located in San Diego, California are permitted or
required by law, executive order or governmental decree to remain closed.

that are not owned by the Seller;   (xvi) the Owner and the Seller shall
execute and deliver certificates as required under Section 1445 of the Code
and Section 1.1445-2(b) of the Treasury regulations; provided, however, that
if either the Owner or the Seller fails or refuses to deliver the certificate
required to confirm it is not a "foreign person" as such term is defined in
Section 1445(f)(3) of the Code, or the Buyer has actual knowledge that such
certificate is false, the Buyer shall deduct and withhold from the Purchase
Price a Tax as required by Section 1445 of the Code; and, provided, further,
that, in the event of any such withholding, the Closing hereunder shall not
be otherwise affected, the Buyer shall remit such amount to and file the

Schedule 5.6(b) attached hereto are to become Assigned Contracts. In making
such determination, the Parties will be guided by the principle that the
provisions of such material transfer agreements which relate to materials
transferred to the Seller prior to the Closing Date (or the entire material
transfer agreement, if the agreement relates only to such materials) will be
assigned to the Seller, for subsequent assignment to the Buyer. In the event
a dispute arises between the Parties with respect to the determination by the
Owner and the Buyer,   -41-  there shall be a rebuttable presumption that
the agreements that are the subject of the dispute are to be Assigned
Contracts. Upon a determination that a material transfer agreement (or a
portion thereof) is to be an Assigned Contract, such material transfer
agreement (or the portion of such agreement which relates to materials
previously transferred to the Seller) will be assigned to the Seller prior to
the Closing Date, and in connection with the Closing the Buyer will grant
such licenses to the Vertex Parties as may be reasonably necessary to permit
the Vertex Parties to share the benefit of any rights under such material
transfer agreements which are granted back to the Buyer (as the assignee of
such agreements).   ARTICLE VI  CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO CLOSING   6.1

Seller\'s members and managers) as it shall reasonably request in connection

the Owner and the Seller shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify the
Buyer and its officers, directors, managers, employees, agents,
representatives and its Affiliates and their officers, directors, managers,
employees, agents and representatives (the "Buyer Indemnitees") in respect
of, and hold the Buyer Indemnitees harmless against, any and all liabilities,
obligations, judgments, interest, losses, assessments, damages, fines, fees,
penalties, costs and expenses (determined on a pre-tax basis, but after
credit for applicable insurance proceeds actually received by an Indemnified
Party with respect to such previously described liabilities, losses and the
like, whether such receipt is before or after payment by an Indemnifying
Party, subrogation rights of the Indemnified Party\'s insurers being hereby
waived, and also including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\' fees
and reasonable expenses of investigating and defending claims, lawsuits,
complaints, actions or other pending or   -44-  threatened litigation)
(collectively the "Damages") incurred or suffered by any of the Buyer
Indemnitees to the extent resulting from or attributable to:   (a) any
breach of any representation or warranty of the Owner or the Seller contained
in this Agreement;   (b) any failure by any Vertex Party to perform or
observe any covenant or agreement required to be performed or observed by
that Vertex Party contained in this Agreement or any Transfer Document;  
(c) any failure by the Vertex Parties to pay, perform or discharge any
Excluded Liabilities; or   (d) the items set forth on Schedule 7.1(d), which
items will be deemed to be Third-Party Claims in the event claims are made
with respect thereto.   7.2 Indemnification by the Buyer. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Article VII, from and after the Closing, the
Buyer shall indemnify each of the Owner and the Seller and its officers,
directors, managers, employees, agents, representatives and its Affiliates
and their officers, directors, managers, employees, agents and
representatives (the "Seller Indemnitees") in respect of, and hold the Seller
Indemnitees harmless against, any and all Damages incurred or suffered by any
of the Seller Indemnitees to the extent resulting from or attributable
to:   (a) any breach of any representation or warranty of the
Buyer contained in this Agreement;   (b) any failure by the Buyer to
perform or observe any covenant or agreement required to be performed or
observed by it contained in this Agreement or any Transfer Document; or  
(c) any failure by the Buyer to pay, perform or discharge any Assumed
Liabilities.   7.3 Claims for Indemnification.   (a) Third-Party Claims.
All claims for indemnification made under this Agreement resulting from,
related to or arising out of a claim made by a Third-Party against an
Indemnified Party (as defined below) shall be made in accordance with the
following procedures. A person entitled to indemnification under this Article
VII (an "Indemnified Party") shall give prompt written notification to the
person from whom indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of the
commencement of any action, suit or proceeding relating to a claim by a
Third-Party (a "Third-Party Claim") for which indemnification may be sought
or, if earlier, upon the assertion of any such claim by a Third-Party. Such
notification shall include a description in reasonable detail (to the extent
known by the Indemnified Party) of the facts constituting the basis for such
Third-Party Claim and the amount of the Damages claimed. Within thirty (30)
days after delivery of such notification, the Indemnifying Party may, upon
written notice thereof to the Indemnified Party, assume control of the
defense of such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume
control of such defense, the Indemnified   -45-  Party shall control such
defense. The party not controlling such defense may participate therein at
its own expense; provided that if the Indemnifying Party assumes control of
such defense and the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes, based on advice
from counsel, that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party have
conflicting interests with respect to such Third-Party Claim, the reasonable
fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party solely in connection
therewith shall be considered "Damages" for purposes of this Agreement;
provided, however, that in no event shall the Indemnifying Party
be responsible for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for
all Indemnified Parties. The Party controlling such defense shall keep the
other Parties advised of the status of such Third-Party Claim and the defense
thereof and shall consider recommendations made by the other Parties with
respect thereto. Unless and until an Indemnified Party has waived its claim
for indemnification under this Article VII with respect to a Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of such Third-
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party,
which will not be unreasonably withheld. The Indemnifying Party shall not
agree to any settlement of such Third-Party Claim that does not include a
complete release of the Indemnified Party from all liability with respect
thereto or that imposes any liability or obligation on the Indemnified Party
or that restricts any of the rights purported to be transferred pursuant to
this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party,
which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.   (b) Procedure for Other
Claims. An Indemnified Party wishing to assert a claim for indemnification
under this Article VII which is not subject to Section 7.3(a) shall deliver
to the Indemnifying Party a written notice (a "Claim Notice") which contains
a statement that the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under
this Article VII, the amount of Damages incurred, if then ascertainable, and
a reasonable explanation of the basis of the claim for indemnification and
the Damages incurred. Within thirty (30) days after delivery of a Claim
Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party a
written response in which the Indemnifying Party shall: (i) agree that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder (in which case the
Indemnifying Party shall make payment to the Indemnified Party, by check or
by wire transfer, in an amount equal to the Damages incurred or suffered), or
(ii) contest that the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
hereunder or the amount of Damages claimed by the Indemnifying Party. If the
Indemnifying Party in such response contests the right to indemnification
hereunder, or if the Parties are unable to agree on the amount of Damages
incurred or suffered, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall
each have the right to submit such dispute to a court of
competent jurisdiction in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.9.  
7.4 Survival.   (a) The representations and warranties of the Owner, the
Seller, and the Buyer set forth in this Agreement shall survive the Closing
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and continue
until fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date, at which time they shall
expire; provided, however, (i) the representations and warranties contained
in Sections 3.11 and 3.16 shall survive for sixty (60) days beyond the
applicable statute of limitations and (ii) the representations and warranties
of the Owner and the Seller contained in Sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.14 and of
the Buyer contained in Sections 4.1, 4.2, and 4.5 shall survive the Closing
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby without
limitation.   -46-   (b) If an indemnification claim under Section 7.1(a)
or Section 7.2(a) is properly asserted in writing pursuant to Section 7.3
prior to the expiration as provided in Section 7.4(a) of the representation
or warranty that is the basis for such claim, then such representation or
warranty shall survive until, but only for the purpose of, the resolution of
such claim.   (c) The covenants and agreements of the Parties contained in
this Agreement and the Transfer Documents shall survive the Closing and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.   7.5
Limitations.   (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the following limitations shall apply to indemnification
claims under this Agreement:   (i) no claim shall be valid and assertable
under Section 7.1(a) or Section 7.2(a) unless the aggregate amount of Damages
incurred by the Indemnified Party under Section 0 or Section 7.2(a), as
applicable, exceeds Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($300,000), in which case
the Indemnified Party will have the right to indemnification for all Damages
incurred in excess of Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($300,000);   (ii)
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article VII, the
Owner and the Seller shall not have any obligation to indemnify the Buyer
Indemnitees under Section 7.1(a) and with respect to Items 1 and 5 of
Schedule 7.1(d) in an amount in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the Purchase
Price in the aggregate;   (iii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Article VII, the Owner and the Seller shall not have any
obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees with respect to Item 2 on
Schedule 7.1(d) in excess of the amount set forth in Item 2 of Schedule
7.1(d);   (iv) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Article VII, the Owner and the Seller shall not have any obligation
to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees under Section 7.1(a) with respect to any
matter with respect to which they are also entitled to indemnification under
Section 7.1(d); and   (v) notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Article VII, the Buyer shall not have any obligation under
Section 7.2(a) to indemnify the Seller Indemnitees in an amount in excess of
fifty percent (50%) of the Purchase Price in the aggregate.   (b)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article VII, no
limitation or condition of liability provided in Section 7.5(a) shall apply
to a breach of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.14, 3.16, 4.1, 4.2 or 4.5 hereof.   (c)
The indemnification rights of the Parties under this Article VII are the sole
and exclusive remedies for any breach of representation or warranty made by
any Party in this Agreement; provided, that the foregoing (including but not
limited to the limitations set forth in   -47-  Section 7.5(a) hereof)
shall not be deemed to limit the right of any Party to pursue indemnification
or other remedies for claims involving fraud or intentional misconduct.  
7.6 Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification payments made
under this Agreement shall be treated by the Parties as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price to the maximum extent allowable under applicable law.   7.7
Effect of Closing. Upon the Closing, any condition to the obligations of any
Party hereunder contained in Article VI that has not been satisfied,
including any representation, warranty or covenant which to the actual
knowledge of any Party has been materially breached or left unsatisfied by
any other Party and which material breach or failure to satisfy by such
other Party is a condition precedent to the first Party\'s obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, will be deemed to be waived
by the Parties, and each Party will be deemed to fully release and forever
discharge the other Parties on account of any and all claims, demands, or
charges, known or unknown, with respect to the same. Nothing in this Section
7.7 shall be deemed to affect any provision herein which expressly survives
the Closing or pertains to matters which occur after the Closing.   ARTICLE
VIII  TERMINATION   8.1 Termination of Agreement. The Parties may terminate
this Agreement prior to the Closing as provided below:   (a) the Parties
may terminate this Agreement by mutual written consent;   (b) the Buyer may
terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the Seller and the Owner
if the Seller or the Owner has materially breached any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement and such breach
(i) would cause the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 not to be satisfied
and (ii) is not cured within thirty (30) days following delivery by the Buyer
to the Owner and the Seller of written notice of such breach;   (c) the
Owner and the Seller may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to
the Buyer if the Buyer has materially breached any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement and such breach (i) would
cause the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 not to be satisfied and (ii) is
not cured within thirty (30) days following delivery by the Seller and the
Owner to the Buyer of written notice of such breach;   (d) the Buyer may
terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the Owner and the Seller
if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before May 15, 2003 provided
that the Buyer is not in material breach under this Agreement at the time it
seeks to terminate under this Section 8.1(d);   (e) the Owner and the Seller
may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the Buyer if the
Closing shall not have occurred on or before May 15, 2003 provided that the

time they seek to terminate under this Section 8.1(e).   -48-   8.2
Effect of Termination. If any Party terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1, all obligations of the Parties hereunder shall terminate without
any liability of any Party to the other Parties except for the provisions of
Sections 3.14 and 4.5 relating to brokerage, Section 9.5 relating to press
releases and announcements, Section 9.7 relating to solicitation of employees
and Section 11.7 relating to expenses shall survive such termination, as
shall the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement in accordance with
its terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, termination of this Agreement shall
not relieve any Party of liability for any breach by such Party, prior to
the termination of this Agreement, of any covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement or impair the right of any Party to obtain such remedies as
may be available to it in law or equity with respect to such a breach of any
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement by another Party.  
ARTICLE IX  ADDITIONAL COVENANTS   9.1 Taxes.   (a) Except to extent
included within the Assumed Liabilities, the Owner and the Seller shall be
jointly and severally liable for and pay, and pursuant to Article VII shall
indemnify each Buyer Indemnitee from and against, all Taxes (including,
without limitation, any amounts owed by a Buyer Indemnitee relating to Taxes
pursuant to a contract or otherwise) applicable to the Business, and the
Seller\'s right, title and interest in Business Assets, in each case
attributable to Taxable years or periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such
Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date. In addition to the
Assumed Liabilities, the Buyer shall be solely liable for and pay, and
pursuant to Article VII shall indemnify each Seller Indemnitee from and
against, all Taxes applicable to the Business, the Buyer\'s right, title and
interest in the Business Assets and the Assumed Liabilities that are
attributable to taxable years or periods beginning after the Closing Date
and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period
beginning after the Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement, any
Straddle Period shall be treated on a "closing of the books" basis as two
partial periods, one ending at the close of business on the Closing Date and
the other beginning on the day after the Closing Date, except that Taxes
(such as property Taxes) imposed on a periodic basis shall be allocated on a
daily basis.   (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), any sales Tax, use Tax,
real property transfer or gains Tax, asset transfer Tax, documentary stamp
Tax or similar Tax attributable to the sale or transfer of the Business, the
Acquired Assets, the Seller\'s right, title and interest in the Business

the Owner and the Seller. The Buyer agrees to timely sign and deliver such
certificates or forms as may be necessary or appropriate to establish an
exemption from (or otherwise reduce), or file Tax Returns with respect to,
such Taxes.   (c) The Owner and the Seller or the Buyer, as the case may
be, shall provide reimbursement for any Tax paid by one party all or a
portion of which is the responsibility of the other party in accordance with
the terms of this Section 9.1. Not later than thirty (30) days prior to the
payment of any such Tax, the party paying such Tax shall give notice to the
other party of   -49-  the Tax payable and the portion which is the
liability of each party, although failure to do so will not relieve the other
party from its liability hereunder.   (d) After the Closing Date, the Buyer,
the Owner and the Seller shall reasonably (i) cooperate in preparing for any
audits of, or disputes with Governmental Authorities regarding, any Tax
Returns of the Business or the Business Assets required to be filed by any of
the Parties, and (ii) make available to the other and to any Governmental
Authority as reasonably requested all information, records, and documents in
their possession or control relating to Taxes of the Business or the Business
Assets.   9.2 UCC Matters. From and after the Closing Date, the Owner and
the Seller shall promptly refer all inquiries with respect to ownership or
operation of the Business Assets or the Business to the Buyer. In addition,
the Owner and the Seller shall execute such documents and financing
statements as the Buyer may request from time to time to evidence transfer of
the Seller\'s right, title and interest in the Business Assets to the Buyer,
including, without limitation, any necessary assignment of financing
statements.   9.3 Discharge of Business Obligations. Except with respect to
the Assumed Liabilities, from and after the Closing, each of the Owner and
the Seller shall pay and discharge, in accordance with past practice,
all obligations and liabilities incurred prior to the Closing in respect of
the Business, its operations or the assets and properties used therein,
including any liabilities or obligations to Employees, any Governmental
Authority and clients and customers of the Business.   9.4 Change of the
Seller\'s Name. As of the Closing Date, the Seller shall, and the Owner shall
cause the Seller to, change its limited liability company name and its
fictitious name to such name not containing the word "PanVera," or any name
similar to or derivative of such name, as the Buyer shall reasonably approve.
The Seller and the Owner, at the request of the Buyer, will take such action
as may be necessary or appropriate to permit the Buyer to qualify as a
foreign corporation to do business in the Seller\'s name or conduct business
using the Seller\'s name in the State of Wisconsin and other states
and jurisdictions.   9.5 Public Announcement. Prior to Closing, no Party
hereto shall make or issue, or cause to be made or issued, any public
announcement or written statement concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (except to the respective representatives,
directors, managers and officers of the Buyer, the Owner, the Seller and
their Affiliates) without the prior written consent of the other Parties
(which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that
any Party may make any such announcement or statement it believes in good
faith is required by applicable law or any listing or trading agreement
concerning its publicly-traded securities without such consent, so long as
the disclosing Party provides the other Parties with a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on such disclosure in advance of its being made, if
doing so will not cause the disclosing Party to fail to meet the legal or
other requirements mandating such disclosure.   -50-   9.6 Post Closing
Obligation to Employees.   (a) Schedule 9.6(a) contains a true and correct
list of the name, job title, current base salary or hourly wage, date of
hire, current vacation entitlement and assigned location of all Employees
actively employed (as of the date of this Agreement), including any such
individual on short-term disability or approved leave of absence who was so
employed immediately before such disability or absence. At the Closing, the
Owner and the Seller shall provide to the Buyer an updated Schedule 9.6(a)
which shall disclose all the information required under the preceding
sentence as of the day prior to Closing. All individuals included on the
original Schedule 00, plus all individuals included on the updated Schedule
9.6(a) whose hiring was approved by Buyer, are herein referred to as the
"Seller Employees." With respect to any Seller Employee who is not actively
employed due to short-term disability or approved leave of absence, the
updated Schedule 9.6(a) shall indicate the reason for such absence and the
date such individual is reasonably expected to return to active employment.
If a Seller Employee who is not actively employed at the time of Closing due
to short-term disability or approved leave of absence is, in the reasonable
opinion of the Buyer, unfit to return to active employment with the Buyer
within 30 days of the expected return date indicated on the updated Schedule
9.6(a) or otherwise does not commence active employment with the Buyer within
such 30 day period, such individual shall be considered a "Former
Seller Employee" for all purposes under this Agreement.   (b) Effective as
of 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date, the Owner and the Seller shall cause the
employment of all Seller Employees (other than those individuals who are not
actively employed due to short-term disability or approved leave of absence,
whose employment shall be terminated upon their return to active employment)
to be terminated. Effective as of 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date, the Buyer
shall offer employment to all Seller Employees terminated in accordance with
the preceding sentence (except that with respect to those individuals on
short-term disability or an approved leave of absence, subject to their
commencement of active employment with the Buyer within thirty (30) days of
their expected return date as indicated on updated Schedule 9.6(a), the Buyer
shall offer employment to such individuals upon their return from short-term
disability or approved leave of absence) on terms and conditions determined
by the Buyer in its sole discretion. All Seller Employees to whom the Buyer
offers employment and who accept such employment are herein referred to
as the "Transferred Employees." Nothing in this Section 9.6 shall limit the
Buyer\'s authority to terminate the employment of any Transferred Employee at
any time and for whatever reason. Beginning on the first Business Day
following the execution of this Agreement, the Seller shall provide or make
available to the Buyer, to the extent permitted by applicable law, such
information regarding the Transferred Employees as is contained in the
Seller\'s personnel records, including without limitation information
regarding accrued or incurred but unpaid liabilities for wages, vacations,
deferred compensation, medical/dental/vision, workers\' compensation,
disability and other welfare benefit claims.   (c) The Owner and the Seller
shall be responsible for the payment of any Seller Employee benefits that
become due to any Transferred Employees as a result of their termination by
the Seller in accordance with Section 9.6(b).   -51-   (d) The Owner and
the Seller shall be responsible for all legally mandated health care
continuation coverage for Seller Employees and Former Seller Employees and
their covered dependents who had or have a loss of coverage due to a
"qualifying event" (within the meaning of Section 603 of ERISA)
which occurred or occurs on or prior to the Closing Date including without
limitation, any loss of coverage that results directly or indirectly from the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement.   (e) The Seller and the Owner
shall retain liability for payment of any long-term or short-term disability
benefits to any Seller Employee or Former Seller Employee that relate to a
disability which was first disclosed prior to the Closing Date.   (f) The
Seller, the Owner and the Buyer hereby acknowledge and agree that in
conformity with the Standard Procedure of IRS Revenue Procedure 96-60, 1996-2
C.B. 399, (i) the Owner and the Seller will be responsible for and perform
all Tax withholding, payment and reporting duties with respect to any wages
and other compensation paid by the Owner or the Seller to any Seller Employee
in connection with employment on or prior to the Closing Date; and (ii) the
Buyer will be responsible for and perform all Tax withholding, payment,
and reporting duties with respect to any wages and other compensation paid by
the Buyer to any Transferred Employee in connection with employment after
the Closing Date.   (g) The Seller and the Buyer hereby acknowledge and
agree that (i) in accordance with Section 2101(b)(i) of the WARN Act, the
Seller will be responsible for all required notices prior to the Closing
Date, and the Buyer will be responsible for all required notices on or after
the Closing Date, and (ii) all of the Seller Employees as of the Closing Date
(other than those individuals who are not actively employed on the Closing
Date due to short-term disability or approved leave of absence) will be
deemed to have become employees of the Buyer immediately on the Closing Date
for purposes of the WARN Act.   9.7 Non-Solicitation of Employees. Other

Letter shall cover all such matters as the Buyer and the Seller shall
reasonably determine. If, notwithstanding such Letter, any of the Account
Parties remit payments on or after the Closing directly or indirectly to the

endorse, assign, deliver, deposit, demand, collect, sue on, compound, and
give acquittance for any and all information, documents, payments forms

Seller that relate to the accounts, notes and receivables (including
insurance proceeds) of the Account Parties constituting Acquired Assets.

not permit any of its Affiliates to, use any trade name or trade
mark containing the Aurora name, whether in   -53-  connection with the

provided, that for a period of twenty-four (24) months following the Closing
the Buyer shall be permitted to state in its marketing materials with respect
to products produced through the use of the Business Assets that certain of
such Business Assets were formerly owned or operated by Aurora.   10.3
Access to Business Records. The Buyer agrees that the Seller, the Owner and
their representatives (provided such representatives are subject to a duty of
confidentiality with the Seller or the Owner with respect to such matters)
shall have reasonable access during normal business hours to all of
the financial books and records with respect to the Business and the Business
Assets delivered to the Buyer at or following the Closing, and to make copies
thereof (which copies shall not be disclosed by the Seller or the Owner to
any third party other than (a) in confidence to their attorneys, accountants,
tax preparers, financial advisors, and lenders, (b) as necessary to fulfill
standard or legally required corporate or regulatory reporting or
disclosure requirements, or (c) as may be necessary to enforce the terms of,
or otherwise comply with, this Agreement, or as may be otherwise required by

required corporate or regulatory reporting or disclosure requirements arising
from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to make copies
thereof (which copies shall not be disclosed by the Buyer to any third party
other than (a) in confidence to their attorneys, accountants, tax preparers,
financial advisors, and lenders, (b) as necessary to fulfill standard or
