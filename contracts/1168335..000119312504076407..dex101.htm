(a) In consideration of the sale and transfer of the Shares, Purchaser shall,
or shall cause any one of its Affiliates to, purchase the Shares and assume
and thereafter pay, perform, satisfy and discharge when due the Assumed
Liabilities attributable to the Conveyed Subsidiaries for an aggregate
purchase price of $396,756,000, allocated among the Shares as described on
Schedule 3.02 (the " _Share Purchase Price_ "). In consideration of the sale
and transfer of the Purchased Assets, Purchaser shall, or shall cause any one
of its Affiliates to, purchase the Purchased Assets and assume and thereafter
pay, perform, satisfy and discharge when due the Assumed Liabilities
attributable to such Purchased Assets for an aggregate purchase price of
$53,244,000, allocated among the Asset Selling Corporations as described on
Schedule 3.02 (the " _Asset Purchase Price_ " and, together with the Share
Purchase Price, the " _Aggregate Purchase Price_ "), which shall be exclusive
of any value added, stamp, transfer or registration Taxes. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any provision of
Federal, state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made. Prior to deducting and withholding of any amounts
pursuant to the preceding sentence, Purchaser shall inform Pfizer of any
such requirement and engage in discussions with Pfizer relating thereto.



(b) The Aggregate Purchase Price ($450,000,000) shall be paid on the Closing
Date in immediately available funds, by wire transfer in accordance with
written instructions given by Pfizer to Purchaser not less than 2 Business
Days prior to the Closing. The Aggregate Purchase Price shall be allocated as
described in Section 3.02.



3.02. _Allocation of the Aggregate Purchase Price_.



(a) Pfizer, on behalf of itself and the Seller Corporations, and Purchaser (i)
have agreed to the allocation of the Aggregate Purchase Price among the
Conveyed Subsidiaries and the Asset Selling Corporations as set forth on
Schedule 3.02 (the " _Section 3.02(i) Allocation_ ") and (ii) shall agree as
set forth below on the allocation among the Purchased Assets sold by each
Asset Selling Corporation of the Asset Purchase Price allocable to such Asset
Selling Corporation as set forth on Schedule 3.02 (the " _Section 3.02(ii)
Allocation_ " and, together with the Section 3.02(i) Allocation, the "
_Allocation_ ").



(b) Each of Pfizer on the one hand and Purchaser on the other hand shall
(i) be bound by the Allocation for purposes of determining any Taxes; (ii)
prepare and file, and cause its Affiliates to prepare and file, its Tax
Returns on a basis consistent with the Allocation; and (iii) take no position,
and cause its Affiliates to take no position, inconsistent with the
Allocation on any applicable Tax Return or in any proceeding before any taxing
authority or otherwise. In the event that the Allocation is disputed by any
taxing authority, the party receiving notice of the 



 

17 dispute shall promptly notify the other party hereto, and both Pfizer and
Purchaser agree to use their best efforts to defend such Allocation in any
audit or similar proceeding, and the matter shall be handled as a Tax Claim
described in Section 8.04(i)(B).



(c) Pfizer, on behalf of itself and the Seller Corporations and Purchaser
acknowledge that the Section 3.02(i) Allocation was done at arms
length based upon a good faith estimate of fair market values. Pfizer and
Purchaser agree that Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and
provide to Pfizer a draft of the Section 3.02(ii) Allocation (the " _Sub-
Allocation Draft_ "). Pfizer shall be provided with a copy of the Sub-
Allocation Draft on or prior to the 90th day after Closing and, provided that
Pfizer consents to the Sub-Allocation Draft (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), the Section 3.02(ii) Allocation shall be made as
specified in the Sub-Allocation Draft.



(d) If Pfizer does not consent to the Sub-Allocation Draft, Pfizer and
Purchaser shall use their best efforts to mutually agree on any amendments to
be made to the Sub-Allocation Draft and the Section 3.02(ii) Allocation shall
be made as specified in the Sub-Allocation Draft as amended. If an
independent appraisal firm has not performed an appraisal to support the Sub-
Allocation Draft, Pfizer may request such an appraisal to be conducted by an
independent appraisal firm selected by Purchaser of such Sub-Allocation
Draft, the cost of which shall be borne equally by Purchaser and Pfizer, if
Pfizer reasonably believes that there is no reasonable basis for the Sub-
Allocation Draft. Post-Closing adjustments, if any, to the Aggregate Purchase
Price shall be allocated to the Conveyed Company or to the Asset Selling
Corporation to which the adjustment relates, and shall be further allocated
(if relevant for purposes of any applicable Law) to the assets to which
the adjustment relates. The Aggregate Purchase Price allocation to such
Conveyed Company or Asset Selling Corporation shall be correspondingly
increased or decreased.



(e) If, after all other adjustments to the Allocation are made, the Allocation
with respect to any Asset Selling Corporation, when expressed in the relevant
local currency at the applicable rate of exchange on the Closing Date, is less
than the local currency net book value as reflected on the balance sheet of
such Asset Selling Corporation on the Closing Date, determined in accordance
with GAAP, of the Purchased Assets of such Asset Selling Corporation as of the
Closing Date, then the Allocation with respect to such Asset Selling
Corporation shall be adjusted so that it is equal to such local currency net
book value converted at the rate of exchange on the Closing Date and a
corresponding adjustment will be made to the Allocation pro rata with respect
to Healon AB and Pharmacia Groningen B.V. based on their relative Aggregate
Purchase Price allocation. The "rate of exchange" for purposes of this
Section 3.02(e) shall be the spot rate on the Closing Date as published by the
Financial Times.

other party such necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other
party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and will
provide the other party with copies of all filings made by such party with any
Governmental Authority and, upon request, any other information supplied by
such party to a Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.



(c) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings set forth in this
Section 8.03:



(i) Purchaser and Pfizer shall provide or cause to be provided promptly to
Governmental Authorities with regulatory jurisdiction over enforcement of any
applicable Competition Laws (" _Governmental Antitrust Entity_ ") information
and documents requested by any Governmental Antitrust Entity or necessary,
proper or advisable to permit consummation of the acquisition of the Shares
and the Purchased Assets and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;



 

38 (ii) Purchaser and Pfizer shall file any notification and report form and
related material required under the HSR Act as soon as practicable after the
date hereof, and thereafter use its reasonable best efforts to certify as soon
as practicable its substantial compliance with any requests for additional
information or documentary material that may be made under the HSR Act;



(iii) Purchaser shall proffer to (A) sell or otherwise dispose of, or hold

foregoing clauses (A), (B) or (C) if such action (1) is necessary to obtain
approval for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by any Governmental Antitrust Entity and (2) would not have a
Material Adverse Effect, provided that for purposes of this Section
8.03(c)(iii), the definition of Material Adverse Effect (y) shall include any
material adverse effect to the business results, operations or financial
condition of Purchaser and the Business, taken as a whole, subject to the
exclusions in clauses (i), (ii)(A), (iii) and (iv) of such definition and (z)
shall be read without reference to clauses (ii)(B) and (v) of such definition;
and



(iv) Subject to Section 8.03(c)(iii), each of Purchaser and Pfizer, in the
event that any permanent or preliminary injunction or other order is entered
or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that would
make consummation of the acquisition of the Shares or the Purchased Assets
or the other transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement unlawful or that would prevent or delay consummation of the
acquisition of the Shares or the Purchased Assets or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, shall use its reasonable best efforts
necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or order so as to
permit such consummation on a schedule as close as possible to that
contemplated by this Agreement unless, by mutual agreement, Purchaser and
Pfizer decide that litigation is not in their respective best interests.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this Section 8.03 shall limit the right of a party to this
Agreement to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(b), so long
as such party to this Agreement has up to then complied in all material
respects with its obligations under this Section 8.03. Each of Purchaser and

not prohibited by applicable Law, each of Pfizer and Purchaser shall provide
to the other party copies of all correspondence between it (or its advisor)
and any Governmental Antitrust Entity relating to the acquisition of the
Shares or the Purchased Assets or any of the matters described in this



 

39 Section 8.03. Neither Pfizer nor Purchaser shall independently participate in
a telephone call or meeting with a Governmental Antitrust Entity regarding
the acquisition of the Shares or the Purchased Assets or any of the matters
described in this Section 8.03 without using its reasonable best efforts to
give the other prior notification of the call or meeting and, unless
prohibited by such Governmental Antitrust Entity, the opportunity to attend
and participate.



(d) The parties expressly agree: (i) that any breach by Purchaser of its
obligations under Section 8.03(c) will cause irreparable harm to the
Seller Corporations and the Conveyed Companies; (ii) that Pfizer has agreed
to this transaction with Purchaser in specific reliance on Purchasers
obligations under Section 8.03(c), and would not have otherwise agreed to
enter into this Agreement with Purchaser in relation to the transactions
contemplated hereby; and (iii) therefore, Pfizer is entitled to specific
performance of Purchasers obligations under Section 8.03(c), and Purchaser
hereby agrees in advance to the granting of such specific performance of such
obligations without proof of actual damages or harm.



(e) In the event that any approval or action of a Governmental Authority
(other than a Governmental Authority of the United States of America (or any
state or subdivision thereof), of the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Sweden
or the Netherlands) that is necessary to lawfully consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby is not obtained on or prior to the Closing Date, or there
exists any Law that makes illegal or enjoins or prevents in any respect
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement except
with respect of those jurisdictions specified above, then Pfizer and Purchaser
shall effect the Closing (including payment of the entire Aggregate Purchase
Price), subject to the terms of this Agreement (including, but not limited
to, Section 5.01), with respect to all Shares, Purchased Assets and Assumed
Liabilities outside of the jurisdiction of any such Governmental Authority or
such Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligations of the parties hereto
set forth in this Section 8.03 shall continue with respect to any such
compliance with Law, approval or action until such compliance with Law,
approval or action is obtained or taken, as the case may be, and upon the
occurrence of such compliance with Law, approval or action, the parties hereto
shall effect the transfer of the affected Shares, Purchased Assets and Assumed
Liabilities in accordance with the Foreign Implementing Agreement for
the jurisdictions relating thereto. Each such transfer, upon occurrence,
shall be retroactive to and be deemed to have occurred on the Closing Date.
Furthermore, as of the Closing Date, Pfizer and the Purchaser shall, subject
to applicable Law, enter into mutually agreeable alternative business
arrangements consistent with the terms of this Agreement or other arrangements
which provide Purchaser with the net economic benefit or loss of the affected
Shares, Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities from and after the Closing
Date and continuing until any such approval or action is obtained or taken
(any such agreement evidencing such arrangement is referred to as a " _Net
Economic Benefits Letter_ ").



8.04. _Tax Matters_.



(a) (i) _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns_. Pfizer shall prepare and
timely file or shall cause to be prepared and timely filed all federal, state,
local and foreign Tax Returns in respect of the Conveyed Companies and the
Asset Selling Corporations, their assets and activities that (A) are required
to be filed (taking into account extensions) on or before the Closing Date;
or (B) are required to be filed (taking into account extensions) after the
Closing



 

40 Date and (1) are Consolidated Tax Returns of Pfizer and its Affiliates; (2)
are with respect to Income Taxes and are required to be filed on a separate
Tax Return basis for any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date; or
(3) are to be filed by an Asset Selling Corporation. Purchaser shall prepare
or cause to be prepared and shall file or cause to be filed all other Tax
Returns required of the Conveyed Companies, or in respect of their assets or
activities or required to be filed after the Closing Date with respect to the
Purchased Assets or the Business. Any such Tax Returns that include
periods ending on or before the Closing Date or that include the activities
of the Conveyed Companies or an Asset Selling Corporation (with respect to the
Business) prior to the Closing Date shall, insofar as they relate to the
Conveyed Companies or an Asset Selling Corporation (with respect to the
Business) prior to the Closing Date, be prepared on a basis consistent with
the last previous such Tax Returns filed in respect of the Conveyed Companies
or such Asset Selling Corporation (with respect to the Business), unless
Pfizer or Purchaser, as the case may be, concludes that there is no reasonable
basis for such position. With respect to any Tax Return required to be filed
by Purchaser for a taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), Purchaser shall deliver to Pfizer, at
least 15 Business Days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Return
(taking into account extensions), a statement setting forth the amount of Tax
for which Pfizer is responsible pursuant to Sections 8.04(g)(i) and (iii) and
a copy of such Tax Return. Pfizer shall have the right to review such Tax
Return and statement prior to the filing of such Tax Return. Pfizer and
Purchaser agree to consult and resolve in good faith any issue arising as a
result of Pfizers review of such Tax Return and statement and mutually to
consent to the filing of such Tax Return as promptly as possible. Neither
Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall file any amended Tax Returns for
any periods for or in respect of the Conveyed Companies with respect to which
Purchaser is not obligated to prepare or cause to be prepared the original
such Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 8.04(a)(i) without the prior
written consent of Pfizer. Neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates may
make an election under Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to its purchase
or deemed purchase of any of the Conveyed Companies. If Pfizer
determines that any of the Conveyed Companies is entitled to file or make a
formal or informal claim for refund or file an amended Tax Return providing
for a refund with respect to a period for which it is obligated to prepare or
cause to be prepared the original such Tax Return pursuant to this Section
8.04(a)(i), Pfizer shall be entitled, at its own expense, to file or make such
claim or file an amended Tax Return on behalf of such Conveyed Company and
will be entitled to control the prosecution of such refund claims provided
that any such claims are prosecuted in good faith.



(ii) _Internal Restructurings_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Pfizer shall cause, and shall have the right to cause an election
pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-3 to be filed, effective
from a date prior to the Closing Date, for those of the Conveyed Companies
that are not United States entities to be treated as a branch or a
partnership for U.S. federal Income Tax purposes, and copies of all such
elections have been provided to Purchaser.



(b) _Payment of Taxes_. Pfizer shall pay or cause to be paid (i) all Taxes due
with respect to Tax Returns which Pfizer is obligated to prepare and file or
cause to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 8.04(a); (ii) all Taxes due
with respect to Tax Returns for Straddle Periods for which Pfizer is
responsible pursuant to Section 8.04(g)(i) and (iii) all Non-Income Taxes with
respect to Tax Returns for Non-Income Taxes to be filed by Purchaser on a
separate



 

41 Tax Return basis for any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date for
which Pfizer is responsible pursuant to Section 8.04(g)(i). Purchaser shall
pay or cause to be paid (A) all Taxes due with respect to Tax Returns which
Purchaser is obligated to prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed
pursuant to Section 8.04(a) other than Taxes which Pfizer shall pay or cause
to be paid in accordance with the preceding sentence; and (B) all Taxes owed
by the Conveyed Companies other than Taxes which Pfizer shall pay or cause to
be paid in accordance with the preceding sentence.



(c) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. On the Closing Date, all Tax sharing agreements
and arrangements between (i) the Conveyed Companies, on the one hand, and (ii)
Pfizer or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or any other party (other than
the Conveyed Companies), on the other hand, shall be terminated effective as
of the close of business on the date that immediately precedes the Closing
Date and have no further effect for any taxable year or period (whether a
past, present or future year or period), and no additional payments shall be
made thereunder on or after the Closing Date with respect to any period. At
the Closing, Pfizer or one of its Affiliates (other than Pharmacia Groningen
B.V.) will pay to Pharmacia Groningen B.V. an amount equal to the corporate
tax provision for Pharmacia Groningen B.V.s taxable year beginning December
1, 2003, as included on its balance sheet as of the Closing Date.



(d) _Carryforwards and Carrybacks_. Purchaser shall cause the Conveyed
Companies to elect, when permitted by law, to carry forward any net
operating loss, charitable contribution credit or other item arising after
the Closing Date that could, in the absence of such an election, be carried
back to a taxable period of the Conveyed Companies ending on or before the
Closing Date in which the Conveyed Companies were included in a Consolidated
Tax Return of Pfizer and its Affiliates. Except as provided below, Purchaser,
on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates, hereby waives any right to
use or apply any net operating loss, charitable contribution credit or other
item (including any net capital loss, foreign tax credit or research and
development credit) of the Conveyed Companies for any tax year ending on any
date following the Closing Date to any period of the Conveyed Companies
ending on or before the Closing Date. If any net capital loss, foreign tax
credit, research and development credit or other item shall be carried back to
any such period, Purchaser shall indemnify Pfizer and its Affiliates
(other than the Conveyed Companies) for all reasonable costs and expenses
incurred by Pfizer or any of such Affiliates in filing such claims or in
connection with any audit of such claims. Purchaser, on its own behalf and on
behalf of its Affiliates (including the Conveyed Companies), hereby agrees
not to use or apply any net operating loss or net capital loss of Healon AB
arising or incurred in any Tax period or portion thereof ending on or before
the Closing Date, without Pfizers consent.



(e) _Refunds_. Pfizer shall be entitled to retain, or receive immediate
payment from Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (including the
Conveyed Companies) of, any refund or credit with respect to Taxes (including
refunds and credits arising by reason of amended Tax Returns filed after the
Closing Date or otherwise) with respect to any Tax period or portion thereof
ending on or before the Closing Date relating to the Conveyed Companies or any
Asset Selling Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Purchaser and
the Conveyed Companies shall be entitled to retain, or receive immediate
payment from Pfizer of, any such refund or credit to the extent that such
refund or credit arises as a result of the use or application (as provided in
Section 8.04(d)) of any net capital loss, foreign tax credit, research and
development credit or



 

42 other item of the Conveyed Companies for any period following the Closing Date
to any period of the Conveyed Companies ending on or before the Closing Date;
and (ii) to the extent that Pfizer or any of its Affiliates (other than the
Conveyed Companies) would, but for the carryback by the Conveyed Companies of
any such net capital loss, foreign tax credit, research and development
credit or other item, be entitled to a refund or credit in respect of any net
capital loss, foreign tax credit, research and development credit or other
item of Pfizer or any of Pfizers Affiliates (other than the
Conveyed Companies), Pfizer shall be entitled to receive immediate payment
from Purchaser of any such amount to the extent Purchaser has previously
received a refund or credit from a carryback to Pfizers return, provided that
to the extent that Pfizer or any of Pfizers Affiliates is entitled to a
refund or credit in respect of any such net capital loss, foreign tax credit
or research and development credit of Pfizer or any of Pfizers Affiliates in
another tax period as a result of such carryback by the Conveyed Companies,
Purchaser and the Conveyed Companies shall be entitled to receive immediate
payment from Pfizer of any such refund or credit. Purchaser and the Conveyed
Companies shall be entitled to retain, or receive immediate payment from
Pfizer of, any refund or credit with respect to Taxes with respect to any
taxable period beginning after the Closing Date relating to any of the
Conveyed Companies. Purchaser and Pfizer shall equitably apportion any refund
or credit with respect to Taxes with respect to a Straddle Period in a manner
consistent with the principles set forth in Section 8.04(g)(iii).



(f) _Tax Cooperation_. Each of Purchaser and Pfizer shall provide each other
with such information and records and make such of its officers, directors,
employees and agents available as may reasonably be requested by such other
party in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return or any audit or
other proceeding that relates to the Conveyed Companies or the Asset
Selling Corporations. Pfizer shall, within 60 days after the Closing Date,
provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser a tax balance sheet reflecting
the value of each asset transferred to or owned by Healon AB which asset
values shall equal the values used by Pfizer, Healon AB or their respective
Affiliates in preparing and filing their Swedish Tax Returns.



(g) _Tax Indemnification_.



(i) Pfizer shall indemnify, defend and hold Purchaser and its Affiliates
(including the Conveyed Companies) harmless from and against all Losses
arising from (A) all Liability for Taxes of the Conveyed Companies or with
respect to the Purchased Assets for any Pre-Closing Period, (B) all Liability
from any breach of Pfizers representations and warranties contained in
Section 6.16 to the extent such Liability relates to (1) Taxes of the
Conveyed Companies or the Purchased Assets for any Pre-Closing Period and (2)
in the case of Pharmacia Groningen B.V., corporate income tax and value-added
tax for the Pre-Closing Period of the fiscal unity to which it belonged
during such period; (C) all Liability (as a result of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-6(a) and any analogous provisions of foreign laws including the
Dutch Tax Collection Act (" _Invorderingswet 1990_ ") or otherwise) for
Income Taxes and, with respect to the Netherlands, for all Taxes, of Pfizer or
any other Person (other than the Conveyed Companies) which is or has ever been
affiliated with the Conveyed Companies, or with whom the Conveyed Companies
otherwise join or have ever joined (or are or have ever been required to join)
in filing any consolidated, combined or unitary domestic or foreign Tax
Return, prior to the Closing; (D) any and all Taxes relating to any bulk
sale or bulk transfer laws or similar laws with respect to the Asset Selling

43 Period; (E) any other claim for Taxes for a Pre-Closing Period for which
Pharmacia Groningen B.V. is held secondarily liable for Taxes and for which
another Person is primarily liable; and (F) all Liability for any breach of
Pfizers covenants in Sections 8.02(k) and 8.04 relating to Taxes; _provided_
, _however_ , that (i) to the extent such Losses are with respect to legal,
accounting and appraisal fees and expenses, such amounts must be reasonable,
(ii) Pfizers indemnity obligation for Taxes pursuant to this Section
8.04(g)(i) shall be reduced by refunds of Taxes (excluding carrybacks from
post-Closing Date years to the extent permitted hereunder) with respect to
such periods that end on or before the Closing Date that are received after
the Closing Date by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates and not previously
remitted to Pfizer and (iii) in the event that the Healon Business Drop Down
has not been completed on or before the Closing, any Liability for Taxes
related to the Healon Business Drop Down shall be regarded as being for a Pre-
Closing Period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 8.04(g),
Pfizer shall not indemnify, defend or hold harmless Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates from any Losses arising from any liability for Taxes that are (a)
attributable to any Purchaser Tax Act; or (b) to the extent of any net
operating or capital loss carryforwards of the Conveyed Companies directly
reduce such liability for such Taxes or (c) incurred by virtue of a change in
the use of any property of a Conveyed Company resulting in an obligation to
adjust value-added Taxes if such change is made after the Closing Date.
Furthermore, Pfizers obligation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Purchaser and its Affiliates from Losses as set forth in Section 8.04(g)
shall terminate effective 60 days after the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations (including extensions) in respect of such Losses;
_provided_ , _further_ , with respect to a Tax Claim for which a claim for
indemnification under Section 8.04(g) has been made by Purchaser or its
Affiliates (including the Conveyed Companies), with reasonable specificity, by
written notice given under Section 8.04(i)(A), Pfizers indemnification
obligation shall continue until the date of a final determination of such Tax
Claim.



(ii) Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Conveyed Companies to, indemnify,
defend and hold Pfizer and its Affiliates harmless from and against all Losses
arising from: (A) any Liability for Taxes of the Conveyed Companies except to
the extent Pfizer is otherwise required to indemnify Purchaser for such Tax
pursuant to Section 8.04(g)(i); (B) any Liability for Taxes that is
attributable to a Purchaser Tax Act; and (C) any Liability for any breach of
Purchasers covenants in this Section 8.04 relating to Taxes; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) Purchasers indemnity obligation for Taxes pursuant to
clauses (B) and (C) shall include any additional Taxes arising as a result of
a reduction in the amount of foreign tax credits that are available to Pfizer
(computed as if Pfizer could have fully utilized all available foreign tax
credits), (ii) the Purchaser indemnity obligation with respect to clause (B)
shall cease to apply with respect to Purchaser Tax Acts (1) relating to
Healon AB occurring after the 3rd anniversary of the Closing Date and (2)
relating to Pharmacia Groningen B.V. occurring after the 5th anniversary of
the Closing Date and (iii) to the extent such Losses are with respect
to legal, accounting and appraisal fees and expenses, such amounts must be
reasonable. Purchasers obligation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Pfizer and its Affiliates from any such Loss shall terminate effective 60 days
after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including
extensions) in respect of such Losses; _provided_ , _further_ , with respect
to a Tax Claim for which a claim for indemnification under Section 8.04(g) has
been made by 



 

44 Pfizer or its Affiliates, with reasonable specificity, by written notice given
under Section 8.04(i)(A), Purchasers indemnification obligation shall
continue until the date of a final determination of such Tax Claim.



(iii) In the case of any Straddle Period:



(A) The periodic Taxes of the Conveyed Companies or with respect to the
Purchased Assets that are not based on income or receipts ( _e.g._ , property
Taxes) for the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (the
" _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ ") shall be computed based upon the ratio of the
number of days in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the number of days in the
entire Tax period; and



(B) Taxes of the Conveyed Companies or with respect to the Purchased Assets
for the Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than Taxes described in Section
8.04(g)(iii)(A) above) shall be computed as if such taxable period ended as of
the close of business on the Closing Date and, in the case of any Taxes of
the Conveyed Companies attributable to the ownership by the Conveyed Companies
of any equity interest in any partnership or other "flowthrough" entity, as if
a taxable period of such partnership or other "flowthrough" entity ended as
of the close of business on the Closing Date.



(iv) Any indemnity payment required to be made pursuant to this Section
8.04(g) shall be made within 30 days after the indemnified party makes
written demand upon the indemnifying party, but in no case earlier than 5
Business Days prior to the date on which the relevant Taxes are required to be
paid to the relevant taxing authority (including estimated Tax payments);
_provided_  that any indemnity payment for Taxes that are with respect to
non-Income Taxes and are required to be filed by Purchaser on a separate Tax
Return basis for any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date shall be
made within 10 days after the Purchaser or its Affiliates makes written
demand upon Pfizer, but in no case earlier than 5 Business Days prior to the
date on which such Taxes are required to be paid to the relevant taxing
authorities.



(v) Any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Section 8.04 shall be treated
as an adjustment to the price paid by Purchaser for the relevant Conveyed
Company or the Purchased Assets, as the case may be, for Tax purposes, unless
a final determination with respect to the indemnified party or any of
its Affiliates causes such payment to be treated other than as an adjustment
to the purchase price for Tax purposes.



(h) _Timing Adjustment_. In the event that a final determination (which shall
include the execution of an IRS Form 870-AD or successor form) results in a
timing difference ( _e.g._ , an acceleration of income or delay of deductions)
that would increase Pfizers liability for Taxes pursuant to this Section 8.04
or results in a timing difference ( _e.g._ , an acceleration of deductions or
delay of income) that would increase Purchasers or its Affiliates liability
for Taxes pursuant to this Section 8.04, Purchaser or Pfizer, as the case may
be, shall promptly make payments to Pfizer or Purchaser as and when Purchaser
or Pfizer, as the case may be, actually realizes any Tax benefits as a result
of such timing difference (or under such other method for



 

45 determining the present value of any such anticipated Tax benefits as agreed
to by the parties). Such Tax benefit for federal, state and local and
non-U.S. Income Tax purposes shall be computed for any year using Purchasers
or Pfizers, as the case may be, actual Tax liability with and without giving
effect to such timing difference.



(i) _Tax Contests_.



(A) If a claim shall be made by any taxing authority (a " _Tax Claim_ ")
which, if successful, might result in an indemnity payment to Purchaser or
Pfizer or any of their Affiliates pursuant to Section 8.04, the indemnified
party shall promptly notify the other party of such claim no later than 15
Business Days after such Tax Claim is made, or otherwise the indemnifying
party will be released from any indemnification obligation hereunder with
respect to such Tax Claim to the extent of the actual prejudice caused.



(B) With respect to any Tax Claim relating to a taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date or relating to or affecting a Consolidated Tax Return,
Pfizer shall control all proceedings and may make all decisions taken in
connection with such Tax Claim (including selection of counsel) and,
without limiting the foregoing, may in its sole discretion in good faith
pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and
conferences with any taxing authority with respect thereto, and may, in its
sole discretion, either pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund where
applicable Law permits such refund suits or contest the Tax Claim in any
permissible manner. Purchaser shall be entitled to be informed of (i) such Tax
Claim within a reasonable time after such Tax Claim is asserted and (ii) the
developments with respect to such Tax Claim at any administrative meeting,
conference, hearing or other proceeding.



(C) Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.04(i)(B), Pfizer and Purchaser
shall jointly control and participate in all proceedings taken in connection
with any Tax Claim relating to Taxes of the Conveyed Companies or relating to
the Purchased Assets for any Straddle Period. Neither Pfizer nor Purchaser
shall settle any such Tax Claim without the prior written consent of
the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.



(D) Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.04(i)(B), Purchaser shall
control all proceedings with respect to Taxes for any taxable period beginning
after the Closing Date.



(E) Purchaser, the Conveyed Companies and each of their respective
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Pfizer and its Affiliates, on the other hand,
shall cooperate in contesting any Tax Claim, which cooperation shall include
the retention and (upon request) the provision to the requesting party of
records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Tax Claim,
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information or explanation of any material provided hereunder or to
testify at



 

46 proceedings relating to such Tax Claim. Purchaser shall execute and deliver
such powers of attorney and other documents as are necessary to carry out the
intent of this Section.



8.05. _Employees and Employee Benefits_.



(a) _Employees (US) - Offer of Continued Employment; Severance_.



(i) Subject to Section 8.05(f), Purchaser agrees to offer to continue
employment as of 12:01 a.m. on the day immediately following the Closing Date
to each Employee (US) that is still employed (or, in the case of Employees
(US) employed by the Conveyed Companies, to cause the Conveyed Companies to
offer to continue the employment of each of their Employees (US)) in the same
or a "comparable position" (as defined in Section 8.05(a)(v)) and at a rate
of "pay" (as defined below) at least equal to such Employees (US) rate of pay
in effect on the Closing Date and with benefits that are "substantially
comparable" (as defined below) to the employee benefits set forth on Schedule
6.17.



(ii) From 12:01 a.m. on the day immediately following the Closing Date through
April 15, 2005, Purchaser shall provide severance benefits identical to those
set forth in the Pharmacia Separation Benefit Plan attached as Schedule
8.05(a)(i) (the "Pharmacia Separation Benefit Plan") to each Employee (US)
that meets the eligibility criteria for benefits under the
Pharmacia Separation Benefits Plan. For the two year period commencing on the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall provide severance benefits in accordance with
such other Pfizer severance plans or policies under which such Employee (US)
would have been eligible to receive severance benefits; provided that, if an
Employee (US) receives severance benefits pursuant to the Pharmacia Separation
Benefit Plan, he or she shall not be eligible for severance benefits under any
other severance plan, program or arrangement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Purchaser or its Affiliates may terminate an Employee (US) without paying or
otherwise providing severance benefits to such employee in accordance with
such policy and practice if such employee is terminated, in the reasonable
discretion of Purchaser or its Affiliates, "for cause" under the terms of the
applicable plan.



(iii) Schedule 8.05(a)(iii) (which shall be provided by Pfizer five days prior
to the Closing Date, to the extent Pfizer has at least 10 days advance notice
of the scheduled Closing Date) shall set forth the name of each then-current
Employee (US), and his or her current rate of pay, position and date of hire.
Purchaser shall have no obligation whatsoever in relation to (A)
former employees of the Business who are retired, or who are not or shall
have ceased to be Employees (US) as of the Closing Date, or (B) employees who
do not accept the offer of employment or continuation of employment given by
Purchaser in accordance with this Section 8.05(a) and do not work for
Purchaser or its Affiliates for at least one day, unless such employee is
otherwise an Affected Employee. Purchaser shall be solely responsible for all
salaries or wages (including commissions, bonuses, incentive pay, overtime,
premium pay, shift differentials and severance pay) accruing after the Closing
Date for services rendered and work performed for Purchaser with respect to
the Affected Employees.



 

47 (iv) The following conditions of employment shall remain unchanged until the
date immediately following the second anniversary of the Closing Date: (A)
the pay and benefits comparability requirements described in Section
8.05(a)(v), and (B) the employee separation plan obligations described in
Section 8.05(a)(ii). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, on the
date immediately following the second anniversary of the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall provide pay and benefits and severance plans, programs and
policies which are no less favorable than those provided to other similarly
situated employees of Purchaser, as the case may be. Employees (US) shall also
be provided credit by Purchaser for all service with Pfizer and its
Affiliates, to the same extent as such service was credited for such purpose
by Pfizer and its Affiliates, under (A) all employee benefit plans, programs,
policies and fringe benefits of Purchaser described on Schedule 8.05(a)(v) for
purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual, and (B) severance plans,
programs and policies for purposes of calculating the amount of each such
employees severance benefits; provided, however, that no such crediting of
service shall result in a duplication of benefits.



(v) For purposes of this Section 8.05, references to "pay" shall include base
pay plus bonus, rates for overtime, premium pay and shift differentials and
comparable opportunity for commissions and cash incentive pay, but shall
exclude retention and retention/performance allowances. For purposes of this
Section 8.05, whether benefits are "substantially comparable" shall be
determined pursuant to the analysis and procedures employed by Hewitt
Associates in the report provided to the parties on or around April 15, 2004.
The term "comparable position" shall mean comparable position, except that,
with respect to Employees (US) eligible for benefits under the Pharmacia
Separation Benefit Plan, the term "comparable position" shall be determined by
reference to Section 2.06 of the Pharmacia Separation Benefit Plan, which is
attached hereto in Schedule 8.05(a)(i).



(b) _Qualified Plans_.



(i) Pfizer sponsors the following Plans covering Employees (US) which are
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (collectively, the "
_Pfizer Qualified Plans_ "): the Pharmacia Savings Plan and Pfizer Savings
Plan (these two plans, collectively, the " _Savings Plans_ ") and the
Pharmacia Pension Plan and Pfizer Retirement Annuity Plan (these two plans,
collectively, the " _Retirement Plans_ "). Effective as of the Closing Date,
the Seller Corporations shall cause each Affected Employee who is a
participant in one or more Pfizer Qualified Plans to become one hundred
percent (100%) vested in his or her accrued benefit under each such Plan.



(ii) Effective as of 12:01 a.m. on the day immediately following the Closing
Date, each participant in a Pfizer Qualified Plan who is an Affected Employee
shall cease to be an active participant under each such Plan, and shall become
a participant in the Purchaser Qualified Plans listed on
Schedule 8.05(b)(ii)(A) (such plans being collectively referred to as the "
_Purchaser Qualified Plans_ "); _provided_ , that such Affected Employee shall
not become a participant in a Purchaser Qualified Plan if such Affected
Employee is not employed by Purchaser. Purchaser shall ensure that the
Purchaser Qualified Plans will recognize the accrued service of Affected
Employees, as



 

48 set forth on Schedules 6.17(g)(i) and 6.17(g)(ii), with Pfizer and its
Affiliates up to and including the Closing Date for all purposes, to the
extent credited under the terms of the corresponding Pfizer Qualified Plan as
in effect on the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such crediting
of service shall result in a duplication of benefits. Schedules 6.17(g)(i)
and 6.17(g)(ii), which shall be delivered at the Closing, sets forth a true
and complete copy of such accrued service data. Purchaser shall assume all
liabilities with respect to Employees (US) under Purchaser Qualified Plans
for benefits accrued after the Closing Date.



(iii) If Purchaser maintains (or establishes) a Purchaser Qualified Plan that
corresponds with the Savings Plans, Pfizer shall cause, subject to Purchasers
receipt of satisfactory evidence that the applicable Pfizer Qualified Plans
are in compliance with all applicable Laws, as soon as practicable after the
Closing Date, the Savings Plans to transfer the account balance, in cash or
such other medium as agreed to by Pfizer and Purchaser, of each
Affected Employee to such corresponding Purchaser Qualified Plan as of the
valuation date next preceding the date of transfer. Purchaser, on the one
hand, and Pfizer, on the other hand, each agree to use commercially reasonable
efforts and to cooperate with each other to effect as promptly as possible
the transfers of assets contemplated by this Section 8.05(b)(iii), subject to
Pfizers receipt of satisfactory evidence that the Purchaser Qualified Plans
are in compliance with all applicable Laws. Such evidence shall include a
current determination letter from the IRS and representations satisfactory to
Pfizer from the administrators of the Purchaser Qualified Plans. If a current
determination letter has not been obtained, Purchaser and its counsel shall
provide a representation that the Purchaser Qualified Plans are qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code and that a timely application for a
determination letter is pending and that Purchaser will take all necessary
steps to secure a determination letter. Pfizer and Purchaser shall each bear
their own individual costs regarding the transfer of assets contemplated by
this Section 8.05(b)(iii).



(iv) Pfizer will give Purchaser reasonable access to records in its control
necessary to administer the retirement benefits of Affected Employees
transferred to the Purchaser Qualified Plans.



(c) _Accrued Entitlements_. Purchaser shall be responsible for all accrued but
unused vacation Liabilities for Employees who become employed with Purchaser
or its Affiliates as of the Closing Date consistent with Pfizers policies in
respect thereof, to the extent such Liabilities have been properly accounted
for on Pfizers financial statements.



(d) _Welfare Plan Obligations_. Commencing as of 12:01 a.m. on the day
immediately following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall include those
Affected Employees who become employed by Purchaser in its welfare plans and
agrees to waive any waiting periods or limitations for preexisting conditions
under its welfare benefits plans (including, without limitation, its medical,
dental, life insurance, short-term and long-term disability plans), and any
other similar plans, and shall ensure that such employees are given credit for
any amounts paid toward deductibles, out-of-pocket limits or other fees on or
prior to the Closing Date. Claims by an Affected Employee for welfare benefit
plan services rendered on or after 12:01 a.m. on the day immediately following
the Closing Date shall be the responsibility of the welfare benefit



 

49 plan provided by Purchaser to such employees. Claims incurred for welfare
benefit plan services for Affected Employees rendered prior to and including
the Closing Date shall be the responsibility of the welfare benefit plan of
Pfizer or the Seller Corporation which covered such employees prior to and
including the Closing Date. Pfizer shall arrange for the transfer of
information related to amounts paid toward deductibles, out-of-pocket limits
or other fees as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date but
in any event within 30 days after the Closing Date.



(e) _Employees (non-US) - Offer of Employment; Continued
Employment; Severance_. Except for Employees (non-US) in a country where the
ARD has been implemented under local law, subject to Section 8.05(f), and to
the extent employment with Purchaser or its Affiliates would not continue as a
matter of law, Purchaser agrees to offer, or to cause one of its Affiliates
to offer, to continue employment as of 12:01 a.m. on the day immediately
following the Closing Date to each Employee (non-US) (or, in the case of
Employees employed by the Conveyed Companies, to cause the Conveyed Companies
to offer to continue the employment of each of their Employees (non-US)) at a
rate of pay at least equal to such employees rate of pay in effect on the
Closing Date and, subject to applicable Laws of the foreign countries and
their political subdivisions, in the same or a comparable position and with
benefits which shall be substantially comparable to such employees benefits
which are in effect on the Closing Date. Schedule 8.05(e) (which shall
be provided by Pfizer on the Closing Date) shall set forth the name of each
Employee (non-US).



Other than with respect to matters the subject of Section 8.05(b)(iii) and
except where the Laws of a country in which the ARD has been implemented
require otherwise, Purchaser agrees that the pay, the
substantially comparable benefits requirement, and the severance obligations
for such Employees (non-US) shall remain unchanged until the date immediately
following the second anniversary of the Closing Date, and that following such
date, Purchaser or its Affiliates shall provide pay and benefits and
severance plans, programs and policies which are no less favorable than those
provided to other similarly situated employees of Purchaser or its Affiliates,
as the case may be. Employees (non-US) shall also be provided credit by
Purchaser or its Affiliates for all service with Pfizer and its Affiliates, to
the same extent as such service was credited for such purpose by Pfizer and
its Affiliates under (A) all employee benefit plans, programs, policies and
fringe benefits of Purchaser or its Affiliates in which such Employee (non-US)
is eligible to participate for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit
accrual, and (B) severance plans, programs and policies for purposes
of calculating the amount of each such employees severance benefits;
provided, however, that no such crediting of service shall result in a
duplication of benefits. This Section 8.05(e) shall be subject to such
modification as are necessary to comply with applicable Laws of the foreign
countries and their political subdivisions (including, without limitation,
obligations to notify, consult with and/or obtain the consent of Employees
(non-US) as may be applicable); and applicable labor agreements.



(f) _Employees (US) and Employees (non-US) Absent on Disability or Leaves of
Absence - Offer of Employment; Continued Employment; Severance_. Except for
Employees (non-US) in a country where the ARD has been implemented under local
law, when an Employee (US) or Employee (non-US) who is, on the Closing Date,
absent due to illness or on short-term disability (including maternity
disability) or workers compensation seeks to return to active employment
within the lesser of six months from the Closing Date or the end of the
leave 



 

50 of absence available under Pfizers policies, Purchaser shall or shall cause
one of its Affiliates to offer immediate employment to such employee in the
same or a "comparable position" (as defined in Section 8.05(a)(v) hereof) to
that which the employee occupied before such absence but only at such time
that such employee is medically capable of performing the essential functions
of the position occupied immediately before such absence. In addition,
immediate employment in the same or a "comparable position" (as defined in
Section 8.05(a)(v) hereof) will be offered by Purchaser or one of its
Affiliates to those Employees (US) and Employees (non-US) returning from
authorized leaves of absence such as parental, family and medical, and
military leaves or other leaves where return to work is subject to statutory
requirements. Such employees, returning from disability or leaves of absence,
will be subject to the same pay, benefits, severance and all other policies,
plans, programs and arrangements as stipulated in this Article VIII for
similarly situated Employees (US) and Employees (non-US).



(g) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing contained herein, expressed or
implied, is intended to confer upon any Employee of any Seller Corporation or
any of the Conveyed Companies any benefits under any benefit plans, programs,
policies or other arrangements, including severance benefits or right to
employment or continued employment with Purchaser or any Affiliate of
Purchaser for any period by reason of this Agreement. In addition, the
provisions of this Agreement, in particular this Article VIII, are for the
sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and are not for the benefit of
any third party.



(h) _Assumption of Plans_. Purchaser shall not assume any Plan or any other
employee benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement that is maintained,
contributed to, or required to be contributed to, by any Seller Corporation,
except that Purchaser shall assume the German pension obligations to the
extent included in Section 2.05(g). Purchaser shall not assume any Liabilities
with respect to any Plan, including but not limited to (i) any Liability
under Title IV of ERISA and (ii) any Liability to make contributions to a Plan
pursuant to Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA.



(i) _Cooperation Pre-Closing_. Pfizer and Purchaser agree to
reasonably cooperate during the period prior to the Closing in order to
effectuate the transition of employees from Pfizer and its Affiliates to
Purchaser and its Affiliates, including but not limited to, the provision of
reasonable information to allow Purchaser to implement payroll and benefits
for such incoming employees.



(j) _Continued/Reemployment with Pfizer_. Purchaser will not be required to
provide any severance pay or benefits to any Employee who remains employed
with Pfizer or its Affiliates following the Closing (unless and until such
Employee becomes employed by Purchaser under Section 8.05(f) above, in which
case such Employees entitlement to severance pay and benefits shall be
governed by the provisions of Section 8.05(a)(i) and (ii) above).
Additionally, if within the three-month period following the Closing Date,
Pfizer or its Affiliates employs or re-employs any Employee with respect to
which Purchaser paid severance or provided severance benefits, Pfizer shall
promptly indemnify Purchaser for such amounts.



(k) _Assumption of Liabilities_. Except as otherwise provided in this Section
8.05, Purchaser shall not assume: (i) any Liabilities with respect to any
person that accrued or arose on or prior to the date such person became
employed by Purchaser or its Affiliates; or (ii)



 

51 any Liabilities for benefits under any plan, program, policy or arrangement
maintained by any of the Seller Corporations. Furthermore, Purchaser shall
not assume any severance obligation with respect to Employees who are hired by
Pfizer or its Affiliates in violation of the covenants contained in Sections
8.02(j) and (m). To the extent that Purchaser or its Affiliates assume any of
the foregoing Liabilities or severance obligations automatically through
operation of Law, Pfizer shall indemnify Purchaser for such Liabilities or
severance obligations.



8.06. _Certain Dividends, Etc._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement (including Section 8.02), each Conveyed Company will be
permitted to distribute to Pfizer or any one or more of its designated
Affiliates, effective as of the Closing Date, up to the amount of its retained
earnings accrued through the Closing Date, but not in excess of cash on hand
and in no event to be effected through any additional borrowings from Pfizer,
any of its Affiliates or any third person. In addition, Pfizer and its
Affiliates shall be permitted to continue to conduct their activities
regarding cash management matters relating to the Business (including the
collection and transfer of accounts receivable and disbursement of funds by
Pfizer) in accordance with the practice in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, except as may be affected by actions taken pursuant to Section
2.04 and as may be necessary to settle intercompany payables and receivables
and to effect intercompany funding.



8.07. _Resignations_. At the Closing and except as otherwise requested by
Purchaser in writing, Pfizer will deliver to Purchaser the
resignations (effective on or prior to the Closing) of all directors of each
of the Conveyed Companies from their positions as directors.



8.08. _Bulk Transfer Laws_. Purchaser acknowledges that the Seller
Corporations have not taken, and do not intend to take, any action required
to comply with any applicable bulk sale or bulk transfer laws or similar
laws.



8.09. _Non-competition_.



(a) Subject to the provisions of this Section 8.09, Pfizer agrees that for a
period of two (2) years from and after the Closing Date, Pfizer shall not, and
it shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, compete, directly or indirectly, in
any material respect with the Business as conducted as of the Closing Date ("
_Competitive Activity_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that it shall not be
deemed to be a violation of this Section 8.09(a) for Pfizer or any of
its Subsidiaries: (i) to engage directly or indirectly in the research,
manufacture or sale of any products listed on Schedule 8.09; (ii) to engage,
directly or indirectly, in the research, manufacture or sale of any human
pharmaceutical, human consumer healthcare, animal pharmaceutical or animal
healthcare product or any medical device for the delivery of human or animal
pharmaceutical products; (iii) to invest in or own any debt securities or
other debt obligations; (iv) to invest in any third Person (including any
corporation or mutual or other fund) which invests in, manages or operates a
Competitive Activity, so long as Pfizers and its Subsidiaries aggregate
investment is less than 10% of the outstanding ownership interest in such
third Person and Pfizer and its Subsidiaries do not control such third Person
or conduct the Competitive Activity; (v) to invest in, own an interest in, or
acquire all or a majority of the stock or assets of any Person which is not
engaged primarily in a Competitive Activity; (vi) to invest in securities
having less than 10% of the outstanding voting power of any Person, the
securities of which are publicly traded or listed on any securities exchange
or automated quotation system; (vii) to invest in any Person after the



 

52 Closing Date to the extent that Pfizer or a Subsidiary had, directly or
indirectly, acquired, or had a right to acquire, such interest prior to the
date of this Agreement, provided, however, that such investments shall be
limited to having less than 5% ownership interest in such Persons; or (viii)
to own any equity interests through any employee benefit plan or pension
plan. For purposes of this Section 8.09, "engaged primarily in a Competitive
Activity" shall mean that greater than 20% of the aggregate net revenue
derived during the last complete fiscal year of such Person (calculated on
a consolidated basis) is derived from the Competitive Activity. Each
investment or acquisition made by Pfizer or its Subsidiaries which is subject
to the provisions of this Section 8.09 must be permissible hereunder at the
time of such investment;  _provided_ , _however_ , that any such investment
which was permissible when made cannot thereafter be the basis of a claim of
violation of this Section 8.09.



(b) For a period of two (2) years from and after the Closing Date, Pfizer
shall not, and it shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, directly or
indirectly, induce or attempt to induce any officers, Employees,
representatives or agents of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates engaged solely
in the Business to leave the employ of Purchaser or any such Affiliate for
employment with Pfizer or its Subsidiaries, or violate the terms of their
Contracts, or any employment arrangements, with Purchaser or any such
Affiliate; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section 8.09(b) shall
restrict or preclude Pfizer or any of its Subsidiaries from making
generalized searches for employees by the use of advertisements in the media
(including trade media) or by engaging search firms to engage in searches that
are not targeted or focused on the Employees employed by the Business.



(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 8.09(a), Pfizer and
its Subsidiaries shall not be deemed to have violated the restrictions
contained in Section 8.09(a) in the event that Pfizer or any of its
Subsidiaries acquires (by purchase of stock or assets, merger or otherwise)
or invests in any Person engaged primarily in a Competitive Activity;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Pfizer or such Subsidiary thereafter divests a
portion of such Competitive Activity within 18 months from the date of
purchase of such Person or assets so as to be in compliance with Section
8.09(a).



(d) Prior to the Closing, except as otherwise agreed in writing, neither
Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates will offer or provide employment on a
full-time or part-time or consulting basis to any individual employed by
Pfizer or any of its Affiliates; provided, however, that nothing in this
Section 8.09(d) shall restrict or preclude Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
from employing personnel of Pfizer or any of its Affiliates who respond to a
general solicitation of employment at their own initiative or who contact
Purchaser for employment on their own initiative without any solicitation
(other than a general solicitation) on the part of Purchaser.



(e) Pfizer and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that this Section 8.09
constitutes an independent covenant and shall not be affected by performance
or nonperformance of any other provision of this Agreement. Each of Pfizer and
Purchaser has independently consulted with its counsel and after such
consultation agrees that the covenants set forth in this Section 8.09
are reasonable and proper. It is the desire and intent of the parties that
the provisions of this Section 8.09 shall be enforced to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law. If all or part of this Section 8.09 is held
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy,
all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless



 

53 remain in full force and effect. If any part of this Section 8.09 is held to
be excessively broad as to duration, scope, activity or subject, such part
will be construed by limiting and reducing it so as to be enforceable to the
maximum extent compatible with applicable Law.



8.10. _Compliance with WARN Act, Etc_. With respect to WARN Act or other
similar Laws of any jurisdiction, Purchaser will timely give any notices
or take any other actions as may be required thereunder.



8.11.  _Litigation Support_. From and after the Closing, Purchaser and its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Pfizer and its Affiliates, on the other hand,
will cooperate with each other in the defense or settlement of any Liabilities
(including Product Claims) or lawsuits involving the Business for which they
have responsibility under this Agreement by providing the other party and such
other partys legal counsel and other designated Persons access to employees,
records, documents, data, equipment, facilities, products, parts, prototypes
and other information regarding the Business and its products as such other
party may request, to the extent maintained or under the possession or control
of the requested party. The requesting party shall reimburse the other party
for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses paid to third parties in performing
its obligations under this Section 8.11. Pfizer shall keep Purchaser informed
of the status of the pendency of the relevant Liabilities and lawsuits
involving the Business for which it has responsibility under this Agreement,
will advise Purchaser of material issues involved in the litigation and will
use commercially reasonable efforts to seek a confidentiality agreement with
respect to any settlements of such lawsuits. For so long as any Liabilities or
lawsuits involving the Business for which Pfizer has responsibility under this
Agreement remain outstanding, Purchaser will advise Pfizer of material issues
involved in the lawsuits involving the Business for which it has
responsibility and will use commercially reasonable efforts to seek a
confidentiality agreement with respect to any settlements of such lawsuits.



8.12. _Insurance_. As of the Closing Date, the coverage under all insurance
policies related to the Business (other than such policies as are included in
the Purchased Assets, if any, or such policies, if any, held by the Conveyed
Companies and solely related to the Business and not shared with other
Pfizer entities, unless such policies are reinsured or otherwise covered by
the Pfizer Corporate Insurance Program) shall continue in force only for the
benefit of the Seller Corporations and their Affiliates and not for the
benefit of Purchaser. Purchaser agrees to arrange for its own insurance
policies with respect to the Business covering all periods and agrees not to
seek, through any means, to benefit from any of the insurance policies
maintained by the Seller Corporations or their Affiliates which may provide
coverage for claims relating in any way to the Business prior to the Closing.



8.13. _Trade Notification_. Pfizer and Purchaser shall agree on the method and
content of the notifications to customers of the sale of the Shares and the
Purchased Assets to Purchaser. Pfizer and Purchaser agree that said
notifications are to provide sufficient advance notice of the sale and the
plans associated therewith, with the objective of minimizing any disruption of
the Business. 



8.14. _Products Received by Purchaser_. If any products of the Business
shipped and sold prior to the Closing are received by Purchaser or Purchasers
agent within 60 days after the Closing and Purchaser (i) pays a customer claim
related to any such returned product or (ii)



 

54 replaces such returned product for no additional charge to the customer, then
Pfizer shall within 15 days after notification from Purchaser, reimburse
Purchaser, in the form of credit against any amounts owing under the
Transitional Services Agreement, for all customer claims made against, or
products replaced at no additional charge by, Purchaser in the amounts
associated with such returned products which are received by Purchaser, or
Purchasers agent after the Closing.



8.15. _Foreign Implementing Agreements_. As promptly as practicable after the
date hereof Pfizer and Purchaser shall cause the Foreign
Implementing Agreements to be prepared and executed by their applicable
Affiliates.



8.16. _Audited Financial Information_. As soon as reasonably practicable, but
in no event later than 10 days after the date hereof, Pfizer shall deliver to
Purchaser, at Purchasers sole cost and expense, an audited statement of the
net assets to be sold in relation to the Business, and the related audited
statement of direct revenues and direct operating expenses in relation to the
Business, for the 12 months ended December 31, 2003 for the U.S. operations
and the 11 months ended November 30, 2003 for the international operations,
together with the notes thereto and the audit report thereon of KPMG LLP (the
" _2003 Audited Financial Information_ ").



8.17. _Quarterly Financial Statements; Monthly Sales Information_. 



(a) During the period from January 1, 2004 to the Closing Date, Pfizer shall,
no later than 30 days following the end of each quarter, prepare and deliver
to Purchaser, upon completion, copies of (i) an unaudited statement of the net
assets to be sold in relation to the Business for the quarter then ended and
(ii) the related unaudited statement of direct revenues and direct expenses in
relation to the Business for the quarter then ended (the " _Quarterly
Financial Statements_ "). Purchaser acknowledges that the Quarterly
Financial Statements to be delivered pursuant to this Section 8.17(a) will
include a one month lag of data in respect of the international operations of
the Business, consistent with the treatment of the international operations of
the Business in the 2003 Unaudited Financial Statements previously provided
to Purchaser.



(b) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date,
Pfizer shall, no later than 7 days following the end of each month, prepare
and deliver to Purchaser, copies of the sales information relating to the
Business, for the month then ended.



8.18. _Healon Business Drop Down_. Prior to the Closing, in accordance with
the provisions of the Healon Business Drop Down Documents and all applicable
Laws and regulations, Pfizer shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
contribute to Healon AB the assets, properties and rights of the Business, as
currently conducted in Sweden (the " _Swedish Business_ "), as would be deemed
to be Purchased Assets if such assets, properties and rights were transferred
by an Asset Selling Corporation to Purchaser under Section 2.02 hereof, and
Pfizer shall cause Healon AB to assume only those Liabilities of the Swedish
Business as would be deemed to be Assumed Liabilities under Section 2.05
hereof and shall not assume any Liabilities that would be deemed
Retained Liabilities. To the extent that any of the provisions of the Healon
Drop Down Documents are contrary to the provisions of this Agreement, Pfizer
and Purchaser agree that the provisions of this Agreement shall govern in all
respects, including with respect to payment and indemnification. In such
case, Pfizer and Purchaser agree to take



 

55 appropriate actions to fulfill the intent of this Agreement, including the
transfer of such assets and assignment of such liabilities as may be required
under this Agreement. Pfizer agrees that it will not amend or modify the
Healon Drop Down Documents in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights and obligations of Purchaser under this Agreement. Pfizer shall, and
shall cause the Stock Selling Corporations to, fulfill the information and
negotiation obligations and other obligations to consult and inform the
relevant trade unions in accordance with applicable Laws and regulations prior
to the Healon Business Drop Down and the transfer of the Employees.



8.19.  _Rooster Comb Agreements_. Prior to the Closing, Pfizer will use
commercially reasonable efforts to introduce Purchaser to appropriate
representatives of the counterparties to the Rooster Comb Agreements, and
cooperate with Purchaser, at Purchasers expense, with the view to enabling
Purchaser to negotiate its own arrangements for the provision of any services
which Purchaser wishes to procure from the applicable counterparties or to
amend and extend the term of the Rooster Comb Agreements.



8.20. _Intercompany Receivables_. Prior to the Closing Date, Pfizer shall, to
the extent practicable, cause all intercompany receivables and all
intercompany payables as at Closing to be paid or otherwise discharged in
full. The net effect of the remaining intercompany payables and intercompany
receivables to be transferred to Purchaser will be zero. Pfizer shall be
responsible for any tax Liability arising from the actions taken pursuant to
this Section 8.20.



8.21. _Information and Consultation Requirements_. Except as set forth on
Schedule 8.21, Pfizer and its Affiliates and Purchaser and its Affiliates
have complied with and shall continue to comply with, and Pfizer and Purchaser
shall cause its Affiliates to comply with, all applicable Laws (for example,
the Dutch Works Councils Act ( _Wet op de Ondernemingsraden_ )) or
contractual or other obligations relating to the notification of, consultation
with, and/or the receipt of any approval necessary to any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement from, any employees or any works council,
labor union or organization, or any similar body representing employees and/or
consisting of employees. Pfizer and Purchaser will each use their best
endeavors to provide the other party with all information reasonably necessary
in order to support the other partys compliance with all applicable Laws
relating to the matters described in this Section 8.21.



8.22. _Covenant Not to Sue_. Purchaser hereby agrees not to commence any
litigation, action or other proceeding against Pfizer or its Affiliates based
upon or arising from the matters set forth in item 5 in Schedule 6.08, which
matters shall be the subject of releases executed by Purchaser and delivered
to Pfizer and its Affiliates at the Closing.



8.23. _Return of Non-Public Information_. Immediately after the date of this
Agreement, Pfizer shall request, and shall cause its Affiliates to request,
the prompt return or destruction of all non-public information furnished to
any person (other than Purchaser and its Affiliates and representatives)
pursuant to any confidentiality agreement entered into by Pfizer, its
Affiliates or its representatives with such persons relating to a potential
acquisition of assets or securities of the Business or any portion thereof, or
a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving any of the
Conveyed Companies or Asset Selling Corporations and certify to Purchaser that
such return or destruction has occurred.



 

56 8.24. _Access to Facilities_.



Prior to the Closing, and to the extent not possible, as soon as possible
following the Closing, at Pfizers sole cost and expense, Pfizer shall obtain
(or cause its Subsidiaries to obtain), and deliver to Purchaser written
evidence reasonably acceptable to Purchaser of, all licenses, permits,
applications, approval, authorizations, variances and other entitlements (and
shall pay any and all fees, fines and/or penalties in connection therewith or
related to the fact that there exist no licenses, permits, applications,
approvals, authorizations, variances or other entitlements prior to such
delivery) relating to the access road illustrated on Schedule 8.24 (the
"Access Road"), so as to permit any owner of the Facility, and all guests,
invitees and employees of the Facility or its owner, to use such Access Road
as a right of way for ingress and egress to and from the Facility at all
times and at no cost to Purchaser or any such owner or user (collectively, the
"Road Approvals"). After the Closing, until such time as the Road Approvals
have been obtained and written evidence of the same reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser has been delivered to Purchaser (and, in the event that the Road
Approvals cannot be obtained), Pfizer shall, at its sole cost and expense,
obtain an easement registered at the court to afford and allow (or cause its
Subsidiaries to afford and allow) Purchaser, its affiliates and all guests,
invitees and employees of the Facility or Purchaser, full use of the alternate
road illustrated on Schedule 8.24 (the "Alternate Road") as a right of way of
purposed of ingress and egress to and from the Facility at all times and at no
cost to Purchaser or any such user. After the Road Approvals have been
obtained and written evidence thereof provided to the Purchaser, Purchaser,
its affiliates and all guests, invitees and employees of the Facility or
Purchaser shall cease using such Alternate Road and Purchaser shall take all
necessary actions and execute all such documents at Pfizers expense to remove
or de-register such easement. 



ARTICLE IX

INDEMNIFICATION



9.01. _Indemnification by Pfizer_.



(a) Subject to the provisions of this Article IX, Pfizer agrees to defend,
indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates, and, if
applicable, their respective directors, officers, agents, employees,
successors and assigns from and against any and all claims, actions, causes of
action, judgments, awards, Liabilities, losses, costs or damages
(collectively, a " _Loss_ " or, the " _Losses_ ") arising directly from (i)
any Retained Liability, (ii) any breach by Pfizer of any of its covenants or
agreements in this Agreement, (iii) any breach of any representation or
warranty of Pfizer contained in this Agreement, (iv) any non-compliance with
bulk transfer or similar Laws to the extent the underlying obligation to the
creditor is not an Assumed Liability or (v) those Liabilities and Losses
arising under subparagraphs (i) to (v) of the definition of
Excluded Environmental Liabilities.



(b) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Pfizer shall not have any
liability under any provision of this Agreement for any Loss to the extent
that such Loss relates to action taken by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
after the Closing Date. Purchaser shall take and shall cause its Affiliates
to take all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming
aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise
thereto, including incurring costs only to the minimum extent necessary
to remedy the breach which gives rise to the Loss.



 

57 (c) Nothing in this Article IX shall be construed to impose Liabilities with
respect to Taxes, and no provision of this Article IX shall be interpreted as
altering the rights and responsibilities of the parties under Section 8.04.



9.02. _Indemnification by Purchaser_.



(a) Subject to the provisions of this Article IX, Purchaser agrees to defend,
indemnify and hold harmless Pfizer, the other Seller Corporations,
their respective Affiliates, and, if applicable, their respective directors,
officers, agents, employees, successors and assigns from and against any and
all Losses claimed or arising directly from (i) any Assumed Liability, (ii)
any breach by Purchaser of any of its covenants or agreements in this
Agreement, (iii) any breach of any representation or warranty of Purchaser
contained in this Agreement or (iv) events occurring on or after the Closing
Date in connection with the Business, the Purchased Assets, or the Shares
including the use, ownership, possession, operation or occupancy of any
Facility, Leased Real Property or Real Property, the Intellectual Property of
the Business, the Purchased Assets, or the Shares from and after the
Closing Date.



(b) Pfizer shall take and shall cause its Affiliates to take all commercially
reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any event which
would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto, including
incurring costs only to the minimum extent necessary to remedy the breach
which gives rise to the Loss.



(c) Nothing in this Article IX shall be construed to impose Liabilities with
respect to Taxes.



9.03. _Notice of Claims_.



(a) If any of the Persons to be indemnified under this Article IX (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") has suffered or incurred any Loss, the Indemnified
Party shall so notify the party from whom indemnification is sought (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") promptly in writing describing such Loss, the amount
or estimated amount thereof, if known or reasonably capable of estimation, and
the method of computation of such Loss, all with reasonable particularity and
containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement or any other
agreement, instrument or certificate delivered pursuant hereto in respect of
which such Loss shall have occurred. If any action at Law or suit in equity is
instituted by or against a third party with respect to which the Indemnified
Party intends to claim any Liability as a Loss under this Article IX, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of such action
or suit and tender to the Indemnifying Party the defense of such action or
suit. A failure by the Indemnified Party to give notice and to tender the
defense of the action or suit in a timely manner pursuant to this Section 9.03
shall not limit the obligation of the Indemnifying Party under this Article
IX, except (i) to the extent such Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby,
(ii) to the extent expenses are incurred during the period in which notice was
not provided, and (iii) as provided by Section 9.05.



 

58 (b) Except when a notice, report or other filing must be filed immediately as
required by applicable Environmental Laws, the Indemnified Party will provide
notice and an opportunity to comment to the Indemnifying Party before the
Indemnified Party files any Required Governmental Report or any other report,
notification or filing with any Governmental Authority or third party in
connection with an event that would be reasonably likely to result in a Loss
subject to the indemnification provisions of this Article IX. In the event the
Indemnified Party is required to file a Required Governmental Report or any
other report, notification or filing immediately, the Indemnified Party will
provide simultaneous notice to the Indemnifying Party when it files such
report with the Governmental Authority.



9.04. _Third Party Claims_.



(a) The Indemnifying Party under this Article IX shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to conduct and control, through counsel of its
choosing, any third party claim, action, suit or proceeding (a " _Third Party
Claim_ "), and the Indemnifying Party may compromise or settle the same,
provided that the Indemnifying Party shall give the Indemnified Party advance
notice of any proposed compromise or settlement. No Indemnified Party may
compromise or settle any Third Party Claim for which it is seeking
indemnification hereunder without the consent of the Indemnifying Party. The
Indemnifying Party shall permit the Indemnified Party to participate in, but
not control, the defense of any such action or suit through counsel chosen by
the Indemnified Party, provided that the fees and expenses of such counsel
shall be borne by the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects not
to control or conduct the defense or prosecution of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party nevertheless shall have the right to participate in the
defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and, at its own expense, to
employ counsel of its own choosing for such purpose.



(b) The parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of any
Third Party Claim, with such cooperation to include (i) the retention and
the provision of the Indemnifying Party records and information that are
reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and (ii) the making available
of employees on a mutually convenient basis for providing additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.



9.05. _Expiration_. 



(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the
Closing shall have occurred, all covenants, agreements, warranties and
representations made herein or in any certificate delivered pursuant to
Exhibit A or B shall survive the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
all representations and warranties made herein or in any certificate
delivered pursuant to Exhibit A or B, and all indemnification obligations
under Sections 9.01(a)(iii) and 9.02(a)(iii) with respect to any such
representation or warranty, shall terminate and expire on, and no action or
proceeding seeking damages or other relief for breach of any thereof or for
any misrepresentation or inaccuracy with respect thereto shall be commenced
after 18 months following the Closing Date, unless prior to such time a claim
for indemnification with respect thereto shall have been made, with reasonable
specificity, by written notice given under Section 9.03.



 

59 (b) As to indemnification obligations under Section 9.01(a)(v) with respect to
subparagraphs (ii), (iii) and (v) of the definition of Excluded Environmental
Liabilities, such obligations shall terminate and expire on, and no action or
proceeding seeking damages, relief or indemnity with respect thereto shall be
commenced after, the third anniversary of the Closing Date, unless prior to
such date claims shall have been made against the Indemnified Party and
written notice thereof shall have been given to Pfizer under Section 9.03.



9.06. _Certain Limitations_.



 

(a) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article IX, Pfizer shall not
have any indemnification obligations for Losses under Section 9.01(a)(iii),
unless the aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds $4.5 million, in which
event Pfizer shall be required to pay the amount of such Losses which exceeds
$4.5 million, but only up to a maximum amount of $90 million, except
with respect to Losses related to breaches of the representations set forth
in Section 6.02 and 6.03 of this Agreement, for which there shall be no
maximum amount.



 

(b) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article IX, Pfizer shall not
have any indemnification obligations for Losses under Section 9.01(a)(v) in
respect to subparagraphs (ii), (iii) and (v) of Excluded Environmental
Liabilities unless the extent of the Loss exceeds, in the aggregate,
$3,000,000.



9.07. _Losses Net of Insurance, Etc_. The amount of any Loss for which
indemnification is provided under Section 9.01 or 9.02 shall be net of (i)
any amounts recovered by the Indemnified Party pursuant to any
indemnification by or indemnification agreement with any third party, (ii) any
insurance proceeds or other cash receipts or sources of reimbursement received
as an offset against such Loss (each Person named and source identified in
clauses (i) and (ii), a " _Collateral Source_ "), and (iii) an amount equal to
any tax benefit that resulted in an actual reduction in cash payments for
Taxes in the same fiscal year such Losses were incurred by the Indemnified
Party in connection therewith. Indemnification under this Article IX shall not
be available unless the Indemnified Party first uses commercially reasonable
efforts to seek recovery from all Collateral Sources. The Indemnifying Party
may require an Indemnified Party to assign the rights to seek recovery
pursuant to the preceding sentence; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnifying Party will then be responsible for pursuing such claim at
its own expense. If the amount to be netted hereunder from any payment
required under Sections 9.01 or 9.02 is determined after payment by the
Indemnifying Party of any amount otherwise required to be paid to an
Indemnified Party to this Article IX, the Indemnified Party shall repay to
the Indemnifying Party, promptly after such determination, any amount that the
Indemnifying Party would not have had to pay pursuant to this Article IX had
such determination been made at the time of such payment. 



9.08. _Sole Remedy/Waiver_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the
remedies provided for in this Agreement shall be the parties sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. In
furtherance of the foregoing, the parties hereby waive, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, any and all other rights, claims and causes of
action (including rights of contributions, if any) known or unknown, foreseen
or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future, that it may have
against Pfizer, the other Seller Corporations or any of their respective
Affiliates, or Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, as



 

60 the case may be, arising under or based upon any federal, state or local Law
(including any such Law relating to environmental matters or arising under or
based upon any securities Law, common Law or otherwise).



9.09. _Indemnification Procedures for Remedial Actions_.



(a) Pfizer shall have the right but not the obligation to conduct and control
the management of a Remedial Action at a property owned by a Conveyed Company
or included in the Purchased Assets that is subject to indemnification
pursuant to this Agreement. Pfizer must notify Purchaser, within 30 days of
receipt of notice of Purchasers claim for indemnification for such matter,
(i) that it intends to undertake said responsibility or (ii) that more
information is needed from Purchaser before Pfizer can reasonably determine
that Purchasers claim is subject to indemnification pursuant to this
Agreement. Purchaser shall promptly respond to such requests for information
(to the extent such information is reasonably available to Purchaser) and,
within 30 days of receipt of such information, Pfizer shall notify Purchaser
as to whether it shall undertake the Remedial Action. Prior to a
determination by Pfizer that it will undertake a Remedial Action pursuant to
this Section 9.09, Purchaser shall take only those actions necessary or which
can reasonably be expected to be necessary to comply with applicable
Environmental Laws or address conditions that pose an immediate and acute
health risk (unless additional actions are approved by Pfizer).



(b) In undertaking a Remedial Action pursuant to this Section 9.09, Pfizer
shall, at its own expense, retain a qualified independent
environmental consultant, which consultant shall be subject to Purchasers
approval (such approval not to be unreasonably delayed or withheld). Pfizer
shall consult with Purchaser in all material aspects of the Remedial Action.
Pfizer shall (i) undertake such Remedial Action to meet the Applicable
Remedial Action Standards in a prompt and expeditious fashion, provided that
Pfizer may exercise its rights, including its due process right, to contest
any requirement imposed or determination made by a Governmental Authority
with respect to the contemplated Remedial Action; and (ii) not cause, through
its own inaction, any undue delay in obtaining written notice from the
appropriate Governmental Authority that no further investigation
or remediation is necessary with respect to the matter that is the subject of
the indemnification claim to meet the Applicable Remedial Action Standards or,
if no Governmental Authority is involved in such matter, a good faith
determination from its environmental consultant that no further investigation
or remediation is required to bring the applicable property into conformance
with Applicable Remedial Action Standards. Pfizer shall comply with all
applicable Laws, including all applicable Environmental Laws, pertaining to
its performance of Remedial Action pursuant to this Section 9.09. Pfizer shall
provide copies to Purchaser of all written notices, final submissions, final
work plans, and final reports and shall give Purchaser a reasonable
opportunity given the circumstances (at Purchasers own expense) to comment on
any submissions Pfizer intends to deliver or submit to the appropriate
Governmental Authority prior to said submission. Purchaser may, at its own
expense, hire its own consultants, attorneys or other professionals to
monitor the Remedial Action, including any field work undertaken by Pfizer,
and Purchaser shall provide Pfizer with the results of all such monitoring.
Notwithstanding the above, Purchaser shall not take any actions that shall
unreasonably interfere with Pfizers performance of the Remedial Action.
Pfizer shall undertake any such work required herein in a manner designed to
minimize any disruption, to the greatest extent possible, with the conduct of
operations at the Conveyed



 

61 Companies. Purchaser shall allow Pfizer reasonable access to conduct any of
the work contemplated herein and shall fully cooperate with Pfizer in the
performance of the Remedial Action, including providing Pfizer with reasonable
access to employees and documents as necessary.



(c) If Pfizer declines to undertake the performance of a Remedial Action as
provided in Section 9.09(a), Purchaser shall be entitled to undertake
the Remedial Action to meet the Applicable Remedial Action Standards.
Purchaser shall retain a qualified independent environmental consultant, which
consultant shall be subject to Pfizers approval (such approval not to be
unreasonably delayed or withheld). Purchaser shall promptly provide copies to
Pfizer of all notices, correspondence, draft reports, submissions, work plans,
and final reports and shall give Pfizer a reasonable opportunity (at Pfizers
own expense) to comment on any submissions Purchaser intends to deliver or
submit to any appropriate Governmental Agency prior to said submission. Pfizer
may, at its own expense, hire its own consultants, attorneys or other
professionals to monitor the Remedial Action, including any field work
undertaken by Purchaser, and Purchaser shall provide to Pfizer the results of
all such field work. Notwithstanding the above, Pfizer shall not take any
actions that shall unreasonably interfere with Purchasers performance of
the Remedial Action. Pfizers decision to allow Purchaser to undertake
Remedial Action hereunder shall not limit or affect Pfizers obligation to
indemnify Purchaser for said Remedial Action to the Applicable Remedial Action
Standards as otherwise provided in this Agreement.



9.10. _Limitation on Indemnification for Claims for Remedial Action_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Pfizers
indemnification obligations under Section 9.01 hereof in respect of subsection
(ii) of the definition of Excluded Environmental Liabilities and the matter
described on Schedule 9.11 are subject to the provisions of this Section 9.10.
Pfizer shall be responsible for the cost of such Remedial Action only to the
extent necessary to meet the least stringent, most cost-effective standard
required by applicable Environmental Laws consistent with the
industrial/commercial use of the Facility as of the Closing Date, or a
standard pursuant to applicable Environmental Laws acceptable to the relevant
Governmental Authorities making a claim for Remedial Action (the "
_Applicable Remedial Action Standard_ "). Pfizer shall not be responsible for
those costs incurred in connection with a Remedial Action to the extent such
costs are caused by (A) a Release of Hazardous Materials in connection with
Purchasers operation of the Business or (B) Purchasers negligent, knowing or
reckless action resulting in the exacerbation of environmental conditions
otherwise subject to the indemnification pursuant to this Agreement or (C)
the Purchasers initiation of Remedial Action by Purchaser or at the request
of a third party in the absence of a requirement of Environmental Law after
the Closing Date.



9.11. _Certain Matter_. Pfizer shall, at its sole cost and expense, conduct
and control the management of the Remedial Action with respect to the matter
described in Schedule 9.11 in the manner prescribed by Section 9.09 and 9.10
hereof. The parties agree that, with respect to such matter, any and all
notification requirements set forth in Sections 9.03(a) and 9.09(a)(i) shall
be deemed satisfied and accordingly waive any and all claims based upon the
adequacy or sufficiency of notice relating to such matter. It being understood
that in the event that Pfizers conduct of Remedial Action at the nearby
Diagnostics Facility caused certain Hazardous Materials currently being
remediated at that facility (collectively, " _Diagnostic_



 

62 _Hazardous Materials_ ") to become present at the Healon Facility in violation
of applicable Environmental Laws, then Pfizers responsibility for Remedial
Action under this Section 9.11 shall be deemed to include the Diagnostics
Hazardous Materials as well. The parties hereby waive all notice requirements
with respect to Remedial Action conduct pursuant to the discovery, if
occurring, of Diagnostics Hazardous Materials at the Healon Facility.



9.12. _Procedures and Limitations for Corrective Actions_.



(a) With respect to matters covered under subparagraph (iii) of the definition
of Excluded Environmental Liabilities that are subject to
indemnification hereunder, Purchaser shall have the right, consistent with
applicable Environmental Law and subject to the limitations in this Agreement
and as set forth herein, to determine and implement the appropriate actions to
correct any failures to comply with applicable Environmental Law in effect as
of the Closing Date. Purchaser shall consult with Pfizer in all material
respects in connection with undertaking said corrective actions; shall provide
Pfizer with copies of all material correspondence submitted to and received
by any governmental authorities with respect to such matters; and shall
provide Pfizer with a reasonable opportunity to comment on any material, prior
to their submissions to governmental authorities _,_ with respect to such
matters, including corrective action proposals.



(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Pfizer shall not be obligated to indemnify
Purchaser for those costs incurred in connection with the implementation of a
corrective action that are in excess of the costs that would be incurred to
achieve the minimum corrective action required to comply with applicable
Environmental Law in effect as of the Closing Date, provided, that (i) the
minimum corrective action for purposes of this section shall be sufficient to
allow Purchaser to operate the Facilities in a manner and at a level of
production that is consistent with the operations of the Facilities during the
12 month period prior to the date of this Agreement and (ii) notwithstanding
the foregoing subclause (i), Pfizers obligations under this Section 9.12,
shall be only up to an maximum aggregate amount in respect to all such
indemnifiable corrective action items of $5,000,000. It being understood that
to the extent that Purchaser chooses to implement a corrective action that
goes beyond this standard, including, without limitation, implementing a
corrective action that allows for an expansion in operations at a Facility or
that is required to achieve compliance with Environmental Law that does not
become applicable to a Facility until after the Closing Date, Pfizer shall
not be responsible for the additional or excess costs associated with such
corrective action.



(c) For avoidance of doubt, corrective action contemplated by this Section
9.12 and within the meaning of the subparagraph (iii) of the definition of
Excluded Environmental Liabilities (i) shall include the emissions reduction
measure(s), if any, required to be implemented at the Groningen Facility by
the competent Governmental Authority pursuant to its review of the Groningen
VOC Emissions Study. The application of conditions and limitations of this
Section 9.12 to this subsection (c)(i) shall be without regard to the
Groningen Facilitys compliance, or the lack thereof, with those Environmental
Law and Environmental Permit requirements applicable to those emissions that
are the subject of the Groningen VOC Emissions Study at the time of the
selection of the reduction measures; and (ii) shall not include any Remedial
Action.



 

63 9.13. _No Consequential Damages_. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY
CONTAINED HEREIN, NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIABLE TO OR OTHERWISE
RESPONSIBLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO OR ANY AFFILIATE OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HERETO FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR FOR DIMINUTION IN
VALUE OR LOST PROFITS THAT ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
PERFORMANCE OR BREACH HEREOF OR ANY LIABILITY RETAINED OR ASSUMED HEREUNDER.

TERMINATION



10.01. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Closing:



(a) by written agreement of Purchaser and Pfizer, acting as agent for
the Seller Corporations;



(b) by either Purchaser or Pfizer, by giving written notice of such
termination to the other party, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or
prior to December 31, 2004 (the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if on the Outside Date the condition to Closing set forth in Section
5.01(b) shall not have been satisfied but all other conditions to Closing
shall be satisfied or shall be capable of being satisfied upon satisfaction of
the condition to Closing set forth in Section 5.01(b), then the Outside Date
shall be extended to March 31, 2005 if Parent or Pfizer notifies the other on
or prior to December 31, 2004 of its election to extend the Outside Date to
March 31, 2005; _provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 10.01(b) shall not be available to any
party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been
the primary cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to have
occurred on or before such date; 



(c) by either Purchaser or Pfizer if any court of competent jurisdiction or
other competent Governmental Authority of the United States of America, the
United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden or the Netherlands shall have
issued a Governmental Order or taken any other action permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and such Governmental Order or other action shall have
become final and non-appealable; or



(d) by Pfizer, by giving five (5) Business Days prior written notice of such
termination to Purchaser at any time subsequent to September 30, 2004, if the
Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to the date of Pfizers
notification solely as a result of the non-satisfaction of Section 5.01(a) or
Section 5.01(b) hereof and Pfizer reasonably and in good faith believes,
after consulting with counsel, that there is a reasonable likelihood that
Purchaser and Pfizer will not be able to satisfy the conditions set forth in
Section 5.01(a) and Section 5.01(b) hereof prior to the Outside Date.

in this Agreement prior to such termination.



(b) If this Agreement is terminated and at such time any party is in material
breach of or default under any term or provision hereof, such termination
shall be without prejudice to, and shall not affect, any and all rights to

Law. The damages recoverable by the non-defaulting party shall include all
attorneys fees reasonably incurred by such party in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

expenses, up to an aggregate maximum amount of $5,000,000, incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby through the period up to
and including the date upon which the termination occurs, such amount to be
payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds promptly following
Pfizers receipt of adequate documentation of such expenses.



(d) If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 10.01, (i)

1 year from the date of termination of this Agreement, and (ii) Pfizer agrees

(a) Any obligation of any party to any other party under this Agreement,
which obligation is performed, satisfied or fulfilled by an Affiliate of such
party, shall be deemed to have been performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such

with its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses to be reimbursed by Purchaser, to

(d) Prior to the Closing, Pfizer will provide to Purchaser access and
cooperation as described in Schedule 11.05(d). 



11.06. _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Except as expressly provided in Article IX hereof, nothing
in this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, express or implied, is
intended to confer upon any Person other than Purchaser or Pfizer, or their
successors or permitted assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of
this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.



11.07. _Public Disclosure_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, each party to this Agreement hereby agrees with the other party
hereto that, except as may be required to comply with the requirements of any
applicable Laws, and the rules and



 

67 regulations of each stock exchange upon which the securities of one of the
parties is listed, if any, no press release or similar public announcement or
communication shall, if prior to the Closing, be made or caused to be made
concerning the execution or performance of this Agreement unless the parties
shall have consulted in advance with respect thereto.

 



11.08. _Return of Information_. If for any reason whatsoever the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated, Purchaser shall promptly
return to Pfizer all books and records furnished by Pfizer, any other Seller

whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this

incurring such expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing and Section 8.04(b),

any interest, penalties, surtax or other similar Tax imposed with respect to
such Income Taxes) and fees (including notarial fees) incurred solely as a
result of the transfer of the Shares and the Purchased Assets shall be paid
by the Person liable therefor, but the Liability for such Taxes and fees as
between Pfizer and Purchaser shall be borne as follows: (a) in respect of any
such Taxes and fees that are refundable or in respect of which a credit is,
or becomes, available, by Purchaser and (b) in respect of any other such Taxes
or fees not falling within subclause (a) above, equally by Pfizer, on the one
hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if
any such Tax or any other Tax or fee from which there otherwise could have
been a refund or a credit becomes payable or non-refundable as a result of
Purchasers failing to register or become liable for such Tax or fee, such Tax
or fee shall be borne solely by Purchaser, (ii) the parties acknowledge that
no Dutch or Swedish value-added Tax will be charged on the transfer of the
Shares and (iii) the sale of real property taking place as part of the Healon
Business Dropdown shall be governed by the Real Property Sale Agreement
(attached as Exhibit I hereto). Each party shall use reasonable efforts to
obtain any available exemption from, or recovery or refund with respect to any
assessment of, transfer taxes and to cooperate with the other party in
providing any information or documentation that may be necessary to obtain
such exemption or recovery. Pfizer or Purchaser, as the case may be, shall on
demand reimburse the other for its share of any such Taxes or fees paid by
the other in accordance with this Section 11.09.

respect to Schedules 6.17(g)(i), 6.17(g)(ii) and 6.17(h), Pfizer shall only
have the right to amend or supplement such Schedules within 10 days after the
date of this Agreement. The disclosure of any matter in any Schedule to this
Agreement, as may be amended or supplemented prior to the Closing, shall be
deemed to be a disclosure for all purposes of this Agreement, but shall not be
deemed to constitute an admission by Pfizer or Purchaser, or to otherwise
imply, that any such matter is material for the purposes of this Agreement.



 

68 11.11. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.



(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of law rules
of such state.



(b) With respect to any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement
(each, a " _Proceeding_ "), each party hereto irrevocably (i) agrees and
consents to be subject to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York or any New York State court sitting in
New York City and (ii) waives any objection which it may have at any time to
the laying of venue of any Proceeding brought in any such court, waives any
claim that such Proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum and
further waives the right to object, with respect to such Proceeding, that such
court does not have any jurisdiction over such party. Purchaser hereby
irrevocably designates, appoints and empowers CT Corporation System, with
offices located in New York, New York, as its designee, appointee and agent to
receive, accept and acknowledge for and on its behalf service of any legal
process, summons notices and documents which may be served in any such
Proceeding. If for any reason CT Corporation System is unable or unwilling to
continue to act as such designee, appointee and agent, Purchaser agrees to
immediately appoint a successor designee, appointee and agent in New York City
acceptable to Pfizer. 



11.12. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which
shall constitute one and the same agreement and shall become effective when
one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered
to the other party, it being understood that both parties need not sign the
same counterpart.



11.13. _Headings_. The heading references herein and the table of contents
hereto are for convenience purposes only, do not constitute a part of this
Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions
hereof.



11.14. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
term or other provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any
person or entity or any circumstance, is invalid, illegal or unenforceable,
(i) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order
to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose
of such invalid or unenforceable provision and (ii) the remainder of this
Agreement and the application of such provision to other persons, entities or
circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application
thereof, in any other jurisdiction.
