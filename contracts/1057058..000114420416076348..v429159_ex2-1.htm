AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  



  

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (hereinafter referred to as this "
_Agreement_ "), dated January 18, 2016, is by and among Progressive Waste
Solutions Ltd., a corporation existing under the laws of Ontario (" _Parent_
"), Water Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct
or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ ") and
Waste Connections, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). All
capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the meanings ascribed to
such terms in _Section 9.5_ or as otherwise defined elsewhere in this
Agreement unless the context clearly provides otherwise. Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company are each sometimes referred to herein as a " _Party_ " and
collectively as the " _Parties_ ".

  



  

RECITALS

  



  

WHEREAS, the Parties wish to effect a business combination through the merger
of Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company being the
surviving corporation (the " _Merger_ ");

  



  

WHEREAS, in connection with the Merger, and immediately following the
consummation thereof, based on an implied exchange ratio of 0.4815 of a common
share of Parent for each share of common stock of the Company, representing
the inverse of the Exchange Ratio set forth in _Section 2.1_ hereof, the
Company Shareholders shall own approximately 70% of the then total outstanding
Parent Shares, members of the Company Board of Directors (as defined below)
shall hold five of the seven director positions on the Parent Board of
Directors (as defined below) and the name of Parent shall be changed to Waste
Connections, Inc.;

  



  

WHEREAS, in connection with the Merger, each outstanding share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company
Common Stock_ " or " _Company Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and each holder of Company
Common Stock shall have the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") (other than
Company Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ );

  



  

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board of
Directors_ ") has determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (the " _Transactions_ "), including the Merger, are
advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders;

  



  

WHEREAS, the Company Board of Directors has unanimously adopted resolutions
approving the Merger, the execution of this Agreement and the consummation
of the Transactions and declaring advisable and recommending that the
Company's stockholders approve and adopt this Agreement (the " _Company Board
Recommendation_ ") pursuant to the DGCL;

  



  

WHEREAS, the board of directors of Parent (the " _Parent Board of Directors_
") has unanimously approved this Agreement, determined that the
consummation of the Transactions are in the best interests of Parent and
resolved to recommend that Parent's shareholders vote to approve the Parent
Shareholder Resolutions (the " _Parent Board Recommendation_ ");

  



    



 



    



  

WHEREAS, Parent is the sole member of Merger Sub and has duly approved and
authorized this Agreement, the Merger and the Transactions; and

  



  

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also prescribe
various conditions to the Merger.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as
follows:

  



  

ARTICLE I

  



  

The Merger

  



  

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in
accordance with the DGCL and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (the
" _LLC Act_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub will cease,
with the Company surviving the Merger and continuing under the name "Waste
Connections, Inc." or such other name as the Company designates (the Company,
as the surviving corporation in the Merger, sometimes being referred to herein
as the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), such that following the Merger, the
Surviving Corporation will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. The Merger
shall have the effects provided in this Agreement and as specified in the
DGCL and the LLC Act.

  



  

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_
") will take place at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, at the offices of
Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP, New York, NY 10153, on the third (3rd) business
day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last of the conditions set forth
in _Article VII_ to be satisfied or waived (other than any such conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), unless
another date or place is agreed to in writing by the Company and Parent. The
date on which the Closing actually takes place is referred to as the "
_Closing Date_ ".

  



  

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, the Parties
shall cause a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") to be duly executed and filed with the DSOS as
provided under the DGCL and the LLC Act and make any other filings,
recordings or publications required to be made by the Company under the DGCL
or Merger Sub under the LLC Act in connection with the Merger. The Merger
shall become effective on such date and time as shall be agreed to by Parent
and the Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the date and time
the Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

  



  

Section 1.4 _Governing Documents_. At the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the Company as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 1.5 _Officers and Directors of the Surviving Corporation_.
From and after the Effective Time, the persons listed on Section 1.5 of the
Company Disclosure Letter shall be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation (unless otherwise specified by the Company), and shall hold
office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or
their earlier death, incapacitation, retirement, resignation or removal. The
officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, from and
after the Effective Time, shall be the initial officers of the Surviving
Corporation, and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly
appointed and qualified, or their earlier death, incapacitation, retirement,
resignation or termination.

  



  

ARTICLE II

  



  

Treatment of Securities

  



  

Section 2.1 _Treatment of Capital Stock_.

  



  

(a) _Treatment of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties
or holders of any securities of the Company or of Merger Sub, subject to
_Section 2.1(d)_ and any applicable withholding Tax, each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Company Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section
2.1(b)_ ) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive 2.076843
(the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") fully paid and non-assessable Parent Shares (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, the Exchange Ratio and
the Merger Consideration do not take into account the effects of the
Consolidation. From and after the Effective Time, all such Company Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and each applicable holder of such Company Shares shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Company Shares in
accordance with _Section 2.2_ , including the right to receive, pursuant to
_Section 2.5_ , cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares, if any, into which
such Company Shares have been converted pursuant to this _Section 2.1(a)_ (the
" _Fractional Share Consideration_ "), together with the amounts, if any,
payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(f)_.

  



  

(b) _Cancellation of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time,
all Company Shares owned by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor.

  



  

(c) _Treatment of Merger Sub Units_. At the Effective Time, each
unit representing membership interests in Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and,
in exchange for the cancellation of such units of Merger Sub and the funding
of the aggregate Merger Consideration by Parent, the Surviving Corporation
shall issue an equivalent number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, all of which shares shall be held by
Parent, and which shall constitute the only outstanding shares of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time.

  



    

 | 3| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration
shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock or Parent
Shares, as applicable), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to the
number of shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Shares outstanding after
the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

Section 2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates._

  



  

(a) _Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Parent to act as
the exchange agent in connection with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ ").
The Exchange Agent shall also act as the agent for the Company's stockholders
for the purpose of receiving and holding their Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares and shall obtain no rights or interests in the shares represented
thereby. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence of
Parent Shares issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ in book-entry form equal
to the aggregate Merger Consideration (excluding any Fractional Share
Consideration), and (ii) cash in immediately available funds in an amount
sufficient to pay any dividends under _Section 2.2(f)_ (such evidence
of book-entry Parent Shares and cash amounts, together with any dividends or
other distributions with respect thereto, the " _Exchange Fund_ "), in each
case, for the sole benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock.
In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to pay any dividends
under _Section 2.2(f)_ , Parent shall, or shall cause Merger Sub to,
promptly deposit additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount which
is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment.
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall
make, delivery of the Merger Consideration and any amounts payable in respect
of dividends or other distributions on Parent Shares in accordance with
_Section 2.2(f)_  out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement.
The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not
expressly provided for in this Agreement. The cash portion of the Exchange
Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as reasonably directed by
Parent; _provided, however_ , that any investment of such cash shall in all
events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term
obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S.
government, in commercial paper rated P-1 or A-1 or better by Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances
of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most
recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available),
and that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable
to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares entitled to receive such
amounts pursuant to this  _Article II_. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation
on the earlier of (A) one (1) year after the Effective Time or (B) the full
payment of the Exchange Fund.

  



    

 | 4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, but in no event more than five (5) business
days following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to
mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Company Shares
(the " _Certificates_ ") or non-certificated Company Shares represented by
book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and whose Company Shares were converted
pursuant to _Section 2.1_ into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
(i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration into
which such Company Shares have been converted pursuant to _Section 2.1_ ,
including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in
accordance with _Section 2.5_ , and any dividends or other distributions on
Parent Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_. Upon surrender of a
Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder
of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article II_, any Fractional Share Consideration that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to the provisions of _Section 2.5_ , and any
amounts that such holder has the right to receive in respect of dividends or
other distributions on Parent Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_ for
each Company Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share, to be mailed within five (5) business days following the Exchange
Agent's receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Share, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)
or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Exchange
Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions
as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in
accordance with normal exchange practices. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent
of payment that (A) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed
or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and (B) the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall
have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such
Tax either has been paid or is not required to be paid. Payment of the Merger
Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the
Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_ , each Certificate and Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article
II_ , including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share
Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.5_ , and any dividends or other
distributions on Parent Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_ , without
interest thereon.

  



  

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company
Shares_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Company Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Company Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall
be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

  



    

 | 5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. At any time
following twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, Parent shall be
entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds (including
any interest received with respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund
that have not been disbursed, or for which disbursement is pending subject
only to the Exchange Agent's routine administrative procedures, to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be
entitled to look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger
Consideration, including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share
Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.5_ , and any dividends or other
distributions on Parent Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_ , payable
upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance
with the procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_ , without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate
or Book-Entry Share for any Merger Consideration or other amounts delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

  



  

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.1_ hereof,
including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in
accordance with _Section 2.5_ , and any dividends or other distributions on
Parent Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_.

  



  

(f) _Dividends or Distributions with Respect to Parent Shares_. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Shares with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the Parent
Shares issuable hereunder, and all such dividends and other distributions
shall be paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in the
Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) in accordance with this
Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) there
shall be paid to the holder thereof, without interest, (i) the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such Parent Shares to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date
subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such Parent Shares.

  



  

(g) _Timing and Effect of Consolidation_. If the Parent Shareholder
Consolidation Approvals are obtained, articles of Parent effecting
the Consolidation will be filed immediately following the completion of the
Merger. If the Consolidation has occurred prior to the time of delivery by
the Exchange Agent of the Merger Consideration to any holders of the Company
Shares, the aggregate Merger Consideration to be delivered by the Exchange
Agent to each former holder of Company Common Stock shall be adjusted
appropriately to reflect the effect of the Consolidation.

Section 2.3 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards._

  



  

(a) _Company Warrants_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof,
each warrant to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under any
Company Equity Plan (each, a " _Company Warrant_ "), that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed by Parent
and shall be converted into a warrant (a " _Parent Warrant_ ") to acquire (A)
that number of whole Parent Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole share)
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Warrant immediately prior to the
Effective Time by (2) the Exchange Ratio, (B) at an exercise price per Parent
Share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient obtained
by dividing (1) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of such
Company Warrant by (2) the Exchange Ratio. Except as otherwise provided in
this _Section 2.3(a)_ , each such Parent Warrant assumed and converted
pursuant to this _Section 2.3(a)_ shall continue to have, and shall be subject
to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Company
Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(b) _Company RSU Awards_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof,
each outstanding award of restricted stock units (whether time-based or
performance-based), including any such units that are deferred under any
deferred compensation plan of the Company that prior to the date hereof has
been provided to Parent or is filed as an exhibit to any Company SEC Document
as of the date hereof, that corresponds to a number of shares of Company
Common Stock (each, a " _Company RSU Award_ ") under any Company Equity Plan
shall be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into a restricted stock
unit award corresponding to Parent Shares (each, a " _Parent RSU Award_ ")
with respect to a number of Parent Shares (rounded up or down to the nearest
whole share) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the
applicable number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the Exchange Ratio.
Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 2.3(b)_ , each Parent RSU Award
assumed and converted pursuant to this _Section 2.3(b)_ shall continue to
have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to
the corresponding Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, restricted stock units under a Company RSU
Award that have vested as of the Closing Date but have not yet been settled as
of such date shall be converted into the right to receive Parent Shares in
the manner set forth in _Section 2.1_.

  



  

(c) _Company Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall pass resolutions, provide any notices, obtain any consents, make
any amendments to the Company Equity Plans or Company Equity Awards, and take
such other actions as are necessary to provide for the treatment of the
Company Warrants and Company RSU Awards (collectively, the " _Company Equity
Awards_ ") as contemplated by this _Section 2.3_.

(d) _Plans and Awards Assumed by Parent_. At the Effective Time,
(i) Parent shall assume each outstanding Parent Warrant and Parent RSU Award,
and (ii) if Parent determines (following the Effective Time) that it desires
to do so, Parent may assume any or all of the Company Equity Plans, merge any
such Company Equity Plan into any equity incentive plan of Parent or adopt new
equity incentive plans of Parent. If Parent elects to so assume or merge any
Company Equity Plan, then, under such Company Equity Plan, Parent shall be
entitled to grant stock awards, to the extent permissible under applicable
Law, using the share reserves of such Company Equity Plan as of the Effective
Time, except that: (A) stock covered by such awards shall be Parent Shares;
(B) all references in such Company Equity Plan to a number of shares of
Company Common Stock shall be deemed amended to refer instead to a number of
Parent Shares determined by multiplying the number of referenced shares of
Company Common Stock by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting number
down to the nearest whole number of Parent Shares; and (C) the board of
directors of Parent or a committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and
responsibility of the board of directors of the Company or any committee
thereof with respect to the administration of such Company Equity Plan.

  



  

(e) _Parent Actions_. Parent shall take all corporate action
reasonably necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of
authorized but unissued Parent Shares for delivery upon exercise or
settlement of the Parent Warrants and Parent RSU Awards in accordance with
this _Section 2.3_.

  



  

Section 2.4 _Withholding_. The Company, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the
Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise
payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement, any amounts as are
required to be withheld or deducted with respect to such consideration under
the Code, or any applicable provisions of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely remitted to the appropriate
Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made. The Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be authorized to sell or
otherwise dispose of any Parent Shares otherwise payable to the Person as is
necessary to provide sufficient funds to enable it to comply with its
deduction or withholding obligation and such party shall notify the Person
thereof and remit any unapplied balance of the net proceeds of such sale to
such Person.

  



  

Section 2.5 _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip
representing fractional Parent Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a shareholder of Parent. The Exchange Agent, acting as agent for the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock otherwise entitled to receive a
fractional Parent Shares, will aggregate all fractional Parent Shares that
would otherwise have been required to be distributed and cause them to be
sold in the open market for the accounts of such holders. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common
Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled
to receive a fraction of a Parent Share shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash,
without interest, in an amount equal to the proceeds from such sale by the
Exchange Agent, if any, less any brokerage commissions or other fees, from the
sale of such fractional Parent Shares in accordance with such holder's
fractional interest in the aggregate number of Parent Shares sold.

procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company's management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley

financial information, and (ii) any known fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Company's internal controls. The Company has made available to Parent all

that such Company Competing Proposal would no longer constitute a Company
Superior Proposal, or (ii) under _Section 5.3(d)(ii)_ , the Company shall
provide Parent with five (5) business days' prior written notice advising
Parent it intends to effect a Company Change of Recommendation and

and conditions of this Agreement in a manner that would obviate the need to
effect a Company Change of Recommendation.

Approval or the Parent Shareholder Transaction Approval, any
information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent, should be set forth in an
amendment of, or a supplement to, any of the Form F-4, the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Parent Circular, so that any of such documents
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties, and
the Company and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with (x) the SEC
of any necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the

Company shall, through the Company Board of Directors, recommend to its
stockholders that they give the Company Stockholder Approval, include such
recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and solicit and use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, except in
each case to the extent that the Company Board of Directors shall have made a
Company Change of Recommendation as permitted by _Section 5.3_.

date for which the Company Special Meeting is scheduled, the Company has
not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Company
Common Stock to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a
quorum is present, the Company shall have the right to, and at the request of
Parent shall, make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of
the Company Special Meeting; _provided_ that the Company Special Meeting is
not postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than thirty (30) days after
the date for which the Company Special Meeting was originally
scheduled (other than any adjournments or postponements required by
applicable Law, including adjournments or postponements to the
extent reasonably necessary or advisable to ensure that any required
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is provided or made
available to the Company stockholders or to permit dissemination of
information which is material to stockholders voting at the Company Special
Meeting and to give the Company stockholders sufficient time to evaluate any
such supplement or amendment or other information). Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall be deemed to relieve the Company of its obligations to
submit this Agreement to its stockholders for a vote on the approval and
adoption thereof.

best efforts to cause the Parent Circular to be mailed to the shareholders of
Parent entitled to vote at the Parent Special Meeting and to hold the Parent
Special Meeting as soon as practicable after the Parent Circular is cleared by
the Toronto Stock Exchange. Parent shall, through the Parent Board of
Directors, recommend to its shareholders that they give the Parent
Shareholder Approvals, include such recommendation in the Parent Circular,
and solicit and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
Parent Shareholder Approvals, except in each case to the extent that the
Parent Board of Directors shall have made a Parent Change of Recommendation
as permitted by _Section 5.4_. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this _Section 5.5(d)_ , if, on a date for which the Parent Special Meeting is
scheduled, Parent has not received proxies representing a sufficient number
of Parent Shares to obtain the Parent Shareholder Transaction Approval,
whether or not a quorum is present, Parent shall have the right to, and at
the request of the Company shall, make one or more successive postponements or
adjournments of the Parent Special Meeting; _provided_ that the Parent
Special Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than
thirty (30) days after the date for which the Parent Special Meeting was
originally scheduled (other than any adjournments or postponements required
by applicable Law, including adjournments or postponements to the extent
reasonably necessary or advisable to ensure that any required supplement or
amendment to the Parent Circular is provided or made available to the Parent
Shareholders or to permit dissemination of information which is material to
shareholders voting at the Parent Special Meeting and to give the Parent
Shareholders sufficient time to evaluate any such supplement or amendment or
other information). Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to
relieve Parent of its obligation to submit the issuance of the Parent Shares
in the Merger to its shareholders for a vote on the approval thereof.

  



  

(e) The Company and Parent will use their respective reasonable best
efforts to hold the Company Special Meeting and the Parent Special Meeting on
the same date and as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement.

Subsidiaries, respectively, to afford to the other Party and to the
Representatives of such other Party reasonable access during normal business
hours and upon reasonable advance notice to all of their respective
properties, offices, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records (in
each case, whether in physical or electronic form) and, during such period,
each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of the Company
Subsidiaries and the Parent Subsidiaries, respectively, to,
furnish reasonably promptly to the other Party any and all information

required by this _Section 6.1_ to provide the other Party or the
Representatives of such other Party with access to or to disclose information
(A) that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third
party entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or entered into after
the date of this Agreement in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice ( _provided, however_ , that the withholding Party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the required consent of such third party to
such access or disclosure), (B) the disclosure of which would violate any Law
or duty ( _provided, however_ , that the withholding Party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to
permit reasonable disclosure not in violation of any Law or duty) or (C) that
is subject to any attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal
privilege ( _provided, however_ , that the withholding Party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure to the maximum
extent that does not result in a loss of any such attorney-client, attorney
work product or other legal privilege); _provided, however_ , that such
access and information shall be disclosed or granted, as applicable, to
external counsel for Parent and Company to the extent reasonably required for
the purpose of complying with applicable Antitrust Laws subject to prior
execution of a common interest or joint defense agreement in customary form.
Each of the Company and Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts
to minimize any disruption to the businesses of the other Party that may
result from the requests for access, data and information hereunder.

  



  

(b) Each of the Company and Parent will hold, and will cause its
Representatives and affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information,
including any information exchanged pursuant to this _Section 6.1_ , in

(c) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall
give prompt notice to the Company, (i) of any notice or other
communication received by such Party from any Governmental Entity in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger or other Transactions, or from any

could be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (ii)
of any legal proceeding commenced or, to any Party's knowledge, threatened
against, such Party or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates or otherwise
relating to, involving or affecting such Party or any of its Subsidiaries or

relating to the Merger or any other Transaction, and (iii) upon becoming
aware of the occurrence or impending occurrence of any event or circumstance
relating to it or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the Parent Subsidiaries,
respectively, which would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, as the case may be, or which would reasonably be expected to prevent
or materially delay or impede the consummation of the Transactions; _provided,
however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.1(c)_
shall not cure any breach of any representation or warranty requiring
disclosure of such matter prior to the date of this Agreement or otherwise
limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to any Party. The failure to
deliver any such notice shall not affect any of the conditions set forth in

sharing with the other Party to address reasonable attorney-client or other
privilege or confidentiality concerns, provided that a Party must provide
external legal counsel to the other Party with non-redacted versions of drafts

of competent jurisdiction has determined in a final, nonappealable judgment
such Indemnified Party is not ultimately entitled), judgments, fines, losses,

Merger or any of the other Transactions), whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time, in connection with such persons serving as
an officer, director or other fiduciary of the Company, Parent or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or of any Person if such service was at the
request or for the benefit of the Company, Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, to the fullest extent permitted by Law or provided pursuant
to the Company Governing Documents, the Parent Governing Documents or the
organizational documents of any of their respective Subsidiaries or any
indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this
Agreement. The Parties agree that all rights to elimination of liability,
indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring or
alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted
or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, now existing in favor of
the Indemnified Parties as provided in their respective certificate of

Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the provisions in (a) the
Company Governing Documents and the organizational documents of any Company
Subsidiary and (b) any other agreements of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries with any Indemnified Party, and (ii) Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect in (a) the Parent Governing Documents and
the organizational documents of any Parent Subsidiary and (b) any other
agreements of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries with any Indemnified Party,
in each case, regarding elimination of liability, indemnification of directors

in any manner that would adversely affect the rights or protections
thereunder of any such Indemnified Party in respect of acts or
omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective
Time (including acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval
of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger or any of the other
Transactions). Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for
an aggregate period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time,
the Company's current directors and officers an insurance and indemnification
policy that provides coverage for events occurring prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Company D andO Insurance_") that is no less favorable

favorable is unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided, however_ ,
that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium
for the DandO Insurance in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the last
annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement; _provided, further_ ,
that the Company may prior to the Effective Time substitute therefor a single
premium tail coverage with respect to DandO Insurance with an annual cost not
in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid
prior to the date of this Agreement. Parent shall also provide, for an
aggregate period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time,
Parent's directors and officers as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events
prior to the Effective Time (" _Parent D andO Insurance_") that is no less

less favorable is unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided,

Person may seek indemnification pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ , the
provisions of this _Section 6.4_ shall continue in effect with respect to
such matter until the final disposition of all claims, actions,
investigations, suits and proceedings relating thereto. In the event Parent
or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.4_. The
rights and obligations under this _Section 6.4_ shall survive consummation of
the Merger and shall not be terminated or amended in a manner that is adverse
to any Indemnified Party without the written consent of such Indemnified
Party. The provisions of this _Section 6.4_ are intended to be for
the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or
her heirs and his or her legal representatives.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall assume and honor

affiliates providing benefits to any current or former employee of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective affiliates (collectively, the "
_Continuing Employees_ ") after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), and
subject to Applicable Law, each Continuing Employee shall be credited with his
or her years of service with Parent or the Company or any of their respective
affiliates, as the case may be, before the Effective Time, to the same
extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time,
to credit for such service under any similar Parent Benefit Plans or Company
Benefit Plans, as applicable, except to the extent such credit would result in
a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, and subject to any Applicable Law: (i) each Continuing
Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting
time, in any and all New Plans which are welfare benefit plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Parent
Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Plan, as applicable, in which such Continuing
Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans,
collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to
any Continuing Employee, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of
such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of
the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Continuing Employee's
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and
his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts
had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

  



  

(b) This  _Section 6.7_ shall inure solely to the benefit of the
Parties, and nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any
Continuing Employee any right to continue in the employ or service of Parent,
the Company or any of their respective affiliates, or shall interfere with or
restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective affiliates, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to
discharge or terminate the services of any Continuing Employee at any time for
any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. Notwithstanding any provision
in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this _Section 6.7_ shall (i) be
deemed or construed to be an amendment or other modification of any Parent
Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Plan, or (ii) create any third party rights
in any current or former service provider of Parent, the Company or their
affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

the other Party prompt notice of any litigation brought by any stockholder or
shareholder of that Party, as applicable, against such Party, any of its

this Agreement or any of the Transactions. Unless (i) in the case of such
litigation with respect to the Company, the Company Board of Directors has
made or is considering making a Company Change of Recommendation or (ii) in
the case of such litigation with respect to Parent, the Parent Board of
Directors has made or is considering making a Parent Change of Recommendation,
each Party shall give the other Party the opportunity to participate (at such
other Party's expense) in the defense or settlement of any such litigation,
and no such settlement shall be agreed to without the other Party's prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
except that the other Party shall not be obligated to consent to any
settlement which does not include a full release of such other Party and its
affiliates or which imposes an injunction or other equitable relief after the
Effective Time upon Parent or any of its affiliates. In the event of, and to
the extent of, any conflict or overlap between the provisions of this
_Section 6.9_ and _Section 5.1_ , _Section 5.2_ or _Section 6.2_ , the
provisions of this _Section 6.9_ shall control.

reasonable best efforts to cause the Parent Shares to be issued in the Merger
to be approved for listing on the Exchanges, subject to official notice of

(b) by either Parent or the Company, prior to the Effective Time, if
there has been a breach by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger
Sub, on the other hand, of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement

Sub or the Company, except that the Confidentiality Agreements, this _Section
8.2_ and _Section 9.3_ through _Section 9.13_ shall survive such
termination;  _provided, however_ , that nothing herein shall relieve any
Party from liability for fraud or a Willful Breach of its

, concurrently with, and as a condition to, such termination, Parent shall

the event no Termination Fee subsequently becomes payable in accordance with
the terms of this _Section 8.2_ ) is paid to a Party in accordance with this
_Section 8.2_ , the payment of such Termination Fee or Expense Reimbursement
Amount shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of such Party, its
Subsidiaries, officers, directors, partners, shareholders, managers, member,
Affiliates, agents and representatives against the other Party or any of its
Subsidiaries, officers, directors, partners, shareholders, managers, member,
Affiliates, agents and representatives for, and (ii) in no event will the

holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or
other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document. Except as otherwise expressly specified, all references to currency

Section 9.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed
manually or by facsimile by the Parties, in any number of counterparts, each
of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when a counterpart hereof shall have been signed by each of the
Parties and delivered to the other Parties.

  



  

Section 9.9 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries._

  



  

(a) This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter and the
Parent Disclosure Letter) and the Confidentiality Agreements constitute the
entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof and supersede all other prior agreements (except that the
Confidentiality Agreements shall be deemed amended hereby so that until the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1_ , the Parties
shall be permitted to take the actions contemplated by this Agreement) and
understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties or any of them with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

  



  

(b) Except as provided in _Section 6.4_ , no provision of this
Agreement (including _Section 8.2(a)_ and including the Company Disclosure
Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter) or the Confidentiality Agreements is
intended to confer upon any Person other than the Parties any rights or
remedies hereunder; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section 9.9(b)_
shall limit the right of the Company to seek damages as contemplated by
_Section 8.2(a)_. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are
the product of negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of
the Parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the Parties in accordance with _Section 9.1_ without
notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the Parties of risks associated with particular matters regardless of
the knowledge of any of the Parties. Consequently, Persons other than the
Parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this
Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date
of this Agreement or as of any other date.

Section 9.10 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Merger is not affected in any manner adverse to any Party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the Merger
is fulfilled to the extent possible.

  



  

Section 9.11 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction._

  



  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
conflicts of laws principles that would result in the application of the Law
of any other jurisdiction.

  



  

(b) Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and
only if) such court finds it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Federal
court of the United States of America sitting in Delaware, and appellate
courts thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or enforcement
of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the Parties hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such action or
proceeding except in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if
(and only if) such court finds it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the
Federal court of the United States of America sitting in Delaware, and
appellate courts thereof, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such
action or proceeding may be heard and determined in the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court finds it lacks subject
matter jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of America
sitting in Delaware, and appellate courts thereof, (iii) waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may
now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding
in such courts and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in such courts. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that a final
judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by Law. Each Party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to
service of process inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the
courts referred to in this _Section 9.11(a)_ in the manner provided for
notices in _Section 9.4_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of
any Party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted
by Law.

Section 9.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH
OR THE MERGER, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF
SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.12_.

  



  

Section 9.13 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by
any of the Parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the
prior written consent of the other Parties. Subject to the preceding
sentence, but without relieving any Party of any obligation hereunder,
this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

  



  

Section 9.14 _Specific Enforcement._

  



  

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable injury will occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement is not performed
in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached. It is agreed
that prior to the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article
VIII_ , each Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent or remedy any breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by
any other Party, to a decree or order of specific performance specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement and to any further
equitable relief.

  



  

(b) The Parties' rights in this _Section 9.14_ are an integral part
of the Transactions and each Party hereby waives any objections to any remedy
referred to in this _Section 9.14_ (including any objection on the basis that
there is an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of such remedy is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity). For the avoidance of
doubt, each Party agrees that there is not an adequate remedy at Law for a
breach of this Agreement by any Party. In the event any Party seeks any
remedy referred to in this _Section 9.14_ , such Party shall not be required
to obtain, furnish, post or provide any bond or other security in connection
with or as a condition to obtaining any such remedy.
