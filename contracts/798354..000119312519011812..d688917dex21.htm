WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants,
representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

 

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), at
the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company. The
Company shall be the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, and shall continue
its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Delaware as a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall terminate.

 

1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m., New
York City time, at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street,
New York, NY 10004, on a date which shall be no later than four (4) business
days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable Law) of the
latest to occur of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ hereof (other
than those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof), unless another
date, time or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. The
date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Closing Date_."

 

1.3 _The Effective Time_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, on the Closing Date, Parent shall cause to be filed a certificate
of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Secretary_ "). The Merger shall become
effective as of the date and time specified in the Certificate of Merger
(such date and time, the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

1.5 _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of any of the following securities:

 

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(d)_, each share of the Class A common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Company Class_ __ _ A Common
Stock_") and each share of the Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Company Class_ __ _ B Common Stock_" and, together
with the Company Class A Common Stock, the " _Company Common Stock_
"), except for shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Company as
treasury stock or otherwise owned by the Company, Parent or any of their
respective direct or indirect Subsidiaries (in each case, other than shares of
Company Common Stock held in any Company Benefit Plans or otherwise held on
behalf of a third party (collectively, the " _Exception Shares_ ")),
Dissenting Shares (to the extent provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.3_) or Company
Restricted Shares (which shall be treated in accordance with _Section_ __ _
1.8(b)_), shall be converted, in accordance with the procedures set forth in
this Agreement, into the right to receive, without interest, 0.303 of a share
(the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Parent (the " _Parent Common Stock_ ") (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 



-2- 

    

(b) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article I_ shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist
as of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, an " _Old Certificate_
," it being understood that any reference herein to "Old Certificate" shall be
deemed to include reference to book-entry account statements relating to the
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock) previously representing any such
shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) cash in lieu of a fractional
share which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Old
Certificate have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 1.5_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.2(d)_, without any interest
thereon. Old Certificates previously representing shares of Company Common
Stock shall be exchanged for certificates or, at Parents option, evidence of
shares in book entry form (collectively referred to herein as " _New
Certificates_ "), representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock as set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 1.5(a)_ and cash in lieu of fractional shares upon
the surrender of such Old Certificates in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.2_, without any interest thereon. If, between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or
Company Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or
exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities, in any such
case as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar change in
capitalization, or there shall be any extraordinary dividend or distribution,
an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Merger
Consideration to give holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect
as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ that
nothing in this sentence shall be construed to permit Parent or the Company
to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the
terms of this Agreement.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the
Company, Parent or any of their respective direct or indirect Subsidiaries (in
each case, other than the Exception Shares) immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and neither the Merger
Consideration nor any other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

1.6 _Parent Common Stock_. At and after the Effective Time, each share of
Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be affected by the
Merger.

 

1.7 _Merger Sub Common Stock_. At and after the Effective Time, each share
of common stock of Merger Sub, par value $0.01 per share, issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.

 

1.8 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_. Notwithstanding anything in
_Section_ __ _ 1.8(a)_ through _Section_ __ _ 1.8(c)_ to the contrary, but
subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.2_, (i) to the extent the terms of any Company
Equity Award granted on or after the date of this Agreement and not 

 



-3- 

    

 in violation of this Agreement expressly provide for treatment in connection
with the occurrence of the Effective Time that is different from the treatment
prescribed by this  _Section_ __ _ 1.8_, or (ii) as mutually agreed by the
parties hereto and a holder of any Company Equity Award, then, in each case,
the terms of such Company Equity Award shall control (and the applicable
provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 1.8_ shall not apply).

(a) _Treatment of Company Stock Options_. Immediately after the Effective
Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (a "
_Company Stock Option_ ") granted under the Company 2015 Omnibus Incentive
Plan and the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan for Key Employees of the Company and
its affiliates (collectively, the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), whether vested
or unvested, shall, automatically and without any required action on the part
of the holder thereof, cease to represent an option to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock and shall be converted into an option to purchase a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock (such option, a " _Converted Stock
Option_ ") equal to the product (with the result rounded down to the
nearest whole number) of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
and (ii) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock of such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time _divided by_ (B) the Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
exercise price and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable
pursuant to the Converted Stock Option shall be determined in a manner
consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. Except as
specifically provided above, following the Effective Time, each Converted
Stock Option shall continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions
(including vesting (and acceleration thereof upon the Closing, to the extent
provided therein), forfeiture and exercisability terms) as were applicable to
the corresponding Company Stock Option at the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (1) to the extent that any Company Stock Option that is
subject to vesting solely upon achievement of a target price per share of
Company Common Stock (such price, the " _Target Price_ " and such Company
Stock Option, a " _Target Price Option_ ")) would, by its terms, expire as of
the Effective Time, such Target Price Option shall be amended such that it
will not expire upon the Effective Time and shall instead become a Converted
Stock Option, and remain eligible to vest upon satisfaction of the applicable
Target Price, as adjusted to equal the initial Target Price divided by
the Exchange Ratio (the " _Adjusted Target Price_ "), (2) all Converted Stock
Options held by a Company Employee (other than any Converted Stock Option with
an Adjusted Target Price) shall vest in their entirety to the extent such
Company Employee undergoes a Covered Termination and (3) all Converted Stock
Options with an Adjusted Target Price held by a Company Employee shall be
cancelled for no consideration or payment to the extent such Company Employee
undergoes any termination of employment (including a Covered Termination) and
at the time of such termination, the Adjusted Target Price is not achieved.
For purposes hereof, a " _Covered Termination_ " means, with respect to a
Company Employee, (A) an involuntary termination of such Company Employees
employment initiated by the Company that would result in the payment of
severance benefits under the applicable Company Benefit Plan under which such
Company Employee is eligible for severance benefits or (B) such Company
Employee resigns from employment as a result of a material diminution in (I)
the duties or responsibilities of such Company Employee as of the date of this
Agreement, or (II) the base salary or annual incentive compensation
opportunity afforded to such Company Employee as of the date of this
Agreement, in each case, to the extent that such termination or resignation
occurs on or following the date of this Agreement and on or prior to 

 



-4- 

    

 the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided_ that, in the
case of a Company Employee resigning under clause (B) above, (x) the Company
Employee shall provide the Surviving Corporation with written notice
specifying the circumstances alleged to constitute the applicable material
diminution within sixty (60) days following the first (1st) occurrence of such
circumstances, (y) the Surviving Corporation shall have thirty (30) days
following receipt of such notice to cure such circumstances and (z) if the
Surviving Corporation has not cured such circumstances within such thirty
(30)-day period, the Company Employee shall terminate his or her employment
not later than thirty (30) days after the end of such thirty (30) day period;
_provided_ _further_ that any such resignation under clause (B) above
shall constitute a Covered Termination with respect to a Company Employee who
is not a Covered Company Employee solely if so determined by the Company CEO
(subject to his continued employment with the Company, or, following the
Closing, with Parent, through such date).

(b) _Treatment of Company Restricted Shares_. Immediately after the
Effective Time, each outstanding restricted share award granted under the
Company Stock Plans (a " _Company Restricted Share_ ") shall, automatically
and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to
represent a restricted share of Company Class A Common Stock and shall be
converted into a number of restricted shares of Parent Common Stock (each, a "
_Converted Restricted Share_ ") equal to the product (with the result rounded
down to the nearest whole number) of (i) the number of Company Restricted
Shares subject to such award _multiplied by_ (ii) the Exchange Ratio. Except
as specifically provided above, following the Effective Time, each such
Converted Restricted Share shall continue to be governed by the same terms
and conditions (including vesting (and acceleration thereof upon the Closing,
to the extent provided therein) and forfeiture terms) as were applicable to
the corresponding Company Restricted Share at the Effective Time; _provided_
, _however_ , that (A) to the extent that any Company Restricted Share that is
subject to vesting solely upon achievement of a Target Price (a " _Target
Price Restricted Share_ ") would, by its terms, expire as of the Effective
Time, such Target Price Restricted Share shall be amended such that it will
not expire upon the Effective Time and shall instead become a Converted
Restricted Share, and remain eligible to vest upon satisfaction of the
applicable Adjusted Target Price, and (B) all Converted Restricted Shares held
by a Company Employee (other than any Converted Restricted Share with an
Adjusted Target Price) shall vest in their entirety to the extent such
Company Employee undergoes a Covered Termination and (C) all Converted
Restricted Shares with an Adjusted Target Price held by a Company Employee
shall be cancelled for no consideration or payment to the extent such Company
Employee undergoes any termination of employment (including a Covered
Termination) and at the time of such termination, the Adjusted Target Price is
not achieved.

 

(c) _Treatment of Company RSUs_. Immediately after the Effective Time,
each outstanding restricted stock unit granted under the Company Stock Plans
(a " _Company RSU_ "), shall, automatically and without any required action on
the part of the holder thereof, cease to represent a restricted stock unit
denominated in shares of Company Class A Common Stock and shall be converted
into a restricted stock unit denominated in shares of Parent Common Stock (a "
_Converted Parent RSU_ "). The number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject
to each such Converted Parent RSU shall equal to the product (with the result
rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (i) the number of shares of
Company Class A Common Stock subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to
the Effective Time _multiplied by_ (ii) the Exchange Ratio. Except as
specifically provided above, following the Effective Time, each such

 



-5- 

    

 Converted Parent RSU shall continue to be governed by the same terms and
conditions (including vesting (and acceleration thereof upon the Closing, to
the extent provided therein), forfeiture and settlement terms) as were
applicable to the corresponding Company RSU at the Effective Time; _provided_
, _however_ , that (A) to the extent that any Company RSU that is subject to
vesting solely upon achievement of a Target Price (a " _Target Price RSU_ ")
would, by its terms, expire as of the Effective Time, such Target Price RSU
shall be amended such that it will not expire upon the Effective Time and
instead shall become a Converted Parent RSU, and remain eligible to vest upon
satisfaction of the applicable Adjusted Target Price, (B) all Converted Parent
RSUs held by a Company Employee (other than any Converted Parent RSUs with an
Adjusted Target Price) shall vest in their entirety to the extent such
Company Employee undergoes a Covered Termination and (C) all Converted Parent
RSUs with an Adjusted Target Price held by a Company Employee shall be
cancelled for no consideration or payment to the extent such Company Employee
undergoes any termination of employment (including a Covered Termination) and
at the time of such termination, the Adjusted Target Price is not achieved.

 

(d) _Treatment of Company_ _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. As soon as
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement and in any event
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions (including
obtaining any necessary determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board
or a committee thereof and, if appropriate, amending the terms of the
Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _Company ESPP_ ")) that may be
necessary or required under the Company ESPP and applicable Laws to ensure
that (i) except for the offering period under the Company ESPP that commenced
on January 1, 2019 (the " _Final Offering_ "), no offering period shall be
authorized or commenced on or after the date of this Agreement, (ii) the
Company shall not take any action to reduce the applicable purchase price for
a share of Company Class A Common Stock under the Company ESPP after the date
of this Agreement, (iii) if the Closing shall occur prior to the end of the
Final Offering, the Final Offering shall end on the Closing Date, (iv) each
participants accumulated contributions under the Company ESPP shall be used
to purchase shares of Company Class A Common Stock in accordance with the
Company ESPP as of the end of the Final Offering, (v) participants in the
Company ESPP are not permitted to increase deductions under the Company ESPP
after the date of this Agreement and no new participants may begin
participation in the Company ESPP after the date of this Agreement, and (vi)
the Company ESPP shall terminate in its entirety at the Effective Time and no
further rights shall be granted or exercised under the Company ESPP
thereafter.

 

(e) _Company Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Company Board and the compensation committee of the Company Board (the "
_Company Compensation Committee_ "), as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to (i) effectuate the
treatment of the Company Stock Options, the Company Restricted Shares and the
Company RSUs pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.8(a)_ through _1.8(c)_ and (ii)
provide for the deduction, withholding and remittance of any amounts required
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(f)_. The Company shall take all actions
necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, neither Parent
nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver shares of Company
Common Stock or other capital stock of the Company to any person pursuant to
or in settlement of the Company Equity Awards.

for the treatment of the Company Stock Options, the Company Restricted Shares

2.1 _Parent to Make Shares Available_. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust
company designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Old Certificates, for
exchange in accordance with this  _Article II_ , (a) New Certificates to be
issued pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.5_ and exchanged pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 2.2(a)_ in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and (b)
cash in an amount sufficient to pay cash in lieu of any fractional shares
(such New Certificates and cash described in the foregoing _clauses (a)_ and
_(b)_ being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange
Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by
Parent; _provided_ that no such investment (or losses thereon) shall affect
the amount of Merger Consideration payable to the holders of
Old Certificates. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Parent, and Parent shall be treated for U.S.
federal, state and local income Tax purposes as the owner of any such cash and
shall be subject to such Tax on all interest and other income resulting from
such investments.

 



-7- 

    

2.2 _Exchange of Shares_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event
later than five (5) business days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to each holder of record of one (1) or more Old Certificates
representing shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective
Time that have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Article I_ , a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Old Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Old Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by
Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting of a bond in a reasonable and
customary amount as indemnity pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(g)_) to the
Exchange Agent and which shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent
and the Company) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Old Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by
Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting of a bond in a reasonable and
customary amount as indemnity pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(g)_) in exchange
for certificates representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares which the shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall
have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Agreement. From
and after the Effective Time, upon proper surrender of an Old Certificate or
Old Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder
of such Old Certificate or Old Certificates, shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a New Certificate representing that
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder of Company
Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of 
_Article I_ and (ii) a check representing the amount of any cash in lieu of a
fractional share which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the
Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of
this  _Article II_ , and the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued
on any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable to holders of Old
Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_,
each Old Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the Merger Consideration
and any cash in lieu of fractional shares.

(b) If any New Certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to
be issued in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall
be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an
appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer,
and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent
in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of
the issuance of a New Certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock
in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Old Certificate or
Old Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable.

(c) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Old 

 



-8- 

    

 Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the
Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares, as provided in this
_Article II_.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
New Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Old Certificates, and
such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or
to any other rights of a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of
any such fractional share, Parent shall pay to each former stockholder of the
Company who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an
amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by _multiplying_ (i)
the volume-weighted average price per share of Parent Common Stock on the
NASDAQ Stock Market (the " _NASDAQ_ ") as such daily volume-weighted average
price per share is reported by Bloomberg L.P. (or, if such information is no
longer reported by Bloomberg L.P., as reported by a comparable internationally
recognized source mutually determined by Parent and the Company) calculated
for the five (5) consecutive trading days immediately preceding (but not
including) the Closing Date _by_ (ii) the fraction of a share (with the result
rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent
Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.5_.

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of the Company for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former stockholders of the Company who
have not theretofore exchanged their Old Certificates pursuant to this
_Article II_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of any fractional shares,
in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the
Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of
shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws.

(f) Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or any other
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the appropriate
governmental authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which the
deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

(g) In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in
such amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Old
Certificate, the Exchange

 



-9- 

    

 Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old
Certificate the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

2.3 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
shares of Company Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly exercised
appraisal rights in respect of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL (such shares being referred to collectively as the " _Dissenting
Shares_ " until such time as such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or
otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights under applicable Law with
respect to such shares) shall not be converted into a right to receive the
Merger Consideration, but instead shall be entitled to payment of such
consideration as may be determined to be due in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, after the Effective Time,
such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holders
right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, or if a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the
relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares of Company Class B
Common Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 1.5_ upon surrender of such shares of
Company Class B Common Stock.

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received
by the Company for appraisal, of any withdrawals of such demands and of any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company
relating to Section 262 of the DGCL, and Parent shall direct, in consultation
with the Company, all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands; _provided_ that the Company shall not be required to make any payment
to holders of Dissenting Shares (i) that is not conditioned upon the
occurrence of the Effective Time and (ii) unless such payment is made only
after the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect
to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand,
or agree to any such appraisal demands.

character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. As used
in this Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect
to Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, a
material adverse effect on the business, properties, assets, results of
operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole ( _provided_ ,  _however_ , that none of the following, either
individually or in the aggregate, shall be deemed to constitute or be taken
into account when determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred:
(i) changes, after the date hereof, in U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (" _GAAP_ "), (ii) changes, after the date hereof, in Laws of
general applicability, or interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental
Entities, (iii) changes, after the date hereof, in global, national or
regional political conditions (including acts of war (whether or not
declared), civil disobedience, hostilities, terrorism, military actions or the
escalation or worsening of any of the foregoing) or in economic conditions
or financial markets (including securities, capital, equity, credit and debt
markets) conditions in the United States or elsewhere in the world, (iv) a
decline, in and of itself, in the trading price or trading volume of a partys
common stock, a credit ratings downgrade or change in ratings outlook, in and
of itself, for a party or any of its Subsidiaries or the failure, in and of
itself, to meet analyst earnings projections, earnings guidance or internal
financial forecasts, but, in each case, not including the underlying causes
thereof, (v) except for purposes of _Section_ __ _ 3.3_, changes, after the
date hereof, arising out of, or resulting from, the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, or public disclosure of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, public disclosure or consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby (including any effect on a partys relationships with its customers,
suppliers, licensors, landlords, joint venture partners, unions or employees)
or actions expressly required by this Agreement in contemplation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, (vi) changes or developments in the
financial services industry generally, (vii) any Action arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (viii) any
changes or developments resulting from any hurricane, flood, tornado,
earthquake or other weather or natural disaster, or (ix) actions or omissions
taken pursuant to the written consent of Parent, in the case of the Company,
or the Company, in the case of Parent; except, with respect to _subclauses
(i)_ , _(ii)_ , _(iii)_ , _ (vi)_ or _(viii)_ , to the extent that the
effects of such change are materially disproportionately adverse to the
business, properties, assets, results of operations or financial condition of
such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other
companies in the industry in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate).
As used in this Agreement, the

 



-11- 

    

 word " _Subsidiary_ ," when used with respect to any party, means any
corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other organization,
whether incorporated or unincorporated, of which at least a majority of the
securities or ownership interests having by their terms ordinary voting power
to elect a majority of the board of directors or other persons performing
similar functions is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by such party
or by one or more of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ that, with respect to the
Subsidiaries set forth in Section 3.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
(the " _Company JVs_ " and, each, a " _Company JV_ "), each of the covenants,
obligations and agreements set forth in this Agreement shall apply to the
Company JVs only to the extent that the Company has the power to control such
action or forbearance by any such Company JV (including the power to prevent
the Company from taking any action). As used in this Agreement, " _Specified
Company Subsidiary_ " means any Subsidiary of the Company other than a Company
JV. True, correct and complete copies of the Ninth Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended to the date hereof
(the " _Company Charter_ "), and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the

Agreement, have previously been made available by the Company to Parent.

 

(b) Each Subsidiary of the Company (a " _Company Subsidiary_ ") (i) is duly

material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) is duly
qualified to do business and, where such concept is recognized under
applicable Law, in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state,
local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of property or the
conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in which the
failure to be so qualified would reasonably be likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company,
and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted, except
where the failure to have such power and authority, would not reasonably be
likely to be, either individually or in the aggregate, material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(c) Section 3.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true
and complete list of all Subsidiaries of the Company as of the date hereof.

3.3 _Authority; No Violation_.

 

(a) The Company has full corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and, subject to the adoption of this Agreement by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Company Class A Common Stock and Company Class B Common Stock, voting together
as one class, by written consent of the stockholders of the Company in lieu
of a meeting or at a meeting (collectively, the " _Requisite Company Vote_ "),
to consummate the Merger. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger have been duly and validly approved by the Company
Board. The Company Board has approved and declared advisable this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and determined
that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, are in the
best interests of the Company and its stockholders and has directed that this

purposes of Article X of the Company Charter, Parent becoming an "interested
stockholder" within the meaning of such Article X by virtue of the execution,
delivery and performance of the Voting and Support Agreement, such that, as of

the Company Charter (including any successor thereto) will not be applicable
to Parent or any "business combination" within the meaning of Article X of the
Company Charter that may take place in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting and Support Agreement,
including the Merger. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by the Company and (assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by each of Parent and Merger Sub) constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms (except in all cases as such enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium,
reorganization or similar Laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting the rights of creditors generally and subject to general principles
of equity (the " _Enforceability Exceptions_ ")).

party, or by which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be
bound, except (in the case of _clause (ii)_ above) for such violations,

state, any foreign entity, or any Regulatory Agency, and have paid all fees
and assessments due and payable in connection therewith, except where the
failure to file such report, registration or statement or to pay such fees and
assessments, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. As of their
respective dates (and without giving effect to any amendments or modifications
filed after the date of this Agreement with respect to reports and documents
filed before the date of this Agreement), each of such reports and documents,
including the financial statements, exhibits and schedules thereto, complied
with all of the statutes, rules and regulations enforced or promulgated by the
Regulatory Agency with which they were filed, except where such failure to be
in compliance would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Except for
examinations of the Company and its Subsidiaries conducted by a Regulatory
Agency in the ordinary course of business, (A) no Regulatory Agency has
initiated or has pending any proceeding or, to the knowledge of the Company,
investigation into the business or operations of the Company or any of its

Material Adverse Effect on the Company. There is no unresolved violation,
criticism, or exception by any Regulatory Agency with respect to any report or
statement relating to any examinations or inspections of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, which would reasonably be likely to have, either

prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or

available. No such Company Report, at the time filed, furnished or
communicated (and, in the case of registration statements and
proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates of the relevant
meetings, respectively), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in
which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed or
furnished as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) shall be
deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. As of their respective

filing with the SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP

as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. To the extent any of
the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries are required to be
maintained in accordance with GAAP, such books and records have been, since
January 1, 2017, and are being, maintained in all material respects in
accordance with GAAP. Prior to the date hereof, Ernst and Young LLP has not

Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature whatsoever
(whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to
become due) required by GAAP to be included in the consolidated balance sheet

against on the consolidated balance sheet of the Company included in its
Quarterly

 



-17- 

    

 Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2018
(including any notes thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice since September 30, 2018, or
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
None of the Company or any of the Specified Company Subsidiaries, or, to the
knowledge of the Company, any Company JV, is a party to any material "off-
balance sheet arrangements" as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K.

 

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of the Company and
its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means

computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of the Company or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-
direct control that would not reasonably be likely to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. The Company (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information relating to the Company, including its Subsidiaries, is
made known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of
the Company by others within those entities as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosures and to make the
certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date hereof, to the Companys outside auditor and the
audit committee of the Company Board (A) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act)
relating to the period covered by such evaluation which are reasonably likely
to adversely affect in any material respect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information, and (B) to the knowledge
of the Company, any fraud, whether or not material, relating to the period
covered by such evaluation that involves management or other employees who
have a significant role in the Companys internal controls over financial
reporting. These disclosures, if any, were made by management to the Companys
auditor and audit committee and a copy of any such written disclosure has been
previously made available to Parent. To the knowledge of the Company, there
is no reason to believe that the Companys outside auditor and its chief
executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

 

(d) Since January 1, 2016, (i) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any director, officer,
auditor, accountant or representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any
complaint, allegation or claim, whether written or, to the knowledge of
the Company, oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices,
procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to loan loss
reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls that is
material to the Company, including any complaint, allegation or claim, whether
written or oral, that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in
questionable accounting or auditing practices that is material to the
Company, and (ii) no attorney representing the Company or any of its

 violation by the Company or any of its officers, directors, employees or
agents to the Company Board or any committee thereof or, to the knowledge of
the Company, to any director or officer of the Company, pursuant to Section
307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, in each case of the foregoing _clauses (i)_

Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

nor any of their respective officers or directors has employed any broker,

commissions or finders fees in connection with the Merger or related
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner and Smith Incorporated and Evercore Group L.L.C., each pursuant to a
letter agreement, true, correct and complete copies of which have been
previously provided to Parent.

3.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 

(a) Since December 31, 2017, no event or events have occurred that have had
or would reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

as set forth in Sections 3.8(b), 5.1 and 5.2 of the Company Disclosure

date hereof) and in connection with matters related to this Agreement, the
Company and its Subsidiaries have carried on their respective businesses in
all material respects in the ordinary course of business, and from such
date until the date hereof, there has not been any action taken or committed
to be taken by the Company or any of the Specified Company Subsidiaries, or,
to the knowledge of the Company, any Company JV, which, if taken following
entry by the Company into this Agreement, would have required the consent of
Parent pursuant to _Sections 5.2(m)_ or _5.2(o)_ __ (only with respect to
making, changing or revocation of any material Tax election).

 

3.9 _Legal Proceedings_.

 

(a) Section 3.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all pending
and, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, legal, administrative,
arbitral or other Actions, as of the date hereof, with an amount in

executive officers (in their capacity as such). Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to the

jurisdiction that the jurisdiction believes that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries was required to file any Tax Return that was not filed. The

credits, built-in losses or other tax attributes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries are subject to any limitations, reductions or diminutions in
value as a result of Sections 382, 383, 384 or the Treasury Regulations

there are no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened claims
(other than routine claims for benefits) or proceedings by a Governmental

 affect the qualification or tax exemption of any such Company Benefit Plan.
Neither the Company nor any of the Specified Company Subsidiaries, nor, to the
knowledge of the Company, any Company JV, has engaged in a transaction in
connection with which the Company or any of the Specified Company
Subsidiaries, or, to the knowledge of the Company, any Company JV, reasonably

Code.

(e) No Controlled Group Liability has been incurred by the Company or any

plan that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not
under common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a "
_Multiple Employer Plan_ "), and none of the Company or its Subsidiaries nor
any Company ERISA Affiliate has incurred any material liability to a

partial withdrawal (as those terms are defined in Part I of Subtitle E of
Title IV of ERISA) from a Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan that
has not been satisfied in full.

(g) Except as required by applicable Law, no Company Benefit Plan provides
retiree or post-employment medical, disability, life insurance or other
welfare benefits to any person, and none of the Company or any of the
Specified Company Subsidiaries has any obligation to provide such
benefits (excluding any Company Benefit Plan that provides for employer
payment or subsidy of COBRA premiums). To the extent that the Company or any
of the Specified Company Subsidiaries sponsors such plans, the Company or the
applicable Specified Company Subsidiary has reserved the right to amend,
terminate or modify at any time each Company Benefit Plan that provides
retiree or post-employment disability, life insurance or other welfare
benefits to any person.

 

(h) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby could, either alone or
in conjunction with any other event, (i) entitle any current or former
employee, director, officer or independent contractor of the Company or any of
the Specified Company Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Company Employees_
") to severance pay or any material increase in severance pay, (ii) accelerate

 Benefit Plan, (iv) otherwise give rise to any material liability under any
Company Benefit Plan, or (v) limit or restrict the right to amend any Company
Benefit Plan on or following the Effective Time.

(i) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement could, either
alone or in combination with another event, result in the payment of any
amount that could, individually or in combination with any other such payment,
constitute an "excess parachute payment" as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of
the Code.

(j) Neither the Company nor any of the Specified Company Subsidiaries has
any obligation to provide, and no Company Benefit Plan or other agreement
provides any individual with the right to, a gross-up, indemnification,
reimbursement or other payment for any excise or additional taxes, interest
or penalties incurred pursuant to Section 409A or Section 4999 of the Code.

 

(k) Except as would not be reasonably likely to have, either individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, all Non-U.S.
Company Benefit Plans comply with applicable local Law, and all such plans
that are intended to be funded and/or book-reserved are funded and/or book
reserved, as appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions. As of
the date hereof, there is no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened litigation relating to any Non-U.S. Company Benefit Plan which
litigation is material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(l) Section 3.11(l) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth an
accurate and complete list as of the date hereof of any collective bargaining
agreement or other agreement with a labor union, works council or like

Agreements_ "), and, as of the date hereof, to the knowledge of the Company,
there are no material activities or proceedings by any individual or group of
individuals, including representatives of any labor organizations or labor
unions, to organize any employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement, stockholder or other approval of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, either alone or in combination with another event, will not entitle
any third party (including any labor organization or Governmental Entity) to
any payments under any of the Company Labor Agreements, except as would not
reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company and its Subsidiaries are
in compliance with their obligations pursuant to all notification and
bargaining obligations arising under any Company Labor Agreements, except as
would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

 

(m) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all
applicable Laws respecting labor, employment and employment practices, terms
and conditions of employment, discrimination, harassment, wages and hours, and
occupational safety and health, except where the failure to be so compliant

aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that they were required
to file (or furnish, as applicable) since January 1, 2016 with any Regulatory
Agencies, including any report, registration or statement required to be
filed (or furnished, as applicable) pursuant to the Laws of the United States,
any state, any foreign entity, or any Regulatory Agency, and have paid all
fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith, except where
the failure to file such report, registration or statement or to pay such
fees and assessments, either individually or in the aggregate, would not

 



-37- 

    

 reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. As of
their respective dates (and without giving effect to any amendments or
modifications filed after the date of this Agreement with respect to reports
and documents filed before the date of this Agreement), each of such reports
and documents, including the financial statements, exhibits and schedules
thereto, complied with all of the statutes, rules and regulations enforced or
promulgated by the Regulatory Agency with which they were filed, except where
such failure to be in compliance would not, either individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.
Except for examinations of Parent and its Subsidiaries conducted by a
Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of business, (A) no Regulatory Agency
has initiated or has pending any proceeding or, to the knowledge of Parent,
investigation into the business or operations of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries since January 1, 2016 and (B) Parent has not received written
notice of any inquiry by, or has had any disagreement or dispute with, any
Regulatory Agency with respect to the business, operations, policies or
procedures of Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries since January 1, 2016,
in each case of the foregoing _clauses (A)_ and _(B)_ , which would
reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent. There is no unresolved violation,
criticism, or exception by any Regulatory Agency with respect to any report or
statement relating to any examinations or inspections of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, which would reasonably be likely to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

 

(b) An accurate and complete copy of each final registration statement,
prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or
furnished to the SEC by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, since January 1, 2016
(the " _Parent Reports_ ") is publicly available. No such Parent Report, at
the time filed, furnished or communicated (and, in the case of registration
statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates
of the relevant meetings, respectively), contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except that
information filed or furnished as of a later date (but before the date of
this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date.
As of their respective dates, all Parent Reports filed or furnished under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied as to form in all material
respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, no executive officer of Parent has
failed in any respect to make the certification required of him or her under
Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of the date of this
Agreement, there are no outstanding comments from or material unresolved
issues raised by the SEC with respect to any of the Parent Reports.

 

4.6 _Financial Statements_.

 

(a) The consolidated financial statements of Parent and its Subsidiaries

related notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in
accordance with, the books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries, (ii)
fairly present in all material respects the consolidated results of
operations, cash flows, changes in shareholders equity and consolidated
financial position of Parent and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal
periods or as of the respective dates therein set forth (subject in the case
of unaudited statements to year-end audit adjustments normal in

 



-38- 

    

 nature and amount), (iii) complied, as of their respective dates of filing
with the SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements
and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto,
and (iv) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied
during the periods involved, except, in each case, as indicated in such
statements or in the notes thereto. To the extent any of the books and
records of Parent and its Subsidiaries are required to be maintained in
accordance with GAAP, such books and records have been, since January 1, 2017,
and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with
GAAP. Prior to the date hereof, Deloitte and Touche LLP has not resigned (or
informed Parent that it intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent
public accountants of Parent as a result of or in connection with any
disagreements with Parent on a matter of accounting principles or practices,
financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

 

(b) Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether
absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due)
required by GAAP to be included in the consolidated balance sheet of Parent,
except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the
consolidated balance sheet of Parent included in its Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2018 (including any notes
thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since September 30, 2018, or in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. None of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any material "off-balance sheet
arrangements" as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K. 

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Parent and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Parent or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent (i) has
implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information
relating to Parent, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief
executive officer and the chief financial officer of Parent by others within
those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange
Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (ii) has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to
Parents outside auditor and the audit committee of the Parent Board (A) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of
the Exchange Act) relating to the period covered by such evaluation which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect Parents ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (B) to
the knowledge of Parent, any fraud, whether or not material, relating to the
period covered by such evaluation that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in Parents internal controls over financial
reporting. These disclosures, if any, were made by management to Parents
auditor and audit committee and a copy of any such written disclosure has been
previously made available to the Company. To the knowledge of Parent, there is
no reason to believe that Parents outside auditor and its

 



-39- 

    

 chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give
the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
without qualification, when next due.

(d) Since January 1, 2016, (i) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, to the knowledge of Parent, any director, officer, auditor, accountant or
representative of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise
had or obtained knowledge of any complaint, allegation, or claim, whether
written or, to the knowledge of Parent, oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with
respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals)
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting
controls that is material to Parent, including any complaint, allegation, or
claim, whether written or oral, that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has
engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices that is material to
Parent, and (ii) no attorney representing Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
whether or not employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported
evidence of a material violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty

agents to the Parent Board or any committee thereof or, to the knowledge of
Parent, to any director or officer of Parent, pursuant to Section 307 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, in each case of the foregoing _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ ,
except as would not reasonably be likely to be, either individually or in the
aggregate, materially adverse to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.

any of their respective officers or directors has employed any broker, finder

commissions or finders fees in connection with the Merger or
related transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than J.P. Morgan
Securities LLC pursuant to a letter agreement, all fees or commissions due and
payable to J.P. Morgan Securities LLC under which are set forth on Section 4.7
of the Parent Disclosure Schedule.

4.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 

(a) Since December 31, 2017, no event or events have occurred that have had
or would reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

(b) Since December 31, 2017 and through the date of this Agreement, except
as set forth in Sections 4.8(b), 5.1 and 5.3 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule

to the extent the applicable action occurs following the date hereof) and in
connection with matters related to this Agreement, Parent and its Subsidiaries
have carried on their respective businesses in all material respects in the
ordinary course of business.

 

4.9 _Legal Proceedings_.

capacity as such) that would reasonably be likely to (i) have, either

 



-40- 

    

 individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or
(ii) as of the date of this Agreement, prevent or materially impair the
ability of Parent to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

either individually or in the aggregate, material to Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, there is no injunction, order, judgment or

any of its Subsidiaries (or that, upon consummation of the Merger, would
apply to the Company and its Subsidiaries) by any Governmental Entity, (ii)
nor has Parent or any Parent Subsidiary been advised in writing by any
Governmental Entity that it is consider issuing, initiating, ordering or

consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

4.10 _Taxes and Tax Returns_. Except as would not reasonably be likely to
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent:

(a) Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed (taking
into account all applicable extensions) all Tax Returns in all jurisdictions
in which Tax Returns are required to be filed by it, and all such Tax Returns
are true, correct, and complete. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is

and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, creditor,
stockholder, independent contractor or other third party. Neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries has granted any extension or waiver of the limitation
period applicable to any Tax that remains in effect. The federal income Tax

jurisdiction believes that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries was required to
file any Tax Return that was not filed. Parent has made available to the
Company true, correct and complete copies of any private letter ruling
requests, closing agreements or gain recognition agreements with respect to
Taxes requested or executed in the last six (6) years. There are no Liens for

any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law), as a transferee or
successor, by contract or otherwise. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has been, within the past two (2) years or otherwise as part of a
"plan (or series of related transactions)" within the meaning of Section
355(e) of the Code of which the Merger is also a part, a "distributing
corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning of Section
355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock intended to qualify for
tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code. Neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries has participated in a "listed transaction" within the
meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(2). At no time during the
past five (5) years has Parent been a United States real property holding
corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code. Neither

credits, built-in losses or other tax attributes of Parent and its
Subsidiaries are subject to any limitations, reductions or diminutions in
value as a result of Sections 382, 383, 384 or the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder (or promulgated under Section 1502 of the
Code to address the application of such Sections of the Code in the
consolidated group context) or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign Law.

Statutory Parent Benefit Plans, which Non-U.S. Parent Benefit Plans, to the
extent not made available by the date hereof, shall be provided within thirty
(30) days following the date hereof, and (ii) Non-U.S. Statutory Parent

writing and whether or not funded, in each case, which is sponsored or
maintained by, or required to be contributed to, or with respect to which any
potential liability is borne by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. The Parent

the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA, employment, consulting, retirement,
severance, termination or change in control agreements, deferred

applicable Law to be sponsored, maintained, or to be contributed to by Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



-42- 

    

(b) Parent has made available to the Company true, correct and complete
copies of each of the material Parent Benefit Plans (except (i) for Parent
Benefit Plans that are maintained primarily for the benefit of employees
outside of the United States (" _Non-U.S.  Parent Benefit Plans_") that are
not Non-U.S. Statutory Parent Benefit Plans, which Non-U.S. Parent Benefit
Plans, to the extent not previously made available, shall be provided within
thirty (30) days following the date hereof, and (ii) Non-U.S. Statutory Parent
Benefit Plans) and the following related documents, to the extent applicable:

or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened claims (other than routine claims
for benefits) or proceedings by a Governmental Entity by, on behalf of or
against any Parent Benefit Plan or any trust related thereto which would
reasonably be likely to result in any liability which is material to Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(d) Each Parent Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has been determined by the IRS to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code and, to the knowledge of Parent, nothing has
occurred that would adversely affect the qualification or tax exemption of
any such Parent Benefit Plan. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has
engaged in a transaction in connection with which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries reasonably could be subject to either a civil penalty assessed
pursuant to Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed pursuant to
Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code.

(e) No Controlled Group Liability has been incurred by Parent or any
Parent ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full, and no condition
exists that presents a material risk to Parent or any Parent ERISA Affiliate
of incurring any such liability. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Parent

would be treated together with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries as a "single
employer" within the meaning of Section 414 of the Code.

(f) None of Parent and its Subsidiaries nor any Parent ERISA Affiliate has,
at any time during the last six (6) years, contributed to or been obligated

Plan or Multiple Employer Plan that has not been satisfied in full.

 



-43- 

    

(g) Except as required by applicable Law, no Parent Benefit Plan provides
retiree or post-employment medical, disability, life insurance or other
welfare benefits to any person, and none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
has any obligation to provide such benefits (excluding any Parent Benefit Plan
that provides for employer payment or subsidy of COBRA premiums). To the
extent that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries sponsors such plans, Parent or
the applicable Subsidiary has reserved the right to amend, terminate or modify
at any time each Parent Benefit Plan that provides retiree or post-employment
disability, life insurance or other welfare benefits to any person.

 

(h) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby could, either alone or
in conjunction with any other event, (i) entitle any current or former
employee, director, officer or independent contractor of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Parent Employees_ ") to severance pay or
any material increase in severance pay, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting, or materially increase the amount of compensation due to any such
employee, director, officer or independent contractor, (iii) directly or
indirectly cause Parent to transfer or set aside any assets to fund any
material benefits under any Parent Benefit Plan, (iv) otherwise give rise to
any material liability under any Parent Benefit Plan, or (v) limit or
restrict the right to amend any Parent Benefit Plan on or following the
Effective Time.

(i) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement could, either
alone or in combination with another event, result in the payment of any
amount that could, individually or in combination with any other such
payment, constitute an "excess parachute payment" as defined in Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code.

 

(j) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to
provide, and no Parent Benefit Plan or other agreement provides any
individual with the right to, a gross-up, indemnification, reimbursement or
other payment for any excise or additional taxes, interest or penalties
incurred pursuant to Section 409A or Section 4999 of the Code.

(k) Except as would not be reasonably likely to have, either individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, all Non-U.S. Parent
Benefit Plans comply with applicable local Law, and all such plans that are
intended to be funded and/or book-reserved are funded and/or book reserved,
as appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions. As of the date
hereof, there is no pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened
litigation relating to any Non-U.S. Parent Benefit Plan which litigation is
material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

of the date hereof, to the knowledge of Parent, there are no material
activities or proceedings by any individual or group of
individuals, including representatives of any labor organizations or labor
unions, to organize any employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement, shareholder or other approval of
this Agreement and the 

 



-44- 

    

 consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, either
alone or in combination with another event, will not entitle any third party
(including any labor organization or Governmental Entity) to any payments
under any of the Parent Labor Agreements, except as would not reasonably be
likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent. Parent and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with their
obligations pursuant to all notification and bargaining obligations arising
under any Parent Labor Agreements, except as would not reasonably be likely to
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent.

(m) Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all
applicable Laws respecting labor, employment and employment practices, terms
and conditions of employment, discrimination, harassment, wages and hours, and

aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

in the aggregate, material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
Parent and each of the Parent Subsidiaries have since January 1, 2016 (i)

(i) that is a "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10)
of Regulation S-K of the SEC), (ii) that provides for the incurrence of
indebtedness for borrowed money of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or the
guaranty of indebtedness for borrowed money of third parties, in each case,
in an aggregate principal amount in excess of $500,000,000 (other than
securities sold under agreement to repurchase, in each case, incurred in the
ordinary course of business), (iii) other than entered into in the ordinary
course of business, that relates to the acquisition or disposition of any
assets or any business (whether by merger, sale of stock, sale of assets or

-46- 

    

 $1,000,000,000 and with any outstanding obligations as of the date of this
Agreement (including any unpaid earnout or continuing indemnity provisions) or
(iv) that limits in any material respect the payment of dividends by Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries. Each contract, arrangement, commitment or
understanding of the type described in this Section 4.13(a) in existence as of
the date hereof (excluding any Parent Benefit Plan), whether or not set forth
in the Parent Disclosure Schedule, is referred to herein as a " _Parent
Contract_." ( _provided_ that, for purposes of the first sentence of _Section_
__ _ 4.13(b)_, the term "Parent Contract" will include any of the above
entered into after the date hereof that would have been a Parent Contract if
it had been in existence as of the date hereof).

 

(b) In each case, except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, (i)
each Parent Contract is valid and binding on Parent or one of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, and in full force and effect (unless terminated
after the date of this Agreement in accordance with its terms and  _Section_
__ _ 5.3_), (ii) each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has performed all
obligations required to be performed by it prior to the date hereof under each
Parent Contract, (iii) to the knowledge of Parent, each third-party
counterparty to each Parent Contract has performed all obligations required to
be performed by it to date under such Parent Contract, (iv) no event or
condition exists which constitutes or, after notice or lapse of time or
both, will constitute, a default on the part of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries under any such Parent Contract, and (v) neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries knows of, or has received written notice of, any violation of
any Parent Contract by any of the other parties thereto. Parent has made
available to the Company prior to the date hereof true, correct and complete
copies of each Parent Contract in existence as of the date hereof.

 

4.14 _Agreements with Regulatory Agencies_. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other similar order or
enforcement action issued by, or is a party to any consent agreement or
memorandum of understanding or other similar written agreement with, any
Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity or has been since January 1,
2016 ordered to pay any civil money penalty by any Regulatory Agency or other
Governmental Entity. Since January 1, 2016, neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has adopted any policies, procedures or board resolutions at the
request of any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that (a)
materially restricts the conduct of its business or that in any material
manner relates to its ability to pay dividends, its credit or risk management
policies, its management or its business or (b) would prevent or materially
impair the ability of Parent to consummate the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (each, whether or not set forth in the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, a " _Parent Regulatory Agreement_ "). Neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries has been advised in writing, or, to the knowledge of
Parent, orally, since January 1, 2016, by any Regulatory Agency or other
Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing, initiating, ordering, or
requesting any Parent Regulatory Agreement.

 

4.15 _Customers_. Since January 1, 2018 through the date of this
Agreement, Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have not received any notice
from any Parent Covered Customer that such Parent Covered Customer intends to
discontinue or substantially reduce its relationship with Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary, as applicable, or terminate or materially and adversely amend any
existing material contract with Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, as
applicable, or not to continue as a customer of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary, as applicable. As 

 



-47- 

    

 used in this Agreement, the term " _Parent Covered Customer_ " means a
customer of Parent or a Parent Subsidiary the revenue derived from which
constituted five percent (5%) or more of the consolidated revenue of Parent
during the trailing four quarters ended September 30, 2018.

 

4.16 _Environmental Matters_. Except as would not reasonably be likely to
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent, Parent and its Subsidiaries are in compliance, and, since January 1,
2016, have complied, with all Environmental Laws. There are no legal,
administrative, arbitral or other judicial proceedings, claims or actions,
any private environmental investigations or remedial activities or
governmental investigations of any nature pending, or, to the knowledge of
Parent, threatened, seeking to impose, or that would reasonably be likely to
result in the imposition, on Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of any
liability or obligation relating to any Environmental Law which is material to
Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Except as would not reasonably
be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent, to the knowledge of Parent, there is no reasonable
basis for any such proceeding, claim, action or governmental investigation
that would impose any liability or obligation relating to any Environmental
Law. Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, no real property
currently or formerly owned or operated by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, to the knowledge of Parent, any third-party site, has been contaminated
with any Hazardous Substance in a manner that would reasonably be likely to
require remediation or other action or result in any liability pursuant to
any Environmental Law on the part of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.
Parent is not subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter
agreement or memorandum of agreement by or with any court, governmental
authority, regulatory agency or third party imposing any liability or
obligation with respect to any Environmental Law which is material to Parent
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

4.17 _Real Property_. Except as would not reasonably be likely, either
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent, Parent or a Parent Subsidiary (a) has good and marketable title to all
real property reflected in the latest audited balance sheet included in the
Parent Reports as being owned by Parent or a Parent Subsidiary or acquired
after the date thereof (except properties sold or otherwise disposed of since
the date thereof in the ordinary course of business) (the " _Parent Owned
Properties_ "), free and clear of all Liens, except for
Permitted Encumbrances, and (b) is the lessee of all leasehold estates
reflected in the latest audited financial statements included in such Parent
Reports or acquired after the date thereof (except for leases that have
expired by their terms since the date thereof) (the " _Parent Leased
Properties_ " and, collectively with the Parent Owned Properties, the "
_Parent Real Property_ "), free and clear of all Liens of any nature
whatsoever, except for Permitted Encumbrances, and is in possession of the
properties purported to be leased thereunder, and each such lease is valid
without default thereunder by the lessee or, to the knowledge of Parent, the
lessor. There are no pending, or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened,
condemnation proceedings against the Parent Real Property, except as would not
reasonably be likely, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

4.18 _Intellectual Property; Data Privacy and Technology; Information
Security_.

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, Parent and each of its Subsidiaries
own (in each case, free and clear of any material Liens other than any
Permitted Encumbrances) or otherwise have sufficient right to use Intellectual
Property Rights used by Parent or such Subsidiaries, as applicable, in the
conduct of its business as currently conducted, and all such rights shall
survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
unchanged, in each case, except as would not reasonably be likely to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent
( _provided_ that the foregoing shall not be read as a representation on non-
infringement).

 

(b) Except as would not reasonably be likely, either individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, all Intellectual
Property Rights owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and registered with
or issued by, or the subject of a pending application (whether for
registration or issuance) before, any Governmental Entity (" _Parent_
_Registered IP_ ") are subsisting and, to the knowledge of Parent, other than
with respect to applications, valid and enforceable, and none of the Parent
Registered IP is subject to any outstanding order, judgment or decree (other
than routine office actions) adversely affecting Parents or its Subsidiaries
ownership or use of, or rights in or to, any such Parent Registered IP.

 

(c) Except as would not reasonably be likely, either individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, Parent and its
Subsidiaries, and the conduct of Parents and its Subsidiaries businesses,
including the development, manufacture, use, sale, commercialization or
provision of Parents and its Subsidiaries products and services do not and
have not infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated within the past
three (3) years, the Intellectual Property Rights of any person. To the
knowledge of Parent, except as would not reasonably be likely, either
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent,
no person is infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating any
Intellectual Property Rights owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(d) As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written claims that are still pending (i)
alleging that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has infringed, misappropriated
or otherwise violated the Intellectual Property Rights of any person, whether
directly or indirectly or (ii) contesting or challenging the use, validity,
enforceability or ownership of any material Intellectual Property Rights owned
or purported to be owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(e) As of the date of this Agreement, except as would not reasonably be
likely, either individually or in the aggregate, to result in liability or
disruption which is material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
Parent and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all of its and their
privacy policies and with all applicable Laws regarding privacy and personal
information, including with respect to the collection, storage, transmission,
transfer (including cross-border transfers), disclosure and use of personally
identifiable information. Parent and its Subsidiaries have used commercially
reasonable measures, consistent with accepted industry practices, to ensure
the confidentiality, privacy and security of Sensitive Data.

 

(f) To the knowledge of Parent, during the three (3) year period prior to
the date of this Agreement, no third party has gained unauthorized access to
or misused any Sensitive Data or any IT Assets used in the operation of the
businesses of Parent or any of its

 



-49- 

    

 Subsidiaries, in each case, in a manner that has resulted or is reasonably
likely to result in either (i) liability, cost or disruption to the business
of Parent and its Subsidiaries that would be, individually or in the
aggregate, material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii)
a duty to notify any person except as would not reasonably be likely,
individually or in the aggregate, to result in liability which is material to
Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Parent and its Subsidiaries
have taken commercially reasonable steps and implemented commercially
reasonable safeguards, consistent with accepted industry practices, to protect
their products, services and IT Assets from unauthorized access and free from
any Malicious Code. To the knowledge of Parent, as of the date of this
Agreement, except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, the IT
Assets used by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (i) are free from Malicious
Code and (ii) have not, within the three (3) years prior to the date of this
Agreement, experienced any material failure or malfunction.

4.19 _Related Party Transactions_. As of the date hereof, there are no
transactions or series of related transactions, agreements, arrangements or
understandings, nor are there any proposed transactions or series of related
transactions, between Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and
any current director or "executive officer" (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under
the Exchange Act) of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any person who
beneficially owns (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 of the Exchange Act)
five percent (5%) or more of the outstanding Parent Common Stock (or any of
such persons immediate family members or affiliates) (other than
Subsidiaries of Parent), on the other hand, of the type required to be
reported in any Parent Report pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K
promulgated under the Exchange Act (each such agreement, arrangement or
understanding, a " _Parent_ _Related Party Contract_ ").

4.20 _State Takeover Laws_. The Parent Board has approved the Transaction
Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby and has taken all other
necessary corporate actions as required to render inapplicable any applicable
provisions of any Takeover Statutes or any similar takeover-related provision
in the Parent Articles or the Parent Bylaws to the shares of Parent Common
Stock issued pursuant to the Parent Share Issuance or otherwise or that would
prohibit or restrict the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to issue the shares
of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Parent Share Issuance or otherwise
perform under any of the Transaction Agreements or the ability of Parent or
Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby or subject the
Company or its stockholders, including the Stockholder, to any impediment or
condition in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by the Transaction Agreements, including any impediment or condition
in connection with the acquisition by the Stockholder of shares of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to the Parent Share Issuance.

 

4.21 _Reorganization_. Parent has not taken any action nor, to the
knowledge of Parent, is there any fact or circumstance that would reasonably
be likely to prevent the Merger, taken together, from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

4.22 _Opinion_. Prior to the execution of this Agreement, the Parent Board
has received an opinion (which, if initially rendered orally, has been or
will be confirmed by a

 



-50- 

    

 written opinion) from J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, to the effect that, as of
the date hereof, and based upon and subject to the factors, assumptions and
limitations set forth therein, the Exchange Ratio pursuant to this Agreement
is fair, from a financial point of view, to Parent. Such opinion has not been
amended or rescinded in any material respect as of the date of this Agreement.

 

4.23 _Parent Information_. The information relating to Parent and its
Subsidiaries that is provided by Parent or its representatives for inclusion
in (a) the Joint Statement on the date it (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) is first mailed to holders of Company Common Stock, (b) the S-4, when
it or any amendment thereto becomes effective under the Securities Act, (c)
the documents and financial statements of Parent incorporated by reference in
the Joint Statement, the S-4 or any amendment or supplement thereto or (d)
any other document filed with any other Regulatory Agency in connection
herewith, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading. The portions of the
Joint Statement relating to Parent and its Subsidiaries and other portions
within the reasonable control of Parent and its Subsidiaries will comply in
all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation
or warranty is made by Parent with respect to statements made or incorporated
by reference therein based on information provided or supplied by or on
behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries for inclusion in the Joint Statement
or the S-4.

 

4.24 _Insurance_. Except as would not reasonably be likely, either
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent, (a) Parent and its Subsidiaries are insured with insurers against such
risks and in such amounts as the management of Parent reasonably has
determined to be prudent and consistent with industry practice, and neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice to the effect that any
of them are in default under any material insurance policy, (b) each such
policy is outstanding and in full force and effect and, except for policies
insuring against potential liabilities of officers, directors and employees
of Parent and its Subsidiaries, Parent or the relevant Subsidiary thereof is
the sole beneficiary of such policies and (c) all premiums and other payments
due under any such policy have been paid, and all claims thereunder have been
filed in due and timely fashion.

4.25 _Sufficient Funds_.

(a) Assuming the truth and accuracy of the Companys representations and
warranties set forth in  _Article III_ and compliance by the Company with its
obligations hereunder, in each case, in all material respects, and assuming
satisfaction of the conditions in _Article VII_ (other than the conditions set
forth in _Sections 7.2(a)_  and _7.2(b)_ and those conditions that by their
nature can only be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction
or waiver thereof), Parent and Merger Sub will have available to them at the
Effective Time all funds and commitments necessary to refinance in full all
amounts outstanding under the Company Credit Agreement, the Company
Receivables Financing Agreement and the Company Indentures, to pay cash in
lieu of fractional shares in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ and to pay
the fees and expenses relating to the Merger and the Financing. Parent has
delivered to the Company true and complete copies of (i) a fully executed debt
commitment letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement (including all
exhibits thereto in effect on the date hereof) and (ii) the executed fee
letter referenced therein, relating to fees with respect to the Financing
contemplated by the 

 



-51- 

    

 commitment letter (collectively, the " _Commitment Letter_ "), by and among
Parent and the Financing Sources specified therein (with only fee amounts and
other economic terms, and the rates and amounts included in the "flex"
provisions, redacted, none of which redacted provisions would adversely affect
the conditionality, enforceability, termination or amount of the debt
financing contemplated by the commitment letter). Pursuant to the Commitment
Letter, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the Financing Sources
party thereto have committed to provide Parent with the amounts set forth in
the Commitment Letter for the purposes set forth therein (the debt financing
contemplated in the Commitment Letter, together with, unless the context
otherwise requires, any replacement financing, including any bank financing or
debt securities issued in lieu thereof, the " _Financing_ "). As of the date
of this Agreement, the Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and has
not been withdrawn, rescinded or terminated, or otherwise amended or modified
in any respect and no amendment or modification is contemplated (other than as
set forth in the fee letters with respect to flex rights and/or to add
additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents and similar
entities who had not executed the Commitment Letter as of the date of this
Agreement), and the Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered, constitutes
the legal, valid and binding obligation of, and is enforceable against, Parent
and, to the knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto, subject,
in each case, to the Enforceability Exceptions. Except as set forth in the
Commitment Letter and except for any related commitment letters, engagement
letters and fee letters related to the permanent financing described in the
Commitment Letter, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no contracts,
agreements, "side letters" or other arrangements to which Parent or any of its
affiliates is a party relating to the Commitment Letter or the Financing.

 

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to constitute, a default or breach by Parent or, to the knowledge of
Parent, any other party thereto, of any term of the Commitment Letter. As of
the date of this Agreement, no Financing Source party to the Commitment
Letter has notified Parent of its termination or repudiation (or intent to
terminate or repudiate) any of the commitments under such Commitment Letter or
intent not to provide the Financing. Assuming the truth and accuracy of
the Companys representations and warranties set forth in _Article III_ and
compliance by the Company with its obligations hereunder, in each case, in all
material respects, and assuming satisfaction of the conditions in _Article
VII_  (other than the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.2(a)_ and _7.2(b)_
and those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof), Parent has no
reason to believe that any of the conditions to the funding of the Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter and contained in the Commitment Letter
will fail to be satisfied on the Closing Date or that the full amounts
committed pursuant to the Commitment Letter will not be available to be
funded on the Closing Date to the extent required, when taken together with
cash or cash equivalents held by Parent and the Company on the Closing Date
and the other sources of funds available to Parent on the Closing Date, to
refinance in full all amounts outstanding under the Company Credit Agreement,
the Company Receivables Financing Agreement and the Company Indentures, to pay
cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.2_
and to pay the fees and expenses relating to the Merger and the Financing.

 



-52- 

    

(c) Parent acknowledges that its obligation to consummate the Merger as
set forth in this Agreement is not contingent on Parents ability to obtain
any financing, whether pursuant to the Commitment Letter or otherwise.

 

(d) Parent has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment
fees or other fees required by the Commitment Letter to be paid on or before
the date of this Agreement. Assuming (i) the funding of the full amount of the
Financing in accordance with and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions
in the Commitment Letter, (ii) the truth and accuracy of the Companys
representations and warranties set forth in _Article III_ and compliance by
the Company with its obligations hereunder, in each case, in all material
respects, and (iii) satisfaction of the conditions in  _Article VII_ , the
aggregate proceeds from the Financing (after netting out applicable fees,
expenses, original issue discount and similar premiums and chargers and after
giving effect of the maximum amount of flex (including original
issue discount flex) provided under the Commitment Letter) constitute all of
the financing necessary to refinance in full all amounts outstanding under the
Company Credit Agreement, the Company Receivables Financing Agreement and the
Company Indentures, to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ and to pay the fees and expenses relating to the
Merger and the Financing and, when taken together with cash or cash
equivalents held by Parent and the Company on the Closing Date and the other
sources of funds available to Parent on the Closing Date, will be sufficient
in amount to pay the foregoing amounts in full. The only conditions precedent
related to the obligations of the Financing Sources party to the Commitment
Letter to fund the full amount of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letter are expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter.

consent to any limitations or restrictions on freedom of actions with respect
to, or its ability to retain, or make changes in, any such assets, licenses,

for information or documentary material from any Governmental Entity with

comments to, any proposed communication, filing or submission by such party to
any Governmental Entity. The parties will coordinate and cooperate fully with
each other in exchanging information and providing assistance as the other
party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing or in connection
with any filing or submission to be made to any Governmental Entity; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that materials exchanged pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 6.1_ may be redacted or withheld as necessary to address reasonable
privilege or confidentiality concerns, and to remove references concerning
the valuation of the Company or Parents consideration of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or other competitively sensitive material;
_provided_ _further_ that the parties hereto may, as they deem advisable and
necessary, designate any materials provided to the other pursuant to this

information contained therein shall be given only to outside counsel of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,

 officers or directors of the recipient without the advance written consent
of the party providing such materials. Parent and the Company shall consult
with the other party in advance of any meeting, discussion or teleconference
with any Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, with any other person, and, to the extent not prohibited by the
Governmental Entity or other person, give the other party the opportunity to
attend and participate in such meetings, discussions and teleconferences. The
parties shall discuss in advance the strategy and timing for obtaining any
clearances required under any applicable Law in connection with

division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets, or take
any other action, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to,
or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation, or the
taking of any other action, would reasonably be expected to (i) impose any
delay in the obtaining of, or increase the risk of not obtaining, any
authorizations, consents, orders or declarations of any Governmental Entity
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the expiration
or termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii) increase the risk of any
Governmental Entity entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the

the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to respond promptly to
comments from the SEC and have the S-4 declared effective under the Securities
Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and to keep the S-4 effective

Agreement, and Parent and the Company shall as promptly as practicable after
such filing mail or deliver the Joint Statement to their respective
shareholders and stockholders. Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly
notify the other party of the receipt of all comments from the SEC and of any
request by the SEC for any amendment or supplement to the S-4 or the Joint
Statement or for additional information and shall promptly provide to the

reasonable opportunity to review and comment on drafts of the Joint Statement,
the S-4, responses to any comments from the SEC with respect thereto and other
documents related to the Parent Meeting, the Company Consent Solicitation or
the Parent Share Issuance, prior to filing such documents with the applicable
Governmental Entity and mailing such documents to the shareholders of Parent
and the

 



-62- 

    

 stockholders of the Company. Each party will include in the Joint Statement,
the S-4 and such other documents related to the Parent Meeting, the
Company Consent Solicitation or the Parent Share Issuance in respect of the
Merger with all comments reasonably and promptly proposed by the other party
or its legal counsel, and each agrees that all information relating to Parent
and its Subsidiaries included in the Joint Statement and the S-4 shall be in
form and content satisfactory to Parent, acting reasonably, and all
information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries included in the
Joint Statement and the S-4 shall be in form and content satisfactory to the

other party, promptly after receipt of notice thereof, of the time
of effectiveness of the S-4, the issuance of any stop order relating thereto
or the suspension of the qualification of shares of Parent Common Stock for
offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and each of Parent and the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or
suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated. Parent shall also use its
reasonable best efforts to take all action under applicable securities Laws,
rules or regulations and to obtain all necessary state securities Law or
"Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and the Company shall furnish all information
concerning the Company and the holders of the Company Common Stock as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action.

 

(f) Parent and the Company shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information concerning themselves, their affiliates, directors, officers,
shareholders and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably

other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective affiliates to any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 

(g) Each of Parent and the Company further agrees that if it becomes aware
that any information furnished by it would cause any of the statements in the
S-4 or the Joint Statement to be false or misleading with respect to any
material fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein not false or misleading, that it should promptly inform
the other party thereof and take appropriate steps to correct the S-4 or the
Joint Statement.

 

6.2 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws, each of Parent
and the Company, for the purposes of verifying the representations and
warranties of the other party and preparing for the Merger and the other
matters and transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall, and shall
cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and other representatives
of the other party, reasonable access, during normal business hours during the
period prior to the Effective Time, to all of its properties, books,
contracts, personnel, information technology systems and records, and each
shall cooperate with the other party in preparing to execute after the
Effective Time conversion or consolidation of systems and business operations
generally (including by entering into customary confidentiality, non-
disclosure and similar agreements with such service

 



-63- 

    

 providers and/or the other party), and, during such period, each of Parent
and the Company shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, make
available to the other party such information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as such party may reasonably request. Each party
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any interference with
the other partys regular business operations during any such access. None of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required
to provide access to properties, books, contracts, personnel, information
technology systems and records, or to disclose information, pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.2_, where such access or disclosure would, in the reasonable
judgment of Parent or the Company, violate or prejudice the rights of Parents
or the Companys customers, result in the disclosure of trade secrets of any
third parties or competitively sensitive information, jeopardize the attorney-
client privilege of the party in possession or control of such information
(after giving due consideration to the existence of any common interest,
joint defense or similar agreement between the parties), unreasonably
interfere with the other partys regular business operations during any such
access or contravene any Law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree,
fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement. In the event that either party withholds information on the basis
of the foregoing, such party shall inform the other party as to the general
nature of what is being withheld, and the parties hereto will make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply so that such disclosure does
not suffer from any of the foregoing impediments, including through (i) use
of commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the required consent or waiver of
any third party required to provide such information and (ii) the
implementation of appropriate and mutually agreeable measures to permit the
disclosure of such information in a matter so as to remove the basis for
objection, including by arrangement of appropriate "clean room" procedures,
redaction or entry into a customary joint defense agreement with respect to
any information to be so provided if the parties determine that so doing
would reasonably permit the disclosure of such information without violating
applicable Law or jeopardizing any attorney-client privilege.

 

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall hold all information furnished by
or on behalf of the other party or any of such partys Subsidiaries or
Representatives pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_ in confidence to the
extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the
confidentiality agreement, dated November 7, 2018, between Parent and the
Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

(c) No investigation by either Parent or the Company or their respective
Representatives, and no information furnished by any of them, shall affect or
be deemed to modify or waive the representations and warranties of the other
set forth herein.

 

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly
or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the other
party prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party
shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective
operations.

(e) To the extent that any of the information or material furnished
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ or otherwise in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement may include material subject to the attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable 

 



-64- 

    

 privilege, including those concerning pending or threatened Actions, the
parties understand and agree that they have a commonality of interest with
respect to such matters and it is their desire, intention and mutual
understanding that the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall
not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its
continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work
product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All such information that is
entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such
protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint
defense doctrine.

6.3 _Shareholder Approval and Stockholder Approval_. 

(a) Parent shall call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
shareholders (the " _Parent Meeting_ ") as soon as reasonably practicable
after the S-4 is declared effective (and, in any event, within forty-five (45)
business days thereafter) for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Parent
Vote required in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and, if so
desired and mutually agreed, upon other matters of the type customarily
brought before an annual or special meeting of shareholders to approve the
issuance of stock in connection with a merger. Parent shall not postpone the
Parent Meeting except to the extent required by Law or in accordance with the
remaining provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_. Parent agrees (i) to
provide the Company with reasonably detailed periodic updates concerning
proxy solicitation results on a timely basis (including, if requested,
promptly providing daily voting reports in the last ten (10) days prior to the
Parent Meeting) and (ii) to give written notice (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, may be given via e-mail) to the Company one (1) day prior to, and on
the date of, the Parent Meeting, indicating whether, as of such
date, sufficient proxies representing the Requisite Parent Vote have been
obtained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, on a date that is two (2)
business days prior to the time for which the Parent Meeting was originally
scheduled (as set forth in the Joint Statement) (the " _Original Parent
Meeting Date_ "), (A) Parent has not received proxies representing the
Requisite Parent Vote, whether or not a quorum is present, (B) there are
insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) and voting to approve the Parent Share Issuance to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Parent Meeting, or (C) it is
necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Joint Statement
is required to be delivered, Parent may, or, if the Company so requests,
shall, postpone or adjourn the Parent Meeting; _provided_ that Parent shall
only be required to adjourn or postpone the Parent Meeting two (2) times. In
the event of any postponement or adjournment of the Parent Meeting pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_, Parent has the sole discretion to set the date
for the postponement or adjournment of the Parent Meeting; _provided_ that
the Parent Meeting shall not be postponed or adjourned by more than ten (10)
business days from the Original Parent Meeting Date in connection with the
first (1st) postponement or adjournment or more than an aggregate of thirty
(30) business days from the Original Parent Meeting Date if the Parent Meeting
is postponed or adjourned for two (2) times. If the Parent Meeting (including
any adjournments or postponements thereof) shall have concluded and the
Requisite Parent Vote shall not have been obtained, either Parent or the
Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 8.1(h)_. For the avoidance of doubt, but subject to Parents right or
the Companys right to request Parent to adjourn or postpone the Parent
Meeting permitted in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_, unless this Agreement has
been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Parent Meeting shall be
convened and the Parent Share Issuance shall be submitted to the shareholders
of Parent for approval at the Parent Meeting, and nothing contained herein
shall be deemed to relieve Parent of such obligation.

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.3(c)_, in lieu of calling a meeting of
the Companys stockholders, the Company shall provide a form of stockholder
written consent as mutually agreed by the parties to the Companys
stockholders (the " _Company Consent Solicitation_ ") as soon as reasonably
practicable after the S-4 is declared effective (and, in the case of the
Stockholder, the Company shall provide a form of the Stockholder Written
Consent to the Stockholder within twenty-four (24) hours after the S-4
becomes effective) for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Company Vote
required in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and, if so desired
and mutually agreed, upon other matters of the type customarily included in
the written consent or brought before an annual or special meeting of
stockholders to approve the adoption of a merger agreement. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the execution and delivery by the Stockholder to
the Company of a stockholder written consent substantially in the form
attached as Exhibit A to the Voting and Support Agreement in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by the Stockholder (the "
_Stockholder Written Consent_ ") in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL
and the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws, the Company shall deliver to
Parent a copy of such executed copy of the Stockholder Written Consent. As
soon as reasonably practicable after obtaining the Requisite Company Vote as
contemplated in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(b)_, the Company shall prepare
(subject to reasonable approval of Parent) and deliver to its stockholders
who have not consented the notice required by Section 228(e) of the DGCL. For
the avoidance of doubt, unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with its terms or Parent has made a Company Meeting Election, the
Company Consent Solicitation shall be conducted and this Agreement shall be
submitted to the stockholders of the Company for adoption via written consent,
and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such
obligation.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.3(b)_, if the
Company Board shall have effected a Change in Company Recommendation prior to
such time as the Requisite Company Vote is obtained and Parent does not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_, then, within
three (3) business days after such Change in Company Recommendation, Parent
shall have the right to request a Company Meeting by written notice to the
Company (a " _Company Meeting Election_ " and, such notice, the " _Election
Notice_ ") and, if and only if so requested by Parent within such three (3)
business day period, the Company shall (i) use its reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with Parent to either (A) amend the S-4 as promptly as practicable
following the receipt of such Election Notice to include a Joint Proxy
Statement instead of a Joint Proxy/Consent Solicitation Statement in the S-4
if the Company Board shall have effected a Change in Company Recommendation
prior to such time that the S-4 is declared effective or (B) file a post-
effective amendment to the S-4 and/or amend the Joint Proxy/Consent
Solicitation Statement as promptly as practicable following the receipt of
such notice if the Company Board shall have effected a Change in Company
Recommendation at or after such time that the S-4 is declared effective, and
(ii) shall call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
shareholders (the " _Company Meeting_ ") as soon as reasonably practicable
after the S-4 is declared effective or as soon as reasonably practicable after
the post-effective amendment is effective, as applicable (and, in any event,
within forty-five (45) business days thereafter), for the purpose of
obtaining the Requisite Company Vote required in connection with this
Agreement and the Merger and, if so desired and mutually agreed, upon other
matters of the

 



-66- 

    

 type customarily brought before an annual or special meeting of shareholders
to approve the adoption of a merger agreement. The Company shall not postpone
the Company Meeting except to the extent required by Law or in accordance
with the remaining provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(c)_. The Company
agrees (i) to provide Parent with reasonably detailed periodic updates
concerning proxy solicitation results on a timely basis (including, if
requested, promptly providing daily voting reports in the last ten (10) days
prior to the Company Meeting) and (ii) to give written notice (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, may be given via e-mail) to Parent one (1) day prior to,
and on the date of, the Company Meeting, indicating whether, as of such date,
sufficient proxies representing the Requisite Company Vote have been
obtained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, on a date that is two (2)
business days prior to the time for which the Company Meeting was originally
scheduled (as set forth in the Joint Proxy Statement) (the " _Original Company
Meeting Date_ "), (A) the Company has not received proxies representing the
Requisite Company Vote, whether or not a quorum is present, (B) there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) and voting to approve the Merger, to constitute a quorum necessary
to conduct the business of the Company Meeting, or (C) it is necessary to
ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement is
required to be delivered, the Company may, or, if Parent so requests, shall,
postpone or adjourn the Parent Meeting; _provided_ that the Company shall only
be required to adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting two (2) times. In the
event of any postponement or adjournment of the Company Meeting pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(c)_, the Company has the sole discretion to set the
date for the postponement or adjournment of the Company Meeting; _provided_
that the Company Meeting shall not be postponed or adjourned by more than ten
(10) business days from the Original Company Meeting Date in connection with
the first (1st) postponement or adjournment or more than an aggregate of
thirty (30) business days from the Original Company Meeting Date if the
Company Meeting Date is postponed or adjourned for two (2) times. If the
Company Meeting (including any adjournments or postponements thereof) shall
have concluded and the Requisite Company Vote shall not have been obtained,
either Parent or the Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_. For the avoidance of doubt, if Parent has
made a Company Meeting Election, but subject to the Companys right or
Parents right to request the Company to adjourn or postpone the Company
Meeting permitted in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(c)_, unless this Agreement has
been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company Meeting shall be
convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of the
Company for approval at the Company Meeting, and nothing contained herein
shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such obligation.

 

(d) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain from the shareholders of Parent or the stockholders of the Company, as
applicable, the Requisite Parent Vote (including by communicating to Parents
shareholders the Parent Recommendation, subject to the remaining provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(d)_), in the case of Parent, or the Requisite
Company Vote (including by communicating to the Companys stockholders the
Company Recommendation, subject to the remaining provisions of this _Section_
__ _ 6.3(d)_), in the case of the Company. However, subject to _Sections
8.1_ and _8.2_ , if the Parent Board or the Company Board, after receiving the
advice of its outside counsel and its outside financial advisor, determines in
good faith that it would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law to continue to recommend this Agreement, then, in submitting
this Agreement to Parents shareholders or the Companys stockholders, as
applicable, such Board may effect a Change in Parent Recommendation or Change
in Company Recommendation, as

 



-67- 

    

 applicable (although the resolutions approving this Agreement as of the date
hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event such Board may
communicate the basis for its Change in Parent Recommendation or Change in
Company Recommendation, as applicable, to Parents shareholders or the
Companys stockholders, as applicable, in the Joint Statement or an
appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by Law;
_provided_ that neither the Parent Board nor the Company Board may effect a
Change in Parent Recommendation or a Change in Company Recommendation, as
applicable, unless (i)(A) Parent or the Company, as applicable, has received
an Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement that did not result
from a breach of _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ (and such proposal is not withdrawn) and
the Parent Board or the Company Board, as applicable, determines in good
faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and its outside
financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal or (B)(1) in the case of Parent, a Parent Intervening Event shall
have occurred and the Parent Board determines in good faith (after receiving
the advice of its outside counsel and its outside financial advisor) that
continuing to make the Parent Recommendation would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (2) in the case of the Company, a
Company Intervening Event shall have occurred and the Company Board determines
in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and its
outside financial advisor) that continuing to make the Company Recommendation
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (ii)
Parent gives the Company, in the case of the Parent Board, or the Company
gives Parent, in the case of the Company Board, at least four (4)
business days prior written notice of its intention to take such action
(such period, as it may be extended by delivery of any subsequent notices, the
" _notice period_ ") and a reasonable description of the event or
circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action (including
(A) in the case of an Acquisition Proposal, the latest material terms and
conditions of, and the identity of any third party making, any such
Acquisition Proposal and any amendment or modification thereof or (B) in the
case of a Parent Intervening Event or a Company Intervening Event, as
applicable, the nature of the Parent Intervening Event or the Company
Intervening Event, as applicable, in reasonable detail) and (iii) at the end
of such notice period, each of the Parent Board and the Company Board, as
applicable, takes into account any amendment or modification to this Agreement
proposed by the Company, in the case of the Parent Board (which shall
be negotiated in good faith by Parent), or by Parent, in the case of the
Company Board (which shall be negotiated in good faith by the Company), and
after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and its outside financial
advisor, determines in good faith that it would nevertheless be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law to continue to recommend this
Agreement. Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed
to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_,
except that references to "four (4) business days" shall be deemed to be
references to "two (2) business days."

 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
following meanings:

 

(i) A " _Parent Intervening Event_ " means any material event, change,
effect, development or occurrence occurring or arising after the date of this
Agreement that (A) was not known to, and was not reasonably foreseeable by,

Company Board as of the date of this Agreement and did not result from a

involve an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that in no event shall any of the
following events constitute a Company Intervening Event: (1) any change, in
and of itself, in the trading price or trading volume of the Parent Common
Stock or the Company Common Stock, or any change in credit ratings or ratings
outlook, in and of itself, for Parent or the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries (but not including, in each case, the underlying
causes thereof); (2) the fact, in and of itself, that Parent or the Company
exceeds or fails to meet or exceed analyst earnings projections, earnings
guidance or internal financial forecasts (but not including, in each case,
the underlying causes thereof); and (3) compliance with or performance under
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the
NASDAQ, in each case subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the
Effective Time.

 

6.5 _Employee_ _Matters_.

 

(a) The parties agree that the Company Employees as of the Effective Time
who continue to remain employed with Parent or its Subsidiaries (including
the Surviving Corporation) (collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ ")
shall, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
first anniversary of the Closing Date, for so long as they are employed, be
provided with base salary or base wage, target annual cash bonus
opportunities, severance benefit protections, and pension and welfare benefits
(excluding equity and long-term incentive compensation) that are no less
favorable, in the aggregate, than those provided to such Continuing Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
requirements of this sentence shall not apply to Continuing Employees who are
covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Without limiting the foregoing,
during the two (2)-year period commencing on the Closing Date, Parent or its
applicable Subsidiary shall continue to maintain, without amendment thereto,
the Company Benefit Plans providing severance benefits as set forth in
Section 6.5(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(b) With respect to any Parent Benefit Plan in which any Continuing
Employees become eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time (the "
_New Plans_ "), Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) cause
any pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods
under any of its group health plans to be waived with respect to the
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents, except to the extent such
pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the
analogous Company Benefit Plan in which the Continuing Employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) provide each Continuing
Employee and their eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments or
coinsurance and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time under a benefit
plan that provides health care benefits (including medical, dental and

Company Benefit Plan in which the Continuing Employee participated immediately
prior to the Effective Time, in satisfying any applicable deductible, co-
payment, coinsurance or maximum out-of-pocket requirements under any New
Plans, and (iii) give the Continuing Employees service credit for such
Continuing Employees employment with the Company or its applicable Subsidiary
for all purposes in any New Plan to the same extent that such service was
taken into account under the analogous Company Benefit Plan in which the
Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ that the foregoing service recognition shall not apply (A) to the
extent it would result in duplication of benefits for the same period of
service, (B) for purposes of any defined benefit pension plan or benefit plan
that provides retiree welfare benefits, or (C) for purposes of any benefit
plan that is a frozen plan or provides grandfathered benefits.

 



-70- 

    

(c) If requested by Parent in writing at least ten (10) business days
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause any 401(k) plan sponsored
or maintained by the Company (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") to be terminated
effective as of the day immediately prior to the Effective Time
and contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing. In the event that Parent
requests that any Company 401(k) Plan be terminated, the Continuing Employees
shall be eligible to participate, effective as of the Effective Time, in a
401(k) plan sponsored or maintained by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries (a "
_Parent 401(k) Plan_ "). The Company and Parent shall take any and all actions
as may be required, including amendments to the Company 401(k) Plan and/or
Parent 401(k) Plan, to permit the Continuing Employees who are then actively
employed to make rollover contributions to the Parent 401(k) Plan of "eligible
rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code)
in the form of cash, notes (in the case of loans) or a combination thereof.
The Company shall provide Parent with evidence that the Company 401(k) Plan
has been terminated or amended, as applicable, in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 6.5(c)_;  _provided_ that prior to amending or terminating
the Company 401(k) Plan, the Company shall provide the form and substance of
any applicable resolutions or amendments to Parent for review and approval
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall act in good
faith and use reasonable best efforts to mutually agree upon a leadership
incentive plan which shall provide for cash and equity incentive compensation
to be awarded to eligible Continuing Employees and eligible Parent Employees,
which plan shall become effective upon, and cover periods following, the
Closing, subject to the approval of the compensation committee of the Parent
Board.

 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving
Corporation, the Company, or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall
interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving
Corporation, the Company, Parent or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to
discharge or terminate the services of any employee, officer, director or
consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time
for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. Nothing in this Agreement
shall be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit Plan,
New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or
arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation
or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any
particular Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment
plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time. Nothing in
this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
person, including any current or former employee, officer, director or
consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.

(f) Prior to making any material written communications to Company
Employees pertaining to matters that are affected by the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall provide Parent with a copy
of the intended communication, Parent shall have a reasonable period of
time to review and comment on the communication, and the Company shall
consider any such comments in good faith.

6.6 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
that the Company would be permitted to do so, by applicable Law, each present
and former (determined as of the Effective Time) director or officer of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and any person who, prior to or at the Effective
Time, served at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
director or officer of another person in which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has an equity investment, in each case, when acting in such
capacity (collectively, the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any Action or any
other threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whether arising
before or after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of, or
pertaining to, (i) the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or
fiduciary of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at
the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of
another person in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has an equity
investment or (ii) matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with
the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, also advance expenses as incurred in connection
therewith by such Company Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law; _provided_ that the Company Indemnified Party to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking (in a reasonable and customary
form) to repay such advances if it is determined in a final, non-appealable
judgment of a Chosen Court that such Company Indemnified Party is not entitled
to indemnification hereunder.

 

(b) Subject to the following sentence, prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, obtain and fully pay the
premium for "tail" insurance policies for the extension of (i) the directors
and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing directors and
officers insurance policies and (ii) the Companys existing fiduciary
liability insurance policies, in each case, for a claims reporting or
discovery period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time (the "
_Tail Period_ ") from one (1) or more insurance carriers with the same or
better credit rating as the Companys insurance carrier as of the date of this
Agreement with respect to directors and officers liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are at least as favorable to the insureds as the
Companys existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement
or the Merger); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be obligated to
expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of three-hundred percent
(300%) of the aggregate annual premium paid as of the date hereof by the
Company for such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if such premiums for
such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then Parent shall
cause to be maintained, in Parents good faith determination, policies of
insurance that provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium
equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, the Company, in
consultation with, but only upon the consent of, Parent, may (and, at the
request of Parent, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to)
obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six (6)-year "tail" policy under
the Companys existing directors and officers insurance policy providing
equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the
extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate,
does not exceed the Premium Cap.

 



-72- 

    

(c) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall survive the
Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives. The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which a Company Indemnified Party is
entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise. For the avoidance of
doubt, to the extent required by any agreement previously entered into by the
Company in connection with a merger, acquisition or other business
combination, the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall apply to
directors, officers, employees and fiduciaries of predecessor entities
previously acquired by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(d) The obligations of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Company
under this  _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall not be terminated or modified after
the Effective Time in a manner so as to adversely affect any Company
Indemnified Party or any other person entitled to the benefit of this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.6_ without the prior written consent of the affected Company
Indemnified Party. In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or
any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
a majority of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each
such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to
the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_.

 

(e) During the Tail Period, all rights to indemnification and exculpation
from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time and rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in
favor of any Company Indemnified Party as provided in the Company Charter, the
Company Bylaws or any organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary or
any indemnification agreement between such Company Indemnified Party and the
Company or a Company Subsidiary, in each case, as in effect on the date of
this Agreement, shall survive the Effective Time unchanged and shall not
be amended, restated, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect any right thereunder of any such Company Indemnified Party.

 

6.7 _Advice of Changes_. Parent and the Company shall each promptly advise
the other party of any fact, change, event or circumstance known to it (a)
that has had or would reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect
on it or (b) which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or
constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained herein or that reasonably would be expected to give rise,
either individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in
_Article VII_ ; _provided_ that any failure to give notice in accordance with
the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a
violation of this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ or the failure of any condition set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ or  _7.3_ to be satisfied, or otherwise
constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such
notice, in each case, unless the underlying breach would independently result
in a failure of the conditions set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ or _7.3_ to
be satisfied.

 



-73- 

    

6.8 _Corporate Governance_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all actions necessary
(including by securing and causing to be delivered to Parent (with evidence
thereof provided to the Company) the resignations of applicable then-serving
directors of the Parent Board, as necessary) to cause:

 

(i) the number of directors that will comprise the full Parent Board at the
Effective Time to be ten (10), to the extent not already ten (10); and

(ii) the Parent Board at the Effective Time to be comprised of (A) six (6)
directors of Parent as of immediately prior to the Effective Time designated

the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time designated by the
Company (each, a " _Company Designated Director_ "), consisting of two
independent directors of the Company, one director of the Company designated
by and affiliated with the Stockholder in accordance with the Shareholder
Agreement and the Chief Executive Officer of the Company as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the " _Company CEO_ "), and all of the Company
Designated Directors shall be appointed, elected and approved as directors of
the Parent Board effective as of the Effective Time by a vote of at least a
majority of the Parent Board in office as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the parties shall take all actions
necessary to cause (i) the Parent CEO to be appointed as the Chairman of the
Parent Board and (ii) a Parent Designated Director designated by Parent to be
appointed as the Lead Director of the Parent Board, in each case, effective at
the Effective Time and pursuant to, and in accordance with, the Amended

transactions contemplated hereby are not contingent on Parents ability to
obtain the Financing or any specific term with respect to such Financing. To
the extent Parent obtains Alternative Financing pursuant to this _Section_ __

(a) by mutual consent of Parent and the Company in a written instrument;

 

(b) by either Parent or the Company if (i) any Governmental Entity

Merger and such denial has become final and non-appealable or (ii) any
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final non-

terminate this Agreement or to extend the Termination Date, as applicable;

set forth in _Article III_ on the part of the Company, in the case of a

true, either individually or in the aggregate with all other breaches

(f) Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these

if either Parent or the Company fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_, and, in order to obtain such payment, the
Company or Parent, as applicable, commences a suit which results in a final,
non-appealable judgment of a Chosen Court against Parent or the Company, as
applicable, for the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, Parent or the
Company, as applicable, shall pay the costs and expenses of the Company or
Parent, as applicable (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), in
connection with such suit. In addition, if either Parent or the Company, as
applicable, fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
8.2_, then such party shall pay interest on such overdue amounts (for the
period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally
required to be paid and ending on the date that such overdue amount is
actually paid in full) at a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as
announced by Citibank, N.A. or any successor thereto) in effect on the date on
which such payment was required to be made for the period commencing as of the
date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid. The parties
hereto further acknowledge and agree that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_
shall be deemed to affect their right to specific performance under 
_Section_ __ _ 9.13_.

9.11 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any applicable conflicts of

duties of the Parent Board shall be governed and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of Wisconsin).

(b) Each party agrees that it will bring any action or proceeding in
respect of any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware (or, only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York located in New York, New
York or, if such court declines to accept jurisdiction, then any court of
the State of New York sitting in the borough of Manhattan) (the " _Chosen
Courts_ "), and, solely in connection with claims arising under this Agreement
or the transactions that are the subject of this Agreement, (i)
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (ii)
waives any objection to laying venue in any such action or proceeding in the

be effective if notice is given in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.5_.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, all
claims or causes of action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise) against any of the Financing Parties in any way relating to this
Agreement, the Financing, the Commitment Letter or any other agreement
relating to the Financing, or the performance thereof or the financings
contemplated thereby shall, except as specifically set forth in the Commitment
Letter, be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
internal laws of the State of New York, without regard to the conflict of
law principles thereof to the extent that such principles would have the
effect of applying the laws of, or directing a matter to, another
jurisdiction, and each party agrees not to bring or support any person in any
action of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of the Financing Parties in any
way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Financing, the Commitment Letter or any other agreement relating to the
Financing, or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby,
in any forum other than the federal and New York state courts located in the
Borough of Manhattan within the City of New York.

9.12 _Assignment; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any
of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the
prior written consent of the other party. Any purported assignment
in contravention hereof shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns. Except
as otherwise

 



-99- 

    

specifically provided in _Section 6.6_ , which is intended to benefit each
Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives, and
_Section 9.16_, which is intended to benefit each Non-Recourse Party to the
extent set forth therein, this Agreement (including the documents and
instruments referred to herein) is not intended to and does not confer upon
any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder,
including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth
herein. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product
of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject
to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance herewith without notice or
liability to any other person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge
of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the parties
may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date. Except as provided in Section 6.6,
notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, no
consent, approval or agreement of any third party beneficiary will be required
to amend, modify or waive any provision of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, each of the Financing Parties shall be an express third-party
beneficiary of and shall be entitled to rely on the last sentence of _Section
9.2_ , _Section 9.10_ , _Section 9.11(c)_ , this sentence of this _Section
9.12_  and _Section 9.16(a)_ and each of the Financing Parties may enforce
such provisions.

9.13 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly,
the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms of this
Agreement, including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof (including the parties obligation to consummate the
Merger), in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or
in equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any
action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate
and (b) any requirement under any law to post security or a bond as a
prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

 

9.14 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law in any jurisdiction,
such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other
provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement
shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction such that
the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion thereof shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

 

9.15 _Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission_. This Agreement
and any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this
Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent
executed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery
of a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as
an original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. No party 

 



-100- 

    

 hereto or to any such agreement or instrument shall raise the use of a
facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file to deliver
a signature to this Agreement or any amendment hereto or the fact that any
signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through
the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data
file as a defense to the formation of a contract and each party hereto forever
waives any such defense.

 

9.16 _No Recourse_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or implied in this
Agreement or any document, agreement, or instrument delivered
contemporaneously herewith, in no event shall any Financing Party have any
liability or obligation to, or be subject to any action, suit, proceeding or
claim from the Company, its affiliates, or it or its affiliates respective
former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers,

_Company Parties_ ") in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, including any Financing, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise, and none of Company Parties will have any
rights or claims against any Financing Party (solely in its capacity as a
Financing Party) under this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated by,
or entered into in connection with the transactions contemplated by, this
Agreement, including any commitments by the Financing Sources in respect of
financing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or implied in this
Agreement or any document or instrument delivered in connection herewith
(other than any letter of transmittal, the Voting and Support Agreement, the
Shareholder Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement and a certain

persons other than the Company have any liabilities, obligations, commitments
(whether known or unknown or whether contingent or otherwise) hereunder, and
that, no persons other than the Company have any liabilities, obligations,

hereunder, and that, notwithstanding that the Stockholder and its affiliates
or their respective managing members or general partners may be partnerships
or limited liability companies, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any right
of recovery under this Agreement, or any claim based on such liabilities,
obligations, commitments against, and no personal liability shall attach to,
any Non-Recourse Party of the Company, through the Company or otherwise,
whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through
a claim by or on behalf of the Company against any Non-Recourse Party of the
Company, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable
proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or Law, or otherwise; and

 

(ii) The Company covenants, agrees and acknowledges that no persons other
than Parent and Merger Sub have any liabilities, obligations, commitments

 (whether known or unknown or whether contingent or otherwise) hereunder, and
that, no persons other than Parent and Merger Sub have any liabilities,
obligations, commitments (whether known or unknown or whether contingent or
otherwise) hereunder, and that, the Company does not have any right of
recovery under this Agreement, or any claim based on such liabilities,
obligations, commitments against, and no personal liability shall attach to,
any Non-Recourse Party of Parent or Merger Sub, through Parent or Merger Sub
or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate veil,
by or through a claim by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub against any
Non-Recourse Party of Parent or Merger Sub, by the enforcement of any
assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute,
regulation or Law, or otherwise.

respect any party, means (i) any former, current or future equity holders,
controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates,
members, managers or general or limited partners of any of such person,

FISERV, INC. 

ARTICLE I

 

 _OFFICES_

The registered office of the Corporation in the State of Wisconsin shall be
located in the City of Brookfield, County of Waukesha. The Corporation may
establish or discontinue, from time to time, such other offices within or
without the State of Wisconsin as may be deemed proper for the conduct of the
Corporations business.

ARTICLE II

 

 _MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS_

 

Section 1. _Place of Meetings_. All meetings of shareholders shall be held
at such place or places, within or without the State of Wisconsin, as may
from time to time be fixed by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the
Board or the Chief Executive Officer, or as shall be specified in the
respective notices, or waivers of notice, thereof. Any meeting may be
postponed or adjourned pursuant to Section 8 of this Article II to reconvene
at any place designated by vote of the Board of Directors or by the Chairman
of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer.

 

Section 2. _Annual Meeting_. The annual meeting of shareholders (the
"Annual Meeting") shall be held on such date and at such time as may be fixed
by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive
Officer. In fixing a meeting date for any Annual Meeting, the Board of
Directors, the Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer may
consider such factors as it, he or she deems relevant within the good faith
exercise of its, his or her business judgment. At each Annual Meeting, the
shareholders shall elect individuals to the Board of Directors in
accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Corporation.
At any such Annual Meeting, only other business properly brought before the
Annual Meeting by the Board of Directors or in accordance with Section 5 of
this Article II may be transacted.

Section 3. _Special Meetings_.

 

(a) A special meeting of the shareholders (a "Special Meeting") may be
called only by (i) a majority of the Board of Directors, (ii) the Chairman of
the Board or (iii) the Chief Executive Officer. The Board of Directors, the
Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer shall call a Special
Meeting upon the demand, in accordance with this Section 3, of the holders of
record representing at least 10% of all the votes entitled to be cast on any
issue proposed to be considered at the Special Meeting (a "Demand Special
Meeting").

   

(b) To enable the Corporation to determine the shareholders entitled to
demand a Demand Special Meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date
to determine the shareholders entitled to make such a demand (the "Demand
Record Date"). The Demand Record Date shall not precede the date on which the
Board of Directors adopts the resolution fixing the Demand Record Date and
shall not be more than ten days after the date on which the resolution fixing
the Demand Record Date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any shareholder
of record entitled to demand a Demand Special Meeting who is seeking to have
shareholders demand a Demand Special Meeting shall, by sending written notice
to the Secretary at the principal offices of the Corporation, by hand or by
certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, request the Board of
Directors to fix a Demand Record Date. The Board of Directors shall promptly,
but in all events within ten days after the date on which a valid request to
fix a Demand Record Date is received and verified, adopt a resolution fixing
the Demand Record Date and shall make a public announcement of such Demand
Record Date. If no Demand Record Date has been fixed by the Board of Directors
within ten days after the date on which such request is received and verified
by the Secretary at the principal offices of the Corporation, then the Demand
Record Date shall be the tenth day after the first date on which a valid
written request to set a Demand Record Date is received and verified by the
Secretary at the principal offices of the Corporation. To be valid, such
written request shall set forth the purpose or purposes for which the Demand
Special Meeting is to be held, shall be signed by one or more shareholders of
record and by the beneficial owner or owners, if any, on whose behalf the
request is made, shall bear the date of signature of each such shareholder and
any such beneficial owner and shall set forth all information, including about
each such shareholder and any such beneficial owner, that would be required
to be set forth in a shareholders notice described in Section 5(a)(ii) of
this Article II as if the notice related to an Annual Meeting.

 

(c) For a shareholder or shareholders to demand a Demand Special Meeting, a
written demand or demands for a Demand Special Meeting by the holders of
record as of the Demand Record Date of shares representing at least 10% of all
the votes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be considered at the
Demand Special Meeting, calculated as if the Demand Record Date were the
record date for the Demand Special Meeting, must be delivered to the Secretary
at the principal offices of the Corporation. To be valid, each written demand
by a shareholder for a Demand Special Meeting (i) shall set forth
the specific purpose or purposes for which the Demand Special Meeting is to
be held (which purpose or purposes shall be limited to the purpose or purposes
set forth in the written request to set a Demand Record Date received by the
Corporation pursuant to the foregoing Section 3(b)), (ii) shall be signed by
one or more Persons who as of the Demand Record Date are shareholders of
record of at least 10% of all the votes entitled to be cast on any issue
proposed to be considered at the Demand Special Meeting and by the beneficial
owners, if any, on whose behalf the demand is made, (iii) shall bear the date
of signature of each such shareholder and any such beneficial owner, (iv)
shall set forth the name and address of each such shareholder (as they appear
in the Corporations books) and any such beneficial owner signing such demand
and the Share Information (as defined in Section 5(a)(ii) of this Article II)
for each such shareholder and any such beneficial owner, (v) shall be sent to
the Secretary at the principal offices of the Corporation, by hand or by
certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, and (vi) shall be
received by the Secretary at the principal offices of the Corporation within
seventy days after the Demand Record Date.

(d) The Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board and the
Chief Executive Officer shall not be required to call a Demand Special
Meeting unless, in addition to the documents required by the foregoing Section
3(c), the Secretary receives a written agreement, which may require furnishing
of a bond, signed by each Soliciting Shareholder (as defined below) pursuant
to which each Soliciting Shareholder, jointly and severally, agrees to pay the
Corporations costs of holding the Demand Special Meeting, including the costs
of preparing and mailing proxy materials for the Corporations own
solicitation, provided that if each of the resolutions introduced by any
Soliciting Shareholder at such meeting is adopted, and each of the individuals
nominated by or on behalf of any Soliciting Shareholder for election as a
director at such meeting is elected, then the Soliciting Shareholders shall
not be required to pay such costs. For purposes of these By-Laws, the
following terms shall have the respective meanings set forth below:

(i) "Affiliate" of any Person (as defined herein) shall mean any
Person controlling, controlled by or under common control with such first
Person.

(ii) "Business Day" shall mean any day other than a Saturday, a Sunday or
a day on which banking institutions in the State of Wisconsin are authorized
or obligated by law or executive order to close.

 

(iii) "Participant" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in
Rule 14a-12 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the "Exchange Act").

 

(iv) "Person" shall mean any individual, firm, corporation, partnership,
joint venture, association, trust, unincorporated organization or other
entity.

(v) "Proxy" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Rule 14a-1
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

(vi) "Solicitation" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Rule
14a-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

(vii) "Soliciting Shareholder" shall mean, with respect to any Demand
Special Meeting, each of the following Persons:

(A) if the number of shareholders signing the demand or demands of meeting
delivered to the Secretary at the principal offices of the Corporation
pursuant to the foregoing Section 3(c) is ten or fewer, each Person signing
any such demand; or

 

(B) if the number of shareholders signing the demand or demands of meeting
delivered to the Corporation pursuant to the foregoing Section 3(c) is more
than ten, each Person who either (I) was a Participant in any Solicitation of
such

 



3

    

 demand or demands or (II) at the time of the delivery to the Secretary at
the principal offices of the Corporation of the documents described in the
foregoing Section 3(c) had engaged or intends to engage in any Solicitation
of Proxies for use at such Demand Special Meeting (other than a Solicitation
of Proxies on behalf of the Corporation).

 

A "Soliciting Shareholder" shall also mean each Affiliate of a Soliciting
Shareholder described in clause (A) or (B) above who is a member of such
Soliciting Shareholders "group" for purposes of Rule 13d-5(b) under the
Exchange Act, and any other Affiliate of such a Soliciting Shareholder, if a
majority of the directors then in office determines, reasonably and in good
faith, that such Affiliate should be required to sign the written notice
described in the foregoing Section 3(c) and/or the written agreement described
in this Section 3(d) to prevent the purposes of this Section 3 from being
evaded.

(e) Except as provided in the following sentence, any Special
Meeting shall be held at such date and time as may be designated by whichever
of the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive
Officer shall have called such meeting. In the case of any Demand Special
Meeting, such meeting shall be held at such date and time as may be
designated by whichever of the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board
or the Chief Executive Officer shall have called such meeting upon a demand in
accordance with this Section 3; provided, however, that the date of any
Demand Special Meeting shall be not more than seventy days after the Meeting
Record Date (as defined in Section 6(a) of this Article II); and provided
further that in the event that the directors, Chairman of the Board or the
Chief Executive Officer then in office fail(s) to designate a date and time
for a Demand Special Meeting within ten days after the date that valid written
demands for such meeting by the holders of record as of the Demand Record Date
of shares representing at least 10% of all the votes entitled to be cast on
any issue proposed to be considered at the Demand Special Meeting, calculated
as if the Demand Record Date were the record date for the Demand Special
Meeting, are delivered to the Corporation (the "Delivery Date"), then such
meeting shall be held at 10:00 A.M., local time, on the 100th day after the
Delivery Date or, if such 100th day is not a Business Day, on the first
preceding Business Day. In fixing a meeting date for any Special Meeting or
Demand Special Meeting, the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board or
the Chief Executive Officer may consider such factors as it, he or she deems
relevant within the good faith exercise of its, his or her business judgment,
including, without limitation, the nature of the action proposed to be taken,
the facts and circumstances surrounding any demand for such meeting and any
plan of the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board or the
Chief Executive Officer to call an Annual Meeting or Special Meeting for the
conduct of related business.

(f) The Corporation may engage regionally or nationally recognized
independent inspectors of elections to act as an agent of the Corporation for
the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of any
purported written demand or demands for a Demand Special Meeting received by
the Secretary. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such
review, no purported demand shall be deemed to have been delivered to the
Corporation until the earlier of (i) five Business Days following receipt by
the Secretary of such purported demand and (ii) such date as the independent
inspectors certify to the Corporation that the valid demands received by

 



4

    

 the Secretary represent at least 10% of all the votes entitled to be cast on
any issue proposed to be considered at the Demand Special Meeting, calculated
as if the Demand Record Date were the record date for the Demand Special
Meeting. Nothing contained in this Section 3(f) shall in any way be construed
to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board or
the Chief Executive Officer or any shareholder shall not be entitled to
contest the validity of any demand, whether during or after such five Business
Day period, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the
commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto).

Section 4. _Notice of Meetings_.

 

(a) Written notice stating the place, day and time of an Annual Meeting or
a Special Meeting shall be delivered not less than ten days nor more than
seventy days before the date of the meeting (unless a different date is
required by law or the Articles of Incorporation), by or at the direction of
the Chairman of the Board or the Secretary, to each shareholder of record
entitled to vote at such meeting and to such other Persons as are required by
the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law. In the event of any Demand Special
Meeting, such notice of meeting shall be sent prior to the later of (i) the
two days after the Meeting Record Date for such Demand Special Meeting and
(ii) thirty days after the Delivery Date. For purposes of this Section 4,
notice by "electronic transmission" (as defined in the Wisconsin Business
Corporation Law) is written notice. Written notice pursuant to this Section 4
shall be deemed to be effective (x) when mailed, if mailed postpaid and
addressed to the shareholders address shown in the Corporations current
record of shareholders or (y) when electronically transmitted to the
shareholder in a manner authorized by the shareholder.

 

(b) Except as provided in the following sentence, in the case of any
Special Meeting, the notice of meeting shall describe any business that the
Board of Directors shall have theretofore determined to bring before the
meeting and, if applicable, shall contain the information required in the
notice received by the Corporation in accordance with Section 5(b) of this
Article II. In the case of a Demand Special Meeting, the notice of meeting (i)
shall describe any business set forth in the statement of purpose of the
demands received by the Corporation in accordance with Section 3 of
this Article II, (ii) if applicable, shall contain all of the information
required in the notice received by the Corporation in accordance with Section
5(b) of this Article II and (iii) shall describe any business that the Board
of Directors shall have theretofore determined to bring before the Demand
Special Meeting. Except as otherwise provided in these By-Laws, in the
Articles of Incorporation or in the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, the
notice of an Annual Meeting need not include a description of the purpose or
purposes for which the meeting is called.

 

(c) If any Annual Meeting, Special Meeting or Demand Special Meeting is
adjourned to a different date, time or place, then the Corporation shall not
be required to give notice of the new date, time or place if the new date,
time or place is announced at the meeting before adjournment; provided,
however, that if a new Meeting Record Date for an adjourned meeting is or
must be fixed, then the Corporation shall give notice of the adjourned meeting
to Persons who are shareholders as of the new Meeting Record Date.

Section 5. _Notice of Shareholder Business and Nomination of Directors_.

(a) _Annual Meetings_.

 

(i) Subject to Article IX of these By-Laws, nominations of persons for
election to the Board of Directors and the proposal of other business to be
considered by the shareholders may be made at an Annual Meeting (A) pursuant
to the Corporations notice of meeting, (B) by or at the direction of the
Board of Directors, (C) by any shareholder of the Corporation who (1) is a
shareholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this
Section 5(a) and until and at the time of the Annual Meeting, (2) is entitled
to vote with respect to such nomination or other business at the meeting
under the Articles of Incorporation and (3) complies with the notice
procedures set forth in this Section 5(a) as to such nomination or other
business or (D) with respect to nominations by any shareholder of the
Corporation who is eligible under, and complies with the notice procedures set
forth in, Section 14 of this Article II. The preceding clauses (C) and (D)
shall be the exclusive means for a shareholder to make nominations or submit
other business (other than matters properly brought under Rule 14a-8 under the
Exchange Act and included in the Corporations notice of meeting) before an
Annual Meeting.

(ii) For nominations or any other business to be properly brought before an
Annual Meeting by a shareholder pursuant to the foregoing Section 5(a)(i)(C),
the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the
Secretary and such other business must otherwise be a proper matter for
shareholder action. To be timely, a shareholders notice shall be received by
the Secretary at the principal offices of the Corporation not less than forty-
five days nor more than seventy days prior to the first annual anniversary of
the date set forth in the Corporations proxy statement for the immediately
preceding Annual Meeting as the date on which the Corporation first made
available to its shareholders definitive proxy materials for the immediately
preceding Annual Meeting (the "Anniversary Date"); provided, however, that if
the date for which the Annual Meeting is called is more than thirty days
before or more than thirty days after the first annual anniversary of the
immediately preceding Annual Meeting, then notice by the shareholder to
be timely must be received by the Secretary not earlier than the close of
business on the 100th day prior to the date of such Annual Meeting and not
later than the later of (A) the 75th day prior to the date of such Annual
Meeting or (B) the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of
the date of such Annual Meeting is first made. In no event shall any
adjournment or postponement of an Annual Meeting or the announcement thereof
commence a new time period for the giving of a shareholder notice as
described above. Such shareholders notice (whether given pursuant to this
Section 5(a)(ii) or Section 5(b)) to the Secretary shall be signed by the
shareholder of record who intends to make the nomination or introduce the
other business and by the beneficial owner or owners, if any, on whose behalf
the shareholder is acting, shall bear the date of signature of such
shareholder and any such beneficial owner and shall set forth: (I) the name
and address of such shareholder (as they appear on the Corporations books)
and any such beneficial owner; (II) the Share Information (which Share
Information required by this clause (II) shall be supplemented by such
shareholder and any such beneficial owner not later than ten days after the
Meeting Record Date to

 



6

    

 disclose such Share Information as of the Meeting Record Date); (III) a
representation that such shareholder is a holder of record of shares of the
Corporation entitled to vote under the Articles of Incorporation at such
meeting with respect to such nomination or other business and intends to
appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to make such nomination or
introduce such other business; (IV) any other information relating to such
shareholder and any such beneficial owner that would be required to be
disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in
connection with solicitations of proxies for, as applicable, the proposal
and/or for the election of directors in a contested election pursuant to
Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder; (V) in the case of any proposed nomination for election or re-
election as a director, (1) the name and residence address of the person or
persons to be nominated, (2) a description of all agreements, arrangements or
understandings between such shareholder and any such beneficial owner and
each nominee and any other Person or Persons (naming such Person or Persons)
pursuant to which the nomination is to be made by such shareholder and any
such beneficial owner, including without limitation any arrangement or
understanding with any Person as to how such nominee, if elected as a director
of the Corporation, will act or vote on any issue or question, (3) a
description of all direct and indirect compensation and other material
monetary agreements, arrangements and understandings during the past three
years, and any other material relationships, between or among such shareholder
and any such beneficial owner and their respective Affiliates and associates,
or others acting in concert therewith, on the one hand, and each proposed
nominee, and his or her respective Affiliates and associates, or others acting
in concert therewith, on the other hand, including, without limitation, all
information that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Rule 404
promulgated under Regulation S-K if the shareholder making the nomination and
any beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination is made, or any Affiliate
or associate thereof or Person acting in concert therewith, were the
"registrant" for purposes of such rule and the nominee were a director or
executive officer of such registrant, (4) such other information regarding
each nominee proposed by such shareholder and any such beneficial owner as
would be required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for contested
elections of directors, or would be otherwise required to be disclosed, in
each case pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, and (5) the written consent of each
nominee to be named in a proxy statement and to serve as a director of the
Corporation if so elected; (VI) in the case of any proposed removal of a
director, (1) the names of the directors to be removed and (2) the reasons of
such shareholder and any such beneficial owner for asserting that such
directors should be removed; and (VII) in the case of any other business that
such shareholder and any such beneficial owner propose to bring before the
meeting, (1) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before
the meeting and, if such business includes a proposal to amend these By-Laws,
the language of the proposed amendment, (2) the reasons of such shareholder
and any such beneficial owner for conducting such business at the meeting, (3)
any material interest in such business of such shareholder and any such
beneficial owner and (4) a description of all agreements, arrangements or
understandings between such shareholder and any such beneficial owner and any
other Person or Persons (naming such Person or Persons) in connection with
the proposal of such business by such shareholder. In the case of any proposed
nomination for election or

 



7

    

 re-election as a director, the Corporation may require any proposed nominee
to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by
the Corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to
serve as an independent director of the Corporation or that could be material
to a reasonable shareholders understanding of the independence, or lack
thereof, of such nominee.

For purposes of these By-Laws, the term "Share Information" shall mean (1)
the class or series and number of shares of the Corporation that are owned,
directly or indirectly, of record and/or beneficially by a shareholder, any
beneficial owner on whose behalf the shareholder is acting and any of their
respective Affiliates, (2) any option, warrant, convertible security, stock
appreciation right or similar right with an exercise or conversion privilege
or a settlement payment or mechanism at a price related to any class or series
of shares of the Corporation or with a value derived in whole or in part from
the value of any class or series of shares of the Corporation, whether or not
such instrument or right shall be subject to settlement in the underlying
class or series of capital stock of the Corporation or otherwise (a
"Derivative Instrument) directly or indirectly owned beneficially by such
shareholder, any such beneficial owner and any of their respective Affiliates,
and any other direct or indirect opportunity to profit or share in any profit
derived from any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the
Corporation, (3) any proxy, contract, arrangement, understanding, or
relationship pursuant to which such shareholder has a right to vote
any shares of any security of the Corporation, (4) any short interest in any
security of the Corporation (for purposes of this By-Law a Person shall be
deemed to have a short interest in a security if such Person directly or
indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or
otherwise, has the opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from
any decrease in the value of the subject security), (5) any rights
to dividends on the shares of the Corporation owned beneficially by such
shareholder that are separated or separable from the underlying shares of the
Corporation, (6) any proportionate interest in shares of the Corporation or
Derivative Instruments held, directly or indirectly, by a general or limited
partnership in which such shareholder or beneficial owner is a general partner
or, directly or indirectly, beneficially owns an interest in a general partner
and (7) any performance-related fees (other than asset-based fee) that such
shareholder, any such beneficial owner and any of their respective affiliates
are entitled to based on any increase or decrease in the value of shares of
the Corporation or Derivative Instruments, if any, as of the date of such
notice, including without limitation any such interests held by members of
such Persons immediate family sharing the same household.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of the foregoing
Section 5(a)(ii) to the contrary, if the number of directors to be elected to
the Board of Directors is increased and there is no public announcement naming
all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board
of Directors made by the Corporation at least forty-five days prior to the
Anniversary Date, then a shareholders notice required by this Section 5 shall
also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new
positions created by such increase, if it shall be received by the Secretary
at the principal offices of the Corporation not later than the close of
business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement
is first made by the Corporation.

(b) _Special Meetings_. Only such business shall be conducted at a
Special Meeting as shall have been described in the Corporations notice of
meeting sent to shareholders pursuant to the foregoing Section 4\. Nominations
of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a Special
Meeting at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the Corporations
notice of meeting (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii)
provided that the Board of Directors has determined that directors shall be
elected at such Special Meeting, by any shareholder of the Corporation who
(A) is a shareholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in
this Section 5(b) and until and at the time of such Special Meeting, (B) is
entitled to vote with respect to such nominations at the meeting under the
Articles of Incorporation and (C) complies with the notice procedures set
forth in this Section 5(b) as to such nomination. In the event the Board of
Directors, the Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer calls a
Special Meeting for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board
of Directors, any shareholder permitted to nominate persons for election to
the Board of Directors pursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding sentence who
desires to nominate persons for election to such position(s) at such a Special
Meeting as specified in the Corporations notice of meeting shall cause a
written notice described in Section 5(a)(ii) of this Article II (as if the
nomination related to an Annual Meeting) to be received by the Secretary at
the principal offices of the Corporation not earlier than ninety days prior to
such Special Meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of
(I) the 60th day prior to such Special Meeting and (II) the 10th day following
the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of such Special
Meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected
at such meeting. In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of a
Special Meeting or the announcement thereof commence a new time period for the
giving of a shareholders notice as described above.

 

(c) _General_.

 

(i) Subject to Article IX of these By-Laws, only persons who are nominated
by the Board of Directors or in accordance with the procedures set forth in
this Section 5 or Section 14 of this Article II shall be eligible to be
elected as directors at an Annual Meeting or Special Meeting. Only such
business shall be conducted at an Annual Meeting or a Special Meeting, other
than a Demand Special Meeting, as shall have been brought before such meeting
by the Board of Directors or in accordance with the procedures set forth in
this Section 5\. Only such business shall be conducted at a Demand Special
Meeting as shall have been set forth in the statement of purpose of the
demands received by the Corporation in accordance with Section 3 of this
Article II or as shall have been brought before the Demand Special Meeting as
determined by the Board of Directors. The chairman of the meeting shall have
the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed
to be brought before the meeting was made in accordance with the procedures
set forth in this Section 5 or Section 14 of this Article II and, if any
proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with this Section 5 or
Section 14 of this Article II, as the case may be, to declare that such
defective proposal shall be disregarded.

 



9

    

(ii) For purposes of this Section 5, "public announcement" shall mean
disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service,
Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly
filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5, a
shareholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set
forth in this Section 5\. Nothing in this Section 5 shall be deemed to limit
the Corporations obligation to include shareholder proposals in its proxy
statement if such inclusion is required by Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 6. _Fixing of Record Date_.

 

(a) The Board of Directors may fix in advance a date not less than ten days
and not more than seventy days prior to the date of an Annual Meeting or
Special Meeting as the record date for the determination of shareholders
entitled to notice of, or to vote at, such meeting (the "Meeting Record
Date"). In the case of any Demand Special Meeting, (i) the Meeting Record
Date shall be not later than the 30th day after the Delivery Date and (ii) if
the Board of Directors fails to fix the Meeting Record Date within thirty days
after the Delivery Date, then the close of business on such 30th day shall be
the Meeting Record Date. The shareholders of record on the Meeting Record Date
shall be the shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual
Meeting, Special Meeting or Demand Special Meeting. When a determination
of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at the Annual Meeting,
Special Meeting or Demand Special Meeting has been made as provided in this
section, such determination shall be applied to any adjournment thereof unless
the Board of Directors fixes a new Meeting Record Date and except as
otherwise required by law. A new Meeting Record Date must be set if a meeting
is adjourned to a date more than one hundred twenty days after the date fixed
for the original meeting.

 

(b) The Board of Directors may also fix in advance a date as the record
date for the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to take any other
action or determining shareholders for any other purpose other than those set
forth in Section 3(a) of this Article II and the foregoing Section 6(a). Such
record date shall not be more than seventy days prior to the date on which
the particular action, requiring such determination of shareholders, is to be
taken. If the Board of Directors does not fix a record date for the
determination of shareholders entitled to receive a share dividend
or distribution (other than a distribution involving a purchase, redemption
or other acquisition of the Corporations shares), then the close of business
on the date on which the resolution of the Board of Directors is adopted
declaring the dividend or distribution shall be the record date.

(c) In order that the Corporation may determine the shareholders entitled
to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board
of Directors may fix a record date to determine the shareholders entitled to
express consent to

 



10

    

 corporate action in writing without a meeting (the "Consent Record Date").
The Consent Record Date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution
fixing the Consent Record Date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and such
date shall not be more than ten days after the date upon which the resolution
fixing the Consent Record Date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any
shareholder or shareholders of record who are seeking to have the
shareholders express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting
shall, by sending written notice to the Secretary of the Corporation by hand
or by certified registered mail, return receipt requested, request the Board
of Directors to fix a Consent Record Date. The Board of Directors shall
promptly, but in all events within ten days after the date on which such a
valid request is received and verified, adopt a resolution fixing the Consent
Record Date and shall make a public announcement of such Consent Record Date.
If no Consent Record Date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within ten
days after the date on which such a request is received and verified by the
Secretary, then the Consent Record Date shall be the 10th day after the first
date on which a valid written request to set a Consent Record Date is received
and verified by the Secretary. To be valid, such written request shall comply
with each of the following:

 

(i) Such written request shall be signed by one or more shareholders of
record and by the beneficial owners or owners, if any, on whose behalf the
shareholder or shareholders are acting, shall bear the date of signature of
each such shareholder and any such beneficial owner and shall set forth: (A)
the name and address, as they appear on this Corporations books, of each
such shareholder and any such beneficial owner who seeks to have the
shareholders express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting;
(B) the Share Information; (C) a representation that each such shareholder is
a holder of record of shares of the Corporation entitled to vote under the
Articles of Incorporation at a meeting of shareholders with respect to each
matter for which such shareholder is seeking to have shareholders express
consent to corporate action in a writing without a meeting; (D) any other
information relating to such shareholder and any such beneficial owner that
would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings
required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for, as
applicable, the proposal and/or for the election of directors in a contested
election pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder; (E) the manner in which each such
shareholder and any such beneficial owner intend to comply with Regulation 14A
under the Exchange Act in seeking to have the shareholders express consent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting; (F) in the case of any
such shareholder and any such beneficial owner seeking to elect or re-elect a
director by the shareholders expressing consent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting, (1) the name and residence address of the person or
persons each such shareholder and any such beneficial owner are seeking to
elect or re-elect as a director, (2) a description of all agreements,
arrangements or understandings between each such shareholder and any such
beneficial owner and each person such shareholder and any such beneficial
owner are seeking to elect or re-elect as a director and any other Person or
Persons (naming such Person or Persons) pursuant to which such shareholder
and any such beneficial owner are seeking to elect or re-elect such person as
a director including without limitation any arrangement or understanding with
any Person as to how such person, if elected or re-elected as a director of
the Corporation, will act or vote on any issue or question, (3) a description
of all direct and indirect compensation and other

 



11

    

 material monetary agreements, arrangements and understandings during the
past three years, and any other material relationships, between or among such
shareholder and any such beneficial owner and their respective Affiliates and
associates, or others acting in concert therewith, on the one hand, and each
person such shareholder and any such beneficial owner are seeking to elect or
re-elect as a director, and his or her respective Affiliates and associates,
or others acting in concert therewith, on the other hand, including, without
limitation, all information that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to
Rule 404 promulgated under Regulation S-K if such shareholder and any such
beneficial owner, or any Affiliate or associate thereof or Person acting in
concert therewith, were the "registrant" for purposes of such rule and
the person such shareholder and any such beneficial owner are seeking to
elect or re-elect as a director were a director or executive officer of such
registrant, (4) such other information regarding each person such shareholder
and any such beneficial owner are seeking to elect or re-elect as a director
as would be required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for contested
elections of directors, or would be otherwise required to be disclosed, in
each case pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, and (5) the written consent of each such
person to serve as a director of the Corporation if so elected; (G) in the
case of any such shareholder and any such beneficial owner seeking to remove a
director by the shareholders expressing consent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting, (1) the names of the director(s) each such shareholder and
any such beneficial owner are seeking to remove and (2) the reasons of each
such shareholder and any such beneficial owner for asserting that such
director(s) may be removed for cause; and (H) in the case of any such
shareholder and any such beneficial owner seeking to authorize or take any
other corporate action by the shareholders expressing consent to corporate
action in writing without a meeting, (1) a brief description of the
corporate action desired to be authorized or taken and, if such corporate
action includes an amendment to these By-Laws, the language of the proposed

beneficial owner and (4) a description of all agreements, arrangements
or understandings between such shareholder and any such beneficial owner and
any other Person or Persons (naming such Person or Persons) in connection with
the corporate action desired to be authorized or taken by such shareholder. In
the case of any such shareholder and any such beneficial owner seeking to
elect or re-elect a director by the shareholders expressing consent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Corporation may require
any person such shareholder and any such beneficial owner are seeking to
elect or re-elect as a director to furnish such other information as may
reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine the eligibility of
such person to serve as an independent director of the Corporation or that
could be material to a reasonable shareholders understanding of the
independence, or lack thereof, of such person.

 

(ii) Such written request shall be accompanied by a written agreement,
which may require furnishing of a bond, signed by each Consent Soliciting
Shareholder (as defined below) pursuant to which each Consent Soliciting
Shareholder, jointly and severally, agrees to pay the Corporations costs
relating to such Consent Soliciting Shareholder seeking to have
the shareholders express consent to corporate action in

 



12

    

 writing without a meeting, including the costs of preparing and mailing
proxy materials for the Corporations own solicitation, provided that if the
Consent Soliciting Shareholder obtains the requisite number of shares subject
to valid and unrevoked Consents (as defined in Section 11(b) of this Article
II) to express the corporate action referred to therein in accordance with
these By-Laws, then the Consent Soliciting Shareholders shall not be required
to pay such costs. For purposes of these By-Laws, "Consent Soliciting
Shareholder" shall mean each of the following Persons: (A) if the number of
shareholders signing the Consent or Consents is ten or fewer, each Person
signing any such Consents; or (B) if the number of shareholders signing the
Consent or Consents is more than ten, each Person who either (1) was a
Participant in any Solicitation of such consent or consents or (2) at the time
of the delivery to the Corporation of the documents described in this Section
6(c) had engaged or intends to engage in any Solicitation of Consents and/or
Proxies for expressing consent to corporate action in writing without a
meeting (other than a Solicitation of Consents and/or Proxies on behalf of the
Corporation).

 

A "Consent Soliciting Shareholder" shall also mean each Affiliate of a Consent
Soliciting Shareholder described in clause (A) or (B) above who is a member
of such Consent Soliciting Shareholders "group" for purposes of Rule 13d-5(b)
under the Exchange Act, and any other Affiliate of such a Consent Soliciting
Shareholder, if a majority of the directors then in office determine,
reasonably and in good faith, that such Affiliate should be required to sign
the written notice described in the foregoing Section 6(c)(i) and/or the
written agreements described in this Section 6(c)(ii) and the following
Section 6(c)(iii) to prevent the purposes of this Section 6(c) and Section 11
of this Article II from being evaded.

 

(iii) Such written request shall be accompanied by a written agreement
signed by each Consent Soliciting Shareholder pursuant to which each Consent
Soliciting Shareholder agrees to deliver to any inspectors of election engaged
by the Corporation pursuant to Section 11(d) of this Article II within two
Business Days after receipt all Consents and revocations thereof received by
such Consent Soliciting Shareholder or such Consent Soliciting Shareholders
proxy solicitor or other designated agent in connection with such Consent
Soliciting Shareholder seeking to have the shareholders express written
consent to corporate action without a meeting.

Section 7. _List of Shareholders_. It shall be the duty of the Secretary
or other officer of the Corporation who shall have charge of the stock ledger
to prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting of the
shareholders, a complete list of the shareholders entitled to vote thereat,
arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each shareholder
and the number of shares registered in his name. Such list shall be open to
the examination of any shareholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting,
during ordinary business hours, for a period beginning two Business Days
after notice of the meeting is given for which the list was prepared and
continuing to the date of the meeting, either at a place within the city where
the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of
the meeting or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be
held. The list shall be kept and produced at the time and place of the meeting
during the whole time thereof and subject to the inspection of any
shareholders who may be present. The original or duplicate ledger shall be the
only evidence as to who are the shareholders entitled to examine such list or
the books of the Corporation or to vote in person or by proxy at
such meeting.

 



13

    

Section 8. _Quorum; Postponement; Adjournments_.

 

(a) Shares entitled to vote as a separate voting group may take action on a
matter at a meeting only if a quorum of those shares exists with respect to
that matter. Except as otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation,
these By-Laws or in the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, a majority of the
votes entitled to be cast on a matter by the voting group shall constitute a
quorum of that voting group for action on that matter. Once a share is
represented for any purpose at a meeting, other than for the purpose of
objecting to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting, it
is considered present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists for
the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of the meeting unless a
new Meeting Record Date is or must be set for the adjourned meeting.

(b) The Board of Directors acting by resolution may postpone and reschedule
any previously scheduled meeting; provided, however, that a Demand Special
Meeting shall not be postponed beyond the 100th day following the Delivery
Date. Any meeting may be adjourned from time to time, whether or not there is
a quorum, (i) at any time, upon a resolution by shareholders if the votes
cast in favor of such resolution by the holders of shares of each voting group
entitled to vote on any matter theretofore properly brought before the meeting
exceed the number of votes cast against such resolution by the holders of
shares of each such voting group or (ii) at any time prior to the transaction
of any business at such meeting, by the Chairman of the Board or Chief
Executive Officer or pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors;
provided, however, that a Demand Special Meeting adjourned pursuant to clause
(ii) must be reconvened on or before the 100th day following the Delivery
Date. No notice of the time and place of adjourned meetings need be given
except as required by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law. At any
adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any
business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as
originally noticed.

 

Section 9. _Voting_. Every shareholder of record who is entitled to vote
shall at every meeting of the shareholders be entitled to one vote for each
share of stock held by him on the record date; except, however, that shares of
its own stock belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a
majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such
other corporation is held by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to
vote nor counted for quorum purposes. Nothing in this Section shall be
construed as limiting the right of the Corporation to vote its own stock held
by it in a fiduciary capacity. If a quorum exists, then action on a matter,
other than the election of directors, by a voting group is approved if the
votes cast within the voting group favoring the action exceed the votes cast
opposing the action, unless the Articles of Incorporation, these By-Laws or
the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law requires a greater number of
affirmative votes. Each director shall be elected as provided in Section 2 of
Article III. Unless demanded by a shareholder of the Corporation present in
person or by proxy at any meeting of the shareholders and entitled to vote
thereat or so directed by the

  



14

    

 chairman of the meeting or required by law, the vote thereat on any question
need not be by written ballot. On a vote by written ballot, each ballot shall
be signed by the shareholder voting, or in his name by his proxy, if there be
such proxy, and shall state the number of shares voted by him and the number
of votes to which each share is entitled.

 

Section 10. _Proxies_. At any meeting, a shareholder entitled to vote may
vote in person or by proxy. A shareholder entitled to vote at any meeting, or
to express consent or dissent in writing to any corporate action without a
meeting, may authorize another Person to act for the shareholder by appointing
the Person as a proxy. The means by which a shareholder or the shareholders
authorized officer, director, employee, agent or attorney-in-fact may
authorize another Person to act for the shareholder by appointing the Person
as proxy include:

(a) Appointment of a proxy in writing by signing or causing
the shareholders signature to be affixed to an appointment form by any
reasonable means, including, without limitation, by facsimile signature.

 

(b) Appointment of a proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission
of an electronic transmission of the appointment to the Person who will be
appointed as proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service
organization or like agent authorized to receive the transmission by the
Person who will be appointed as proxy. Every electronic transmission shall
contain, or be accompanied by, information that can be used to reasonably
determine that the shareholder transmitted or authorized the transmission of
the electronic transmission. Any Person charged with determining whether
a shareholder transmitted or authorized the transmission of the electronic
transmission shall specify the information upon which the determination is
made.

 

An appointment of a proxy is effective when a signed appointment form or an
electronic transmission of the appointment is received by the inspector
of election or the officer or agent of the Corporation authorized to tabulate
votes. Unless the appointment form or electronic transmission states that the
proxy is irrevocable and the appointment is coupled with an interest, a proxy
may be revoked at any time before it is voted, either by written notice filed
with the Secretary or the secretary of the meeting or by oral notice given by
the shareholder to the presiding officer during the meeting. The presence of a
shareholder who has made an effective proxy appointment shall not of itself
constitute a revocation. A proxy appointment is valid for eleven months unless
a different period is expressly provided in the appointment. The Board of
Directors, the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer each
shall have the power and authority to make rules as to the validity and
sufficiency of proxies.

 

Section 11. _Action without a Meeting_.

 

(a) Any action required to be taken at any Annual Meeting or Special
Meeting or any action which may be taken at any Annual Meeting or Special
Meeting may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a
vote, if a consent in writing setting forth the action so taken shall be
signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the
minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize

 



15

    

 or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote
thereon were present and voted. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate
action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be
given to those shareholders who have not consented in writing.

(b) To be valid, each expression of consent to corporate action in writing
(a "Consent") shall be in writing; shall set forth the specific corporate
action to be taken (which corporate action or actions shall be limited to the
action or actions set forth in the written request to set a Consent Record
Date received by the Corporation pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II);
shall be signed by one or more Persons who as of the Consent Record Date are
shareholders of record (or their duly authorized proxies); shall bear the
date of signature of each such shareholder (or their duly authorized proxies);
shall set forth the name and address, as they appear in the Corporations
books, of each shareholder signing such Consent and the class and number of
shares of the Corporation that are owned of record by each such shareholder;
in the case of a Person who is not a shareholder of record, shall be
accompanied by a proxy or proxies evidencing each such Persons appointment
as a proxy for the applicable shareholder of record; and shall be sent to the
inspectors of elections engaged by the Corporation pursuant to the following
Section 11(d) in accordance with the provisions of the following Section
11(e). Without limiting the foregoing, no Consent shall be valid unless,
within seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to
Section 6(c) of this Article II, Consents representing the requisite number of
shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express such corporate
action are delivered to the Corporation pursuant to this Section 11; provided,
however, that if the Corporation or a Consent Soliciting Shareholder
(whichever is soliciting Consents) has requested a Preliminary Consent Report
that is pending on such 70th day pursuant to the following Section 11(f), then
such Consents shall be valid if Consents representing the requisite number of
shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express such corporate
action are delivered to the Corporation pursuant to this Section 11 at such
time as such inspectors issue the Final Consent Report relating to the pending
Preliminary Consent Report pursuant to the following Section 11(g) or Section
11(h). The Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board or the Chief
Executive Officer shall have the power and authority to make rules that are
not inconsistent with the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law as to the
validity of Consents and revocations thereof.

(c) Consents may be revoked at any time prior to the earlier of (i)
such time as the inspectors of elections issue a Final Consent Report
pursuant to the following Section 11(g) or Section 11(h) or (ii) seventy days
after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of
this Article II by written notice delivered to (A) the Secretary, (B) any
Consent Soliciting Shareholder, (C) to a proxy solicitor or other agent
designated by the Corporation or any Consent Soliciting Shareholder and/or (D)
the inspectors of elections engaged by the Corporation pursuant to the
following Section 11(d).

(d) Within three Business Days after a Consent Record Date fixed pursuant
to Section 6(c) of this Article II, the Corporation shall (i) engage
regionally or nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections to act
as agent of the Corporation for the

 



16

    

 purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of
Consents and revocations thereof and (ii) provide notice to each Consent
Soliciting Shareholder of the identity of such inspectors and the manner in
which such Consent Soliciting Shareholder may deliver Consents and revocations
thereof to such inspectors pursuant to the following Section 11(e). Except as
provided in Section 6(c)(ii) of this Article II, the cost of retaining
inspectors of election shall be borne by the Corporation.

(e) The Corporation, the Consent Soliciting Shareholders and their
respective proxy solicitors or other designated agents shall deliver Consents
and revocations thereof to the inspectors within two Business Days after
receipt. As soon as the inspectors receive Consents and/or revocations
thereof, the inspectors shall review the Consents and revocations thereof and
shall maintain a count of the number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked
Consents. The inspectors shall keep such count confidential and shall not
reveal the count to any Person; provided, however, that, as soon as
practicable after a written request therefor by the Corporation or a Consent
Soliciting Shareholder, the inspectors shall issue a report (a "Consent
Report") to the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders stating:
(i) the number of shares subject to valid Consents; (ii) the number of shares
subject to valid revocations of Consents; (iii) the number of shares subject
to valid and unrevoked Consents; (iv) the number of shares subject to invalid
Consents; (v) the number of shares subject to invalid revocations of Consents;
(vi) whether, based on their count, the requisite number of shares subject to
valid and unrevoked Consents has been obtained to express the corporate
action specified in the Consents; and (vii) the latest date the inspectors
received Consents and revocations thereof that the inspectors reflected in
such report (the "Report Date"). 

(f) As soon as practicable after a written request therefor by the
Corporation or a Consent Soliciting Shareholder (whichever is soliciting
Consents), notice of which request shall be given to the Corporation and any
parties opposing the solicitation of Consents, if any, which request shall
state that the Corporation or the Consent Soliciting Shareholders, as the
case may be, have a good faith belief that the requisite number of shares
subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action
specified in the Consents has been received in accordance with the Articles of
Incorporation and these By-Laws, the inspectors shall issue and deliver to
the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders a preliminary Consent
Report (the "Preliminary Consent Report"); provided, however, that neither
the Corporation nor the Consent Soliciting Shareholders may request a
Preliminary Consent Report after the 70th day after the applicable Consent
Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II. Unless the
Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders shall agree to a shorter
or longer period, the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders
shall have two Business Days after receipt of the Preliminary Consent Report
to review the Consents and revocations thereof and to advise the inspectors
and the opposing parties in writing as to whether they intend to challenge the
Preliminary Consent Report.

 

(g) If no written notice of an intention to challenge a Preliminary Consent
Report is received within two Business Days after receipt of the Preliminary
Consent Report by the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders and
either (i) the date that is two Business Days after such receipt of such
Preliminary Consent Report

 (the "Cut-Off Date") is more than seventy days after the applicable Consent

Cut-Off Date is not more than seventy days after the applicable Consent Record
Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II and the requisite
number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the
corporate action specified in the Consents was obtained, then the inspectors
shall as promptly as practicable issue to the Corporation and the Consent
Soliciting Shareholders their final Consent Report (a "Final Consent
Report"), which shall contain the information included in the Preliminary
Consent Report, plus all changes in the vote totals as a result of Consents
and revocations thereof received after the Preliminary Consent Report Report
Date to the time of issuance of the Final Consent Report, if such Consents and
revocations thereof are received within seventy days after the applicable
Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II, and
a certification as to whether the requisite number of shares subject to valid
and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the
Consents was obtained. If the Cut-Off Date is not more than seventy days
after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of
this Article II and the requisite number or shares subject to valid and
unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents
was not obtained, then the inspectors shall as promptly as practicable issue
a Consent Report to the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders
and a certification that the requisite number of shares subject to valid and

was not obtained, and the Corporation or the Consent Soliciting Shareholders
(whichever is soliciting Consents) shall have the right to request again a

(h) If the Corporation or the Consent Soliciting Shareholders issue
written notice to the inspectors and the Corporation or the Consent Soliciting
Shareholders, as the case may be, of an intention to challenge a Preliminary
Consent Report within two Business Days after receipt of the
Preliminary Consent Report by the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting
Shareholders, then a challenge session shall be scheduled by the inspectors as
promptly as practicable, at which the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting
Shareholders shall have the right to object to the validity of Consents and
revocations thereof. A transcript of the challenge session shall be recorded
by a certified court reporter. Following completion of the challenge session,
if either (i) the date on which the challenge session is completed (the
"Completion Date") is more than seventy days after the applicable Consent
Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II or (ii) the
Completion Date is not more than seventy days after the applicable Consent
Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II and the
requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express
the corporate action specified in the Consents was obtained, then the
inspectors shall as promptly as practicable issue to the Corporation and the
Consent Soliciting Shareholders a Final Consent Report, which shall contain
the information included in the Preliminary Consent Report, plus all changes
in the vote totals as a result of the challenge and, if such Consents and
revocations thereof are received within seventy days after the applicable

Consents and revocations thereof received after the Preliminary Consent
Report Report Date to the time of issuance of the Final Report, and a
certification as to whether the requisite number of

 



18

    

 shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate
action specified in the Consents was obtained. If the Completion Date is not
more than seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed
pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II and the requisite number of shares
subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action
specified in the Consents was not obtained, then the inspectors shall as

provisions of the foregoing Section 11(f).

(i) Simultaneously with the delivery of any Final Consent Report to the
Corporation pursuant to the foregoing Section 11(g) or Section 11(4), the
inspectors shall deliver all valid and unrevoked Consents to the Corporation,
which shall constitute delivery of such Consents to the Corporation for
purposes of Section 180.0704 of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law and
the Articles of Incorporation. A copy of any Final Consent Report shall be
included in the book in which the proceedings of meetings of shareholders are
recorded.

 

(j) As to any Consent, if, prior to the issuance of a Final Consent Report
and delivery of Consents to the Corporation, all Consent Soliciting
Shareholders notify the Corporation and the inspectors in writing that such
Consent Soliciting Shareholders no longer desire to express consent to the
corporate actions specified in the Consents, then the Consents shall
be deemed abandoned, and the inspectors shall not issue a Final Consent
Report or deliver such Consents to the Corporation.

 

Section 12. _Acceptance of Instruments Showing Shareholder Action_. If the
name signed on a vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment corresponds to
the name of a shareholder, the Corporation, acting in good faith, may accept
the vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment and give it effect as the act
of a shareholder. If the name signed on a vote, consent, waiver or proxy
appointment does not correspond to the name of a shareholder, the Corporation,
acting in good faith, may accept the vote, consent, waiver or proxy
appointment and give it effect as the act of the shareholder if any of
the following apply:

(a) The shareholder is an entity and the name signed purports to be that of
an officer or agent of the entity.

(b) The name purports to be that of a personal representative,
administrator, executor, guardian or conservator representing the shareholder
and, if the Corporation requests, evidence of fiduciary status acceptable to
the Corporation is presented with respect to the vote, consent, waiver or
proxy appointment.

 

(c) The name signed purports to be that of a receiver or trustee in
bankruptcy of the shareholder and, if the Corporation requests, evidence of
this status acceptable to the Corporation is presented with respect to the
vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment.

 



19

    

(d) The name signed purports to be that of a pledgee, beneficial owner, or
attorney-in-fact of the shareholder and, if the Corporation requests, evidence
acceptable to the Corporation of the signatorys authority to sign for
the shareholder is presented with respect to the vote, consent, waiver or
proxy appointment.

(e) Two or more persons are the shareholders as co-tenants or fiduciaries
and the name signed purports to be the name of at least one of the co-owners
and the person signing appears to be acting on behalf of all co-owners.

The Corporation may reject a vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment if
the Secretary or other officer or agent of the Corporation who is authorized
to tabulate votes, acting in good faith, has reasonable basis for doubt about
the validity of the signature on it or about the signatorys authority to sign
for the shareholder.

Section 13. _Conduct of Meetings_. The Chairman of the Board or, in his or
her absence, the Chief Executive Officer, or in the Chief Executive Officers
absence, any other officer, shall call any Annual Meeting, Special Meeting or
Demand Special Meeting to order and shall act as chairman of the meeting, and
the Secretary shall act as secretary of all meetings of the shareholders,
but, in the absence of the Secretary, the presiding officer may appoint any
other person to act as secretary of the meeting. The Board of Directors may,
to the extent not prohibited by law, adopt by resolution such rules and
regulations for the conduct of a meeting as it shall deem appropriate. Except
to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the
Board of Directors, the chairman of the meeting shall have the right and
authority to prescribe such rules, regulations or procedures and to do such
acts as, in the judgment of the chairman of the meeting, are appropriate for
the proper conduct of a meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures,
whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the chairman of
the meeting, may to the extent not prohibited by law include, without
limitation, the following: (a) the establishment of an agenda or order of
business for the meeting; (b) rules and procedures for maintaining order at
the meeting and the safety of those present; (c) limitations on attendance at
or participation in the meeting to shareholders of record of the Corporation,
their duly authorized and constituted proxies (which shall be reasonable in
number) or such other persons as the chairman of the meeting shall determine;
(d) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the
commencement thereof; (e) limitations on the time allotted to questions or
comments by participants; (f) rules and procedures regarding the execution of
election ballots before or after the time fixed for the commencement of the
meeting; (g) the appointment of an inspector of election or an officer or

Section 14. _Shareholder Nominations Included in the Corporation_ __ _s
Proxy Materials_.

(a) _Inclusion of Nominee in Proxy Statement_. Subject to the provisions
of this Section 14, if expressly requested in the relevant Nomination Notice
(as defined below), the Corporation shall include in its proxy statement for
any Annual Meeting:

 

(i) the name of any person nominated for election (the "Nominee") to the
Board of Directors, which shall also be included on the Corporations form of
proxy and ballot for the relevant Annual Meeting, by any Eligible Holder (as
defined below) or group of up to 20 Eligible Holders that has (individually
and collectively, in the case of a group) satisfied, as determined by the
Board of Directors or its designee, acting in good faith, all applicable
conditions and complied with all applicable procedures set forth in this
Section 14 (such Eligible Holder or group of Eligible Holders being a
"Nominating Shareholder");

(ii) disclosure about the Nominee and the Nominating Shareholder required
under SEC rules or any other applicable law, rule or regulation to be included
in the proxy statement; and

 

(iii) any statement included by the Nominating Shareholder in the
Nomination Notice for inclusion in the proxy statement in support of the
Nominees election to the Board of Directors (subject, without limitation, to
Section 14(e)(ii)), if such statement does not exceed 500 words.

 

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Corporation may solicit
shareholders against any Nominee and include in its proxy statement for
any Annual Meeting any other information that the Corporation or the Board of
Directors determines, in their discretion, to include in the proxy statement
relating to the nomination of the Nominee, including without limitation any
statement in opposition to the nomination and any of the information provided
pursuant to this Section 14\.

(b) _Maximum Number of Nominees_.

(i) The Corporation shall not be required to include in the proxy statement
for an Annual Meeting more Nominees than that number of directors
constituting 20% of the total number of directors of the Corporation on the
last day on which a Nomination Notice may be submitted pursuant to Section
14(d) (the "Final Nomination Date"), rounded down to the nearest whole
number, but not less than two (the "Maximum Number"). The Maximum Number for a
particular Annual Meeting shall be reduced by (A) Nominees nominated by a
Nominating Shareholder for that Annual Meeting whose nomination is
subsequently withdrawn after the Nominating Shareholder is notified by the
Corporation that the Nominees will be included in the Corporations proxy
statement and proxy card for the Annual Meeting, (B) Nominees nominated by a
Nominating Shareholder for such Annual Meeting pursuant to this Section 14
that the Board of Directors itself decides to nominate for election at such
Annual Meeting and (C) the number of directors in office as of the Final
Nomination Date who had been

 



21

    

 Nominees nominated by a Nominating Shareholder with respect to any of the
preceding two Annual Meetings (including any Nominee who had been counted at
any such Annual Meeting pursuant to the immediately preceding clause (B)) and
whose reelection at the upcoming Annual Meeting is being recommended by the
Board of Directors. If one or more vacancies for any reason occurs on the
Board of Directors after the Final Nomination Date but before the date of the
Annual Meeting and the Board of Directors resolves to reduce the size of the
Board of Directors in connection with the occurrence of the vacancy or
vacancies, then the Maximum Number shall be calculated based on the number
of directors in office as so reduced.

(ii) Any Nominating Holder submitting more than one Nominee pursuant to
this Section 14 for an Annual Meeting shall rank such Nominees based on the
order in which the Nominating Holder desires such Nominees to be selected for
inclusion in the Corporations proxy statement for such Annual Meeting if the
number of Nominees pursuant to this Section 14 exceeds the Maximum Number. If
the number of Nominees pursuant to this Section 14 for any Annual Meeting
exceeds the Maximum Number, then the highest ranking Nominee who meets the
requirements of this Section 14 from each Nominating Holder will be selected
for inclusion in the Corporations proxy statement until the Maximum Number is
reached, going in order of the amount (largest to smallest) of the shares of
common stock of the Corporation disclosed as owned in each Nominating
Shareholders Nomination Notice.

(iii) If, after the Final Nomination Date, (A) the Corporation is
notified, or the Board of Directors or its designee, acting in good faith,
determines that (1) a Nominating Shareholder has failed to satisfy or to
continue to satisfy the eligibility requirements described in Section 14(c),
(2) any of the representations and warranties made in the Nomination Notice
cease to be true and accurate in all material respects (or omit a material
fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading) or (3) any
material violation or breach occurs of the obligations, agreements,
representations or warranties of the Nominating Shareholder or the Nominee
under this Section 14, (B) a Nominating Shareholder or any
qualified representative thereof does not appear at the Annual Meeting to
present any nomination submitted pursuant to this Section 14, or the
Nominating Shareholder withdraws its nomination, or (C) a Nominee becomes
ineligible for inclusion in the Corporations proxy statement pursuant to
this Section 14 or dies, becomes disabled or is otherwise disqualified from
being nominated for election or serving as a director of the Corporation or is
unwilling or unable to serve as a director of the Corporation, in each case
as determined by the Board of Directors or its designee, acting in good faith,
whether before or after the Corporations definitive proxy statement for such
Annual Meeting is made available to shareholders, then the nomination of the
Nominating Shareholder or such Nominee, as the case may be, shall be
disregarded and no vote on such Nominee will occur (notwithstanding that
proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation),
the Nominating Shareholder may not cure in any way any defect preventing the
nomination of the Nominee, and the Corporation (1) may omit from its proxy
statement and any ballot or form of proxy the disregarded Nominee and any
information concerning such Nominee (including a Nominating Shareholders
statement in support) or any successor or replacement nominee proposed by the
Nominating Shareholder or by any other Nominating Shareholder and (2) may 

 



22

    

 otherwise communicate to its shareholders, including without limitation by
amending or supplementing its proxy statement or ballot or form of proxy, that
the Nominee will not be included as a Nominee in the proxy statement or on
any ballot or form of proxy and will not be voted on at the Annual Meeting.

 

(c) _Eligibility of Nominating Shareholder_.

 

(i) An "Eligible Holder" is a person who has either (A) been a record
holder of the shares of the Corporations common stock used to satisfy the
eligibility requirements in this Section 14(c) continuously for the three-year
period specified in Section 14(c)(ii) or (B) provides to the Secretary of the
Corporation, within the time period referred to in Section 14(d), evidence of
continuous ownership of such shares for such three-year period from one or
more securities intermediaries in a form and in substance that the Board of
Directors or its designee, acting in good faith, determines would be deemed
acceptable for purposes of a shareholder proposal under Rule 14a-8(b)(2) under
the Exchange Act (or any successor rule).

 

(ii) An Eligible Holder or group of up to 20 Eligible Holders may submit a
nomination in accordance with this Section 14 only if the person or group (in
the aggregate) has continuously owned at least the Minimum Number (as defined
below) of shares of the Corporations common stock throughout the three-year
period preceding and including the date of submission of the Nomination
Notice and continues to own at least the Minimum Number through the date of
the Annual Meeting. A group of funds under common management and investment
control shall be treated as one Eligible Holder for purposes of such
limitation if such Eligible Holder shall provide together with the Nomination
Notice documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation that
demonstrates that the funds are under common management and investment
control. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of a nomination by a group
of Eligible Holders, any and all requirements and obligations applicable to an
individual Eligible Holder that are set forth in this Section 14, including
the minimum holding period, shall apply to each member of such group;
provided, however, that the Minimum Number shall apply to the ownership of the
group in the aggregate, and a breach of any obligation, agreement,
representation or warranty under this Section 14 by any member of a group
shall be deemed a breach by the Nominating Shareholder. If any shareholder
withdraws from a group of Eligible Holders at any time prior to the Annual
Meeting, then the group of Eligible Shareholders shall only be deemed to own
the shares held by the remaining members of the group and if, as a result of
such withdrawal, the Nominating Shareholder no longer owns the Minimum Number
of shares of the Corporations common stock, then the nomination shall be
disregarded as provided in Section 14(b)(iii).

(iii) The "Minimum Number" of shares of the Corporations common
stock means 3% of the number of outstanding shares of the Corporations
common stock as of the most recent date for which such amount is given in any
filing by the Corporation with the SEC prior to the submission of the
Nomination Notice.

 



23

    

(iv) For purposes of this Section 14, an Eligible Holder "owns" only those
outstanding shares of common stock of the Corporation as to which the Eligible
Holder possesses both:

 

(A) the full voting and investment rights pertaining to such shares; and

 

(B) the full economic interest in (including the opportunity for profit and
risk of loss on) such shares;

 

provided that the number of shares calculated in accordance with clauses (A)
and (B) shall not include any shares (1) sold by such Eligible Holder or any
of its affiliates in any transaction that has not been settled or closed, (2)
borrowed by such Eligible Holder or any of its affiliates for any purpose or
purchased by such Eligible Holder or any of its affiliates pursuant to
an agreement to resell or (3) subject to any option, warrant, forward
contract, swap, contract of sale, other derivative or similar instrument or
agreement entered into by such Eligible Holder or any of its affiliates,
whether any such instrument or agreement is to be settled with shares or with
cash based on the notional amount or value of outstanding shares of common
stock of the Corporation, in any such case which instrument or agreement has,
or is intended to have, the purpose or effect of (x) reducing in any manner,
to any extent or at any time in the future, such Eligible Holders or any of
its affiliates full right to vote or direct the voting of any such shares
and/or (y) hedging, offsetting, or altering to any degree gain or loss
arising from maintaining the full economic ownership of such shares by such
Eligible Holder or any of its affiliates. An Eligible Holder "owns" shares
held in the name of a nominee or other intermediary so long as the Eligible
Holder retains the right to instruct how the shares are voted with respect to
the election of directors and possesses the full economic interest in the
shares. An Eligible Holders ownership of shares shall be deemed to
continue during any period in which the Eligible Holder has delegated any
voting power by means of a proxy, power of attorney or other similar
instrument or arrangement that is revocable at any time by the Eligible
Holder. An Eligible Holders ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue
during any period in which the Eligible Holder has loaned such shares provided
that the Eligible Holder has the power to recall such loaned shares on five
business days notice, recalls such loaned shares upon being notified by the
Corporation that any of the Eligible Holders Nominees will be included in the
Corporations proxy statement and proxy card for the Annual Meeting (subject
to the provisions of this Section 14) and holds such shares through the date
of the Annual Meeting. The terms "owned," "owning," "ownership" and other
variations of the word "own" shall have correlative meanings. Whether
outstanding shares of the Corporation are "owned" for these purposes shall be
determined by the Board. For purposes of this Section 14, the term "affiliate"
or "affiliates" shall have the meaning ascribed thereto under the General
Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act.

(v) No person shall be permitted to be in more than one group constituting
a Nominating Shareholder, and if any person appears as a member of more than
one group, then it shall be deemed to be a member of the group that has the
largest amount of shares of common stock of the Corporation disclosed as owned
in the Nomination Notice.

 



24

    

(d) _Nomination Notice_. To nominate a Nominee for purposes of this
Section 14, the Nominating Shareholder must have given timely notice thereof
in writing to the Secretary. To be timely, a Nominating Shareholders notice
shall be received by the Secretary at the principal offices of the
Corporation not less than 120 days nor more than 150 days prior to the first
annual anniversary of the date set forth in the Corporations proxy statement
for the immediately preceding Annual Meeting as the date on which the
Corporation first made available to its shareholders definitive proxy
materials for the immediately preceding Annual Meeting; provided, however,
that if the date for which the Annual Meeting is called is more than 30 days
before or more than 30 days after the first annual anniversary of the
immediately preceding Annual Meeting, then notice by the Nominating
Shareholder to be timely must be received by the Secretary by the later of the
close of business on the date that is 180 days prior to the date of such
Annual Meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public
announcement of such Annual Meeting is first made. In no event shall any
adjournment or postponement of any Annual Meeting or the announcement thereof
commence a new time period for the giving of a Nomination Notice. To be in
proper form, a Nominating Shareholders notice to the Secretary for purposes
of this Section 14 shall include all of the following information and
documents (collectively, the "Nomination Notice"):

(i) A Schedule 14N (or any successor form) relating to the Nominee,
completed and filed with the SEC by the Nominating Shareholder as applicable,
in accordance with SEC rules;

(ii) A written notice of the nomination of such Nominee that includes the
following additional information, agreements, representations and warranties
by the Nominating Shareholder (including each group member):

pursuant to Section 5(a)(ii) of this Article II;

(B) the details of any relationship that existed within the past three
years and that would have been described pursuant to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14N
(or any successor item) if it existed on the date of submission of the
Schedule 14N;

 

(C) a representation and warranty that the shares of common stock of the
Corporation owned by the Nominating Shareholder were acquired in the ordinary
course of business and not with the intent or objective to influence or change

of changing control of the Corporation or to gain a number of seats on the
Board of Directors that exceeds the maximum number of nominees that
shareholders may nominate pursuant to this Section 14;

 



25

    

(D) a representation and warranty that the Nominating
Shareholder satisfies the eligibility requirements set forth in Section 14(c)
and has provided evidence of ownership to the extent required by Section
14(c)(i);

engage in, and will not be a "participant" in another persons,
"solicitation" within the meaning of Rule 14a-1(l) under the Exchange Act
(without reference to the exception in Rule 14a-1(l)(2)(iv)) (or any
successor rules) with respect to the Annual Meeting, other than with respect
to its Nominees or any nominees of the Board of Directors;

 

(I) a representation and warranty that the Nominating Shareholder will not
use any proxy card other than the Corporations proxy card in soliciting
shareholders in connection with the election of a Nominee at the Annual
Meeting;

 

(J) a representation and warranty that the Nominees nomination for
election to the Board of Directors or, if elected, Board membership would not
violate applicable state or federal law or the rules of any stock exchange on
which the Corporations securities are traded;

 

(K) a representation and warranty that the Nominee (1) qualifies as
independent under the rules of any stock exchange on which the Corporations
securities are traded, (2) meets the audit committee and compensation

sale or marketing of any Competing Product or Service.

(2) "Competing Product or Service" means any product or service that is
sold in competition with, or is being developed and that will compete with, a
product or service developed, manufactured, or sold by the Corporation.

 

(M) if desired, a statement for inclusion in the proxy statement in support
of the Nominees election to the Board of Directors, provided that such
statement shall not exceed 500 words and shall fully comply with Section 14 of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, including Rule

including withdrawal of the nomination.

 

(iii) An executed agreement, in a form deemed satisfactory by the Board of
Directors or its designee, acting in good faith, pursuant to which the
Nominating Shareholder (including each group member) agrees:

(A) to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in

(B) to file any written solicitation or other written communication with
the Corporations shareholders relating to one or more of the Corporations

regulation;

 

(C) to assume all liability (jointly and severally by all group members in
the case of a nomination by a group) stemming from any action, suit or

with any threatened or pending action, suit or proceeding, whether legal,

ARTICLE III

 

 _BOARD OF DIRECTORS_

 

Section 1. _Powers_. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be
managed under the direction of the Board of Directors.

Section 2. _Election and Term_.

 

(a) The Board of Directors shall be elected for terms as set forth in the
Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation. Acceptance of the office of
Director may be expressed orally or in writing, and attendance at a meeting
shall constitute such acceptance.

 

(b) Except as provided in this Section 2, each Director shall be elected by
the majority of the votes cast with respect to that Directors election at
any meeting of shareholders for the election of Directors at which a quorum is
present and the election is not a Contested Election. For purposes of this
Section 2, a majority of votes cast shall mean that the number of votes cast
"for" a Directors election exceeds the number of votes cast "withheld" with
respect to that Directors election. Abstentions will not be counted as votes
cast with respect to that Directors election. If at the close of the notice
periods set forth in Sections 5 and 14 of Article II or upon the Corporations
receipt of demands sufficient to require the calling of a Demand Special
Meeting under Section 3(c) of Article II, the Chairman of the Board
determines that the number of persons properly nominated to serve as Directors
of the Corporation exceeds the number of Directors to be elected (a "Contested
Election"), each Director shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast
with respect to that Directors election at the meeting at which a quorum is
present regardless of whether a Contested Election shall continue to exist as
of the date of such meeting.

 

(c) In an election of Directors that is not a Contested Election, any
nominee who was an incumbent Director whose term would otherwise have expired
at the time of the election if a successor had been elected who receives a
number of votes cast "for" his or her election less than the number of votes
cast "withheld" with respect to his or her election (a "Majority Against
Vote") will promptly tender his or her resignation to the Chairman of the
Board following certification of the shareholder vote. The Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors will promptly
consider the resignation submitted by such director, and the Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board of
Directors as to

 



30

    

 whether to accept the tendered resignation or to reject it, subject to
Article IX of these By-Laws. In considering whether to accept or reject the
tendered resignation, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will
consider all factors deemed relevant by the members of the Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee, including, without limitation, the stated
reasons why shareholders "withheld" votes for election from such Director,
the length of service and qualifications of the Director whose resignation has
been tendered and the Directors contributions to the Corporation. Subject to
Article IX of these By-Laws, the Board of Directors will act on the Nominating
and Corporate Governance Committees recommendation no later than 90 days
following the date of the meeting of shareholders at which the
election occurred. In considering the Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committees recommendation, the Board of Directors will consider the factors
considered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and such
additional information and factors the Board of Directors believes to be
relevant. Following the Board of Directors decision, the Corporation will
promptly publicly disclose in a Form 8-K filed with the SEC the Board
of Directors decision whether to accept the resignation as tendered,
including a full explanation of the process by which the decision was reached
and, if applicable, the reasons for rejecting the tendered resignation. Any
Director who tenders a resignation pursuant to this provision will not
participate in the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
recommendation or Board of Directors consideration regarding whether or not to
accept the tendered resignation. If a majority of the members of the
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee received Majority Against Votes
at the same election, then the independent Directors who are on the Board of
Directors who did not receive Majority Against Votes or who were not
standing for election will appoint a committee of the Board of Directors
among themselves for the purpose of considering the tendered resignations and
will recommend to the Board of Directors whether to accept or reject them,
Subject to Article IX of these By-Laws, this committee of the Board of
Directors may, but need not, consist of all of the independent Directors who
did not receive Majority Against Votes or who were not standing for election.

 

(d) Subject to Article IX of these By-Laws, if a Directors resignation
is accepted by the Board of Directors pursuant to this Section 2, or if a
nominee for Director is not elected and the nominee is not an incumbent
Director whose term would otherwise have expired at the time of the election
if a successor had been elected, then the Board of Directors may fill the
resulting vacancy pursuant to the provisions of Section 11 of Article III of
these By-Laws or may decrease the size of the Board of Directors pursuant
to the provisions of Section 3 of Article III of these By-Laws.

 

Section 3. _Number_. Subject to Article IX of these By-Laws, the number
of Directors shall be such number as shall be determined from time to time by
the Board of Directors but shall not be less than three nor more than eleven.

 

Section 4. _Tenure and Qualifications_. Each Director shall hold office
until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until his successor shall
have been elected, or until his prior death, resignation or removal for cause
only. A Director may be removed from office for cause only by the shareholders
at an annual meeting or a special meeting of shareholders called for that
purpose if the number of votes cast to remove such

 



31

    

 Director exceeds the number of votes cast not to remove such Director, and
any vacancy so created may be filled by the shareholders by the affirmative
vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to filling such vacancy,
subject to Article IX of these By-Laws. Directors need not be residents of the
State of Wisconsin or shareholders of the Corporation.

 

Section 5. _Nominations for Election to the Board of Directors_. Subject
to Article IX of these By-Laws nominations for elections to the Board of
Directors may be made by the Board of Directors or by any shareholder of any
outstanding class of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote for
election of Directors at a meeting of shareholders in accordance with
Sections 5 or 14 of Article II.

Directors, if one be elected, shall preside, if present, at all meetings of

law, the presence of fifty-one percent (51%) of the whole Board of Directors

meeting from time to time until a quorum shall be present. Notice of any
adjourned meeting need not be given. At all meetings of Directors, a quorum
being present, all matters shall be decided by the affirmative vote of
the majority of the Directors present, except as otherwise required by law or
as otherwise provided in Article IX of these By-Laws. The Board of Directors
may hold its meetings at such place or places within or without the State of
Wisconsin as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine or as
shall be specified in the respective notices, or waivers of notice, thereof.

 

Section 8. _Organization Meeting_. Immediately after each annual meeting
of shareholders for the election of Directors the Board of Directors shall
meet at the place of the annual meeting of shareholders for the purpose of
organization, the election of officers and the transaction of other business.
Notice of such meeting need not be given. If such meeting is held at any
other time or place, notice thereof must be given as hereinafter provided for
special meetings of the Board of Directors, subject to a waiver of such
notice, in the manner set forth in Section 180.0823 of the Wisconsin
Business Corporation Law, by all Directors who may not have received such
notice.

Section 9. _Regular Meetings_. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors
may be held at such time and place, within or without the State of Wisconsin,
as shall from time to time be determined by the Board of Directors. After

each member of the Board of Directors as hereinafter provided for special
meetings, regular meetings may be held without further notice being given.

 



32

    

Section 10. _Special Meetings; Notice_. Special meetings of the Board of
Directors shall be held whenever called by the Chairman of the Board, the
Chief Executive Officer, or by a majority of the Directors. Notice of each
such meeting shall be mailed to each Director, addressed to him at his
residence or usual place of business, at least five days before the date on
which the meeting is to be held, or shall be sent to him at such place by
telegraph, cable, radio or wireless, or be delivered personally or by
telephone, not later than the day before the day on which such meeting is to
be held. Each such notice shall state the time and place of the meeting and,
as may be required, the purposes thereof. Notice of any meeting of the Board
of Directors need not be given to any Director if he shall sign a written
waiver thereof either before or after the time stated therein for such
meeting, or if he shall be present at the meeting. Unless limited by law, the
Articles of Incorporation, these By-Laws or the terms of the notice thereof,
any and all business may be transacted at any meeting without the notice
thereof having specifically identified the matters to be acted upon.

 

Section 11. _Resignations_. Any Director of the Corporation may resign at
any time by giving written notice to the Chairman of the Board, the Chief
Executive Officer or the Secretary of the Corporation. The resignation of any
Director shall take effect upon receipt of notice thereof or at such later
time as shall be specified in such notice; and, unless otherwise specified
therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it
effective.

 

Section 12. _Vacancies_. Subject to Article IX of these By-Laws,
any newly created directorships and vacancies occurring in the Board by
reason of death, resignation, retirement or disqualification may be filled by
(a) a majority of the Directors then in office or (b) the action of the
holders of record of the majority of the issued and outstanding stock of the
Corporation (i) present in person or by proxy at a meeting of holders of such
stock and entitled to vote thereon or (ii) by a consent in writing in the
manner contemplated in Section 11 of Article II. The Director so chosen,
whether selected to fill a vacancy or elected to a new directorship, shall

directors is in the regular order of business, and until his successor has
been elected and qualifies, or until he sooner dies, resigns or is removed.

receive any stated salary for their services, but, by resolution of the Board,
a specific sum fixed by the Board plus expenses may be allowed for attendance

agent appointed as in Section 6 of this Article VI, on surrender of the
certificate or certificates for such shares properly endorsed or, in the case
of shares issued in book entry form, upon written transfer instructions

thereon. The Person in whose name shares of stock stand on the books of the
Corporation shall be deemed the owner thereof for all purposes as regards the

any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a date as

to be kept and used by any other officer.

special meeting declare dividends upon the capital stock of the Corporation as
and when they deem expedient. Before declaring any dividend there may be set
apart out of any funds of the Corporation available for dividends such sum or
