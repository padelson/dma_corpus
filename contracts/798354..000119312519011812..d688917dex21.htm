the rates and amounts included in the &#147;flex&#148; provisions, redacted, none of which redacted provisions would adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability, termination or amount of the debt financing contemplated by the commitment

(the debt financing contemplated in the Commitment Letter, together with, unless the context otherwise requires, any replacement financing, including any bank financing or debt securities issued in lieu thereof, the &#147;<U>Financing</U>&#148;). As

forth in the fee letters with respect to flex rights and/or to add additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents and similar entities who had not executed the Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement), and the Commitment
Letter, in the form so delivered, constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of, and is enforceable against, Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto, subject, in each case, to the Enforceability Exceptions.
Except as set forth in the Commitment Letter and except for any related commitment letters, engagement letters and fee letters related to the permanent financing described in the Commitment Letter, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no

the Commitment Letter has notified Parent of its termination or repudiation (or intent to terminate or repudiate) any of the commitments under such Commitment Letter or intent not to provide the Financing. Assuming the truth and accuracy of the
