   7.1 | Completion of Tax returns and calculations 
---|--- 



     | (a) | As soon as practicable after the Completion Date and in any
event no later than the due date for lodgement (taking into account any
applicable extensions of time):  
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | the Sellers (or their professional advisors) must prepare
all Tax returns in respect of the Company and each Group Company (as
applicable) for any periods of account that end on or before Completion and

other in the preparation of each Tax return referred to in clauses 7.1(a) and

Buyer within 20 Business Days of such request, all documents within the
Sellers possession and control relating to the affairs of Pharmasave and
Central Healthcare which are reasonably required by the Buyer to prepare the
Tax returns; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | the Buyer must provide each Seller and any professional

---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | the Revision Period lapses after the Buyer gives a
Revision Notice but any revision suggested has not been agreed to by the
Sellers within 5 Business Days after the end of the Revision Period, in which
case the parties must appoint an independent and reputable third party firm as
a tax expert (Expert) agreed between them (acting reasonably) and in the event
the parties fail to agree the Expert it shall be appointed by the President
of the Australian Institute of Chartered Accountants at the request of either
party to determine any matters under the Revision Notice that have not been
agreed and settle the draft Tax return which must be lodged by the Buyer. The
Experts determination will be final and binding. 
---|---|--- 
 



29 ---|--- 



     | (a) | If the Buyer or the Company receives any written
communication or notice from any Government Agency of any enquiry, including
any request for Information, notice to produce documents, audit, review or
request for a meeting (Tax Enquiry): 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | relating to a Group Company; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | wholly or partially in relation to the period before
Completion; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | that is likely to lead to a circumstance as a result of
which the Buyer, would, or would be likely to, make a Tax Claim, 
---|---|--- 
 

then the Buyer or the relevant Group Company must promptly notify the Sellers
of that fact within 15 Business Days after receipt of the Tax Enquiry.



     | (b) | Where a Tax Enquiry relates wholly to the period before
Completion.

---|---|--- 



     | (A) | notify the Sellers of the Tax Enquiry within 15 Business

against or in respect of the Company, and the Sellers must, at the request of
the Buyer or the Company, provide all such assistance as is reasonably

however 



     | (ii) | the Buyer must not settle any Tax Enquiry with the relevant
Government Agency, or pay to the relevant Government Agency any Tax or Stamp
Duty the subject of the Tax Enquiry until: 
---|---|--- 



     | (A) | the Sellers have agreed to the substance of the settlement
or payment, and in this regard, the Sellers have 30 Business Days from receipt
of the proposed settlement or payment (Tax Enquiry Revision Period) to notify
the Buyer of any revisions sought (Tax Enquiry Revision Notice); 
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | the Tax Enquiry Revision Period lapses and no Tax Enquiry
Revision Notice has been received by the Buyer; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (C) |

the Tax Enquiry Revision Period lapses after the Sellers give a Tax Enquiry
Revision Notice but any revision suggested has not been agreed to by
the Buyer within 5 Business Days after the end of the Tax Enquiry Revision
Period, in which case the parties must appoint an independent and reputable
third party firm as a tax expert (Expert) agreed between them (acting
reasonably) and in the event the parties fail to agree the Expert it shall be
appointed by 

---|---|--- 
 



30 Accountants at the request of either party to determine any matters under the
Revision Notice that have not been agreed and determine an appropriate
settlement with respect to the Tax Enquiry. The Experts determination will be
final and binding 
---|--- 



     | (c) | Where a Tax Enquiry that is likely to lead to a circumstance
as a result of which the Buyer would, or would be likely to, make a Tax Claim
concerns both the period before and the period after Completion, then the
Sellers and the Buyer must, and the Buyer must cause the relevant Group
Company to, co-operate fully with each other to determine whether the Tax or
Stamp Duty the subject of the Tax Enquiry relates to either: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | a period or part period up to and including Completion, in
which case the Sellers and the Buyer must comply with the requirements of
clause 7.2(b); or  
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | a period or part period following Completion, in which case
the Buyer will have full control of the Tax Enquiry. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) | For the avoidance of doubt the Buyer and the Company have
full control of all other Tax Enquiries concerning the relevant Group Company: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | for periods of account commenced on or after Completion; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | for periods of account ending prior to Completion, where
the Tax Enquiry is not likely to lead to a circumstance as a result of which
the Buyer would, or would be likely to, make a Tax Claim. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | In assessing any amount recoverable by the Buyer as a result
of any Claim, 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | any cash benefit received or Tax Relief obtained by a Group
Company which: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (A) | results in the amount of Tax for which the relevant Group
Company is or may be liable to be assessed or accountable being reduced or
extinguished; and  
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | arises directly or indirectly from the matter which gives
rise to the Claim, 
---|---|--- 
 

will be taken into account in the manner described in clause 7.2(e)(ii).

 



     | (ii) | In the period of account in which the relevant Group
Companys liability to Tax is reduced or extinguished, the Buyer must cause
the relevant Group Company to account to the Sellers in their Respective
Proportions for the full amount of that benefit, but not to the extent the
benefit has been taken into account under clause 9.4. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (f) | If a Tax Enquiry under clause 7.2(c) arises and that Tax
Enquiry leads to a circumstance where the relevant Group Company receives a
refund in cash or reduction in a Liability booked in the Accounts or
Management Accounts in respect of the period on or before Completion, then the
Buyer must cause the relevant Group Company to account to the Sellers in their
Respective Proportions for the full amount of that benefit, but not to the
extent that the refund in cash or reduction in Liability has been taken into
account under clause 9.4. 
---|---|--- 
 



31 ---|--- 

The Sellers severally indemnify the Buyer against and must pay the Buyer the
amount of, any:



     | (a) | Tax or Stamp Duty payable by the Company or any of the Group
Companies, whether it relates to the activities of the Company or any of the
Group Companies or otherwise, to the extent that Tax or Stamp Duty: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | relates to any period, or part period, up to and including
Completion; or 
---|---|--- 



      | (ii) | arises as a result of entry into this Agreement or
Completion (except for Stamp Duty for which the Buyer is liable under clause
22.14); and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | Tax Costs incurred by or on behalf of the Buyer, the Company
or a Group Company to the extent those Tax Costs arise from or relate to any
of the matters for which the Sellers may be liable under clause 7.3(a), 
---|---|--- 

except to the extent that the Sellers liability for the Tax or Stamp Duty is
limited or qualified under clause 8 or 9.



   7.4 | Tax effect of Claims 
---|--- 

If a party (payor) is liable to pay an amount to another party (recipient) in
respect of a Claim and that payment is treated as income under the Tax Law
such that the payment is subject to income tax payable by the recipient, or
the Head Company of any Consolidated Group of which the recipient is a
member, (collectively the recipient Group) under the Tax Law, then the payment
must be grossed-up by such amount as is necessary to ensure that the net
amount retained by the recipient Group after deduction of Tax or payment of
the increased income tax equals the amount the recipient Group would have
retained had such income tax not been payable, after taking into account any
benefits or relief relating to Tax obtained or to be obtained by the
recipient Group in relation to such Claim or payment. For the avoidance of
doubt, this clause 7.4 does not apply insofar as the receipt of the Purchase
Price under clause 3 by the Sellers is liable to Tax.

 



   7.5 | Due date for payments under clause 7.3 
---|--- 

Where the Sellers become liable to make any payment pursuant to clause 7.3,
the due date for the making of that payment shall be:

 



     | (a) | (save as mentioned in clause 7.5(b) below and subject to the
provisions of clause 7.6 below), the date falling 10 Business Days after the
date when the Sellers have been notified by the Buyer or any of the Group
Companies, that the Sellers have a liability for a determinable amount under
clause 7.3; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | the date (if later than that specified in clause 7.5(a)
above) which is 2 Business Days prior to: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | in the case of Tax in respect of which there is no provision
for payment by instalments, the latest date on which the tax in question can
be paid to the relevant Government Agency in order to avoid a liability to
interest, surcharge or penalties (or other similar imposition) accruing; or 
---|---|--- 
 



32 provision for payment by instalments, each date on which an instalment of such
tax becomes payable (and so that on each such date an appropriate proportion
of the amount claimed shall be paid, such proportion to be notified by the
Buyer to the Sellers at least 5 Business Days prior to each such date). 
---|---|--- 
 



   7.6 | Deferral of due date for payments under clause 7.3 
---|--- 

Notwithstanding the provisions of clause 7.5 above, if the date on which Tax
to which clause 7.3 applies becomes payable is deferred following application
to the appropriate Government Agency and the Sellers indemnify the Buyer and
the Group Company concerned to their reasonable satisfaction, the date for
payment by the Sellers (if later than that specified in clause 7.5(a) above)
shall be the earlier of the date on which the tax becomes payable to the
relevant Government Agency (notwithstanding any initial deferral) and such
date when the amount of Tax is conclusively determined. For this purpose, an
amount of Tax shall be deemed to be conclusively determined when, in respect
of such amount, a decision of a court or tribunal of first instance is given
or any binding agreement, or administrative or arbitral determination is made.



   8. | Sellers Warranties 
---|--- 



   8.1 | Warranties 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Subject to clauses 8.1(b) and 8.1(c), the Warrantors
severally warrant to the Buyer that, subject to the limitations in this clause
8 and clause 9, each of the Sellers Warranties is true and accurate, and not
