        AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of January 28, 2001 (the
"Agreement") among MAXIM INTEGRATED PRODUCTS, INC., a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), MI ACQUISITION SUB, INC., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and DALLAS SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION, a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"). Capitalized terms not elsewhere defined
herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in Section 8.4 hereof.

                WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined
that it is consistent with the Company's long-term strategic plan and in the
best interests of its stockholders and employees for the Company to pursue a
strategic transaction with Parent in order to preserve the existence of the
Company's corporate entity;

                WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have each determined that it is in the best interests of their
respective stockholders for Merger Sub to merge with and into the Company upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

                WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, the Boards of Directors of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have each approved the merger (the "Merger")
of Merger Sub with and into the Company, in accordance with the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL") and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, which Merger will result in, among other things,
the Company becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent;

                WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of, and an inducement
to, Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, contemporaneously with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company is entering into a
Stock Option Agreement dated as of the date hereof (the "Option Agreement") in
the form of Exhibit A attached hereto, granting Parent an irrevocable option to
purchase up to that number of shares of Company Common Stock as shall represent
14.9% (by voting power) of the total outstanding Company Common Stock (as
defined herein), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein;

                WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that
the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"); and

                WHEREAS, for accounting purposes, it is intended that the Merger
shall qualify for "pooling-of-interests" treatment.

                NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby
agree as follows:

<PAGE>   6

                                    ARTICLE I
                                   THE MERGER

        1.1. THE MERGER.

                At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2) and subject to
and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the DGCL, (a) Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company, (b) the separate corporate existence
of Merger Sub shall cease, and (c) the Company shall, as the surviving
corporation in the Merger, continue its existence under Delaware law as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. The Company as the surviving corporation
after the Merger is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Surviving
Corporation."

        1.2. EFFECTIVE TIME.

                As promptly as practicable after the satisfaction or, to the
extent permitted hereunder, waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI
hereof, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a
certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware, in such form as required by and executed in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the date and time of such filing, or
such later date and time as may be specified in the Certificate of Merger by
mutual agreement of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, being the "Effective
Time").

        1.3. EFFECT OF THE MERGER.

                At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as
provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL, including Section 259
thereof. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,
at the Effective Time, all the assets, property, rights, privileges, immunities,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub
shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

        1.4. CERTIFICATION OF INCORPORATION; BYLAWS.

                Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective
Time, at the Effective Time and without any further action on the part of the
parties hereto, (a) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended as provided therein and by the DGCL and (b) the Bylaws of Merger Sub
shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as
provided therein and by the DGCL.

        1.5. DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.

                Except as set forth on Section 1.5 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office
in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the



                                       2
<PAGE>   7

Surviving Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. Except as
determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the officers of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the
Surviving Corporation.

        1.6. CONVERSION OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK, ETC.

                At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the parties hereto or the holders of the following
securities:

                (a) Subject to the provisions of this Article I, each share of
common stock, par value $0.02 per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock")
including the associated Company Rights issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than any shares of the Company Common Stock to be
canceled pursuant to Section 1.7 and subject to Section 1.10 and Section 1.11),
will be converted automatically into the right to receive from Merger Sub that
number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001
per share (the "Parent Common Stock"), of Parent equal to the Exchange Ratio.
For purposes of this Agreement, "Exchange Ratio" shall mean the decimal
equivalent (rounded to four decimal places) of the quotient obtained by dividing
the Aggregate Parent Share Amount (as defined below) by the Fully Diluted
Company Share Amount (as defined below). For purposes hereof, the "Fully Diluted
Company Share Amount" means the number of shares of Company Common Stock
calculated as of the close of business on the day immediately preceding the
Effective Time pursuant to the Treasury Stock Method (assuming a 35% effective
tax rate) as defined by GAAP (as defined herein), which as of the close of
business on January 26, 2001 and based on outstanding shares and options as of
January 25, 2001, would have resulted in an Exchange Ratio of 0.6163. For
purposes hereof, the "Aggregate Parent Share Amount" means the following:

                        (i) if the Average Closing Price (as defined below) of
Parent Common Stock is equal to or greater than $61.00 per share, then the
Aggregate Parent Share Amount is 40,000,000;

                        (ii) if the Average Closing Price of Parent Common Stock
is equal to or less than $52.00 per share, then the Aggregate Parent Share
Amount is 42,000,000; and

                        (iii) if the Average Closing Price of Parent Common
Stock is greater than $52.00 per share but less than $61.00 per share, then the
Aggregate Parent Share Amount is the sum of (x) 40,000,000 plus (y) the product
obtained by multiplying 2,000,000 times the quotient obtained by dividing (1)
$61.00 minus the Average Closing Price of Parent Common Stock by (2) $9.00.

The "Average Closing Price" means the average closing price of Parent Common
Stock (rounded to the nearest cent) on the NASDAQ National Market System for the
10 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day that is two trading days
prior to the Effective Time.

                (b) Each share of the Company Common Stock shall be deemed
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing
any such share of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive that number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio upon surrender of the



                                       3
<PAGE>   8

certificate representing such share of Company Common Stock in the manner
provided in Section 1.12 (together with the cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock as specified in Section 1.11, the "Merger Consideration").
Unless the context otherwise requires, each reference in this Agreement to
shares of Company Common Stock shall include the associated Company Rights
issued pursuant to the Company Rights Agreement.

        1.7. CANCELLATION OF TREASURY STOCK AND PARENT-OWNED STOCK.

                Each share of the Company Common Stock held in the treasury of
the Company, if any, and each share of Company Common Stock, if any, owned by
Parent or Merger Sub, in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and no payment
or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

        1.8. STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS.

                (a) At the Effective Time, all options to purchase Company
Common Stock then outstanding under the Company's (i) 1984 Stock Option Plan,
(ii) Amended 1987 Stock Option Plan and (iii) 1993 Officer and Director Stock
Option Plan (each as amended, collectively, the "Option Plans"), by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall be
assumed by Parent in accordance with Section 5.5.

                (b) The Company and its Board of Directors shall promptly take
all actions necessary to ensure that (i) immediately prior to the Effective Time
the Purchase Plan (as defined in Section 2.3) shall be terminated and of no
further force and effect and without any liability of the Company thereunder,
and (ii) following the Effective Time no holder of any options or other rights
pursuant to, nor any participant in or party to, the Option Plans or any other
Employee Plan (as defined herein) or other plan, program, arrangement, agreement
or other commitment providing for the issuance or grant of any interest in
respect of the capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
will have any rights thereunder to acquire equity securities, or any right to
payment in respect of the equity securities, of Parent, the Company, or the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries, except as provided herein.

        1.9. CAPITAL STOCK OF MERGER SUB.

                Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger
Sub (the "Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation
and shall thereafter constitute all of the issued and outstanding capital stock
of the Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing
ownership of any shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall continue to evidence
ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

        1.10. ADJUSTMENTS TO EXCHANGE RATIO.

                Without limiting any other provision of this Agreement, the
Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split,
reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Parent



                                       4
<PAGE>   9

Common Stock or Company Common Stock occurring after the date hereof and prior
to the Effective Time.

        1.11. FRACTIONAL SHARES.

                No certificates or scrip representing the right to acquire
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the
Merger, and such fractional interests will not entitle the owner thereof to any
rights of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu thereof, each holder of shares of
Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to Section 1.6 or of options or warrants
exchanged pursuant to Section 1.8(a) who would otherwise be entitled to a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to have been otherwise received by such holder)
shall receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded down to the nearest whole
cent and without interest) equal to the product of such fractional part of a
share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by the Average Closing Price.

        1.12. SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES.

                (a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
designate a bank or trust company to act as the Exchange Agent in the Merger.

                (b) Parent to Provide Common Stock. When and as needed, Parent
shall make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this
Article I, through such reasonable procedures as Parent may adopt, sufficient
shares of Parent Common Stock (and any cash payable in lieu of any fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock) to be exchanged pursuant to Section 1.6 and
Section 1.11.

                (c) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates (the "Certificates") that represented as of the
Effective Time outstanding shares of Company Common Stock to be exchanged
pursuant to Section 1.6, a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall
pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be
in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify)
and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock. Upon
surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor a certificate representing the number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock and payment in lieu of fractional shares which such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to Sections 1.6 and 1.11, after giving effect
to any required Tax (as defined herein) withholdings, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. At any time following six months after
the Effective Time, all or any number of shares of Parent Common Stock (and any
or all cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock)
deposited with or made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section
1.12(b), which remain undistributed to the holders of the Certificates
representing shares of Company Common Stock, shall be delivered to Parent upon
demand, and thereafter such holders of unexchanged shares of Company Common
Stock shall be entitled to look only to Parent



                                       5
<PAGE>   10

(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) as general
creditors thereof with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock for payment
upon due surrender of their Certificates.

                (d) Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with
respect to shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective
Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to
the whole shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the holder of
record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Following surrender
of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the
certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange
therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and
payable between the Effective Time and the time of such surrender with respect
to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

                (e) Transfers of Ownership. If any certificate for shares of
Parent Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than the name in which the
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a
condition of the issuance thereof that (i) the Certificate so surrendered will
be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such exchange will have paid any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares of Parent Common
Stock in a name other than the name of the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or (ii) established to the satisfaction of Parent, or any agent
designated by Parent, that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

                (f) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, none of the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable to a holder of a Certificate for any
Parent Common Stock (and any cash payable for fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock or any other amount due, if any) that was properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

                (g) Withholding of Tax. Parent or the Exchange Agent will be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to any holder
of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent (or any Affiliate thereof) or the
Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code, or any applicable provision of federal, state,
local or foreign Tax Law (as defined herein). To the extent that amounts are so
properly withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts will be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
the Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding were
made by Parent.

        1.13. FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN COMPANY COMMON STOCK.

                All shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Article I
(including any cash paid in respect thereof) shall be deemed to have been issued
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock. At
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the



                                       6
<PAGE>   11

Company shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no further registration
of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the records of the Surviving
Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
evidencing ownership of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock except as
otherwise provided for herein. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this Article I.

        1.14. CLOSING.

                Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement abandoned pursuant to the provisions
of Article VII, and subject to the provisions of Article VI, the closing of the
Merger (the "Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m. (Pacific time) on a date
(the "Closing Date") to be mutually agreed upon by the parties, which date shall
be not later than the second Business Day after all the conditions set forth in
Article VI shall have been satisfied (or waived in accordance with Section 7.5,
to the extent the same may be waived), unless another time and/or date is agreed
by the parties hereto. The Closing shall take place at the offices of Simpson
Thacher & Bartlett, 3330 Hillview Avenue, Palo Alto, California 94304 or such
other place as the parties hereto otherwise agree.

        1.15. LOST, STOLEN OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES.

                In the event any Certificates evidencing Company Common Stock
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of Parent Common Stock
and cash for fractional shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section
1.11; provided, however, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent or the Exchange
Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

        1.16. TAX CONSEQUENCES.

                For federal income tax purposes, the parties intend that the
Merger be treated as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code, and that this Agreement shall be, and is hereby, adopted as a plan of
reorganization for purposes of Section 368 of the Code. The parties shall not
take any action that would prevent or impede the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code nor take a position on any Tax
Return (as defined herein) inconsistent with this Section 1.16.

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Company is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business,
and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the
properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities makes

the Company to be in possession of which could not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each
Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation or entity to
do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character
of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its
activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the
failure to be so qualified could not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                (c) Section 2.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
forth, as of the date hereof, a true and complete list of all of the Company's
directly and indirectly owned Subsidiaries, together with the jurisdiction of

hereof, there are no stock-appreciation rights, stock-based performance units,
"phantom" stock rights or other agreements, arrangements or commitments of any
character (contingent or otherwise) pursuant to which any Person is or may be
entitled to receive any payment or other value based on the revenues, earnings
or financial performance, stock price performance or other attribute of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or assets or calculated in accordance
therewith (other than ordinary course payments or commissions to employees or

or any of its Subsidiaries.

        2.4. AUTHORITY; ENFORCEABILITY.

                The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement, the Option Agreement and each instrument
required to be executed and delivered by it at the Closing hereunder and
thereunder, perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and consummate the

and delivery by the Company of this Agreement and the Option Agreement, the
performance of its obligations hereunder and thereunder, and the consummation by
the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, have been duly
and validly authorized by all corporate action and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement
or the Option Agreement or to consummate the transactions so contemplated (other

Agreement by votes of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Company
Common Stock in accordance with Delaware law and the Company's Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws and the filing of the Certificate of Merger) herein or
therein. Each of this Agreement and the Option Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery thereof by Parent and Merger Sub,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms (subject to the effects of
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and
other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, general
equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law)
and an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing).

                (a) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement,
the Option Agreement or any instrument required by this Agreement to be executed

Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or equivalent organizational documents of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) conflict with or violate any Law or
Order in each case applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by

Schedule or (B) in the case of clause (ii) or (iii) above, for any such
conflicts, breaches, violations, defaults or other occurrences that could not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

                (b) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement,
the Option Agreement or any instrument required by this Agreement to be executed
and delivered by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at the Closing do not,
and the performance of this Agreement, the Option Agreement and any instrument
required by this Agreement to be executed and delivered by the Company or any of

Subsidiaries that may be acquired or controlled by Parent or (ii) would or would
purport to entitle any Person to acquire securities of the Company.

        2.21. POOLING; TAX MATTERS.

                (a) To the Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any
of its Affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action, failed to take any
action or is aware of any fact or circumstance that would prevent (i) the Merger
from being treated for financial accounting purposes as a "pooling of interests"
in accordance with GAAP and the Regulations of the SEC or (ii) the Merger from
constituting a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

                (b) The Company has no Knowledge of any reason why it may not
receive a letter from KPMG LLP (the "Company's Accountants") dated as of the
Closing Date and addressed to the Company in which the Company's Accountants
will concur with the Company management's conclusion that no conditions exist
related to the Company that would preclude Parent from accounting for the Merger
as a "pooling of interests."

a true and complete list of all Persons who, to the Knowledge of the Company,
may be deemed to be Affiliates of the Company, excluding all of its Subsidiaries
but including all directors and executive officers of the Company.

        2.22. BROKERS.

                No broker, financial advisor, finder or investment banker or
other Person is entitled to any broker's, financial advisor's, finder's or other
fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the Company, except
for Robertson Stephens, Inc. (the "Company Financial Advisors"). Section 2.22 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, and the Company has



                                       25
<PAGE>   30

heretofore furnished to Parent a true and complete copy of, all agreements
between the Company and the Company Financial Advisors pursuant to which such
Person would be entitled to any payment relating to the transactions
contemplated hereunder.

        2.23. INTERESTED PARTY TRANSACTIONS.

                Except as disclosed in Section 2.23 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule or in SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, there are no existing
Contracts, transactions, indebtedness or other arrangements, or any related
series thereof, between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand,
and any of the directors, officers, stockholders or other Affiliates of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates or family
members, on the other (except for amounts due as normal salaries and bonuses and
in reimbursement of ordinary expenses).

        2.24. OPINION OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR.

                The Company has received the written opinion of the Company
Financial Advisors to the effect that, in its opinion, as of the date hereof,
the Exchange Ratio to be used in the Merger is fair to such stockholders of the
Company from a financial point of view, and the Company has provided copies of
such opinion to Parent.

        2.25. COMPANY RIGHTS AGREEMENT.

                The Company Board of Directors has approved and duly authorized
and the Company has executed an amendment and will amend, within two Business
Days of the date of this Agreement,(substantially in the form provided to
Parent) the Company Rights Agreement to the effect that neither of Parent or
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates shall become an Acquiring
Person (as defined in the Company Rights Agreement), and that no Distribution
Date (as defined in the Company Rights Agreement) will occur, and that the
Company Rights will not separate from the underlying shares of Company Common
Stock or give the holders thereof the right to acquire securities of any party
hereto, in each case as a result of the approval, execution or delivery of this
Agreement, the Option Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. The Company Rights Agreement shall terminate and
be of no further force or effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
without any consideration being payable with respect to the outstanding Company
Rights thereunder.


                                   ARTICLE III
             REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

                Parent and Merger Sub hereby, jointly and severally, represent
and warrant to the Company as follows:

        3.1. ORGANIZATION AND QUALIFICATION.

                Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Delaware. Parent has all
the requisite corporate power

<PAGE>   31

and authority, and is in possession of all Approvals necessary to own, lease and
operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except where the failure to be so qualified, existing and in good

or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign
corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where
the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of
its activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such
failures to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing that could
not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Merger Sub is a newly-formed single purpose entity
which has been formed solely for the purposes of the Merger and will not carry
on any business or engage in any activities other than those reasonably related
to the Merger.

        3.2. CAPITALIZATION.

                                       27
<PAGE>   32

Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any obligation or requirement
to provide funds for or to make any investment (in the form of a loan or capital
contribution) to or in any Person.

                (c) Except for outstanding options under the Parent Option Plans
and except as described in Section 3.2(c) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as

generated by them without augmentation as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby) (collectively, "Stock-Based Rights") or to cause Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries to file a registration statement under the Securities
Act, or which otherwise relate to the registration of any securities of Parent.
Except as set forth in Section 3.2(c) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, there

voting or disposition of any shares of capital stock of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries.

        3.3. AUTHORITY; ENFORCEABILITY.

        3.13. POOLING; TAX MATTERS.

Board, and the Regulations of the SEC.

nor any of their Affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action or failed to
take any action that would prevent (a) the Merger from being treated for

reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

                (c) Parent has no Knowledge of any reason why it may not receive

Parent that would preclude Parent from accounting for the Merger as a "pooling
of interests."

        reflect timing differences between book and Tax treatment) in accordance
        with GAAP on the respective company's Balance Sheet for any material
        Taxes not yet due for all periods ending on or before the date of the
        latest Balance Sheet. All assessments for material Taxes due and owing

        have been paid. Neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has
        incurred a Tax liability from the date of the latest Balance Sheet other

        has formally commenced and no written notice has been received that such
        audit or other proceeding is pending or threatened by any Governmental

        Taxes, and all deficiencies proposed as a result of such actions, suits,
        proceedings, investigations, claims or audits have been paid, reserved
        against or settled.

be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly
notify each Company Representative of its obligations under this Section 4.3.

                (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may participate
in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish information with respect to the
Company pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to
the Company than those in effect between the Company and Parent to, any Person
if and only if (x) such Person has submitted an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal to the Company (y) neither the Company nor any of the
Company Representatives shall have violated Section 4.3(a) and (z) the Board of
Directors of the Company (i) determines by a majority vote in its good faith
judgment, after consultation with outside counsel, that taking such action is
necessary to comply with the fiduciary duties of such Board under applicable Law
and (ii) provides prior written notice to Parent of its decision to so
participate or furnish.

                (c) Except as set forth in the following sentence, neither the
Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (1) approve or
recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal other
than the Merger, (2) withdraw or modify or propose to withdraw or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub its approval or recommendation of the
Merger, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (3) upon a
written request by Parent to reaffirm its approval or recommendation of this
Agreement or the Merger following the delivery, making or announcement of an
Acquisition Proposal, fail to do so within five Business Days after such request
is made, (4) approve, enter, or permit or cause the Company or any Material
Subsidiary to enter, into any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement or other similar agreement related to any Acquisition
Proposal, or (5) resolve or announce its intention to do any of the foregoing.
The immediately preceding sentence notwithstanding, in the event that prior to
the Company Stockholders' Meeting the Board of Directors of the Company receives
a Superior Proposal (as defined herein), the Board of Directors of the Company
may (i) withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Sub its approval or recommendation of the Merger,
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) fail to reaffirm
its approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger within five
Business Days after a written request by Parent to do so, or (iii) resolve or
announce its intention to do any of the actions set forth in the preceding
clauses (i) or (ii), if (x) after consultation with outside counsel, such Board
determines by a majority vote of directors in their good faith judgment that
taking such action is necessary to comply with the fiduciary duties of such
Board under applicable Law and (y) the Company furnishes Parent two Business
Days' prior written notice of the taking of such action (which notice shall
include a description of the material terms and conditions of the Superior
Proposal and identify the person making the same). For purposes of this
Agreement, (A) "Material Subsidiary" means any Subsidiary of the Company whose
consolidated revenues, net income or assets constitute 10% or more of the
revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole, and (B) the term "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide Acquisition
Proposal to effect a merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of
the assets of the Company or acquisition of a majority of the outstanding



                                       39
<PAGE>   44

capital stock of the Company which is on terms which the Board of Directors of
the Company determines by a majority vote of its directors in their good faith
judgment (after consultation with its outside counsel and investment advisors of
nationally recognized reputation), after taking into account all relevant
factors, including any conditions to such Acquisition Proposal, the form of
consideration contemplated by such Acquisition Proposal, the timing of the
closing thereof, the risk of nonconsummation, the ability of the Person making
the Acquisition Proposal to finance the transactions contemplated thereby and
any required filings or Approvals, to be more favorable to the stockholders of
the Company than the Merger (or any revised proposal made by Parent).

                (d) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set
forth in this Section 4.3, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within
one Business Day) advise Parent orally and in writing of any request for
information with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry with
respect to or which could result in an Acquisition Proposal, the material terms
and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, and the
identity of the Person making the same. The Company shall inform Parent on a
prompt and current basis of the status, terms and content of any discussions
regarding any Acquisition Proposal with a third party. Nothing contained in this
Section 4.3(d) shall prevent the Board of Directors of the Company from
complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act.


                                    ARTICLE V

Parent's prior consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. The Company shall allow Parent's full participation in the preparation
of the Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto and shall consult
with Parent and its advisors concerning any comments from the SEC with respect
thereto.

                (b) Parent shall, promptly following the date hereof, prepare
and file with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form S-4, in which the Proxy
Statement shall be included as part of the prospectus, and the parties hereto
shall use all reasonable efforts to have the

<PAGE>   45

Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable
after such filing. Parent shall obtain and furnish the information required to
be included in the Registration Statement and, after consultation with the
Company, respond promptly to any comments made by the SEC with respect to the
Registration Statement. Parent shall allow the Company's full participation in
the preparation of the Registration Statement and any amendment or supplement
thereto and shall consult with the Company and its advisors concerning any
comments from the SEC with respect thereto.

                (c) The Proxy Statement shall include the recommendation of the
Board of Directors of the Company in favor of approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the Merger, except to the extent that the Company shall have
withdrawn or modified its recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger as
permitted by Section 4.3(c).

                (d) Parent and the Company shall, as promptly as practicable,
make all necessary filings with respect to the Merger under the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act and the Regulations thereunder and under applicable Blue
Sky or similar securities Laws, and shall use all reasonable efforts to obtain
required Approvals with respect thereto.

                (e) Each party hereto agrees to furnish all information
concerning itself as may be reasonably required to prepare the Proxy Statement
or Registration Statement or to make such filings pursuant to Section 5.1(d).
Each party hereto agrees to correct any information provided by it for use in

misleading in any material respect.

        5.2. MEETING OF COMPANY'S STOCKHOLDERS.

                The Company shall promptly after the date hereof take all action
necessary in accordance with the DGCL and its Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws to duly call, give notice of and hold the Company Stockholders' Meeting
as soon as practicable following the date upon which the Registration Statement
becomes effective and shall consult with Parent in connection therewith. The
Board of Directors of the Company has declared that this Agreement is advisable
and, subject to Section 4.3(c), shall recommend that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby be approved and authorized by the stockholders
of the Company and include in the Registration Statement and Proxy Statement a
copy of such recommendations; provided, however, that the Board of Directors of
the Company shall submit this Agreement to the stockholders of the Company
whether or not the Board of Directors of the Company at any time subsequent to
making such declaration takes any action permitted by Section 4.3(c). The
Company shall solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the Merger and
shall take all other action reasonably necessary or advisable to secure the vote
or consent of its stockholders to authorize and approve the Merger. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) the Company agrees that its
obligation to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company
Stockholders' Meeting as required by this Section 5.2, shall not be affected by
the withdrawal, amendment or modification of the Board of Directors'
recommendation of approval and adoption of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (ii) the Company agrees that its obligations under this
Section 5.2 shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public
disclosure or communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal.

                (a) In order to facilitate the consummation of the Merger and
the integration of the operations of Parent and Company after the Effective
Time, during the period prior to the Effective Time, upon reasonable notice, the
Company shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford to the
officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives and agents
of Parent (collectively "Parent Representatives"), reasonable access during

Subsidiaries. In addition, Parent Representatives shall present any request for
such access pursuant to this Section 5.3(a) to, and coordinate all such access
with, M.D. Sampels and Alan P. Hale. The Company shall (and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to) make available to Parent the appropriate individuals for
discussion of such entity's business, properties and personnel as Parent or the
Parent Representatives may reasonably request. No investigation pursuant to this
Section 5.3(a) shall affect any representations or warranties of the parties
herein or the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereto.

                (b) Parent shall keep all information obtained pursuant to
Section 4.1 or Section 5.3(a) confidential in accordance with the terms of the
Confidential Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated January 24, 2001 (the

in the Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company
and Parent hereby agree that each such party may issue press release(s) or make
other public announcements in accordance with Section 5.10.

        5.4. REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS; FURTHER ASSURANCES.

                (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, each party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other party or parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby (including Section 6.2(g) hereof), and by the
Option Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof. The
Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) as promptly as
practicable, obtain all Approvals (including those referred to in Sections
2.6(a) and 2.6(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule), and the Company and
Parent shall make all filings under applicable Law required in connection with
the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Option
Agreement by the Company and Parent and the consummation by them of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger (in
connection with which Parent and the Company will cooperate with each other in
connection with the making of all such filings, including providing copies of
all such documents to the non-filing party and its advisors prior to filings
and, if requested, will accept all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested in connection therewith) or (ii) furnish all information required for
any application or other filing to be made pursuant to the DGCL or any other Law
or any applicable Regulations of any Governmental



                                       42
<PAGE>   47

Authority (including all information required to be included in the Proxy
Statement or the Registration Statement) in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Option Agreement. Anything in this
Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates shall be under any obligation to (x) make proposals, execute or carry
out agreements or submit to Orders providing for the sale or other disposition
or holding separate (through the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any
assets or categories of assets of Parent, any of its Affiliates, including its
Subsidiaries, the Company or the holding separate of the Company Common Stock or
imposing or seeking to impose any limitation on the ability of Parent or any of
its Affiliates, including its Subsidiaries, to conduct their business or own
such assets or to acquire, hold or exercise full rights of ownership of Company
Common Stock, or (y) otherwise take any step to avoid or eliminate any
impediment which may be asserted under any Law governing competition, monopolies
or restrictive trade practices which, in the reasonable judgment of Parent,
might result in a limitation of the benefit expected to be derived by Parent as
a result of the transactions contemplated hereby or might adversely affect the
Company or Parent or any of Parent's Affiliates, including its Subsidiaries.
Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, without the prior
written consent of Parent neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will
take any action specified in clause (x) or clause (y) of the immediately
preceding sentence.

                (b) The parties hereto shall use their reasonable best efforts

Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement;

                        (ii) in connection with the preparation of any filing

                        (iv) in seeking any Approvals or making any filings,
including furnishing information required in connection therewith or with the
Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement, and seeking timely to obtain any
such Approvals, or making any filings; and

        5.5. STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK PLAN; OPTIONS.

                (a) At the Effective Time, each Outstanding Employee Option,
whether vested or unvested, will be assumed by Parent. Each such Outstanding
Employee Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement shall continue to
have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the Option
Plans, option agreements thereunder and other relevant documentation immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except that such Outstanding Employee Option will
be exercisable solely for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were
purchasable under such Outstanding Employee Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest
whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, and the per-share exercise price
for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed
Outstanding Employee Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing
the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Outstanding
Employee Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest
whole cent.

                (b) Parent shall reserve for issuance a sufficient number of
shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Outstanding Employee
Options assumed by Parent under this Agreement. Parent shall file as soon as
practicable after the Effective Date (but in any event within ten (10) days) a
registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act covering the shares
of Parent Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Outstanding Employee
Options assumed by Parent pursuant to Section 5.5(a), and shall use its
reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective as
soon thereafter as practicable and to maintain such registration in effect until
the exercise or expiration of such assumed Outstanding Employee Options.

                (c) Except as set forth in Section 5.5(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the vesting of each Outstanding Employee Option shall not
accelerate as a result of, or in connection with, the transactions contemplated
hereby. In addition, the Company shall ensure that no discretion is exercised by
the Board of Directors or any committee thereof or any other body or Person so
as to cause the vesting of any Outstanding Employee Option or any other warrant
or right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock to accelerate.

                (d) On and after the date hereof, the Company shall ensure that
no options to purchase Company Common Stock shall be granted under the Purchase
Plan. The Company shall provide that the current offering period under the
Purchase Plan shall terminate prior to the Merger.

        5.6. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.

                (a) Parent agrees that individuals who are employed by the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall become employees of the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries
upon the Effective Time (each such employee, a "Company Employee"); provided,
however, that this Section 5.6(a) shall not be construed to limit the ability of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any
Company Employee at any time and provided further that prior to the fifth



                                       44
<PAGE>   49

anniversary of the Effective Date, salaried employees will not be terminated on
less than ninety (90) days notice.

                (b) After the Effective Time, the Company Employees shall be
eligible to participate in the employee benefit plans of Parent (other than
equity-based compensation plans) to the same extent as any similarly situated
employee of Parent located in the same country; provided, however, that, Company
Employees may continue to participate in their benefits (without duplication)
under the employee benefits plans of the Company (other than equity-based
compensation plans) provided to such Company Employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time, as elected by the on-site management of the Surviving
Corporation. The Company Employees will be allowed credit for their service with
the Company and its Subsidiaries for purposes of vesting and participation only
(and not for benefit accrual purposes), with respect to the employee benefit
plans in which such Company Employees are entitled to participate following the
Effective Time.

                (c) With respect to any plan that is a "welfare benefit plan"
(as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) maintained by the Parent, Parent shall (i)
cause there to be waived any pre-existing condition limitation to the same
extent such pre-existing condition was waived under an Employee Plan and (ii)
give effect, in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket
limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to,
such employees with respect to similar plans maintained by Company and its
Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date.

                (d) Parent agrees that, from and after the Effective Time,
Company's employees may participate in the employee stock purchase plan
sponsored by Parent ("Parent ESPP"), subject to the terms and conditions of the
Parent ESPP, and that service with Company shall be treated as service with the
Parent for determining eligibility of Company's employees under the Parent ESPP.

                (e) The Company shall terminate, effective as of the day
immediately preceding the Effective Time, any and all 401(k) plans sponsored or
maintained by the Company unless Parent provides written notice to the Company
prior to the Effective Time that any such 401(k) plan shall not be terminated.
Parent shall receive from the Company evidence that the Company's plan(s) and/or
program(s) have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company's Board
of Directors (the form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to
review and approval of Parent), effective as of the day immediately preceding
the Effective Time. The Company employees shall be eligible to participate in a
401(k) plan sponsored by Parent no later than the first day of the next
commencing month immediately after the Effective Time.

                (f) Parent will negotiate in good faith new employment
agreements with each of Chao C. Mai, Alan P. Hale, and Michael L. Bolan, which
may include compensation opportunities in lieu of a portion of the compensation
and benefits to which such employees would be entitled pursuant to those certain
Letter Agreements, dated May 20, 1999, as amended on November 19, 2000 and
further amended on January 28, 2001 (the "Change of Control Agreements"), and
which employment agreements are expected to include customary noncomeptition,
nonsolicitation and confidentiality provisions.

        5.7. POOLING; REORGANIZATION.

                (a) The Company shall not knowingly take, or knowingly permit
any controlled Affiliate of the Company to take, any action that could prevent
the Merger from being treated (i) for financial accounting purposes as a
"pooling of interests" under GAAP; it being understood and agreed that if the
Company's Accountants and Parent's Accountants both advise the Company and
Parent in writing that such an action would not prevent the Merger from being so
treated, such action will be conclusively deemed not to constitute a breach of
this Section 5.7 or (ii) as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.

                (b) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
an executed affiliate pooling agreement substantially in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit B (each, a "Company Affiliate Pooling Agreement") from each of
the Persons identified in Section 2.21(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and thereafter from any other
person who may be deemed an affiliate of the Company regarding compliance with
Rule 145 under the Securities Act and the requirements for accounting treatment
of the Merger as a "pooling of interests."

                (c) Parent shall not knowingly take, or knowingly permit any
controlled Affiliate of Parent to take, any action that could prevent the Merger
from being treated (i) for financial accounting purposes as a "pooling of
interests" under GAAP; it being understood and agreed that if Parent's
Accountants, advise Parent in writing that such an action would not prevent the
Merger from being so treated, such action will be conclusively deemed not to
constitute a breach of this Section 5.7; or (ii) as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

                (d) Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain an
executed affiliate pooling agreement containing substantially the substance of
the second and third paragraphs of the Company Affiliate Pooling Agreement from
each of the Persons identified in Section 5.7(d) of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule regarding compliance with the requirements for accounting treatment of
the Merger as a "pooling of interests."

        5.8. NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS.

                (a) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent
shall give prompt notice to the Company, of the occurrence, or non-occurrence,
of any event the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of which results in any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect (or, in the case of any representation or
warranty qualified by its terms by materiality or Material Adverse Effect, then
untrue or inaccurate in any respect) and any failure of the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by
it hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this Section 5.8 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

                (b) Each of the Company and Parent shall give prompt notice to
the other of (i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that
the Approval of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger
or the Option Agreement, (ii) any notice or other communication from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger or the Option Agreement;
(iii) any Litigation, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the
Company or its Subsidiaries or Parent or its Subsidiaries that relates to the
Merger or the Option Agreement; and (iv) any change that could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or is likely to delay or impede the
ability of either Parent or the Company to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Option Agreement or to fulfill their
respective obligations set forth herein or therein.

                (c) Each of the Company and Parent shall give (or shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third Persons, and use,
and cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, its reasonable best efforts to
obtain any consents from third Persons (i) necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) otherwise
required under any Contracts in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or (iii) required to prevent a Material Adverse
Effect from occurring. If any party shall fail to obtain any such consent from a
third Person, such party shall use its reasonable best efforts, and will take
any such actions reasonably requested by the other parties, to limit the adverse
effect upon the Company and Parent, their respective Subsidiaries, and their
respective businesses resulting, or which would result after the Effective Time,
from the failure to obtain such consent.

                (d) Recognizing that the retention of the Company's employees is
to the material benefit of Parent, in the event that the Company receives any
written or oral indication from any engineer or other key employee that such
person is considering or has decided to terminate his or her employment with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Company shall notify Parent by the next
Business Day in order that Parent may meet with such employee.

        5.9. LISTING ON THE NASDAQ NATIONAL MARKET.

                Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Parent

issued pursuant to Section 5.5 to be approved for listing on the NASDAQ National
Market System, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective
Time.

        5.10. PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS.

                Parent and the Company shall consult with and obtain the

system, in which case the party proposing to issue such press release or make
such public announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult in
good faith with the other party before issuing any such press release or making
any such public announcement.

        5.11. TAKEOVER LAWS.

                If any form of anti-takeover statute, Regulation or charter
provision or Contract is or shall become applicable to the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby or by the Option Agreement, the Company and the
Board of Directors of the Company shall grant such Approvals and take such
actions as are necessary under such Laws and provisions so that the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on
the terms contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such Law, provision or Contract on the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby.

on the date hereof in their respective certificates of incorporation, bylaws or
similar organizational documents, as well as related director indemnification

well as officer and other indemnification agreements listed on Section 5.13 of

                (b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current
policies of the directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the
Company (provided that Parent may substitute therefore policies of at least the
same coverage containing terms and conditions which are not materially less
advantageous) with respect to matters or events occurring prior to the Effective
Time to the extent available (the "D&O Insurance"); provided, however, that in
no event shall Parent be required to expend more than an amount per year equal
to 1.50 times the premium paid by the Company as of the date hereof to maintain
or procure the D&O Insurance pursuant hereto; and, provided, further that if the
annual premiums of the D&O Insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent shall
be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage reasonably available
for a cost not exceeding such amount.

                (c) After the Effective Time, Parent agrees that it will cause
the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each present and former
director and officer of the Company, determined as of the Effective Time (the
"Indemnified Parties"), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorney's fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising
out of or pertaining to matters relating to their duties or actions in their
capacity as officers and directors and existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including as a result of this Agreement), whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law (and Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, also advance fees and expenses (including reasonable attorney's
fees) as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law provided
the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides a customary undertaking
complying with applicable Law to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification). To the extent
not satisfied by the D&O Insurance or the Surviving Corporation, Parent hereby
unconditionally guarantees the obligations of the Surviving Corporation under
this Section 5.13(c).

                (d) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed
to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers'
insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect
to the Company or any of its officers, directors or employees, it being
understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.13
is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

        5.14. OPTION AGREEMENT.

                Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Company shall deliver to Parent an executed version of the Option

under applicable Law its obligations under the Option Agreement.

        5.15. COMPANY RIGHTS AGREEMENT.

                The Board of Directors of the Company shall take all action (in

amending the Company Rights Agreement) in order to render the Company Rights
inapplicable to the Merger and the other



                                       49

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Option Agreement. Except in
connection with the foregoing sentence, the Board of Directors of the Company
shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, (i) amend the Company
Rights Agreement or (ii) take any action with respect to, or make any
determination under, the Company Rights Agreement, in each case in order to
facilitate any Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company.

        5.16. ACTION BY BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

                Prior to the Effective Time, the Boards of Directors of Parent
and/or Company, as applicable, or an appropriate committee of non-employee
directors thereof, shall adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretative
guidance of the SEC so that (i) the assumption of Outstanding Employee Options
held by Company Insiders (as defined below) pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii)
the receipt by Company Insiders of Parent Common Stock in exchange for Company
Common Stock pursuant to the Merger, shall be an exempt transaction for purposes
of Section 16 of the Exchange Act by any officer or director of Company who may
become a covered person of Parent for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act
(a "Company Insider").

        5.17. BOARD SEAT.

                Promptly following the Effective Time, consistent with
applicable law and its Bylaws, the number of directors on Parent's Board shall

vacancy need be created), and M.D. Sampels shall be elected to fill such
vacancy, to serve as such until the next annual meeting of Parent's stockholders
or such time as his successor shall have been duly elected or appointed and
qualified.

subsections, Schedules or Exhibits, such reference shall be to a section,
subsection, Schedule or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.
The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used herein shall be deemed
in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation." The word "herein"
and similar references mean, except where a specific section or Article
reference is expressly indicated, the entire Agreement rather than any specific
section or Article. The table of contents and the headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

        8.6. SEVERABILITY.

                If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or public policy, all
other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to any
party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

                This Agreement and the Option Agreement (including all exhibits
and schedules hereto and thereto) and other documents and instruments delivered

        8.10. FAILURE OR INDULGENCE NOT WAIVER; REMEDIES CUMULATIVE.

                No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the
exercise of any right hereunder will impair such right or be construed to be a
waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or
agreement herein, nor will any single or partial exercise of any such right
preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights and
remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive to,
and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

        8.11. GOVERNING LAW; ENFORCEMENT.

                This Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties
hereunder shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the Law of the
State of Delaware applicable to contracts executed and to be performed entirely
within that state. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement or the Option Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or the Option
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement
or the Option Agreement in the United Stated District Court for the District of
Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity. In addition, each of the parties hereto, (a) consents to
submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the United Stated District Court
for the District of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of this
Agreement or the Option Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby or
thereby, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (c)
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or the
Option Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby in any other
court and (d) waives any right to trial by jury with respect to any action
related to or arising out of this Agreement or the Option Agreement or any
transaction contemplated hereby or thereby.

        8.12. COUNTERPARTS.

                This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, and
by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when
executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement.

                                    EXHIBIT A


        STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT, dated as of January 28, 2001 (the "Agreement"),
between Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Grantee"),
Dallas Semiconductor Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Issuer").

                                    RECITALS

        WHEREAS, Grantee and Issuer are, concurrently with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of the date hereof (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which the parties
will engage in a business combination (the "Merger") (capitalized terms not
otherwise defined herein shave have the meanings assigned to them in the Merger
Agreement).

        WHEREAS, as a condition to its willingness to enter into the Merger
Agreement, Grantee has required that Issuer agree, and believing it to be in the
best interests of Issuer, Issuer has agreed, among other things, to grant to
Grantee the Option (as hereinafter defined) to purchase shares of common stock,
par value $0.02 per share, of Issuer ("Issuer Common Stock") at a price per
share equal to the Exercise Price (as hereinafter defined).

                                    AGREEMENT

        NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:


                                    ARTICLE I

                            OPTION TO PURCHASE SHARES

        1.1 Grant of Option.

                (a) Issuer hereby grants to Grantee an irrevocable option to
purchase, in whole or in part, an aggregate of up to 9,259,002 duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Issuer Common Stock
(representing 14.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of Issuer Common Stock
as of January 25, 2001), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein (the "Option"); provided, however, that in no event shall the number of
shares of Issuer Common Stock, for which this Option is exercisable, exceed
14.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of Issuer Common Stock at the time of
exercise without giving effect to the issuance of any Option Shares (as defined
below). The number of shares of Issuer Common Stock that may be received upon
the exercise of the Option and the Exercise Price are subject to adjustment as
herein set forth.

<PAGE>   70

                (b) In the event that any additional shares of Issuer Common
Stock are issued or otherwise become outstanding after January 25, 2001 (other
than pursuant to this Agreement and other than pursuant to an event described in
Section 3.1 hereof), the number of shares of Issuer Common Stock subject to the
Option shall be increased so that, after such issuance, such number together
with any shares of Issuer Common Stock previously issued pursuant hereto, equals
14.9% of the number of shares of Issuer Common Stock then issued and
outstanding, without giving effect to any shares subject or issued pursuant to
the Option. Nothing contained in this Section 1.1(b) or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall be deemed to authorize Issuer to breach or fail to comply with
any provision of the Merger Agreement. As used herein, the term "Option Shares"
means the shares of Issuer Common Stock issuable pursuant to the Option, as the
number of such shares shall be adjusted pursuant to the terms hereof.

        1.2 Exercise of Option.

                (a) The Option may be exercised by Grantee, in whole or in part,
at any time, or from time to time, commencing upon the Exercise Date and prior
to the Expiration Date. As used herein, the term "Exercise Date" means the date
on which Grantee becomes unconditionally entitled to receive a termination fee
pursuant to Section 7.3(b) of the Merger Agreement (the "Termination Fee"). As
used herein, the term "Expiration Date" means the first to occur prior to
Grantee's exercise of the Option pursuant to Section 1.2(b) of:

                        (i)     the Effective Time;

                        (ii)    written notice of termination of this Agreement
                                by Grantee to Issuer;

                        (iii)   12 months after the first occurrence of an
                                Exercise Date; or

                        (iv)    the date of termination of the Merger Agreement,
                                unless, in the case of this clause (iv), Grantee
                                has the right to receive the Termination Fee
                                either (x) upon, or (y) following, such
                                termination upon the occurrence of certain
                                events, in which case the Option will not
                                terminate until the later of (A) 15 business
                                days following the time the Termination Fee
                                becomes unconditionally payable, and (B) the
                                expiration of the period referred to in Section
                                7.3(b)(A)(III) of the Merger Agreement.

Notwithstanding the termination of the Option, Grantee shall be entitled to
purchase those Option Shares with respect to which it may have exercised the
Option by delivery of an Option Notice (as defined below) prior to the
Expiration Date, and the termination of the Option will not affect any rights
hereunder that by their terms do not terminate or expire prior to or at the
Expiration Date.

                (b) In the event Grantee wishes to exercise the Option, Grantee
shall send a written notice to Issuer of its intention to so exercise the Option
(an "Option Notice"), specifying the number of Option Shares to be purchased
(and the denominations of the certificates, if more than one), whether the
aggregate Exercise Price will be paid in cash or by surrendering a portion of
the Option in accordance with Section 1.3(b) or a combination thereof, and the
place in the United States, time and date of the closing of such purchase (the
"Option Closing" and the date of such Closing, the "Option Closing Date"), which
date shall not be less than two Business



                                       2
<PAGE>   71

Days nor more than ten Business Days from the date on which an Option Notice is
delivered; provided, however, that the Option Closing shall be held only if (i)
such purchase would not otherwise violate or cause the violation of, any
applicable material law, statute, ordinance, rule or regulation (including the
HSR Act) (individually, a "Law" and collectively, "Laws"), and (ii) no material
judgment, order, writ, injunction, ruling or decree of any Governmental
Authority (collectively, "Orders") shall have been promulgated, enacted, entered
into, or enforced by any Governmental Authority that prohibits delivery of the
Option Shares, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent; provided, however,
that the parties hereto shall use their reasonable best efforts to (x) promptly
make and process all necessary filings and applications and obtain all consents,
approvals, Orders, authorizations, registrations and declarations or expiration
or termination of any required waiting periods (collectively, "Approvals") and
to comply with any such applicable Laws and (y) have any such Order vacated or
reversed. In the event the Option Closing is delayed pursuant to clause (i) or
(ii) above, the Option Closing shall be within ten Business Days following the
cessation of such restriction, violation, Law or Order or the receipt of any
necessary Approval, as the case may be (so long as the Option Notice was
delivered prior to the Expiration Date); provided further, that, notwithstanding
any prior Option Notice, Grantee shall be entitled to rescind such Option Notice
and shall not be obligated to purchase any Option Shares in connection with such
exercise upon written notice to such effect to Issuer.

                (c) At any Option Closing, (i) Issuer shall deliver to Grantee
all of the Option Shares to be purchased by delivery of a certificate or
certificates evidencing such Option Shares in the denominations designated by
Grantee in the Option Notice, and (ii) if the Option is exercised in part and/or
surrendered in part to pay the aggregate Exercise Price pursuant to Section
1.3(b), Issuer and Grantee shall execute and deliver an amendment to this
Agreement reflecting the Option Shares for which the Option has not been
exercised and/or surrendered. If at the time of issuance of any Option Shares
pursuant to an exercise of all or part of the Option hereunder, Issuer shall
have issued any rights or other securities which are attached to or otherwise
associated with the Issuer Common Stock, then each Option Share issued pursuant
to such exercise shall also represent such rights or other securities with terms
substantially the same as and at least as favorable to Grantee as are provided
under any shareholder rights agreement or similar agreement of Issuer then in
effect. At the Option Closing, Grantee shall pay to Issuer by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account specified by Issuer to Grantee in
writing at least two Business Days prior to the Option Closing an amount equal
to the Exercise Price multiplied by the number of Option Shares to be purchased
for cash pursuant to this Article I; provided, however, that the failure or
refusal of Issuer to specify an account shall not affect Issuer's obligation to
issue the Option Shares.

                (d) Upon the delivery by Grantee to Issuer of the Option Notice
and the tender of the applicable aggregate Exercise Price in immediately
available funds or the requisite portion of the Option in accordance with
Section 1.3, Grantee shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Option
Shares issuable upon such exercise, notwithstanding that the stock transfer
books of Issuer may then be closed, that certificates representing such Option
Shares may not then have been actually delivered to Grantee, or Issuer may have
failed or refused to take any action required of it hereunder. Issuer shall pay
all expenses that may be payable in connection with the preparation, issuance
and delivery of stock certificates or an amendment to this Agreement under this
Section 1.2 and any filing fees and other expenses arising from the performance
of the transactions contemplated hereby.

        1.3 Payments.

                (a) The purchase and sale of the Option Shares pursuant to
Section 1.2 of this Agreement shall be at a purchase price equal to $26.8125 per
share (as such amount may be adjusted pursuant to the terms hereof, the
"Exercise Price"), payable at Grantee's option in cash, by surrender of a
portion of the Option in accordance with Section 1.3(b), or a combination
thereof.

                (b) Grantee may elect to purchase Option Shares issuable, and
pay some or all of the aggregate Exercise Price payable, upon an exercise of the
Option by surrendering a portion of the Option with respect to such number of
Option Shares as is determined by dividing (i) the aggregate Exercise Price
payable in respect of the number of Option Shares being purchased in such manner
by (ii) the excess of the Fair Market Value (as defined below) per share of
Issuer Common Stock as of the last trading day preceding the date Grantee
delivers its Option Notice (such date, the "Option Exercise Date") over the per
share Exercise Price. The "Fair Market Value" per share of Issuer Common Stock
shall be (x) if the Issuer Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange
(the "NYSE") or any other nationally recognized exchange or trading system as of
the Option Exercise Date, the average of last reported sale prices per share of
Issuer Common Stock thereon for the ten trading days commencing on the 12th
trading day immediately preceding the Option Exercise Date, or (y) if the Issuer
Common Stock is not listed on the NYSE or any other nationally recognized
exchange or trading system as of the Option Exercise Date, the amount determined
by a mutually acceptable independent investment banking firm as the value per
share the Issuer Common Stock would have if publicly traded on a nationally
recognized exchange or trading system (assuming no discount for minority
interest, illiquidity or restrictions on transfer). That portion of the Option
so surrendered under this Section 1.3(b) shall be canceled and shall thereafter
be of no further force and effect.

                (c) Certificates for the Option Shares delivered at an Option
Closing will have typed or printed thereon a restrictive legend which will read
substantially as follows:

        "THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED
        UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND MAY BE REOFFERED OR
        SOLD ONLY IF SO REGISTERED OR IF AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH REGISTRATION IS
        AVAILABLE. SUCH SECURITIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS
        ON TRANSFER AS SET FORTH IN THE STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT DATED AS OF
        JANUARY 28, 2001, A COPY OF WHICH MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE SECRETARY OF
        STAR CORPORATION AT ITS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES."

It is understood and agreed that (i) the reference to restrictions arising under
the Securities Act in the above legend will be removed by delivery of substitute
certificate(s) without such reference if such Option Shares have been registered
pursuant to the Securities Act, such Option Shares have been sold in reliance on
and in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act or Grantee has
delivered to Issuer a copy of a letter from the staff of the SEC, or an opinion
of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Issuer and its
counsel, to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the
Securities Act and (ii) the reference to restrictions pursuant to this Agreement
in the above legend will be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s)
without such reference if the Option Shares evidenced by certificate(s)
containing such reference



                                       4
<PAGE>   73

have been sold or transferred in compliance with the provisions of this
Agreement under circumstances that do not require the retention of such
reference.


                                   ARTICLE II

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

        2.1 Representations and Warranties of Grantee. Grantee hereby represents
and warrants to Issuer that any Option Shares or other securities acquired by
Grantee upon exercise of the Option will not be taken with a view to the public
distribution thereof and will not be transferred or otherwise disposed of except
in a transaction registered or exempt from registration under the Securities
Act.

        2.2 Representations and Warranties of Issuer. Issuer hereby represents
and warrants to Grantee as follows:

                (a) Option Shares. Issuer has taken all necessary corporate and
other action to authorize and reserve for issuance, and, subject to receipt of
any Approvals, to permit it to issue, the Option Shares and all additional
shares or other securities that may be issued pursuant to Section 3.1 upon
exercise of the Option, and, at all times from the date hereof until such time
as the obligation to deliver Option Shares hereunder terminates, will have
reserved for issuance upon exercise of the Option the Option Shares and such
other additional shares or securities, if any. All of the Option Shares and all
additional shares or other securities or property that may be issuable pursuant
to Section 3.1, upon exercise of the Option and issuance pursuant hereto, shall
be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, shall be
delivered free and clear of all Liens of any nature whatsoever, and shall not be
subject to any preemptive or similar right of any Person.

                (b) No Restrictions. No Delaware law or other takeover statute
or similar Law and no provision of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or
Bylaws of Issuer or any agreement to which Issuer is a party (i) would or would
purport to impose restrictions that might adversely affect or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (ii) as a
result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(x) would or would purport to restrict or impair the ability of Grantee to vote
or otherwise exercise the rights of a stockholder with respect to securities of
Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries that may be acquired or controlled by Grantee,
or (y) would or would purport to entitle any Person to acquire securities of
Issuer.


                                   ARTICLE III

                    ADJUSTMENT UPON CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION

                3.1 In addition to the adjustment in the number of shares of
Issuer Common Stock that may be purchased upon exercise of the Option pursuant
to Section 1.1, the number of shares of Issuer Common Stock that may be
purchased upon the exercise of the Option and the Exercise Price shall be
subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this Section 3.1. In the
event of any change in the number of issued and outstanding shares of Issuer
Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend, split-up, merger,
recapitalization, combination, conversion,



                                       5
<PAGE>   74

exchange of shares, spin-off or other change in the corporate or capital
structure of Issuer that would have the effect of diluting or otherwise
diminishing Grantee's rights hereunder, the number and kind of Option Shares or
other securities subject to the Option and the Exercise Price therefor shall be
appropriately adjusted so that Grantee shall receive upon exercise of the Option
(or, if such a change occurs between exercise and the Option Closing, upon the
Option Closing) the number and kind of shares or other securities or property
that Grantee would have received in respect of the Option Shares that Grantee is
entitled to purchase upon exercise of the Option if the Option had been
exercised (or the purchase thereunder had been consummated, as the case may be)
immediately prior to such event or the record date for such event, as
applicable. The rights of Grantee under this Article III shall be in addition
to, and shall in no way limit, its rights against Issuer for breach of or the
failure to perform any provision of the Merger Agreement.


                                   ARTICLE IV

                               REGISTRATION RIGHTS

        4.1 Registration of Option Shares Under the Securities Act.

                (a) If requested by Grantee at any time and from time to time
within two years after receipt by Grantee of Option Shares (the "Registration
Period"), Issuer shall use its reasonable best efforts, as promptly as
practicable, to effect the registration under the Securities Act and any
applicable state law (a "Demand Registration") of such number of Option Shares
or such other Issuer securities owned by or issuable to Grantee in accordance
with the method of sale or other disposition contemplated by Grantee, including
a "shelf" registration statement under Rule 415 of the Securities Act or any
successor provision, and to obtain all consents or waivers of other parties that
are required therefor. Except with respect to such a "shelf" registration,
Issuer shall keep such Demand Registration effective for a period of not less
than 180 days, unless, in the written opinion of counsel to Issuer, which
opinion shall be delivered to Grantee and which shall be reasonably satisfactory
in form and substance to Grantee and its counsel, such registration under the
Securities Act is not required in order to lawfully sell and distribute such
Option Shares or other Issuer securities in the manner contemplated by Grantee.
Issuer shall only have the obligation to effect three Demand Registrations
pursuant to this Section 4.1; provided, however, that only requests relating to
a registration statement that has become effective under the Securities Act
shall be counted for purposes of determining the number of Demand Registrations
made. Issuer shall be entitled to postpone for up to 90 days from receipt of
Grantee's request for a Demand Registration the filing of any registration
statement in connection therewith if the Board of Directors of Issuer determines
in its good faith reasonable judgment that such registration would materially
interfere with any material event involving the Issuer or require premature
disclosure of any material non-public information, the disclosure of which would
materially and adversely affect the Issuer; provided, however, that Issuer shall
not have postponed any Demand Registration pursuant to this sentence during the
twelve month period immediately preceding the date of delivery of Grantee's
request for a Demand Registration.

                (b) If Issuer effects a registration under the Securities Act of
Issuer Common Stock for its own account or for any other stockholders of Issuer
(other than on Form S-4 or Form S-8, or any successor form), Grantee shall have
the right to participate in such registration and include in such registration
the number of shares of Issuer Common Stock or such other Issuer securities as
Grantee shall designate by notice to Issuer (an "Incidental Registration" and,
together with a



                                       6
<PAGE>   75

Demand Registration, a "Registration"); provided, however, that, if the
Incidental Registration is in connection with an underwritten public offering,
the managing underwriters of such offering advise Issuer in writing that, in
their opinion, the number of shares of Issuer Common Stock or other Issuer
securities requested to be included in such Incidental Registration exceeds the
number which can be sold in such offering, Issuer shall include therein (i)
first, all shares proposed to be included therein by Issuer, (ii) second,
subject to the rights of any other holders of registration rights in effect as
of the date hereof, the shares requested to be included therein by Grantee, and
(iii) third, shares proposed to be included therein by any other stockholder of
Issuer. Participation by Grantee in any Incidental Registration shall not affect
the obligation of Issuer to effect Demand Registrations under this Section 4.1.
Issuer may withdraw any registration under the Securities Act that gives rise to
an Incidental Registration without the consent of Grantee.

                (c) In connection with any Registration pursuant to this Section
4.1 that is an underwritten public offering, (i) Issuer and Grantee shall
provide each other and any underwriter of the offering with customary
representations, warranties, covenants, indemnification and contribution
obligations in connection with such Registration, (ii) Issuer shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause any Option Shares included in such Registration
to be approved for listing on the NYSE or any other nationally recognized
exchange or trading system upon which Issuer's securities are then listed,
subject to official notice of issuance, which notice shall be given by Issuer
upon issuance, and (iii) Grantee shall provide all information reasonably
requested by Issuer that is required for inclusion in any registration statement
covering the Option Shares. Grantee will provide all information reasonably
requested by Issuer for inclusion in any registration statement to be filed
hereunder. The costs and expenses incurred by Issuer in connection with any
Registration pursuant to this Section 4.1 (including any fees related to
qualifications under Blue Sky Laws and SEC filing fees) (the "Registration
Expenses") shall be borne by Issuer, excluding legal fees of Grantee's counsel
and underwriting discounts or commissions with respect to Option Shares to be
sold by Grantee included in a Registration.

        4.2 Transfers of Option Shares.

                (a) The Option Shares may not be sold, assigned, transferred, or
otherwise disposed of except (i) as provided in Section 4.1 or (ii) other than
in accordance with Section 5.3 hereof, to any purchaser or transferee who would
not, to the knowledge of Grantee after reasonable inquiry, immediately following
such sale, assignment, transfer or disposal beneficially own more than five
percent (5%) of the then-outstanding voting power of the Issuer; provided,
however, that Grantee shall be permitted to sell any Option Shares if such sale
is made pursuant to a tender or exchange offer that has been approved or
recommended by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of Issuer
(which majority shall include a majority of directors who were directors as of
the date hereof).

                                    ARTICLE V
               REPURCHASE RIGHTS; SUBSTITUTE OPTION; FIRST REFUSAL

        5.1 Repurchase Rights.

                (a) At any time on or after the Exercise Date and prior to the
Expiration Date, Grantee shall have the right (the "Repurchase Right") to
require Issuer to repurchase from Grantee (i) the Option or any part thereof as
Grantee shall designate at a price (the "Option Repurchase Price") equal to the
amount by which (A) the Market/Offer Price (as defined below) exceeds (B) the
Exercise Price, multiplied by the number of Option Shares as to which the



                                       7
<PAGE>   76

Option is to be repurchased, and (ii) such number of Option Shares as Grantee
shall designate at a price (the "Option Share Repurchase Price") equal to the
Market/Offer Price multiplied by the number of Option Shares so designated. The
term "Market/Offer Price" shall mean the highest of (x) the highest price per
share of Issuer Common Stock offered or paid in any Acquisition Proposal (as
defined in the Merger Agreement), or (y) the highest closing price for shares of
Issuer Common Stock during the six-month period immediately preceding the date
Grantee gives the Repurchase Notice (as hereinafter defined). In determining the
Market/Offer Price, the value of consideration other than cash shall be
determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by
Grantee and reasonably acceptable to Issuer, which determination, absent
manifest error, shall be conclusive for all purposes of this Agreement.

                (b) Grantee shall exercise its Repurchase Right by delivering to
Issuer written notice (a "Repurchase Notice") stating that Grantee elects to
require Issuer to repurchase all or a portion of the Option and/or the Option
Shares as specified therein. The closing of the Repurchase Right (the
"Repurchase Closing") shall take place in the United States at the place, time
and date specified in the Repurchase Notice, which date shall not be less than
two Business Days nor more than ten Business Days from the date on which the
Repurchase Notice is delivered. At the Repurchase Closing, subject to the
receipt of a writing evidencing the surrender of the Option and/or certificates
representing Option Shares, as the case may be, Issuer shall deliver to Grantee
the Option Repurchase Price therefor or the Option Share Repurchase Price
therefor, as the case may be, or the portion thereof that Issuer is not then
prohibited under applicable Law from so delivering. At the Repurchase Closing,
(i) Issuer shall pay to Grantee the Option Repurchase Price for the portion of
the Option that is to be repurchased or the Option Shares Repurchase Price for
the number of Option Shares to be repurchased, as the case may be, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified by Grantee at
least 24 hours prior to the Repurchase Closing, and (ii) if the Option is
repurchased only in part, Issuer and Grantee shall execute and deliver an
amendment to this Agreement reflecting the Option Shares for which the Option is
not being repurchased.

                (c) To the extent that Issuer is prohibited under applicable Law
from repurchasing the portion of the Option or the Option Shares designated in
such Repurchase Notice, Issuer shall immediately so notify Grantee and
thereafter deliver, from time to time, to Grantee the portion of the Option
Repurchase Price and the Option Share Repurchase Price, respectively, that it is
no longer prohibited from delivering, within five Business Days after the date
on which Issuer is no longer so prohibited; provided, however, that if Issuer at
any time after delivery of a Repurchase Notice is prohibited under applicable
Law from delivering to Grantee the full amount of the Option Repurchase Price
and the Option Share Repurchase Price for the Option or Option Shares to be
repurchased, respectively, Grantee may rescind the exercise of the Repurchase
Right, whether in whole, in part or to the extent of the prohibition, and, to
the extent rescinded, no part of the amounts, terms or the rights with respect
to the Option or Repurchase Right shall be changed or affected as if such
Repurchase Right were not exercised. Issuer shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain all required regulatory and legal approvals and to file any
required notices to permit Grantee to exercise its Repurchase Right and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to avoid or cause to be rescinded or rendered
inapplicable any prohibition on Issuer's repurchase of the Option or the Option
Shares.

        5.2 Substitute Option.

                (a) In the event that Issuer enters into an agreement (i) to
consolidate with or merge into any Person, other than Grantee or any Subsidiary
of Grantee (each an "Excluded Person"), and Issuer is not the continuing or
surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger, (ii) to permit any
Person, other than an Excluded Person, to merge into Issuer and Issuer shall be
the continuing or surviving or acquiring corporation, but, in connection with
such merger, the then outstanding shares of Issuer Common Stock shall be changed
into or exchanged for stock or other securities of any other Person or cash or
any other property or the then outstanding shares of Issuer Common Stock shall
after such merger represent less than 50% of the outstanding voting securities
of the merged or acquiring company, or (iii) to sell or otherwise transfer all
or substantially all of its assets to any Person, other than an Excluded Person,
then, and in each such case, the agreement governing such transaction shall make
proper provision so that, unless earlier exercised by Grantee, the Option shall,
upon the consummation of any such transaction and upon the terms and conditions
set forth herein, be converted into, or exchanged for, an option with identical
terms appropriately adjusted to acquire the number and class of shares or other
securities or property that Grantee would have received in respect of Issuer
Common Stock if the Option had been exercised immediately prior to such
consolidation, merger, sale, or transfer, or the record date therefor, as
applicable and make any other necessary adjustments; provided, however, that if
such a conversion or exchange cannot, because of applicable Law be the same as
the Option, such terms shall be as similar as possible and in no event less
advantageous to Grantee than the Option.

                (b) In addition to any other restrictions or covenants, Issuer
agrees that it shall not enter or agree to enter into any transaction described
in Section 5.2(a) unless the Acquiring Corporation (as hereinafter defined) and
any Person that controls the Acquiring Corporation assume in writing all the
obligations of Issuer hereunder and agree for the benefit of Grantee to comply
with this Article V.

                (c) For purposes of this Section 5.2, the term "Acquiring
Corporation" shall mean (i) the continuing or surviving Person of a
consolidation or merger with Issuer (if other than Issuer), (ii) Issuer in a
consolidation or merger in which Issuer is the continuing or surviving or
acquiring Person, and (iii) the transferee of all or substantially all of
Issuer's assets.

        5.3 First Refusal.

                (a) If Grantee desires to sell, assign, transfer or otherwise
dispose of all or any of the shares of Issuer Common Stock or other securities
acquired by it pursuant to the exercise of the Option, it will give Issuer
written notice of the proposed transaction (the "Offeror's Notice"), identifying
the proposed transferee, the proposed purchase price and the terms of such
proposed transaction. For ten business days following receipt of such notice,
Issuer shall have the option to elect by written notice to purchase all, but not
less than all, of the Issuer Common Stock or other securities specified in
Offeror's Notice at the price and upon the terms set froth in such notice.

                (b) The closing of any repurchase of Option Shares pursuant to
this Section 5.3 shall take place within ten business days of Issuer's election
to purchase such Option Shares. On such closing date, Issuer shall pay the
purchase price to Grantee in immediately available funds, and Grantee shall
thereupon surrender to Issuer the certificate or certificates evidencing



                                       9
<PAGE>   78

the shares of Issuer Common Stock or other securities repurchased by the Issuer
pursuant to this Section 5.3.

                (c) If Issuer does not elect to purchase the shares of Issuer
Common Stock or other securities designated in the Offeror's Notice, Grantee
may, within 60 days from the date of the Offeror's Notice, sell such shares of
Issuer Common Stock or other securities to the proposed transferee at no less
than the price specified and on terms not more favorable to the transferee than
those set forth in the Offeror's Notice; provided, however, that the provisions
of this Section 5.3(c) will not limit the rights Grantee many otherwise have if
Issuer has elected to purchase such shares of Issuer Common Stock or other
securities and wrongfully refuses to complete such purchase.

                (d) The requirements of this Section 5.3 will not apply to (i)
any sale, assignment, transfer or disposition to an affiliate of Grantee;
provided, however, that such affiliate agrees to be bound by the terms hereof,
(ii) any sale, assignment, transfer or disposition as a result of which the
proposed transferee would own beneficially not more than 5% of the outstanding
voting power of the Issuer, or (iii) any sales or transfers by Grantee in a
registered underwritten offering.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

        6.1 Total Profit.

                (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no
event shall Grantee's Total Profit (as hereinafter defined) plus any termination
fees paid by Issuer pursuant to Section 7.3(b) of the Merger Agreement (such
fees, collectively, the "Total Issuer Fees") exceed in the aggregate an amount
(the "Limitation Amount") equal to $75,000,000, and, if the total amount that
would otherwise be received by Grantee otherwise would exceed such amount,
Grantee, at its sole election, shall either (i) reduce the number of shares of
Issuer Common Stock subject to this Option, (ii) deliver to Issuer for
cancellation Option Shares previously purchased by Grantee, (iii) reduce the
amount of the Option Repurchase Price or the Option Share Repurchase Price, (iv)
pay cash to Issuer, or (v) any combination thereof, so that Grantee's actually
realized Total Profit, when aggregated with the Total Issuer Fees so paid to
Grantee, shall not exceed the Limitation Amount after taking into account the
foregoing actions.

                (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
Option may not be exercised for a number of Option Shares as would, as of the
date of exercise, result in a Notional Total Profit (as defined below) which,
together with the Total Issuer Fees theretofore paid to Grantee, would exceed
the Limitation Amount; provided, however, that nothing in this sentence shall
restrict any exercise of the Option permitted hereby on any subsequent date.

                (c) As used herein, the term "Total Profit" shall mean the
aggregate amount (before taxes) of the following: (i) the amount received by
Grantee pursuant to Issuer's repurchase of the Option (or any portion thereof)
pursuant to Section 5.1, (ii) (x) the amount received by Grantee pursuant to
Issuer's repurchase or purchase of Option Shares pursuant to Section 5.1 or
Section 5.3, as the case may be, less (y) Grantee's purchase price for such
Option Shares, and (iii) (x) the net cash amounts or the fair market value of
any property received by Grantee pursuant to any consummated arm's-length sales
of Option Shares (or any other



                                       10
<PAGE>   79

securities into which such Option Shares are converted or exchanged) to any
unaffiliated party, less (y) Grantee's purchase price of such Option Shares.

                (d) As used herein, the term "Notional Total Profit" with
respect to any number of Option Shares as to which Grantee may propose to
exercise the Option shall be the Total Profit determined as of the date of such
proposal assuming that the Option was exercised on such date for such number of
Option Shares and assuming that such Option Shares, together with all other
Option Shares held by Grantee and its affiliates as of such date, were sold for
cash at the closing market price (less customary brokerage commissions) for
shares of Issuer Common Stock on the preceding trading day on the NASDAQ
National Market System (or on any other nationally recognized exchange or
trading system on which shares of Issuer Common Stock are then so listed or
traded).

        6.2 Further Assurances; Listing.

                (a) From time to time, at the other party's request and without
further consideration, each party hereto shall execute and deliver such
additional documents and take all such further action as may be necessary or
desirable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including, without limitation, to vest in Grantee good and marketable title,
free and clear of all Liens, to any Option Shares purchased hereunder. Issuer
agrees not to avoid or seek to avoid (whether by charter amendment or through
reorganization, consolidation, merger, issuance of rights or securities, the
Company Rights Agreement or similar agreement, dissolution or sale of assets, or
by any other voluntary act) the observance or performance of any of the
covenants, agreements or conditions to be observed or performed hereunder by it.

                (b) If the Issuer Common Stock or any other securities to be
acquired upon exercise of the Option are then listed on the NYSE (or any other
national securities exchange or trading system), Issuer, upon the request of
Grantee, will promptly file an application to list the shares of Issuer Common
Stock or such other securities to be acquired upon exercise of the Option on the
NYSE (and any other national securities exchange or trading system) and will use
reasonable best efforts to obtain approval of such listing as promptly as
practicable.

        6.3 Division of Option; Lost Options. The Agreement (and the Option
granted hereby) are exchangeable, without expense, at the option of Grantee,
upon presentation and surrender of this Agreement at the principal office of
Issuer, for other agreements providing for Options of different denominations
entitling Grantee to purchase, on the same terms and subject to the same
conditions as are set forth herein, in the aggregate the same number of Option
Shares purchasable hereunder. Upon receipt by Issuer of evidence reasonably
satisfactory to it of the loss, theft or destruction or mutilation of this
Agreement, and (in the case of loss, theft or destruction) of reasonably
satisfactory indemnification, and upon surrender and cancellation of this
Agreement, if mutilated, Issuer will execute and deliver a new agreement of like
tenor and date.

        6.4 Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

        6.8 Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries.

                (a) This Agreement and the other agreements of the parties
referred to herein constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

                (b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the
benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,

        6.9 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts
executed and to be performed entirely within that State.

        6.10 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy, all
other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to
the greatest extent possible.

        6.11 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests
or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto, in
whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior
written consent of the other party, and any attempt to make any such assignment
without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable
by the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

        6.12 Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers. Each of Grantee and Issuer
irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this
Agreement or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect hereof
brought by the other party hereto or its successors or assigns may be brought
and determined in the Chancery or other Courts of the State of Delaware, and
each of Grantee and Issuer hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such
action or proceeding for itself and in respect to its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. Each
of Grantee and Issuer hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by
way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason
other than the failure to lawfully serve process, (b) that it or its property is
exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process
commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to
judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise), (c) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, that (i) the
suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient
forum, (ii) the venue of such



                                       13

single or partial exercise of any such right preclude other or further exercise
thereof or of any other right. All rights and remedies existing under this
Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive to, and not exclusive of, any

                           AFFILIATE POOLING AGREEMENT

                                January 28, 2001

Maxim Integrated Systems, Inc.
120 San Gabriel
Sunnyvale, CA  94086

Ladies and Gentlemen:

        The undersigned has been advised that, as of the date hereof, the
undersigned may be deemed to be an "affiliate"("Affiliate") of Dallas
Semiconductor Corporation., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), as that term
is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the Regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").

        Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of that certain
Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among Maxim Integrated Systems, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Parent"), MI Acquisition Sub, Inc., a newly formed
Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and
the Company, dated as of January 28, 2001 (the "Merger Agreement"), providing
for, among other things, the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the
"Merger"), the undersigned will be entitled to receive shares of common stock of
Parent [or options or warrants to acquire Parent Common Stock] (collectively
"Parent Common Stock") in exchange for shares of common stock of the Company [or
options or warrants to acquire Company Common Stock] (collectively "Company
Common Stock") owned by the undersigned at the Effective Time of the Merger as
determined pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Capitalized terms used but not
defined herein are defined in the Merger Agreement and are used herein with the
same meanings ascribed to them therein.

        The undersigned understands that the Merger will be treated for
financial accounting purposes as a "pooling of interests" in accordance with
GAAP, and that the staff of the SEC has issued certain guidelines that should be
followed to ensure the application of pooling of interests accounting to the
Merger.

        In consideration of the agreements contained herein, Parent's reliance
on this letter in connection with the consummation of the Merger and for other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the undersigned hereby agrees that the undersigned will not make
any sale, pledge, transfer or other disposition of, or hedge or reduce its risk
with respect to, (i) Company Common Stock during the period from the 30th day
prior to the Effective Time until the earlier of the Effective Time or the
termination of the Merger Agreement or (ii) Parent Common Stock now owned or
hereafter acquired by the undersigned, including, without limitation, Parent
Common Stock to be received by the undersigned pursuant to the Merger, until
such time as financial statements that include at least 30 days of combined
operations of the Company and Parent after the Merger will have been

<PAGE>   85

publicly reported, unless the undersigned delivers to Parent, prior to any such
sale, transfer or other disposition, written advice from Ernst & Young LLP,
independent public accountants for Parent, or a written no-action letter from
the accounting staff of the SEC, in either case in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, to the effect that such sale, transfer or other
disposition will not cause the Merger not to be treated as a "pooling of
interests" for financial accounting purposes in accordance with GAAP and the
Regulations of the SEC.

        The undersigned has been advised that the offering, sale and delivery of
the shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will have been
registered with the SEC under the Securities Act on a Registration Statement on
Form S-4. The undersigned also has been advised, however, that, because the
undersigned may be deemed to be an Affiliate of the Company at the time the
Merger is submitted for a vote of the stockholders of the Company, Parent Common
Stock received by the undersigned pursuant to the Merger can be sold by the
undersigned only (i) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act, (ii) in conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule
145 promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act or (iii) in reliance upon an
exemption from registration that is available under the Securities Act.

        The undersigned also understands that "stop transfer" instructions will
be given to the transfer agent for the Company Common Stock with respect to
shares of the Company Common Stock now owned or hereafter acquired by the
undersigned and that there will be placed on the certificates representing such
shares of Company Common Stock, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating
in substance as follows:

                "These shares may be transferred only in accordance with the
        terms of an Affiliate Pooling Agreement between the original holder of
        such shares and Sun, Inc., a copy of which agreement is on file at the
        principal offices of Maxim Integrated Systems, Inc."

It is understood and agreed that the legend set forth above will be removed upon
surrender of certificates bearing such legend by delivery of substitute
certificates without such legend (i) if the undersigned will have delivered to
Parent the above-referenced advice of Ernst & Young LLP, or the above-referenced
no-action letter from the accounting staff of the SEC or (ii) upon the
termination of the Merger Agreement.

        The undersigned also understands that "stop transfer" instructions will
be given to the transfer agent for Parent Common Stock with respect to shares of
Parent Common Stock to be received by the undersigned pursuant to the Merger and
that there will be placed on the certificates representing such shares of Parent
Common Stock, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance as
follows:

                "These shares were issued in a transaction to which Rule 145
        promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, applies. These
        shares may be transferred only in accordance with the terms of such Rule
        and an Affiliate Pooling Agreement between the original holder of such
        shares and Sun, Inc., a copy of which agreement is on file at the
        principal offices of Sun, Inc."



                                       2
<PAGE>   86

It is understood and agreed that the legend set forth above will be removed upon
surrender of certificates bearing such legend by delivery of substitute
certificates without such legend if the undersigned will have delivered to
Parent an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Parent, to the effect that (i) the sale or disposition of the shares represented
by the surrendered certificates may be effected without registration of the
offering, sale and delivery of such shares under the Securities Act, and (ii)
the undersigned will have delivered to Parent the above-referenced advice of
Ernst & Young LLP or the above-referenced no-action letter from the accounting
staff of the SEC.

        Parent agrees that it will not unreasonably refuse to consent to, or
unreasonably delay, the removal of the foregoing legends.

        By its execution hereof, Parent agrees that it will, as long as the
undersigned owns any Parent Common Stock to be received by the undersigned
pursuant to the Merger, take all reasonable efforts to make timely filings with
the SEC of all reports required to be filed by it pursuant to the Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, and will promptly furnish upon written request of the
undersigned a written statement confirming that such reports have been so timely
filed.

        If you are in agreement with the foregoing, please so indicate by
signing below and returning a copy of this Affiliate Pooling Agreement to the
undersigned, and this Affiliate Pooling Agreement will become a binding
agreement between us as of the date first above written.
