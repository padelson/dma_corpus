Article XI below.



WHEREAS, the Purchaser desires to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of the Company in a reverse subsidiary merger on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein;



WHEREAS, this Agreement and the related transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, have been approved by the holders of a majority of the
capital stock of the Company, voting together as a single class; and



WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of the Purchaser, the Merger Sub,
and the Company have approved this Agreement, the Merger (as defined below),
and the related transactions contemplated hereby, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth herein.



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:



ARTICLE I



THE MERGER



1.01 The Merger.



(a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, at the Effective Time, the
Merger Sub shall merge (the "Merger") with and into the Company in accordance
with the California Code and the DGCL, whereupon the separate existence of the
Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation
(the "Surviving Corporation").



(b) At the Closing, the Company and the Merger Sub shall cause (i) a Merger 

Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto and separate
certificates from the authorized officers of the Company and Merger Sub
substantially in the forms of Exhibits B-1 and B-2, respectively, attached
hereto (collectively, the "Agreement of Merger") to be executed, acknowledged
and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of California and (ii) a
Certificate of Merger, in substantially the form of Exhibit B-3 attached
hereto (the "DE Certificate of Merger") to be filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware, and make all other filings or recordings
required by the California Code and the DGCL in connection with the Merger.
The Merger shall become effective at such time as each of the Agreement of
Merger and the DE Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of
State of the States of California and Delaware, as applicable, or at such
other time as the Purchaser and the Company shall agree and specify in the
Agreement of Merger and the DE Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time").



(c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall succeed
to all the assets, rights, privileges, powers and franchises, and be subject
to all of the liabilities, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the
Company and the Merger Sub, all as provided under the California Code and the
DGCL.



1.02 Merger Consideration and Related Payments; Effect on Company Securities;
Effect on Capital Stock of Merger Sub.



(a) Amount of Initial Merger Consideration Calculation Amount. The "Initial
Merger Consideration Calculation Amount" means an amount equal to the
following:



(i) $420,000,000; minus



(ii) the Estimated Transaction Costs; minus



(iii) the Estimated Indebtedness; minus



(iv) the Holdback Amount; minus



(v) the Indemnity Escrow Amount; minus



(vi) the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount; plus



(vii) the Estimated Cash amount; plus



(viii) the Estimated Residual Amount; plus



(ix) the Option Exercise Amount; plus



(x) the Option Loan Amount; plus



(xi) the Management Loan Amount; plus



(xii) the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Working Capital exceeds the
Target Working Capital; minus 

(xiii) the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Working Capital is less than
the Target Working Capital.



As more specifically provided in Section 2.02, the cash portion of the Initial
Merger Consideration Calculation Amount to be paid by or at the direction of
Purchaser or Merger Sub to the Common Security Holders on the Closing Date
shall equal the Initial Merger Consideration Calculation Amount minus the
Option Exercise Amount minus the Option Loan Amount minus the Management Loan
Amount. On the Closing Date, the Option Loan Amount shall be deemed to be
repaid by the Stockholders (and the security interests related thereto shall
be deemed to be released, discharged and terminated) and the proceeds thereof
paid to the Common Security Holders in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. Interest shall cease to accrue and be payable to the Company on any
promissory notes related to the Loan Amounts as of the date immediately prior
to the Closing Date. On the Closing Date, the Management Loan Amount shall be
deemed to be repaid by Charles R. Smith and Maryanne Elizabeth Smith, or their
successors, as Trustees of the 2003 Charles and Maryanne Smith Family Trust
dated September 25, 2003 (and the security interests related thereto shall be
deemed to be released, discharged and terminated) and the proceeds thereof
paid to the Common Security Holders in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. Interest shall cease to accrue and be payable to the Company on the
Smith Promissory Note as of the date immediately prior to the Closing Date.



(b) Effect on Company Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof:



(i) Common Stock. Subject to the adjustments set forth in Section

1.11, each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive in cash,
payable to the holder thereof in accordance with this Section 1.02(b)(i), the
consideration set forth in Section 2.02(b) and any Subsequent Merger
Consideration Payments in accordance with Section 2.03, as and when it becomes
payable pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that Purchaser, Merger
Sub or the Surviving Corporation, or any of their designees, as applicable,
shall not have any obligation to deliver to such holder of any such Common
Stock any cash or other consideration for such holder's outstanding shares of
such Common Stock until such holder has delivered to Purchaser (or its
designee) a duly executed and completed Letter of Transmittal, substantially
in the form of Exhibit C-1 attached hereto (a "Letter of Transmittal") to
accompany the certificates for such shares of Common Stock; provided further,
however, that upon receipt by Purchaser (or its designee) of duly executed
Letter of Transmittal from any holder of such Common Stock, Purchaser (or its
designee) shall make any payments owed to such holder of such Common Stock in
accordance with this ARTICLE I and ARTICLE II; and provided further however,
that if a holder of such Common Stock has not delivered to Purchaser (or its
designee) such Letter of Transmittal at Closing, Purchaser (or its designee)
may hold such amount and shall not have any obligation to pay such amount to
such holder of such Common Stock until such Letter of Transmittal is
delivered. Each certificate that is surrendered pursuant to this Section
1.02(b)(i) shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, each such
certificate shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes, only
the right to receive the consideration outlined in Section 2.02(b) and any
Subsequent Merger Consideration Payments in accordance with Section 2.03, as
and when it becomes payable pursuant to this Agreement. 

No interest (other than any interest on the Escrow Fund) will be paid or will
accrue on such portion of the initial Merger consideration payable pursuant to
Section 2.02(b) or any Subsequent Merger Consideration Payments. The Purchaser
shall act as paying agent in effecting the exchange of cash for certificates
which, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represent shares of Common
Stock (other than any Dissenting Shares) entitled to payment pursuant to
Section 1.02.



(ii) Options. All outstanding Options, whether or not then vested or
exercisable in accordance with their terms, shall be terminated or canceled as
of the Effective Time, at which time each Optionholder shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive from the Surviving
Corporation the consideration set forth in Section 2.02(c) and any Subsequent
Merger Consideration Payments in accordance with Section 2.03, as and when it
becomes payable pursuant to this Agreement, if any, provided, however, that
Purchaser, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, or any of their designees,
as applicable, shall not have any obligation to deliver to such holder of such
Options any payment or other consideration for such cancelled Options until
such holder has delivered to Purchaser (or its designee) a duly executed and
completed Option Letter of Transmittal substantially in the form of Exhibit
C-2 attached hereto ("Option Letter of Transmittal") with respect to such
Options; provided further, however, that upon receipt by Purchaser (or its
designee) of any Option Letter of Transmittal from any holder of such Options,
Purchaser (or its designee) shall make any payments due to such holder of
Options in accordance with this ARTICLE I; provided further, however that if
such a holder of Options has not delivered to Purchaser (or its designee) such
Option Letter of Transmittal at Closing, Purchaser may hold such amount and
shall have no obligation to pay such amount to the holder of Options until
such Option Letter of Transmittal is delivered. No interest (other than any
interest on the Escrow Fund) will be paid or will accrue on such portion of
the initial Merger consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) or any
Subsequent Merger Consideration Payments payable to any such holder of such
Options. From and after the Effective Time, each Option shall no longer
represent the right to acquire Common Stock and shall represent for all
purposes only the right to receive the consideration outlined in Section
2.02(c) and any Subsequent Merger Consideration Payments in accordance with
Section 2.03, as and when it becomes payable pursuant to this Agreement. The
Purchaser shall act as paying agent for the Surviving Corporation in effecting
the exchange of cash for Option Letters of Transmittal and cancelling the
outstanding Options as provided in this Section 1.02. The Purchaser shall
further cause the Surviving Corporation to make timely payment to the
appropriate taxing authority or authorities of any amounts withheld from
payment to the Optionholders under this Section 1.02.



(iii) Cancellation of Treasury Stock. Each share of Common Stock held
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Company as treasury stock, if
any, shall be canceled and no payment shall be made with respect thereto. 

(c) Effect on Capital Stock of Merger Sub. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each
share of the Merger Sub's common stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.



(d) No Further Rights. Each share of Common Stock and each Option, when
canceled pursuant to this Section 1.02, as applicable, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired, to the extent
applicable, and each holder of a certificate or certificates representing any
such shares of Common Stock or any evidence of any Option shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the respective
consideration provided for in this Agreement. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and no transfer of shares of
any Common Stock or Options shall be made thereafter. If, after the Effective
Time, certificates representing any shares of Common Stock or any evidence of
any Options are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled
and retired by Purchaser (or its designee) as provided for in this Agreement.



(e) Dissenters' Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is entitled to exercise,
and who properly exercises and perfects, his or her dissenters' rights and
demands payment for the fair value of such shares ("Dissenting Shares")
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with Chapter 13 of the
California Code ("Chapter 13") shall not be converted into the right to
receive any portion of the Initial Merger Consideration Calculation Amount (or
any portion of the Subsequent Merger Consideration Payments), if any, as
provided in this ARTICLE I, but rather the holders of Dissenting Shares shall
be entitled to payment of the fair market value of such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with Chapter 13; provided, however, that if any such holder shall
fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
payment under Chapter 13, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair
value of such holder's Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting
Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into,
and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, the portion
of the Initial Merger Consideration Calculation Amount (plus a portion of the
Subsequent Merger Consideration Payments) as provided in this ARTICLE I. Prior
to the Closing, Purchaser and the Company shall comply, and after the Closing,
Purchaser shall comply, with the information delivery and other requirements
pursuant to Chapter 13 and applicable California law. Prior to the Closing,
the Company shall give Purchaser notice of any written demands of intent to
assert dissenters' rights under the California Code of any shares of Common
Stock, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant
to the California Code and received by the Company. Each dissenting
shareholder who, pursuant to Chapter 13, becomes entitled to payment of the
fair value of the Dissenting Shares will receive payment therefor (but only
after the value therefore has been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant
to such provisions).



(f) Certain Duties and Responsibilities in connection with the Merger. Subject
to the provisions of ARTICLE VIII, Purchaser (or its designee) shall be
responsible for and bear all costs and expenses associated with representing
the Company and the Surviving Corporation following the Closing with respect
to complying with all applicable Laws, including escheat and withholding laws.
Any initial Merger consideration amount payable pursuant to Section 2.02
remaining unclaimed as of a date which is six (6) months following the Closing
Date 

or any Subsequent Merger Consideration Payments remaining unclaimed as of the
date which is six (6) months after the date such payment is determined in
accordance with this Agreement ("Unclaimed Amounts") shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation;
provided, that the Surviving Corporation shall thereafter remain solely liable
for the payment of any Unclaimed Amounts without interest to any holder of
Common Stock or Options after surrender of such Common Stock or evidence of
such Options and delivery of the Letter of Transmittal or Option Letter of
Transmittal (as applicable).



1.03 Lost Certificates. If any certificate representing shares of Common Stock
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then, upon the making of an
affidavit of such fact by the Person claiming such certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Purchaser shall issue, upon receipt of such affidavit
and in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the amounts
set forth in this Agreement to be paid in respect of the shares of Common
Stock represented by such certificate, as contemplated by Section 1.02.



1.04 Withholding Rights. Each of Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from, or in respect of,
payments made in connection with any of the transactions contemplated hereby
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any provision of applicable Law
relating to Taxes. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or paid over to
or deposited with the relevant Governmental Entity by Purchaser, Merger Sub or
the Surviving Corporation, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Common Security Holder in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.



1.05 Escrow Deposits.





(a) At the Closing, Purchaser or Merger Sub shall deposit, or shall cause to
be deposited:



(i) with the Escrow Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
into separate accounts, amounts equal to the Indemnity Escrow Amount and the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount (collectively, the "Escrow Fund") each
to be governed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and an escrow
agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit D (the "Escrow
Agreement"), among Purchaser, the Escrow Agent and the Representative; and



(ii) with the Representative, by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
an aggregate amount equal to $500,000, or such higher amount as the
Representative may designate in writing to the Purchaser prior to Closing (the
"Holdback Amount").



(b) The Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be used solely to
satisfy any amounts owed to Purchaser from the Common Security Holders
pursuant to Section 1.11(i). Any portion of the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Amount that is not then subject to any claims under Section 1.11(i)
shall be released to the Common Security Holders, in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement. Purchaser and the Representative agree to cooperate to
provide prompt notice to the Escrow Agent to satisfy the funding timing
requirements of this 

Section 1.05(b).



(c) The Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be used solely to satisfy (i) any
amounts owed to Purchaser from the Common Security Holders pursuant to Section
1.11(i) and (ii) any indemnification amounts owed to the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties from the Common Security Holders pursuant to Section 8.02. The
Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be paid out or released in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement.



(d) Any fees owed to the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement shall
be paid by the Purchaser. Any indemnification obligations owed to the Escrow
Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement shall be borne in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement.



(e) The Escrow Fund shall be held as a trust fund and shall not be subject to
any encumbrance, attachment, trustee process or any other judicial process of
any creditor of any party, and shall be held and disbursed solely for the
purposes and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement.



(f) All parties hereto agree for all Tax purposes that (i) the right of the
Common Security Holders to the Escrow Fund shall be treated as deferred
contingent purchase price eligible for installment sale treatment under Code
Section 453 and any corresponding provision of foreign, state or local Law, as
appropriate, (ii) any interest and earnings earned from the investment and
reinvestment of the Escrow Fund, or any portion thereof, shall be allocable to
the Purchaser pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.468B-8, (iii) if and
to the extent any amount of the Escrow Fund is actually distributed to the
Common Security Holders, interest may be imputed on such amount, as required
by Code Section 483 or 1274 and (iv) to the extent income and earnings on the
Escrow Fund exceed imputed interest under the relevant provisions of the Code,
such excess shall be treated as additional stated interest for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes. The intention of clause (iv) of the preceding sentence is
to ensure that the rights of the Common Security Holders to any amounts in the
Escrow Fund are not treated as part of a contingent payment sale lacking a
stated maximum selling price. No party shall take any action or filing
position that is inconsistent with the foregoing.



1.06 Holdback. The Holdback Amount shall be held for the benefit of the
Representative, on behalf of the Common Security Holders, to satisfy potential
future obligations of the Common Security Holders to the Representative,
including expenses of the Representative arising from the defense or
enforcement of claims pursuant to Sections 1.11, 8.02 and 10.01. The Holdback
Amount shall be retained in whole or in part by the Representative for such
time as the Representative shall determine in his sole discretion in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing
sentence, any remaining portion of the Holdback Amount available for
distribution to the Common Security Holders, if any, shall be paid by the
Representative to the Common Security Holders no later than five (5) years
after the Effective Time. Any amounts distributed from the Holdback Amount to
the Common Security Holders shall be distributed to them by the Representative
in accordance with Section 10.01(f). Neither the Purchaser nor the Surviving
Corporation shall have any obligation or responsibility with respect to the
distribution of funds from the Holdback Amount, or interest in or claim to the
Holdback Amount.



1.07 Articles of Incorporation. At the Effective Time, the Articles of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as
set forth in Exhibit E attached hereto until amended in accordance with the
California Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Articles of Incorporation
of Surviving Corporation shall include the provisions relating to the
limitation of liability and exculpation of directors and the indemnification
of directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company and other entities
as described in Section 7.03 of this Agreement and any amendment of such
provisions shall be subject to the terms of Section 7.03 of this Agreement.



1.08 Bylaws. The Bylaws of the Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and the provisions of the
Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and in accordance with
the California Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Bylaws of Surviving
Corporation shall include the provisions relating to the limitation of
liability and exculpation of directors and the indemnification of directors,
officers, employees and agents of the Company and other entities as described
in Section 7.03 of this Agreement and any amendment of such provisions shall
be subject to the terms of Section 7.03 of this Agreement.



1.09 Directors and Officers. From and after the Effective Time, until
successors are duly elected or appointed in accordance with the California
Code, the directors of the Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of the Merger Sub at

1.10 Estimated Closing Statement; Allocation Schedule; Accounting Policies.



(a) At least five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to the Purchaser a statement (the "Estimated Closing Statement")
setting forth the Company's good faith estimate of:



(i) the consolidated balance sheet of Company as of the Closing Date

(the "Estimated Closing Balance Sheet");



(ii) a calculation from the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet of the estimated
Working Capital (the "Estimated Working Capital");



(iii) Indebtedness as of the close of business on the Closing Date, including
any prepayment penalties or fees that would be incurred at the Closing (the
"Estimated Indebtedness");

business on the Closing Date (the "Estimated Cash");



(v) all Transaction Costs as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the
"Estimated Transaction Costs"); and 

(vi) all Residual Amounts as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the
"Estimated Residual Amount").



(b) At least five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to the Purchaser an allocation schedule in the form attached
hereto as Schedule 1.10(b) (with the form attached as of the date hereof
provided solely as an example for illustration purposes) (the "Allocation
Schedule") which shall set forth an updated detailed breakdown of all amounts
payable at Closing under this ARTICLE I and ARTICLE II (subject to and in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement), including:



(i) the Estimated Indebtedness, the Estimated Working Capital, Estimated Cash,
the Estimated Transaction Costs and the Estimated Residual Amount;



(ii) the Escrow Amount, the Holdback Amount and the Initial Merger
Consideration Calculation Amount;



(iii) each Common Security Holder's name and address, and for each Common
Security Holder desiring to receive payments by wire transfer, wire
instructions for receipt of such payments (and any Common Security Holders for
whom wire instructions are not provided shall receive payment by check);



(iv) the Option Exercise Amount, the Option Loan Amount and the Management
Loan Amount;



(v) the specific amounts payable to, or for the benefit of, as applicable,

Options, each on a fully-adjusted and fully-diluted basis after accounting for
any applicable stock splits, anti-dilution provisions and any other similar
provisions or events, along with the name of each holder thereof and each
holder's pro rata percentage for calculating any pro rata amounts payable
hereunder with respect to such holders of Common Stock and the number of
Options and each Common Security Holder's Pro Rata Share.



(c) The Estimated Closing Statement, the Proposed Closing Statement and the
Final Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP consistent
with the same accounting principles, policies, methodologies or procedures
used in preparing the Latest Balance Sheet (the "Accounting Policies") to the
extent consistent with GAAP, except that, in calculating the component line
items of Working Capital other than income Tax liabilities, no effect shall be
given to (i) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the financing
thereof, and (ii) any purchase accounting or other similar adjustments
resulting from the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, current liabilities in Working
Capital shall include the employer's share of Medicare Taxes (but not any
Social Security Taxes) attributable to the exercise of Options on or prior to
the Closing Date or payments in respect of Options to Optionholders on or
around the Closing Date. For purposes of clarity, net income Tax liabilities
in Working Capital shall be equal to zero.



1.11 Post-Closing Working Capital Adjustment.



(a) As soon as practicable (and in any event within 90 days following the
Closing Date), the Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the Representative
and its counsel a statement (the "Proposed Closing Statement") setting forth a
good faith determination of consolidated balance sheet of Company as of the
Closing Date prepared by the Purchaser in accordance with Section 1.10(c) (the
"Closing Balance Sheet"), a calculation of the Working Capital, Indebtedness,
Cash, Transaction Costs and Residual Amount in the same manner as described in
Section 1.10(a) and based on such Closing Balance Sheet, and all work papers
and back-up materials relating thereto.



(b) On or prior to the 30th day following the Purchaser's delivery of the
Proposed Closing Statement, the Representative may give the Purchaser a
written notice stating in reasonable detail the Representative's objections
(an "Objection Notice") to the Proposed Closing Statement. Any Objection
Notice shall specify in reasonable detail the dollar amount of any objection
and the basis therefor. Any determination set forth on the Proposed Closing
Statement which is not specifically objected to in the Objection Notice shall
be deemed accepted and shall be final and binding upon the Representative, the
Common Security Holders, the Surviving Corporation and the Purchaser upon
delivery of the Objection Notice and shall not be subject to the Dispute
Resolution Procedure set forth below. If the Representative does not give the
Purchaser an Objection Notice within such 30-day period, then the Proposed
Closing Statement shall be conclusive and binding upon the Representative, the
Common Security Holders, the Surviving Corporation and the Purchaser, and the
Adjustment Amount set forth in the Proposed Closing Statement will constitute
the "Adjustment Amount" for purposes of this Section 1.11. Purchaser shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its and their respective
employees and agents to, assist the Representative and its agents in their
review of the Proposed Closing Statement and shall provide the Representative
and its agents with access at all reasonable times to the books and records of
the Surviving Corporation and its personnel, properties and accountants as may
be reasonably necessary for the Representative to review the Proposed Closing
Statement and for the other purposes set forth in this Section 1.11. Each
party shall bear its own costs in connection with the purposes set forth in
this Section 1.11. For the avoidance of doubt, neither the Purchaser nor the
Representative shall seek to charge the other for any costs incurred by such
party in connection with this Section 1.11.



(c) Following the Purchaser's receipt of any Objection Notice, the
Representative and the Purchaser shall attempt to negotiate in good faith to
resolve such dispute. In the event that the Representative and the Purchaser
fail to resolve the Representative's proposed adjustments set forth in the
Objection Notice within 30 days after the Purchaser receives the Objection
Notice, the Representative and the Purchaser agree that a mutually acceptable
accounting firm of nationally recognized standing (the "Independent Accounting
Firm") shall be retained for review and resolution of any and all matters
specified in such Objection Notice that remain in dispute (and as to no other
matter), and the Independent Accounting Firm shall resolve each such matter
that remains in dispute based solely on the presentations and supporting
material provided by the Representative or Purchaser and not pursuant to any
independent review. The Independent Accounting Firm shall reach a final,
binding resolution of all such matters that remain in dispute, which final
resolution shall not be subject to collateral attack for any reason (other
than fraud or manifest error) and shall be (i) in writing and signed by the
Independent Accounting Firm, (ii) equal to or in the range between the amount
contested by the Representative and Purchaser for each matter specified in the
Objection Notice, (iii) furnished to Purchaser and the Representative 

as soon as practicable after the items in dispute have been referred to the
Independent Accounting Firm, which shall not be more than sixty (60) days
after such referral, (iv) made in accordance with this Agreement and the
Accounting Policies and (v) conclusive and binding upon the parties on the
date of delivery of such written resolution. The Surviving Corporation and the
Representative (on behalf of the Common Security Holders) each agree to
execute, if requested by the Independent Accounting Firm, a reasonable
engagement letter in customary form. The Surviving Corporation, Purchaser and
the Representative agree to cooperate fully with the Independent Accounting
Firm and promptly provide all documents and information requested by the
Independent Accounting Firm so as to enable it to make such determination as
quickly and as accurately as practicable. The procedure outlined in Section
1.11(b) and this Section 1.11(c) is referred to as the "Dispute Resolution
Procedure". Notwithstanding the above, the Independent Accounting Firm shall
serve as an arbitrator of the dispute rather than an auditor.



(d) Purchaser and the Representative (subject to Section 10.01) shall each pay
their own costs and expenses incurred in connection with such Dispute
Resolution Procedure; provided, that the fees and expenses of the Independent
Accounting Firm incurred in the resolution of the disputed matter(s) set forth
in the Objection Notice shall be borne by (i) the Representative, on behalf of
the Common Security Holders (pro rata in accordance with each Common Security
Holder's Pro Rata Share) on the one hand (from the Holdback Amount), and (ii)
the Purchaser, on the other hand, in inverse relation to their success with
respect to any dispute submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm for
resolution.



(e) The Proposed Closing Statement shall become the "Final Closing Statement"
on the applicable one of the following dates: (i) the earlier of (x) the
thirtieth (30th) day following the delivery of the Proposed Closing Statement
if an Objection Notice has not been delivered to Purchaser by the
Representative and (y) the date upon which the Representative acknowledges in
writing that it has no objections to the Proposed Closing Statement, (ii) with
such changes as are necessary to reflect matters resolved pursuant to any
written resolution executed pursuant to Section 1.11(c), on the date such
resolution is executed, if all outstanding matters are resolved through such
resolution and (iii) with such changes as are necessary to reflect the
Independent Accounting Firm's resolution of matters in dispute, on the date
the Independent Accounting Firm delivers its final, binding resolution
pursuant to Section 1.11(c). The date on which the Proposed Closing Statement
shall become the Final Closing Statement pursuant to the immediately foregoing
sentence is referred to as the "Final Determination Date".



(f) Purchaser agrees, solely with respect to the calculations required
pursuant to this Section 1.11, that it will not take any actions with respect
to the Accounting Policies and the Company's books and records as applicable
to the Final Closing Statement. 

(g) Neutral Adjustment Amount. If the Adjustment Amount equals zero, the
Purchaser shall promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days)
cause the Escrow Agent to deliver to the Common Security Holders, by wire
transfer of immediately available United States funds to one or more accounts
designated in writing by the Representative, or in such other manner as
Representative may direct, all funds remaining in the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Account, as set forth more fully in the Escrow Agreement.



(h) Positive Adjustment Amount. Subject to Sections 1.02(b)(i) and
1.02(b)(ii), if the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, Purchaser shall
promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days of the Final
Determination Date) (i) pay to the Common Security Holders, pro rata in
accordance with each Common Security Holder's Pro Rata Share, such Adjustment
Amount, by wire transfer of immediately available United States funds to one
or more accounts designated in writing by the Representative to the Purchaser
and (ii) cause the Escrow Agent to distribute to the Common Security Holders,
pro rata in accordance with each Common Security Holder's Pro Rata Share, all
funds remaining in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated in
writing by the Representative, or in such other manner as Representative may
direct, as set forth more fully in the Escrow Agreement.



(i) Negative Adjustment Amount. Subject to Sections 1.02(b)(i) and
1.02(b)(ii), if the Adjustment Amount is a negative number, the Representative
and the Purchaser shall promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business
Days of the Final Determination Date) cause the Escrow Agent to (i) pay to the
Purchaser solely from and only to the extent of the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Account the absolute value of such Adjustment Amount by wire transfer
of immediately available United States funds to one or more accounts
designated by the Purchaser to the Representative; provided, that if the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount is insufficient to pay the absolute
value of such Adjustment Amount in full, the shortfall shall be paid from the
Indemnity Escrow Account, to the extent funds are available therein, and (ii)
distribute to the Common Security Holders, pro rata in accordance with each
Common Security Holder's Pro Rata Share, all funds remaining in the Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow Account, if any, following the payment set forth in
the immediately preceding clause (i), by wire transfer of immediately
available United States funds to one or more accounts designated in writing by
the Representative, or in such other manner as Representative may direct, as
set forth more fully in the Escrow Agreement. The Deductible shall not apply
to any amounts owed to the Purchaser under this Section 1.11. The Common
Security Holders and the Representative shall not have any liability for any
amounts due pursuant to this Section 1.11, except to the extent of the funds
available in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account and the Indemnity
Escrow Account. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, holders of
Dissenting Shares shall not participate in the provisions of this Section 1.11
and shall not be entitled to receive any portion of the Holdback Amount or the
amounts paid pursuant to this Section 1.11.

the outstanding Loan Amount (and, solely with respect to Charles R. Smith and

monetary obligations of the Company with respect to any Indebtedness
outstanding immediately prior to the Closing;



(h) Purchaser or Merger Sub shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, to each
payee owed any portion of the Estimated Transaction Costs, by wire transfer of

designated by the Company (as previously designated to the Company by each
such payee), the respective amount of Estimated Transaction Costs owed to such
payee; and

provide such certificate will be to withhold from the payments to be made
pursuant to this Agreement any required withholding Tax under Section 1445 of
the Code.



ARTICLE VII



COVENANTS OF THE PURCHASER



7.01 Access to Books and Records. From and after the Closing, the Purchaser
shall, and shall cause the Company to, provide the Representative and its

out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

of Incorporation, the bylaws, other organizational documents, or any
indemnification agreements of the Company and pursuant to applicable Law shall

Time shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation and indemnification to
the full extent of the law.



(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, the Purchaser shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain director and officer
liability insurance which insurance shall provide coverage for the individuals
who were officers and directors of the Company prior to Closing comparable to
the policy or policies maintained by the Company immediately prior to the
Closing for the benefit of such individuals. As the sole means of satisfying
Purchaser's obligation under this Section 7.03(b), Company shall acquire, at

or omissions that occurred at or prior to the Closing, including with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The foregoing provision is
a contract right in favor of the current and former directors and officers of
Company and shall not be adversely effected by any modification to the
Surviving Corporation's Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company
after the date hereof.



(c) The provisions of this Section 7.03 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Person entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Section 7.03, and each such person's heirs, legatees,
representatives, successors and assigns, it being expressly agreed that such
Persons shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 7.03 and (ii) shall
not be subject to amendment by the parties to this Agreement. The
indemnification obligations provided under this Section 7.03 are primary and
the indemnified Persons under this Section 7.03 shall not be obligated to
pursue claims that exist under any other agreement or document which may
provide such Person with any rights of indemnification or exculpation.





(d) Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation hereby acknowledge
that the indemnified Persons under this Section 7.03 may have certain rights
to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided by
current shareholders, members, or other Affiliates of the Company or its
shareholders ("Indemnitee Affiliates") separate from the indemnification
obligations of Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation hereunder.
Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation hereby agree (i) that the
Surviving Corporation is the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., its obligations
to the indemnified Persons under this Section 7.03 are primary and any
obligation of any Indemnitee Affiliate to advance expenses or to provide
indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by the
indemnified Persons under this Section 7.03 are secondary), (ii) that
Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation hereby shall be required
to advance the full amount of expenses incurred by the indemnified Persons
under this Section 7.03 and shall be liable for the full amount of all
expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement to the
extent legally permitted, without regard to any rights the indemnified Persons
under this Section 7.03 may have against any Indemnitee Affiliate, and (iii)
that Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation irrevocably waive,
relinquishes and releases the Indemnitee Affiliates from any and all claims
against the Indemnitee Affiliates for contribution, subrogation or any other
recovery of any kind in respect thereof.



7.04 Employment and Benefit Arrangements.



(a) Immediately following the Closing, all of the employees who, at the
Closing Date, were employed by the Company, either directly or through its co-
employer relationship with Insperity, or its Affiliates, other than the
employees listed on Schedule 7.04 (the "Continuing Employees"), will continue
as employees of the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliate. Purchaser shall
provide Continuing Employees with such compensation and benefit plans,
programs, arrangements, agreements and policies as are provided to similarly
situated employees of the Purchaser. The Purchaser shall take all actions
required so that eligible employees of the Company shall receive service
credit for service with the Company prior to the Closing Date for eligibility
and vesting purposes under any employee benefit plans and arrangements
sponsored by the Purchaser. The Purchaser shall waive any applicable waiting
periods, pre-existing conditions or actively-at-work requirements and shall
give such employees credit under the new coverages or benefit plans for
deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket payments that have been paid during
the year in which such coverage or plan modification occurs. Except with
respect to those Persons set forth on Schedule 7.04(a)(i), if the employment
of any employee of the Company is terminated within six (6) months following
the Closing, the Purchaser shall, subject to Section 8.02, pay (or cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay) such employee a severance benefit that shall in
no event be less than the severance benefit that would be derived from the
Severance Matrix set forth on Schedule 4.21(e) attached hereto. The Purchaser
shall be solely responsible for any obligations arising under Section 4980B of
the Code with respect to all "MandA qualified beneficiaries" as defined in
Treasury Regulation §54.4980B-9. This Section 7.04 shall survive the
consummation of the Merger at the Effective Time, is intended to benefit the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, the employees of the Company, and the
Surviving Corporation, and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of
the Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation. Employees who are on approved
leaves of absence, including disability leave, workers' compensation leave, or
any statutorily authorized leave, such as parental, family, medical, and
military leave, shall be Continuing Employees. Schedule 7.04 contains a list
of all Employees who are, as of January 1, 2014, on approved leaves of absence
or who are not yet on approved leave 

but who have, as of January 1, 2014, made a written request for a leave of
absence, including disability leave, workers' compensation leave, or any
statutorily authorized leave, such as parental, family, medical, and military
leave.



(b) As of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall assume and be
responsible for any and all liabilities related to the Continuing Employees
and the transfer of the Continuing Employees to the Surviving Corporation,
including, without limitation, any payroll, vacation, compensation, sick
leave, severance, payments, costs under the Consolidated Omnibus
Reconciliation Act of 1986, as amended, and all similar amounts. As of the
Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall comply with any notice or filing
requirements under the WARN Act or any similar state or local plant-closing or
severance laws and shall be responsible for any and all liabilities for any
failure to comply therewith including, without limitation, in regard to the
Continuing Employees.



7.05 Regulatory Filings.



(a) Subject to the Company's cooperation in accordance with Section 6.03, the
Purchaser shall, within six (6) Business Days of the date hereof, make or
cause to be made all filings and submissions required of the Purchaser under
the HSR Act or any other laws or regulations applicable to the Purchaser for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein. The Purchaser shall
promptly comply with any additional requests for information, including
requests for production of documents and production of witnesses for
interviews or depositions by any Governmental Entities. In addition, the
Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith with the Governmental Entities and
undertake promptly any and all reasonable action required to complete the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement expeditiously and lawfully,
provided that Purchaser shall have no obligation to take any action that (a)
would require the divestiture of any of it or its Affiliates' business,
product lines or assets or involve any material requirement or restriction on
any of it or its Affiliates' businesses, product lines or assets; (b) would
require any material modification of the existing capital structure of the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates; (c) would reasonably likely have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates; or (d)
would reasonably likely have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, if a suit or other action is
threatened or instituted by any government authority or any other entity
challenging the validity or legality or seeking to restrain the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Purchaser and Merger
Sub shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to avoid, resist, resolve
or, if necessary, defend such suit or action. The Purchaser shall assist and
cooperate with the Company in preparing and filing all documents required to
be submitted by the Company or its affiliates to any Governmental Entities in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and in obtaining any
governmental or third party consents, waivers, authorizations or approvals
which may be required to be obtained by the Company in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (which assistance and cooperation shall
include timely furnishing to the Company all information concerning the
Purchaser and/or its Affiliates that counsel to the Company reasonably
determines is required to be included in such documents or would be helpful in
obtaining such required consent, waiver, authorization or approval). The
Company and Purchaser shall share equal responsibility for all filing fees
under the HSR Act and under any such other laws or regulations applicable to
the Purchaser. The Purchaser shall have no obligation to cause the filings
under the HSR Act to be considered for grant of "early termination." The
Company shall not cause the filings under the HSR Act to be considered for
grant of "early termination." The parties shall also file any post- 

transaction notices as may be required by such Governmental Entities within
the time periods prescribed by applicable Law. Purchaser and the Company shall
keep each other apprised of the status of any communications with, and any
inquiries or requests for additional information from, any Governmental
Entities and use commercially reasonable efforts to comply promptly with any
such inquiry or request.



(b) Each of the Company and Purchaser will (i) reasonably cooperate with each
other in connection with any investigation or other inquiry relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) reasonably keep the other
party or its counsel informed of any communication received by such party
from, or given by such party to any other Governmental Entity and of any
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, in each case regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
(iii) promptly respond to and certify substantial compliance with any
inquiries or requests received from any Governmental Entity for additional
information or documentation; (iv) reasonably consult with each other in
advance of any meeting or conference with any Governmental Entity, and to the
extent permitted by any Governmental Entity and reasonably determined by such
party to be appropriate under the circumstances, give the other Parties or
their counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences; and (v) permit the other party or its counsel to the extent
reasonably practicable to review in advance, and in good faith consider the
views of the other party or its counsel concerning, any submission, filing or
communication (and documents submitted therewith) intended to be given by it
to any Governmental Entity.



(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to take such actions as may be required to cause the
expiration of the waiting or notice periods under the HSR Act with respect to
the transactions as promptly as possible after the execution of this Agreement
and to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any decree, order,
judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit
or proceeding, that would otherwise have the effect of preventing or
materially delaying the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. For purposes of this Section 7.05(c), the "reasonable action" of
Purchaser shall include opposing any motion or action for a temporary,
preliminary or permanent injunction against the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.



7.06 Conditions. The Purchaser shall use all commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the conditions set forth in Section 3.02 to be satisfied and to
consummate the transactions contemplated herein as soon as reasonably possible
after the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article III (other than
those to be satisfied at the Closing itself).



7.07 Consents. Purchaser acknowledges that certain consents and waivers with
respect to the Merger may be required from parties to contracts to which the
Company is a party and that, except to the extent obtained pursuant to Section
3.01(f) and Section 6.07, such consents and waivers have not been obtained.
Purchaser agrees that none of the Representative nor any of the Common
Security Holders or their respective affiliates shall have any liability
whatsoever to Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation arising out of or
relating to the failure to obtain any consents or waivers or deliver any
notices that may be required in connection with the Merger or because of the
breach or termination of any contract as a result thereof. Purchaser further
agrees that no representation, warranty or covenant of the Company contained
herein shall be breached or deemed breached, and no condition shall be deemed
not satisfied, as a result of (a) the failure to obtain any such consent,
approval or waiver, (b) any such breach or termination or (c) any action
commenced 

or threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising out of or relating to the
failure to obtain any such consent or any such breach or termination.



7.08 Release. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
effective as of the Effective Time, in consideration of the mutual covenants
and agreements contained herein, each of Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries hereby releases, waives and
forever discharges each Common Security Holder, the Representative and their
respective Affiliates, and each of their respective officers, directors,
employees, shareholders, partners, members, managers, agents and
representatives from any and all actions, causes of action, demands, suits,
agreements, liabilities, or Losses of any type, based on any fact or
circumstance arising from such Common Security Holder's past or current
ownership, as applicable, of the Common Stock or Options or other equity
securities of the Company or their management of the Company (including any
claims relating to actual or alleged breaches of fiduciary or other duties by
the Company's directors, officers or shareholders), whether based on contract
or any applicable Law (including tort, statute, local ordinance, regulation or
any comparable law) in any jurisdiction; provided, that none of Purchaser,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries are
releasing or discharging any such Persons from (i) the obligations and
agreements established pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) any obligations or
agreements relating to the employment of such Person by the Company and (iii)
criminal misconduct or intentional fraud.



ARTICLE VIII



INDEMNIFICATION



8.01 Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants, Agreements and Other
Provisions. Except to the extent a different period is expressly set forth
herein, the covenants (that were required to be performed prior to the
Closing), representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement shall
survive the Closing and shall terminate eighteen (18) months after the Closing
(the "Survival Period Termination Date"), provided that the representations
and warranties contained in Sections 4.01, 4.02, 4.05, 4.06, 4.11, 5.01, and
5.02 shall survive until the applicable statute of limitations for any claim
made in connection therewith. No claim for indemnification hereunder for
breach of any such covenants (that were required to be performed prior to the
Closing), representations and warranties may be made after the expiration of
such survival period, provided that any claim that is made prior to the
Survival Period Termination Date shall be deemed timely made even if such
claim continues beyond the Survival Period Termination Date. Such funds as are
necessary to address a claim made prior to the Survival Period Termination
Date shall remain in the Indemnity Escrow Account following the Survival
Period Termination Date, if necessary, to satisfy any potential Losses from
such claim that is made prior to the Survival Period Termination Date. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is the specific intention of the
parties that the Survival Period Termination Date constitutes a limitation of
and modification of the statute of limitations time period otherwise
applicable to any claims arising under this Agreement.



8.02 Indemnification from the Escrow Account for the Benefit of the Purchaser.



(a) Except in accordance with Section 8.02(d) or for Losses arising on account
of fraud, from and after the Closing (but subject to the provisions of this
Article VIII and the Escrow Agreement), the Purchaser shall be entitled to
assert, as its sole and exclusive remedy for any action relating (directly or
indirectly) to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and
only in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement,
claims against the Indemnity Escrow Account, excluding any interest or
dividends earned thereon, in respect of any loss, liability, damage or expense
("Losses") suffered or incurred by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, or
their respective officers, directors, partners, members, employees, agents,
representatives, successors and permitted assigns (the "Purchaser Indemnified
Parties") to the extent arising from (i) any non-fulfillment or breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other provision set forth
herein by the Company or in any exhibit, Schedule or certificate delivered by
Company hereunder, (ii) any payments made by the Surviving Corporation or an
Affiliate pursuant to Schedule 8.02(a)(ii) not to exceed an amount equal to
$500,000 in the aggregate, (iii) any payments made by the Surviving
Corporation or any Affiliate pursuant to Schedule 8.02(a)(iii) not to exceed
an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of any such payments, or (iv) the
circumstances set forth on Schedule 8.02(a)(iv). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no claims by the Purchaser under Section 8.02(a)(i) (except for
claims with respect to any non-fulfillment or breach of Section 4.11 or 10.4)
shall be so asserted unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses under
Section 8.02(a)(i) (except for claims with respect to any non-fulfillment or
breach of Section 4.11 or 10.4) that would otherwise be payable hereunder from
the Indemnity Escrow Account exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal to
$3,000,000 (the "Deductible"), following which only Losses in excess of the
Deductible shall be payable to the Purchaser. No claims by the Purchaser under
Section 8.02(a)(i) with respect to claims with respect to any non-fulfillment
or breach of Section 4.11 or 10.4 shall be so asserted unless and until the
aggregate amount of Losses under Section 8.02(a)(i) with respect to claims
with respect to any non-fulfillment or breach of Section 4.11 or 10.4 that
would otherwise be payable hereunder from the Indemnity Escrow Account exceeds
on a cumulative basis an amount equal to $250,000 (the "Tax Deductible"),
following which only Losses in excess of the Tax Deductible shall be payable
to the Purchaser. None of the Purchaser or the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
shall make any claim with respect to, or be entitled to indemnification for,
any Loss that has been taken into account in the calculation of the Actual
Working Capital in accordance with Section 1.11. The liability of the Common
Security Holders under the Indemnity Escrow Account shall be joint and
several.



(b) Except in accordance with Section 8.02(d) or for Losses arising on account
of fraud, recovery against (i) the Indemnity Escrow Account pursuant to this
Section 8.02, and (ii) the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account pursuant
to Section 1.11, constitute the Purchaser's and the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties' sole and exclusive remedy for any and all Losses or other claims
relating to or arising from this Agreement or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, including in any exhibit, Schedule or
certificate delivered hereunder, and Purchaser's claims against the Indemnity
Escrow Account and Purchase Price Adjustment Account shall be limited, in the
aggregate, to the amounts originally deposited into such accounts, and
Purchaser shall have no claim to any interest, dividends, or other earnings
accruing to such accounts, all of which shall belong to the Common Security
Holders.



(c) Except in accordance with Section 8.02(d) or for Losses arising on account
of fraud, the Purchaser may not avoid the limitations on liability set forth
in this Article VIII by seeking damages for breach of contract.



(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Management Shareholders, on account of
their respective Common Stock, and the Management Optionholders on account of
their respective Options, shall severally indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties, and hold them harmless against any Losses which the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties may suffer or sustain as a result of any breach of the
representation and warranty in Section 4.06 made by such party with respect to
their shares or Options, as the case may be. The liability of the Management
Shareholders for a breach of the representation and warranty in Section
4.06(a) shall be several and the maximum liability of the Management
Shareholders for a breach of the representation and warranty in Section
4.06(a) shall be equal to the consideration actually received by such
Management Shareholder on account of the Common Stock held by them at the
Effective Time, inclusive of amounts ultimately payable to such Person from
the Holdback Amount, Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account, and Indemnity
Escrow Account. The liability of the Management Optionholders for a breach of
the representation and warranty in Section 4.06(b) shall be several and the
maximum liability of each Management Optionholder for a breach of the
representation and warranty in Section 4.06(b) shall be equal to the
consideration actually received by such Management Optionholder on account of
the Options held by them at the Effective Time, inclusive of amounts
ultimately payable to such Person from the Holdback Amount, Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Account, and Indemnity Escrow Account.



(e) All payments made from the Indemnity Escrow Account or in connection with
Section 8.02(d) shall be treated by the parties as an adjustment to the
proceeds received by the Common Security Holders pursuant to Article II
hereof. Following the Survival Period Termination Date, the Allocation
Schedule shall be updated by the Representative to reflect any adjustments to
the Per Share Initial Merger Consideration.



8.03 Indemnification by the Purchaser for the Benefit of the Stockholders and
Optionholders. The Purchaser shall indemnify the Representative, the
Stockholders and Optionholders, and their respective Affiliates, and their
respective officers, directors, partners, members, employees, agents,
representatives, successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the
"Stockholder Indemnified Parties") and hold them harmless against any Losses
which the Stockholder Indemnified Parties may suffer or sustain, as a result
of: (a) any breach of any representation or warranty of the Purchaser or the
Merger Sub under this Agreement, (b) any nonfulfillment or breach of any
covenant, agreement or other provision by the Purchaser or the Merger Sub, and
(c) any claim or suit brought against any of the Stockholder Indemnified
Parties at any time on or after the Closing Date relating solely to actions
taken by the Purchaser or the Company on or after the Closing Date other than
any claim or action by the Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.02 relating to any
breach by any of the Company or the Management Shareholders. 

8.04 Mitigation. Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate all losses, costs, expenses and
damages after becoming aware of any event which could reasonably be expected
to give rise to any losses, costs, expenses and damages that are indemnifiable
or recoverable hereunder or in connection herewith. In connection with any
Losses for which an Indemnitee may seek indemnification under this Article
VIII, such Indemnitee shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to seek
and pursue any available insurance coverage or other claims against third
parties that such Indemnitee may have in respect of such Losses, provided that
such Indemnitee shall be entitled to assert and recover on its claim for
indemnification while seeking and pursuing such coverage or other claim.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a breach by the Company of
Section 4.16 relates in any way to a breach by Insperity or PEO Canada of any
contract, agreement or arrangement between (a) Insperity and the Company or
(b) PEO Canada and the Company, the Representative shall have the right, but
not the obligation, to (1) control, commence and bring any such claim against
Insperity or PEO Canada on behalf of the Surviving Corporation and/or the
Common Security Holders, or (2) cause Surviving Corporation to assign to
Representative, on behalf of the Common Security Holders, any and all claims
that the Surviving Corporation may have with respect to any such breach by
Insperity or PEO Canada. In the event the Representative seeks to exercise its
rights under the preceding sentence, the Representative shall notify the
Purchaser in writing.



8.05 Defense of Third Party Claims. Any Person making a claim for
indemnification under Section 8.02 or Section 8.03 (an "Indemnitee") shall
notify the indemnifying party (an "Indemnitor") and the Representative (on
behalf of the Common Security Holders), if applicable, of the claim in writing
promptly after receiving written notice of any action, lawsuit, proceeding,
investigation or other claim against it (if by a third party), describing the
claim, the amount thereof (if known and quantifiable) and the basis thereof.
Any Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such action,
lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim giving rise to an
Indemnitee's claim for indemnification at such Indemnitor's expense, and at
its option shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof by appointing a
reputable counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee to be the lead
counsel in connection with such defense. Any Indemnitor shall continue to be
entitled to assert any limitation on any claims contained herein, and the
Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such claim and
to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose at the Indemnitee's expense.
If the Indemnitor shall control the defense of any such claim then the
Indemnitor shall be entitled to settle such claim; provided, that, the
Indemnitor shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) before entering into
any settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend such claim if, pursuant to or
as a result of such settlement or cessation, injunctive or other equitable
relief will be imposed against the Indemnitee or if such settlement does not
expressly and unconditionally release the Indemnitee from all liabilities and
obligations with respect to such claim, without prejudice. The Representative
(on behalf of the Common Security Holders) shall act on behalf of all
Indemnitors in the case of all third party claims with respect to which the
Purchaser is seeking indemnification from the Common Security Holders under
Section 8.02. If the Indemnitor makes any payment on any claim pursuant to
Section 8.02, the Indemnitor shall be subrogated, to the extent of such
payment, to all rights and remedies of the Indemnitee to any insurance
benefits or other claims of the Indemnitee with respect to such claim. 

8.06 Determination of Loss Amount. The amount of any Loss subject to
indemnification under Section 8.02 or Section 8.03 shall be calculated net of
(i) any Tax Benefit realized by an Indemnitee arising from the incurrence or
payment of any Loss and (ii) any insurance proceeds or any indemnity,
contribution or other similar payment actually received by the Indemnitee from
any third party with respect thereto, provided that Purchaser shall have no
obligation to seek recovery under any insurance policy issued to Purchaser or
one of its Affiliates other than Company, and Company shall, until the
Survival Period Termination Date, either (i) renew and not cancel any such
policy maintained by Company as of the Closing Date at least until the
Survival Period Termination Date or (ii) obtain insurance policies providing
for substantially similar coverage at least until the Survival Period
Termination Date. In the event that an insurance or other recovery is made by
any Indemnitee with respect to any Loss for which any such Person has been
indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the
recovery shall be made promptly to the Representative, on behalf of the Common
Security Holders. Except for Losses arising on account of fraud, in no event
shall any Person be entitled to recover or make a claim for any amounts in
respect of consequential, diminution in value, incidental or indirect damages,
lost profits or punitive damages and, in particular, no "multiple of profits"
or "multiple of cash flow" or similar valuation methodology shall be used in
calculating the amount of any Losses.



8.07 Updating Company Disclosure Schedule. The Company may, by written notice
to the Purchaser, provide any additions or modification of the Disclosure
Schedules necessary to make the information set forth therein true, accurate
and complete (the "Supplemental Disclosures"). The Supplemental Disclosures
may relate only to matters arising between the date hereof and the Closing
Date and shall not modify or amend Purchaser's right to seek a remedy for a
breach of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or limit,
restrict or broaden the Purchaser's right to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with the terms herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
may modify Schedule 4.05 in connection with the exercise by any Optionholder
of such Optionholder's Options following the date hereof and prior to the
Closing Date; provided that such modification does not change the aggregate
amounts to be paid by Purchaser under this Agreement (understanding that the
definition of Cash and Option Loan Amount may take into account the exercise
price paid or payable by such Optionholder upon exercise of such Options).



ARTICLE IX



TERMINATION



9.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing:



(a) by the mutual written consent of the Purchaser and the Company;



(b) by the Purchaser, if there has been a violation or breach by the Company
of any covenant, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement that
has prevented the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of the
Purchaser at the Closing and such violation or breach has not been waived by
the Purchaser or cured by the Company within fifteen (15) Business Days after
receipt by the Company of written notice thereof from the Purchaser or, if the
nature of such breach is such that it would not be susceptible to cure within
fifteen (15) days, then such time as would be reasonably required for Company
to effect such cure, but in no event more

10.04 Tax Matters.



(a) Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns.



(i) If the taxable year of the Company does not automatically end as of the
end of the Closing Date, then, to the extent permitted under the applicable
Law, Purchaser and the Company shall elect to cause the taxable year of the
Company to terminate as of the end of the Closing Date. The Representative
shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax
Returns of the Company due (after taking into account all appropriate
extensions) on or prior to the Closing Date (the "Seller Prepared Returns").
The Representative shall provide each Seller Prepared Return to the Purchaser
for its review and comment at least twenty (20) Business Days prior to the
date on which such Tax Return is to be filed, and the Representative shall
make changes to each such Tax Return as are reasonably requested by the
Purchaser. The Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or
cause to be filed all Tax Returns of the Company due after the Closing Date
(the "Purchaser Prepared Returns"). To the extent that a Purchaser Prepared
Return relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, such Tax Return shall be prepared
in a manner consistent with past practice, except as otherwise required by
applicable Law. The Purchaser shall provide each Purchaser Prepared Return to
the Representative for its review and comment at least twenty (20) Business
Days prior to the date on which such Tax Return is to be filed, and the
Purchaser shall make changes to each such Tax Return as are reasonably
requested by the Representative.



(ii) Without the prior written consent of the Representative (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), neither the Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation nor any of their Affiliates shall make or change any Tax
election, adopt or change any accounting method, file any Tax Return
(including amended Tax Returns), surrender any right to claim a refund of
Taxes or take any other action if such election, adoption, change, amendment,
surrender or action could have the effect of (A) increasing the Tax liability
of the Common Security Holders or any of their respective direct or indirect
owners, (B) increasing the amount that any Purchaser Indemnified Party may
seek indemnity for under this Agreement, or (C) decreasing any amount payable
to the Common 

Security Holders pursuant to any provision of this Section 10.04.



(iii) The Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the Representative agree
(A) to treat any Transaction Deductions paid or accrued on or before the
Closing Date as deductible in a Pre-Closing Tax Period and that no party shall
apply the "next day rule" under Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) to such deductions and (B) to properly make an election
under Revenue Procedure 2011-29 to deduct seventy percent (70%) of any
Transaction Deductions that are success-based fees as defined in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.263(a)-5(f).



(b) Closing Date Course of Business. For the portion of the Closing Date after
the time of Closing, other than transactions expressly contemplated hereby,
the Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to carry on its business
only in the ordinary course in the same manner as heretofore conducted.



(c) Cooperation on Tax Matters. The Purchaser, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and the Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of any
Tax Returns of the Company, the filing and prosecution of any Tax claims, the
calculation of any refunds or credits for which the Common Security Holders
are entitled to under Section 10.04(e), and any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon the other party's request) the provision of records and information
which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other
proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. The Purchaser, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the
Representative agree to retain all books and records with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to the Company and the Surviving Corporation relating to any
taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the
statute of limitations (and to the extent of any extensions thereof) of the
respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any Governmental Entity.



(d) Apportionment of Taxes. In the case of any taxable period that includes,
but does not end on, the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the parties agree
as follows: (i) the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income or
receipts, sales or use Taxes, employment Taxes or withholding Taxes of the
Company for a the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an
interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date
and (ii) the amount of any other Taxes of the Company for a Straddle Period
that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of
such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator
of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle
Period. 

(e) Tax Refunds. Any non-income Tax refunds that are received by or on behalf
of the Company, and any amounts credited against non-income Tax to which the
Surviving Corporation becomes entitled to, that, in each case, relate to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period (except to the extent such refunds or credits represent
receipts of Tax assets reflected as assets in the determination of Actual
Working Capital which shall be for the account of the Surviving Corporation)
shall be paid to the Representative (less any required Tax withholding) on
behalf of the Common Security Holders when such refund is received or such
credit is actually realized. Promptly upon receipt of any such Tax refund, and
in no event later than five (5) Business Days after receipt by the Purchaser,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates, the Purchaser will, and
will cause the Surviving Corporation to, deliver and pay over, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, such Tax refunds to the
Representative (on behalf of the Common Security Holders). The Representative
shall have the right to remit a portion of such Tax refunds to the Surviving
Corporation in each case where a Common Security Holder is subject to
withholding of Taxes on such payment, and in each such case the Surviving
Corporation (or the Purchaser) shall cause withholding and remittance of
required Taxes to be made with respect to such amounts and the net payments to
be promptly paid to the applicable Common Security Holders. The Purchaser
will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, execute such documents,
take reasonable additional actions and otherwise reasonably cooperate as may
be necessary for the Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation to perfect their
rights in and obtain the Tax refunds contemplated by this Section 10.04(e).
For purposes of clarity, the Purchaser shall be entitled to all income Tax
refunds received after the Closing by or on behalf of the Company or Surviving
Corporation.



(f) Transfer Taxes. All transfer, value added, excise, stock transfer, stamp,
recording, registration and other substantially similar Taxes and fees
incurred in connection with the Merger and other transactions contemplated
hereby (collectively, "Transfer Taxes") shall be paid by the Purchaser.



(g) Amendments of Income Tax Returns. Purchaser shall not amend or permit to
be amended any income Tax Return of the Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period
without the review and approval of the Representative prior to the filing of
such amendment, and the Purchaser shall make changes to each such amended Tax
Return as are reasonably requested by the Representative.

anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such
court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of
process on such party as provided in Section 12.03 shall be deemed effective

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
Purchaser, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and a third party other than the Representative
or a Common Security Holder, on the other hand, Purchaser, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent the
disclosure of the Privileged Communications to such third party; provided,
however, that none of Purchaser, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Subsidiaries may waive such privilege without the
prior written consent of the Representative. In the event that Purchaser,
Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries is legally required by governmental order or otherwise to access
or obtain a copy of all or a portion of the Privileged Communications,
Purchaser shall promptly (and, in any event, within five (5) Business Days),
to the extent not legally prohibited, notify the Representative in writing
(including by making specific reference to this Section) so that the
Representative can seek a protective order and Purchaser agrees to use all
commercially reasonable efforts to assist therewith.



(f) No Duty to Disclose Privileged Communications. To the extent that files or
other materials maintained by Goodwin and/or Hopkins constitute property of
its clients, only the Representative and the Common Security Holders shall
hold such property rights and Goodwin and/or Hopkins shall have no duty to
reveal or disclose any such files or other materials or any Privileged
Communications by reason of any attorney-client relationship between Goodwin
and/or Hopkins, on the one hand, and Purchaser, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries, on the other hand.



(g) Prohibition on Access to or Use of Privileged Communications. Each of
Purchaser and Merger Sub agrees that it will not, and that it will cause
Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and their Subsidiaries and
their respective employees, directors, officers, agents and representatives
not to, (i) access or use the Privileged Communications, including by way of
review of any electronic data, communications or other information, or by
seeking to have the Representative or any Common Security Holder waive the
attorney-client or other privilege, or by otherwise asserting that Purchaser,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries
has the right to waive the attorney-client or other privilege or (ii) seek to
obtain the Privileged Communications from Goodwin and/or Hopkins.



12.21 Acknowledgment of Purchaser and Merger Sub. Each of the Purchaser and
Merger Sub acknowledges that it has relied on the representations and
warranties of the Company (and, solely for purposes of Section 4.06(a), the
Management Shareholders, and solely for purposes of Section 4.06(b), the
Management Optionholders) expressly and specifically set forth in this
Agreement, including the Schedules (and updated Schedules) in making its
determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Such representations and warranties by the Company (and, solely for purposes
of Section 4.06(a), the Management Shareholders, and solely for purposes of
Section 4.06(b), the Management Optionholders) constitute the sole and
exclusive representations and warranties of the Company (and, solely for
purposes of Section 4.06(a), the Management Shareholders, and solely for
purposes of Section 4.06(b), the Management Optionholders) to the Purchaser in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and each of the
Purchaser and Merger Sub understands, acknowledges and agrees that all other
representations and warranties of any kind or nature, expressed or implied,
are specifically disclaimed by the Company, the Management Shareholders and
the Management Optionholders and are not being relied on by the Purchaser or 

Merger Sub. In connection with the Purchaser's investigation of the Company,
the Purchaser has received certain future projections, including future
projected statements of operating revenues and income from operations of the
Company and certain future business plan information. Each of the Purchaser
and Merger Sub acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to make such future estimates, projections and other forecasts and
plans, that each of the Purchaser and Merger Sub is familiar with such
uncertainties and that each of the Purchaser and Merger Sub is taking full
responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
all future estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans so furnished
to it, including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such future
estimates, projections and forecasts. Accordingly, each of the Purchaser and
Merger Sub hereby acknowledges that none of the Company, the Management
Shareholders or the Management Optionholders (or any of their respective
Affiliates, stockholders, partners, members, manager, trustees, employees,
directors, officers, agents or representatives) are making any representation
or warranty with respect to such future estimates, projections and other
forecasts and plans, including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such future estimates, projections and forecasts, and each of the
Purchaser and Merger Sub hereby disclaims any reliance on such future
estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans.



12.22 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except with respect to the Common Security
Holders or as otherwise set forth in Section 7.03, Section 7.08 and ARTICLE
VIII, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their
heirs, legatees, representatives, successors and permitted assigns and nothing
herein expressed or implied shall give or be construed to give to any Person,
other than the parties hereto and such assigns, any legal or equitable rights
hereunder. 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement and Plan
of Merger on the day and year first above written.
