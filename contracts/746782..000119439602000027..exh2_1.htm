A Certificate of Merger and any other required documents (collectively, the " _Merger Documents_ "), substantially in the form attached as _EXHIBIT 1.1_ , will be duly prepared, executed and acknowledged by Adaytum and Merger Sub and thereafter delivered to the Secretary of State of Delaware for filing in accordance with the DGCL contemporaneously with the Closing (as defined below). The Merger will become effective at such time as the Merger Documents have been filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware (the " _Effective Time_ "). Following the Merger, Adaytum will continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") under the laws of the State of Delaware, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease. 

   

  1.2   _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, (i) the Merger will have all of the effects provided by the Certificate of Merger and applicable law, (ii) the Certificate of Incorporation of Adaytum will be amended in the form attached as  _Appendix A_ to _EXHIBIT 1.1_ until duly further amended, (iii) the bylaws of Merger Sub will be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until duly amended, (iv) the directors of Merger Sub will be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, to hold office in accordance with the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, (v) the officers of Merger Sub will be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, to hold office in accordance with the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and (vi) the issued and outstanding certificates for the capital stock of Merger Sub will be the issued and outstanding certificates initially representing all of the issued capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

  1.3   _Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") will take place as soon as practicable (but no more than three (3) business days) after satisfaction or waiver of the last to be fulfilled of the conditions set forth in Article IX that by their terms are not to occur at the Closing (the " _Closing Date_ "), at the offices of Testa, Hurwitz and Thibeault, LLP in Boston, Massachusetts, unless another date or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and Adaytum. If all of conditions set forth in Article IX hereof are determined to be satisfied (or duly waived) at the Closing, concurrently with the Closing the parties hereto will cause the Merger to be consummated by the filing of the Merger Documents with the Secretary of State of Delaware. The Closing will be deemed to have concluded at the Effective Time. 

    1.4   _Approval by the Stockholders of Adaytum_. Adaytum will take all action necessary in accordance with applicable law, its Charter Documents (as defined below) and any agreements to which it is a party to solicit the approval of this Agreement, the Merger and all of the transactions contemplated hereby by the stockholders of Adaytum by means of a written consent of stockholders in accordance with the DGCL, or if it is unable to obtain such written consent, by a duly convened meeting of stockholders. Adaytum will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain stockholder approval as soon as practicable. Adaytum represents and warrants that its Board of Directors has duly (i) approved the Merger in accordance with the DGCL and (ii) resolved to recommend to the stockholders of Adaytum that they approve this Agreement, the Merger and all of the transactions contemplated hereby.

such Participating Holder bears to the aggregate Merger Consideration 
payable to all Participating Holders pursuant to Section 2.1.

will also constitute  their approval of the terms and provisions of the

Agreement, and the taking by the  Indemnification Representative of all

If a holder of Dissenting Shares shall withdraw, in accordance with Section 262(k) of the DGCL, such holders demand for such appraisal or shall become ineligible for such appraisal, then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease to be Dissenting Shares and shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration into which such holders Adaytum Capital Stock was converted as of the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement. Any amounts to be paid to holders of Dissenting Shares with respect to such Dissenting Shares shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation. 

    

  2.4   _Exchange Procedure_. 

   

  (a)   _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall designate an  exchange agent mutually agreeable to Parent and Adaytum
(the " _Exchange  Agent_ ").

       (b)   _US Sub to Provide Merger Consideration_. At the
Effective Time, US Sub  shall, and Parent shall cause US Sub to, make

pursuant to Section 2.2 and the  Escrow Agreement, US Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause US Sub to, deposit into  escrow the Escrow Fund.

   

  (c)   _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective
Time, the Surviving  Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each holder of
record of outstanding  shares of Adaytum Capital Stock whose shares were
converted into the right to  receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.1 (i) a letter of  transmittal substantially in the form attached as
_EXHIBIT 2.4(C)_ and  (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
any certificate or  certificates representing such shares (the "
_Certificates_ ") in  exchange for the applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender  of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent or to such other agent  or agents as may be appointed by
Parent (or in the case of In-the-Money Options  and warrants that have been
exercised but for which Certificates have not been  delivered to the
Participating Holder, the applicable exercise agreement and  verification of
payment to Adaytum of the appropriate exercise price, whether in  cash or
pursuant to a "cashless" or "net exercise" surrender  of the relevant option
or warrant or portion thereof (collectively  " _Exercise Documentation_ ")),
together with such letter of  transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the  instructions thereto, duly executed stock
powers reasonably acceptable to the  Exchange Agent, and such other customary
documents as may be reasonably required  pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate or Exercise  Documentation, as the case may be,
shall be entitled to receive in exchange  therefor the portion of the Merger
Consideration payable to such Participating  Holder pursuant to Section 2.1
(less the portion of the Merger Consideration  otherwise payable to such
holder that is deposited into escrow pursuant to  Section 2.2 and the Escrow
Agreement), and the Certificate so surrendered shall  forthwith be canceled
(or deemed to be cancelled in the case of In-the-Money  Options or warrants
for which Certificates have not been so delivered);  provided, however, that
no portion of the Merger Consideration shall be paid to  a Participating
Holder until such time as all properly executed letters of  transmittal have
been delivered to the Exchange Agent by such holder. As soon as  practicable
after the Effective Time, and subject to and in accordance with the 
provisions of Section 2.2, US Sub shall, and Parent shall cause US Sub to, 
deliver to the custodian of the Escrow Fund mutually selected by Parent and 
Adaytum (the " _Custodian_ "), on behalf of the Participating  Holders, the
portion of the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to such  holder that is
to be deposited into escrow pursuant to Section 2.2 and the  Escrow
Agreement), which shall be available to reimburse Parent, US Sub or its 
affiliates, as provided in Article X and the Escrow Agreement.

   

  (d)   _Transfers of Ownership_. If any portion of the Merger
Consideration is to  be distributed to a Person (defined below) other than
the Person shown as the  record holder of the shares of Adaytum Capital Stock
surrendered, it will be a  condition of the distribution thereof that the
Certificate, if any, so  surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise
in proper form for transfer  and that the Person requesting such exchange
will have paid to Parent, US Sub or  any agent designated by it any transfer
or other Taxes (as defined below)  required by reason of distribution of the
portion of Merger Consideration to a  Person other than the Person shown as
the record holder of the shares of Adaytum  Capital Stock surrendered, or
established to the satisfaction of Parent, US Sub  or any agent designated by
it that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

      (e)   _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this  Section 2.4, none of the Exchange Agent, Parent, US Sub,
the Surviving  Corporation, the Custodian or any party hereto shall be liable
to a holder of  shares of Adaytum Capital Stock for any amount properly paid
to a public  official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar law.

   

  (f)   _Issue Shares_. At the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will issue  shares of newly issued, fully-paid and non-assessable
common stock, without par  value of the Surviving Corporation to US Sub in
consideration for US Sub paying  the Merger Consideration to the holders of
Outstanding Adaytum Shares pursuant  to the provisions of this Agreement,
which shares issued by the Surviving  Corporation will have a fair market
value equal to the aggregate fair market  value of the Outstanding Adaytum
Shares and equal to the cash paid by US Sub.

   

  2.5   _No Further Ownership Rights in Adaytum Capital Stock_. The Merger and its approval by the stockholders of Adaytum and the execution of this Agreement will be deemed, at the Effective Time, to constitute full satisfaction and termination of all rights and agreements pertaining to Adaytum Capital Stock pursuant to the DGCL, by contract or otherwise, other than (i) rights pursuant to this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby and (ii) rights of holders of Dissenting Shares under the DGCL. After the Effective Time, there will be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Adaytum of Adaytum Capital Stock. Except for the Outstanding Adaytum Options to be exercised pursuant to Section 2.1(c) or assumed pursuant to Section 2.6 below, prior to or upon Closing, Adaytum will cause all other Outstanding Adaytum Options, including without limitation the warrants described on Schedule 2.5 hereto, to be cancelled. Until surrendered to Parent, each certificate for Adaytum Capital Stock will, after the Effective Time, represent only the right to receive Merger Consideration into which the shares of Adaytum Capital Stock formerly represented thereby will have been converted pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

  2.6   _Assumption of Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, US Sub shall assume that portion of each Outstanding Adaytum Option listed on Schedule 2.6 that has not been exercised pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and each holder thereof (each an " _Option _ Holder") shall thereby be entitled to acquire, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Option Holder, on substantially the same terms (including the dates and extent of exercisability) and subject to the same conditions, including vesting, as such Outstanding Adaytum Option (taking into account any amendment to such option provided for in Section 9.2(m)), the number of shares of common stock, without par value, of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ ") determined by  _ _multiplying__ __the number of shares of Adaytum Common Stock for which such portion of such Outstanding Adaytum Option is exercisable in accordance with its terms immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Conversion Number (rounded down to the nearest whole share), at an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Adaytum Common Stock of such Outstanding Adaytum Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Conversion Number. The term _"Conversion Number_ " means the quotient obtained by dividing the Common Per Share Amount by the average of the daily closing prices of the Parent Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market for the five consecutive full trading days ending two trading days preceding the Closing Date.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ADAYTUM

   

 Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule of Adaytum dated as of the date hereof and delivered herewith to Parent (the _"Adaytum Disclosure Schedule_ ") which identifies the section and subsection to which each disclosure therein relates, and whether or not the Adaytum Disclosure Schedule is referred to in a specific section or subsection, Adaytum represents and warrants to Parent, US Sub and Merger Sub as follows:

  (a)   Adaytum is a corporation duly organized, validly existing

requisite corporate power and  authority __ to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its  businesses as now being conducted, and is
duly qualified and in good standing to  do business in each jurisdiction in
which a failure to so qualify would  reasonably be expected to have a

The minute books and stock records of Adaytum, complete and correct copies of which have been delivered to Parent, contain correct and complete records of all material proceedings and actions taken at all meetings of, or effected by written consent of, the stockholders of Adaytum and its Board of Directors, and all original issuances and subsequent transfers, repurchases and cancellations of Adaytums capital stock.

     (b)   Adaytum does not currently own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock or  other equity securities of any corporation or have direct or indirect equity or  ownership interest in any partnership, limited liability company, joint venture  or other entity. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each  subsidiary of Adaytum are owned beneficially and of record by Adaytum, one of  its other subsidiaries, or any combination thereof, in each case free and clear  of any security interests, liens, charges, restrictions, claims, encumbrances or  assessments of any nature whatsoever (" _Liens_ "); and there are  no outstanding subscriptions, warrants, options, convertible securities, or  other rights (contingent or other) pursuant to which any of the subsidiaries is  or may become obligated to issue any shares of its capital stock to any Person  other than Adaytum or one of the other subsidiaries. 

    

 3.2   _Capital Structure._

   

  (a)   The authorized capital stock of Adaytum consists of
50,000,000 shares of Adaytum  Common Stock and 20,000,000 shares of Adaytum

issued and held as treasury  shares by Adaytum and no shares of Adaytum
Preferred Stock that are issued and  held as treasury shares by Adaytum.
Section 3.2(a) of the Adaytum Disclosure  Schedule sets forth all holders of
Adaytum Common Stock and Adaytum Preferred  Stock and the number of shares
owned. Section 3.2(a) of the Adaytum Disclosure  Schedule also sets forth any
options, warrants, calls, conversion rights,  commitments, agreements,
contracts, understandings, restrictions, arrangements  or rights of any
character (other than the Adaytum Preferred Stock) (each, an  " _Adaytum
Option_ ") to which Adaytum is a party or by which  Adaytum may be bound
obligating Adaytum to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to  be issued,
delivered or sold, additional shares of the capital stock of Adaytum,  or
obligating Adaytum to grant, extend, or enter into any such option, warrant, 
call, conversion right, conversion payment, commitment, agreement, contract, 
understanding, restriction, arrangement or right. All issued and outstanding 
Adaytum Options have been offered, issued and delivered in compliance with 
applicable federal and state securities laws. The holders of Adaytum Options 
have been or will be given, or shall have properly waived, any required
notice  prior to the Merger. Upon the assumption by US Sub of the outstanding
Adaytum  Options as set forth in Section 2.6, all of such Adaytum Options
shall be  exercisable solely for shares of Parent Common Stock as set forth
in Section  2.6. The assumption of the Adaytum Options by US Sub as set forth
in Section 2.6  does not conflict with or violate the provisions of the
Adaytum Software, Inc.  1999 Stock Option Plan, as amended (the " _Option
Plan_ "), or any  stock option or other agreement or instrument relating to
or governing any  Adaytum Option and no consent or approval of, or notice to,
any Person is  required in connection with such assumption, other than as
contemplated by  Section 9.2(m).

      (b)   All outstanding shares of Adaytum Common Stock and Adaytum
Preferred Stock are,  and any shares of Adaytum Common Stock issued upon
exercise of any Outstanding  Adaytum Options will be, validly issued, fully
paid, nonassessable and not  subject to any preemptive rights (other than
those which have been duly waived),  or to any agreement to which Adaytum is
a party or by which Adaytum may be  bound. Adaytum does not have outstanding
any bonds, debentures, notes or other  indebtedness the holders of which (i)
have the right to vote (or convertible or  exercisable into securities having
the right to vote) with holders of shares of  Adaytum Common Stock or Adaytum
Preferred Stock on any matter (" _Adaytum  Voting Debt_ ") or (ii) are or
will become entitled to receive any  payment as a result of the execution of
this Agreement or the completion of the  transactions contemplated hereby.

   

  3.3   _Authority_. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and all other agreements contemplated hereby by Adaytum have been duly authorized by all necessary action of the Board of Directors of Adaytum, and if the Closing shall occur, shall have been duly authorized by all necessary action of the stockholders of Adaytum. Certified copies of the resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors of Adaytum and its stockholders approving this Agreement, all other agreements contemplated hereby and the Merger have been or will be provided to Parent prior to the Closing. Adaytum has duly and validly executed and delivered this Agreement and has, or prior to Closing will have, duly and validly executed and delivered all other agreements contemplated hereby, and each of this Agreement and such other agreements constitutes a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Adaytum in accordance with its terms, except that the enforcement hereof may be limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors rights generally and (b) general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity). 

   

  3.4   _Compliance with Laws and Other Instruments; Non-Contravention_. Adaytum holds all licenses, permits and authorizations from all Governmental Entities (as defined below) necessary for the lawful conduct of its business pursuant to all applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules and regulations of all such Governmental Entities having jurisdiction over it or any part of its operations, excepting, however, when such failure to hold would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Adaytums Business Condition. There are no material violations or claimed violations of any such license, permit or authorization or any such statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation. Assuming the receipt of all Consents (as defined below), neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement and all other agreements contemplated hereby by Adaytum and the Principal Stockholders (as defined below), nor the consummation of the Merger or any other transaction described herein, does or will, after the giving of notice, or the lapse of time, or otherwise, conflict with, result in a breach of, or constitute a default under, the Charter Documents of Adaytum or any federal, foreign, state or local court or administrative order or process, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation, or any contract, agreement or commitment to which Adaytum is a party, or under which Adaytum is obligated, or by which Adaytum or any of the rights, properties or assets of Adaytum are subject or bound; result in the creation of any Lien upon, or otherwise adversely affect, any of the rights, properties or assets of Adaytum; terminate, amend or modify, or give any party the right to terminate, amend, modify, abandon or refuse to perform or comply with, any contract, agreement or commitment to which Adaytum is a party, or under which Adaytum is obligated, or by which Adaytum or any of the rights, properties or assets of Adaytum are subject or bound; or accelerate, postpone or modify, or give any party the right to accelerate, postpone or modify, the time within which, or the terms and conditions under which, any liabilities, duties or obligations are to be satisfied or performed, or any rights or benefits are to be received, under any contract, agreement or commitment to which Adaytum is a party, or under which Adaytum may be obligated, or by which Adaytum or any of the rights, properties or assets of Adaytum are subject or bound, other than any of the foregoing that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Business Condition of Adaytum. Section 3.4 of the Adaytum Disclosure Schedule sets forth each agreement, contract or other instrument binding upon Adaytum requiring a notice or consent (by its terms or as a result of any conflict or other contravention required to be disclosed in the Adaytum Disclosure Schedule pursuant to the preceding provisions of this Section 3.4) as a result of the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement and all other agreements contemplated hereby by Adaytum or the consummation of the Merger or any other transaction described herein (each such notice or consent, a " _Consent_ "). No consent, approval, order, or authorization of or registration, declaration, or filing with or exemption (also a " _Consent_ ") by, any court, administrative agency, stock exchange or commission or other governmental authority or instrumentality, whether domestic or foreign (each a " _Governmental Entity_ ") is required by or with respect to Adaytum in connection with the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement and all other agreements contemplated hereby by Adaytum or the consummation of the Merger or any other transaction described herein, except for the filing by Adaytum and Merger Sub of the appropriate Merger Documents with the Secretary of State of Delaware.

All Tax Returns  filed by Adaytum were complete and correct in all respects, and such Tax Returns  correctly reflected the facts regarding the income, business, assets,  operations, activities, status and other matters of Adaytum and any other  information required to be shown thereon.

Adaytum has  not agreed to make any adjustment under Section 481(a) of the Code (or any  corresponding provision of state, local or foreign law) by reason of a change in  accounting method or otherwise, and Adaytum will not be required to make any  such adjustment as a result of the transactions set forth in this Agreement.

The unpaid Taxes of Adaytum did not, as of  the Unaudited Balance Sheet Date, exceed the reserve for actual Taxes (as  opposed to any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing  differences between book and Tax income) as shown on the Unaudited Balance  Sheet, and will not exceed such reserve as adjusted for the passage of time  through the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and practice of  Adaytum in filing its Tax Returns (taking into account any Taxes incurred as a  result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). Adaytum is not a  party to any joint venture, partnership, limited liability company or other  arrangement or contract which is treated as a partnership for federal income tax  purposes. Adaytum will not incur any liability for Taxes from the Unaudited  Balance Sheet Date through the Closing Date other than in the ordinary course of  business and consistent with reasonable past practices.

 3.18   _Employee Benefit Plans_. Each Plan (as defined below) covering active, former, or retired employees of Adaytum or any ERISA Affiliate (as defined below) is listed in Section 3.18 of the Adaytum Disclosure Schedule. " _Plan_ " means any employee benefit plan as defined in ERISA (as defined below) and will also include any employment, severance or similar contract, arrangement or policy (written or oral) and each plan or arrangement providing for insurance coverage (including any self-insured arrangements), workers compensation, disability benefits, supplemental unemployment benefits, vacation benefits, pension or retirement benefits or for deferred compensation, profit-sharing, bonuses, phantom stock, stock options, stock appreciation rights or other forms of incentive compensation or post-retirement insurance, compensation or benefits. Adaytum has made available to Parent a copy of each Plan, and where applicable, any related trust agreement, annuity, or insurance contract. All annual reports (Form 5500) required to be filed with the appropriate Governmental Entity have been properly filed on a timely basis, and Adaytum has made available to Parent copies of the three most recently filed Forms 5500 for each applicable Plan. Each Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and has remained tax-qualified to this date and its related trust is tax-exempt and has been so since its creation. No Plan is covered by Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "), or Section 412 of the Code. No "prohibited transaction," as defined in ERISA Section 406 or Code Section 4975, has occurred with respect to any Plan, unless such a transaction was exempt from such rules. Each Plan has been maintained and administered in material compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, orders, rules and regulations, including but not limited to ERISA and the Code, which are applicable to such Plans. There are no pending or anticipated claims against or otherwise involving any of the Plans and no suit, action, or other litigation (excluding claims for benefits incurred in the ordinary course of Plan activities) has been brought against or with respect to any Plan. All contributions, reserves, or premium payments to the Plan determined in accordance with prior funding and accrual practices have been made or provided for through the date hereof. Neither Adaytum nor any entity which is considered one employer with Adaytum under Section 414 of the Code or Section 4001 of ERISA (each an " _ERISA Affiliate_ ") has ever maintained or contributed to or incurred or expects to incur liability with respect to any Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or any "multi-employer plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA. There are no restrictions on the rights of Adaytum or any ERISA Affiliate to amend or terminate any Plan without incurring any liability thereunder. Adaytum has not engaged in or is a successor or parent corporation to an entity that has engaged in a transaction described in ERISA Section 4069. Since the Unaudited Balance Sheet Date, there have been no amendments to, written interpretations of, or announcements (whether or not written) by Adaytum or any ERISA Affiliate relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage under, any Plan that would materially increase the cost of maintaining such Plan. Neither Adaytum nor any of its ERISA Affiliates have any current or projected liability in respect of post-employment or post-retirement welfare benefits for retired or former employees other than health care continuation benefits required to be provided under applicable law. No tax under Section 4980B or 4980D of the Code has been incurred in respect of any Plan that is a group health plan, as defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code. 

   

 3.19   _Certain Agreements_.

ARTICLE X

    

INDEMNIFICATION

    

 10.1   _Indemnification Relating to Agreement_. 

   

 (a)   Subject to Sections 10.4 and 10.5, US Sub shall be entitled to be indemnified  and held harmless from and against, and to be reimbursed with respect to, any  and all losses, damages, liabilities, claims, judgments, settlements, fines,  costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees)  (" _Indemnifiable Amounts_ "), of every nature whatsoever incurred  by US Sub (which will be deemed to include any of the foregoing incurred by the  Parent or the Surviving Corporation) by reason of or arising out of or in  connection with (i) any breach, or any claim (including claims by parties other  than US Sub) that constitutes a breach, by Adaytum of any representation or  warranty of Adaytum contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or other  document delivered to US Sub or Parent pursuant to this Agreement, other than  any breach or related claim taken or not taken at the written direction of or  after consultation with and written concurrence of US Sub or Parent and (ii) the  failure, partial or total, of Adaytum to perform any agreement or covenant  required by this Agreement to be performed by it other than any breach or  related claim taken or not taken at the written direction of or after  consultation with and written concurrence of US Sub or Parent and (iii) subject  to the provisions of Schedule 10.1, any Tax liability, or asserted liability, of  Adaytum attributable to periods (or any portion thereof) ending on or prior to  the Closing other than Tax liabilities accrued on the Closing Balance Sheet and  reflected in the calculation of Net Working Capital. The foregoing right to  indemnity will be determined without regard to any right to indemnification to  which any Person may have in his or her capacity as an officer, director,  employee, agent or any other capacity of Adaytum, and no stockholder of Adaytum  will be entitled to any indemnification from Adaytum or the Surviving  Corporation for amounts paid hereunder. There will be no right of contribution  or subrogation from Parent, US Sub or the Surviving Corporation for  indemnification payments made by or for the account of the stockholders of  Adaytum. Any amounts received by US Sub shall be treated as adjustments to the  consideration for the Merger. 

   

 (b)   For purposes of calculating the Tax liability in Section 10.1(a)(iii) above, in  the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a  Tax period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, the portion of  such Tax related to the portion of such Tax period ending on the Closing Date  shall (x) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to  income, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period  multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax  period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of  days in the entire Tax period, and (y) in the case of any Tax based upon or  related to income be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the  relevant Tax period ended on the Closing Date (including Taxes, if any, imposed  on Adaytum pursuant to Sections 951 through 964 of the Code calculated as if the  relevant Tax period of each subsidiary of Adaytum ended on the Closing Date).  Any credits relating to a Tax period that begins before and ends after the  Closing Date shall be taken into account as though the relevant Tax period ended  on the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the  foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with reasonable past  practice of Adaytum.

* * *

     

 10.2   _Third Party Claims_. With respect to any claims or demands by third parties as to which US Sub may seek indemnification hereunder, other than claims or demands covered by Section 10.3, whenever US Sub will have received a written notice that such a claim or demand has been asserted or threatened, US Sub will promptly notify the Indemnification Representative (as designated in the Escrow Agreement) of such claim or demand and of the facts within US Subs knowledge that relate thereto within a reasonable time after receiving such written notice. The Indemnification Representative will then have the right to defend, contest, negotiate or settle any such claim or demand through counsel of his own selection, reasonably satisfactory to US Sub, and solely at the cost and expense of the stockholders of Adaytum. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Indemnification Representative will not settle, compromise, or offer to settle or compromise any such claim or demand without the prior written consent of US Sub, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. Without limiting US Subs right to object for other reasons, US Sub may object to a settlement or compromise which includes any provision which in its reasonable judgment may have an adverse impact on or establish an adverse precedent for the Business Condition of US Sub or Parent or any of its subsidiaries. If the Indemnification Representative gives notice to US Sub within twenty (20) calendar days after US Sub has notified the Indemnification Representative that any such claim or demand has been made in writing, that the Indemnification Representative elects to have US Sub defend, contest, negotiate, or settle any such claim or demand, then US Sub will have the right to contest and/or settle any such claim or demand and seek indemnification pursuant to this Article X as to any Indemnifiable Amounts; _provided, however,_ that US Sub will not settle, compromise, or offer to settle or compromise any such claim or demand without the prior written consent (which may include a general or limited consent) of the Indemnification Representative, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. If the Indemnification Representative fails to give written notice to US Sub of his intention to contest or settle any such claim or demand within twenty (20) calendar days after US Sub has notified the Indemnification Representative that any such claim or demand has been made in writing, or if any such notice is given but any such claim or demand is not contested by the Indemnification Representative within a reasonable time thereafter, US Sub will have the right to contest and/or settle any such claim or demand in its sole discretion and seek indemnification pursuant to this Article X as to any Indemnifiable Amounts; _provided, however,_ that US Sub will not settle, compromise, or offer to settle or compromise any such claim or demand without the prior written consent (which may include a general or limited consent) of the Indemnification Representative, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. 

   

 10.3   _Tax Contests_. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, US Sub will have the right to conduct any Tax audit or other Tax contest relating to the Surviving Corporation. US Sub will conduct any such Tax audit or other Tax contest in good faith. With respect to any matters relating to such Tax audits or other Tax contests as to which US Sub may seek indemnification hereunder, US Sub shall provide the Indemnification Representative with copies of all correspondence with the relevant Governmental Entity regarding such matter, and shall consult with and allow the Indemnification Representative to comment upon such matter and shall not take any position (whether or not in writing) or make any written submission to any Governmental Entity without the consent of the Indemnification Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

   

 10.4   _Limitations_. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Article X, US Sub will be entitled to indemnification only to the extent that the aggregate Indemnifiable Amounts exceed Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000). The aggregate amount to which US Sub will be entitled to be indemnified will not exceed the amount of Merger Consideration delivered to the Escrow Fund. The Escrow Fund will be US Subs sole source of funds with respect to any rights it has to be indemnified under this Article X. 

    

 37 

      

* * *

     

 10.5   _Binding Effect_. The indemnification obligations contained in this Article X are an integral part of this Agreement and the Merger in the absence of which US Sub would not have entered into this Agreement. 

   

 10.6   _Time Limit_. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of Adaytum and the Principal Stockholders set forth in this Agreement will survive the Closing and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, but any claims with respect thereto may be made only on or before the first yearly anniversary of the date of this Agreement. 

   

 10.7   _Sole Remedy_. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the provisions of this Article X will be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent, US Sub, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation for any damage, claim, cause of action or right of any nature arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the certificates or other documents executed or delivered herewith, or the transactions contemplated hereby;  _provided, however,_ that nothing in this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement will be deemed to limit any right or remedy against a Person for that Persons criminal activity or fraud. 

    

ARTICLE XI

    

TERMINATION

   

 11.1   _Mutual Agreement_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time by the written consent of US Sub and Adaytum. 

   

 11.2   _Termination by US Sub_. This Agreement may be terminated by US Sub ( _provided that_ it is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement) alone, by means of written notice to Adaytum, if there has been a material breach by Adaytum or a Principal Stockholder of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement or other ancillary agreements, which breach would result in a failure to satisfy the closing conditions contained in Section 9.2 and has not been cured within five (5) business days following receipt by Adaytum of written notice of such breach. 

   

 11.3   _Termination by Adaytum_. This Agreement may be terminated by Adaytum ( _provided that_ it is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement) alone, by means of written notice to US Sub, if there has been a material breach by Parent, US Sub or Merger Sub of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in the Agreement or other ancillary agreements, which breach would result in a failure to satisfy the closing conditions contained in Section 9.3 and has not been cured within five (5) business days following receipt by US Sub of written notice of such breach.

 11.4   _Outside Date_. This Agreement may be terminated by US Sub alone or by Adaytum alone by means of written notice if the Effective Time does not occur on or prior to February 28, 2003; _provided, however,_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the preceding clause will not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been a significant cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before such date. 

   

 11.5   _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by any of Adaytum or US Sub as provided in this Article, this Agreement will forthwith become void and have no effect, and there will be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent, US Sub, Adaytum, Merger Sub, the Principal Stockholders or their respective officers, directors or shareholders, except that (i) the provisions of Sections 8.3, 8.5, 8.6 and 12.2 will survive any such termination and abandonment, and (ii) no party will be released or relieved from any liability arising from the willful breach by such party prior to termination of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements as set forth in this Agreement.

Any attempted assignment by Merger Sub, US Sub or Parent, on the one hand, or by Adaytum, on the other hand, in violation of this Section 12.5 will be voidable and will entitle Adaytum or Parent, respectively, to terminate this Agreement at its option and provided, further, that Parent may assign its rights under this Agreement to US Sub without limitation. 

   12.6   _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more partially or fully executed counterparts each of which will be deemed an original and will bind the signatory, but all of which together will constitute but one and the same instrument. The execution and delivery of a Signature Page to Agreement and Plan of Reorganization in the form annexed to this Agreement, including a facsimile copy of the actual signature, by any party hereto who will have been furnished the final form of this Agreement will constitute the execution and delivery of this Agreement by such party. 

   

 12.7   _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing executed by Adaytum, Merger Sub, US Sub and Parent; _provided however,_ that no such amendment which materially adversely affects the rights or obligations of any stockholder of Adaytum will be made without the written consent of such stockholder. 

   

 12.8   _Extension, Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto may, to the extent legally allowed: (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of any other party hereto to the party extending such time, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements, covenants or conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. 

   

 12.9   _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference will be to a Section, Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The words "include," "includes," and "including" when used therein will be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation." The table of contents, index to defined terms, and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and will not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

   

 12.10   _Knowledge_. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _knowledge_ " (including any derivation thereof such as "know" or "knowing" and regardless of whether such word starts with an initial capital) in reference to Adaytum will mean the actual knowledge of the directors and officers of Adaytum, as well as any facts or information that such persons should have known after conducting a reasonable investigation. 

   

 12.11   _Transfer, Sales, Documentary, Stamp and Other Similar Taxes_. Any and all transfer, sales, documentary, stamp and other similar Taxes imposed in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be paid by the stockholder of Adaytum with respect to which such Tax relates.
