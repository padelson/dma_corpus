<U>No Further Ownership Rights in Adaytum Capital Stock</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Merger and its approval
by the stockholders of Adaytum and the execution of this Agreement will be deemed, at the

otherwise, other than (i) rights pursuant to this Agreement and the other agreements
contemplated hereby and (ii) rights of holders of Dissenting Shares under the DGCL. After
the Effective Time, there will be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Adaytum of
Adaytum Capital Stock. Except for the Outstanding Adaytum Options to be exercised pursuant

Adaytum will cause all other Outstanding Adaytum Options, including without limitation the
warrants described on Schedule 2.5 hereto, to be cancelled. Until surrendered to Parent,
each certificate for Adaytum Capital Stock will, after the Effective Time, represent only

<U>Assumption of Stock Options</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the Effective Time, US Sub shall assume that
portion of each Outstanding Adaytum Option listed on Schedule 2.6 that has not been
exercised pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and each holder thereof (each an &#147;<U>Option
</U>Holder&#148;) shall thereby be entitled to acquire, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the Option Holder, on substantially the same terms
(including the dates and extent of exercisability) and subject to the same conditions,
including vesting, as such Outstanding Adaytum Option (taking into account any amendment
to such option provided for in Section 9.2(m)), the number of shares of common stock,
without par value, of Parent (&#147;<U>Parent Common Stock</U>&#148;) determined by
<I><U>multiplying</U></I><U></U> the number of shares of Adaytum Common Stock for which
such portion of such Outstanding Adaytum Option is exercisable in accordance with its
terms immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Conversion Number (rounded down to
the nearest whole share), at an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded
up to the nearest whole cent) determined by dividing the exercise price per share of
Adaytum Common Stock of such Outstanding Adaytum Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time by the Conversion Number. The term <U>&#147;Conversion Number</U>&#148; means the
quotient obtained by dividing the Common Per Share Amount by the average of the daily
closing prices of the Parent Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market for
the five consecutive full trading days ending two trading days preceding the Closing Date. </FONT></P>

          waived any statute of limitation with respect to any Tax or agreed to any

          Adaytum in filing its Tax Returns (taking into account any Taxes incurred as a

          arrangement or contract which is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
          purposes. Adaytum will not incur any liability for Taxes from the Unaudited

<U>Employees</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 3.17 of the Adaytum Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of (a)
the names, titles, salaries and all other compensation of all salaried Adaytum employees
(such term meaning permanent and temporary, full-time and part-time employees) and (b) the
wage rates for non-salaried Adaytum employees (by classification). Any persons engaged by
Adaytum as independent contractors, rather than employees, have been properly classified
as such and have been so engaged in accordance with all applicable federal, foreign, state
or local laws. No senior management or technical employee has stated to Adaytum that such
employee intends to resign or retire as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or otherwise within six months after the Closing Date. Adaytum is not and has
never been engaged in any dispute or litigation with an employee or former employee
regarding matters pertaining to intellectual property or assignment of inventions.
Adaytum&nbsp;has never been and, to the knowledge of Adaytum, is not now subject to a
union organizing effort. Except for contracts listed in Section 3.14(a) of the Adaytum
Disclosure Schedule and &#147;at-will&#148; employment arrangements, Adaytum does not have
any written contract of employment or other employment, severance or similar agreement
with any of its employees or any established policy or practice relating thereto, and all
of its employees are employees-at-will. Adaytum is not a party to any pending, or to
Adaytum&#146;s knowledge, threatened, labor dispute. Adaytum has complied in all material
respects with all applicable federal, foreign, state and local laws, ordinances, rules and
regulations and requirements relating to the employment of labor, including but not
limited to the provisions thereof relating to wages, hours, collective bargaining and
ensuring equality of opportunity for employment and advancement of minorities and women.
There are no claims pending, or, to the knowledge of Adaytum, threatened to be brought, in
any court or administrative agency by any former or current employees of Adaytum for
compensation, pending severance benefits, vacation time, vacation pay or pension benefits,
or any other claim threatened or pending in any court or administrative agency from any
current or former employee or any other Person arising out of Adaytum&#146;s status as
employer, whether in the form of claims for employment discrimination, harassment, unfair
labor practices, grievances, wrongful discharge, or otherwise. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Employee Benefit Plans</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each Plan (as defined below) covering active, former, or
retired employees of Adaytum or any ERISA Affiliate (as defined below) is listed in
Section 3.18 of the Adaytum Disclosure Schedule. &#147;<U>Plan</U>&#148; means any
employee benefit plan as defined in ERISA (as defined below) and will also include any
employment, severance or similar contract, arrangement or policy (written or oral) and
each plan or arrangement providing for insurance coverage (including any self-insured
arrangements), workers&#146; compensation, disability benefits, supplemental unemployment
benefits, vacation benefits, pension or retirement benefits or for deferred compensation,
profit-sharing, bonuses, phantom stock, stock options, stock appreciation rights or other
forms of incentive compensation or post-retirement insurance, compensation or benefits.
Adaytum has made available to Parent a copy of each Plan, and where applicable, any
related trust agreement, annuity, or insurance contract. All annual reports (Form 5500)
required to be filed with the appropriate Governmental Entity have been properly filed on
a timely basis, and Adaytum has made available to Parent copies of the three most recently
filed Forms 5500 for each applicable Plan. Each Plan intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and has remained tax-qualified to this date and
its related trust is tax-exempt and has been so since its creation. No Plan is covered by
Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
(&#147;<U>ERISA</U>&#148;), or Section 412 of the Code. No &#147;prohibited
transaction,&#148; as defined in ERISA Section 406 or Code Section 4975, has occurred with
respect to any Plan, unless such a transaction was exempt from such rules. Each Plan has
been maintained and administered in material compliance with its terms and with the
requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, orders, rules and regulations, including
but not limited to ERISA and the Code, which are applicable to such Plans. There are no
pending or anticipated claims against or otherwise involving any of the Plans and no suit,
action, or other litigation (excluding claims for benefits incurred in the ordinary course
of Plan activities) has been brought against or with respect to any Plan. All
contributions, reserves, or premium payments to the Plan determined in accordance with
prior funding and accrual practices have been made or provided for through the date
hereof. Neither Adaytum nor any entity which is considered one employer with Adaytum under
Section 414 of the Code or Section 4001 of ERISA (each an &#147;<U>ERISA
Affiliate</U>&#148;) has ever maintained or contributed to or incurred or expects to incur
liability with respect to any Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or any
&#147;multi-employer plan&#148; within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA. There
are no restrictions on the rights of Adaytum or any ERISA Affiliate to amend or terminate
any Plan without incurring any liability thereunder. Adaytum has not engaged in or is a
successor or parent corporation to an entity that has engaged in a transaction described
in ERISA Section 4069. Since the Unaudited Balance Sheet Date, there have been no
amendments to, written interpretations of, or announcements (whether or not written) by
Adaytum or any ERISA Affiliate relating to, or change in employee participation or
coverage under, any Plan that would materially increase the cost of maintaining such Plan.
Neither Adaytum nor any of its ERISA Affiliates have any current or projected liability in
respect of post-employment or post-retirement welfare benefits for retired or former
employees other than health care continuation benefits required to be provided under
applicable law. No tax under Section 4980B or 4980D of the Code has been incurred in
respect of any Plan that is a group health plan, as defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the
Code. </FONT></P>

          Subject to Sections 10.4 and 10.5, US Sub shall be entitled to be indemnified
          and held harmless from and against, and to be reimbursed with respect to, any
          and all losses, damages, liabilities, claims, judgments, settlements, fines,
          costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#146; fees)
          (&#147;<U>Indemnifiable Amounts</U>&#148;), of every nature whatsoever incurred
          by US Sub (which will be deemed to include any of the foregoing incurred by the
          Parent or the Surviving Corporation) by reason of or arising out of or in
          connection with (i) any breach, or any claim (including claims by parties other
          than US Sub) that constitutes a breach, by Adaytum of any representation or
          warranty of Adaytum contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or other
          document delivered to US Sub or Parent pursuant to this Agreement, other than
          any breach or related claim taken or not taken at the written direction of or
          after consultation with and written concurrence of US Sub or Parent and (ii) the
          failure, partial or total, of Adaytum to perform any agreement or covenant
          required by this Agreement to be performed by it other than any breach or
          related claim taken or not taken at the written direction of or after
          consultation with and written concurrence of US Sub or Parent and (iii) subject
          to the provisions of Schedule 10.1, any Tax liability, or asserted liability, of
          Adaytum attributable to periods (or any portion thereof) ending on or prior to
          the Closing other than Tax liabilities accrued on the Closing Balance Sheet and
          reflected in the calculation of Net Working Capital. The foregoing right to
          indemnity will be determined without regard to any right to indemnification to
          which any Person may have in his or her capacity as an officer, director,
          employee, agent or any other capacity of Adaytum, and no stockholder of Adaytum
          will be entitled to any indemnification from Adaytum or the Surviving
          Corporation for amounts paid hereunder. There will be no right of contribution
          or subrogation from Parent, US Sub or the Surviving Corporation for
          indemnification payments made by or for the account of the stockholders of
          Adaytum. Any amounts received by US Sub shall be treated as adjustments to the
          consideration for the Merger. </FONT></P>

          For purposes of calculating the Tax liability in Section 10.1(a)(iii) above, in
          the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a
          Tax period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, the portion of
          such Tax related to the portion of such Tax period ending on the Closing Date
          shall (x) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to
          income, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period
          multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax
          period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
          days in the entire Tax period, and (y) in the case of any Tax based upon or
          related to income be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the
          relevant Tax period ended on the Closing Date (including Taxes, if any, imposed
          on Adaytum pursuant to Sections 951 through 964 of the Code calculated as if the
          relevant Tax period of each subsidiary of Adaytum ended on the Closing Date).
          Any credits relating to a Tax period that begins before and ends after the
          Closing Date shall be taken into account as though the relevant Tax period ended
          on the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the
          foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with reasonable past
          practice of Adaytum. </FONT></P>

<U>Third Party Claims</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With respect to any claims or demands by third parties as to
which US Sub may seek indemnification hereunder, other than claims or demands covered by
Section 10.3, whenever US Sub will have received a written notice that such a claim or
demand has been asserted or threatened, US Sub will promptly notify the Indemnification
Representative (as designated in the Escrow Agreement) of such claim or demand and of the
facts within US Sub&#146;s knowledge that relate thereto within a reasonable time after
receiving such written notice. The Indemnification Representative will then have the right
to defend, contest, negotiate or settle any such claim or demand through counsel of his
own selection, reasonably satisfactory to US Sub, and solely at the cost and expense of
the stockholders of Adaytum. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Indemnification
Representative will not settle, compromise, or offer to settle or compromise any such
claim or demand without the prior written consent of US Sub, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld. Without limiting US Sub&#146;s right to object for other reasons,
US Sub may object to a settlement or compromise which includes any provision which in its
reasonable judgment may have an adverse impact on or establish an adverse precedent for
the Business Condition of US Sub or Parent or any of its subsidiaries. If the
Indemnification Representative gives notice to US Sub within twenty (20) calendar days
after US Sub has notified the Indemnification Representative that any such claim or demand
has been made in writing, that the Indemnification Representative elects to have US Sub
defend, contest, negotiate, or settle any such claim or demand, then US Sub will have the
right to contest and/or settle any such claim or demand and seek indemnification pursuant
to this Article X as to any Indemnifiable Amounts; <I>provided, however,</I> that US Sub
will not settle, compromise, or offer to settle or compromise any such claim or demand
without the prior written consent (which may include a general or limited consent) of the
Indemnification Representative, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. If the
Indemnification Representative fails to give written notice to US Sub of his intention to
contest or settle any such claim or demand within twenty (20) calendar days after US Sub
has notified the Indemnification Representative that any such claim or demand has been
made in writing, or if any such notice is given but any such claim or demand is not
contested by the Indemnification Representative within a reasonable time thereafter, US
Sub will have the right to contest and/or settle any such claim or demand in its sole
discretion and seek indemnification pursuant to this Article X as to any Indemnifiable
Amounts; <I>provided, however,</I> that US Sub will not settle, compromise, or offer to
settle or compromise any such claim or demand without the prior written consent (which may
include a general or limited consent) of the Indemnification Representative, which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld. </FONT></P>

<U>Tax Contests</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, US Sub will have the right to
conduct any Tax audit or other Tax contest relating to the Surviving Corporation. US Sub
will conduct any such Tax audit or other Tax contest in good faith. With respect to any
matters relating to such Tax audits or other Tax contests as to which US Sub may seek
indemnification hereunder, US Sub shall provide the Indemnification Representative with
copies of all correspondence with the relevant Governmental Entity regarding such matter,
and shall consult with and allow the Indemnification Representative to comment upon such
matter and shall not take any position (whether or not in writing) or make any written
submission to any Governmental Entity without the consent of the Indemnification
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. </FONT></P>

entitled to indemnification only to the extent that the aggregate Indemnifiable Amounts
exceed Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000). The aggregate amount to which US Sub
will be entitled to be indemnified will not exceed the amount of Merger Consideration
delivered to the Escrow Fund. The Escrow Fund will be US Sub&#146;s sole source of funds
with respect to any rights it has to be indemnified under this Article X. </FONT></P>
