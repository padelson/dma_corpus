 The number of MPLX Common Units subject to each Converted MPLX Phantom Unit
shall be equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of
(x) the number of ANDX Common Units subject to such ANDX Phantom Unit
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the Public
Unitholder Exchange Ratio. For the avoidance of doubt, any then-accumulated
distribution equivalent amounts payable pursuant to distribution equivalent
rights with respect to each ANDX Phantom Unit will carry over and be paid to
the holder upon, and subject to, the vesting of the Converted MPLX Phantom
Unit that corresponds to the ANDX Phantom Unit to which such distribution
equivalent amounts related.

(b) _ANDX Director Phantom Units_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding
ANDX Phantom Unit that is held by a non-employee director of ANDX GP (each, an
" _ANDX Director Phantom Unit_ ") shall, automatically and without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall only entitle
the holder of such ANDX Director Phantom Unit to receive (without interest),
as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time (but in any
event no later than ten (10) Business Days after the Effective Time), a cash
payment equal to (i) the number of ANDX Common Units subject to such ANDX
Director Phantom Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not
vested, multiplied by (ii) the product of (A) the Public Unitholder Exchange
Ratio and (B) the average of the volume weighted average price per unit of
MPLX Common Units on NYSE (as reported by Bloomberg L.P. or, if not reported
therein, in another authoritative source mutually selected by MPLX and ANDX)
on each of the ten (10) consecutive trading days ending with the complete
trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that to the extent that any such ANDX Director Phantom Unit constitutes
nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, such
payment shall be paid in accordance with the applicable awards terms and at
the earliest time permitted under the terms of such award that will not result
in the application of a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

(c) _ANDX Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, ANDX and the ANDX
Board, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that
are necessary to effectuate the treatment of the ANDX Phantom Units and ANDX
Director Phantom Units and to give effect to this Section 3.2. ANDX shall take
all actions necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective Time,
neither MPLX nor the Surviving Entity will be required to deliver ANDX Common
Units or other units of ANDX to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of
ANDX Phantom Units.

 

(d) _MPLX Actions_. MPLX shall take all actions that are necessary for the
assumption of the ANDX Phantom Units pursuant to Section 3.2(a), including
the reservation, issuance and listing of MPLX Common Units as necessary to
effect the transactions contemplated by this Section 3.2.

Agreement. Such MPLX Common Units and MPLX Series B Preferred Units, cash in
lieu of any fractional units payable pursuant to Section 4.5 and the amount

delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such Public

provisions with respect to delivery of an "agents message" with respect to
Book-Entry Units), such materials to be in such form and have such other

approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) (the "
_Letter of Transmittal_ "), and (B) instructions for surrendering the

with the transfer of Book-Entry Units, in accordance with the terms of the
Letter of Transmittal and accompanying instructions or, with respect to Book-
Entry Units held through DTC, in accordance with DTCs customary procedures
(it being understood that the holders of Book-Entry Units shall be deemed to
have surrendered such units upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of such
"agents message" or such other evidence, if any, as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably request) and such other procedures as agreed by the ANDX Parties,
the MPLX Parties, the Exchange Agent and DTC, the holder of such Certificate

Units or ANDX Series A Preferred Units, as applicable, and any Certificate or
ledger entry relating to Book-Entry Units formerly representing ANDX Common
Units or ANDX Series A Preferred Units, as applicable, that have been so
surrendered shall be cancelled by the Exchange Agent.

(d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of certificated Public Unitholder
Eligible Units or Affiliated Unitholder Eligible Units that are not
registered in the transfer records of ANDX, the proper number of MPLX Common
Units, together with any cash (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in Section 4.8) to be paid upon due surrender of the
Certificate and any distributions in respect thereof, may be issued and/or
paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Public
Unitholder Eligible Units or Affiliated Unitholder Eligible Units, as
applicable, is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable unit transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable, in each
case, in form and substance, reasonably satisfactory to the Exchange Agent.
With respect to Book-Entry Units, payment of the Public Unitholder Merger
Consideration, Affiliated Unitholder Merger Consideration or ANDX Series A
Consideration, as applicable, and any cash in lieu of fractional units
payable pursuant to Section 4.5 and any distributions pursuant to Section 4.3
shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Units are
registered in the unit transfer books of ANDX.

 

4.3. _Distributions_. All MPLX Common Units and MPLX Series B Preferred Units
to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed issued and outstanding as
of the Effective Time and whenever a distribution is declared by MPLX in
respect of the MPLX Common Units or MPLX Series B Preferred Units, the record
date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that declaration
shall include distributions in respect of all units issuable pursuant to this
Agreement.

 



\- 19 -

    

 No distributions in respect of the MPLX Common Units or MPLX Series B
Preferred Units shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Public
Unitholder Eligible Units, Affiliated Unitholder Eligible Units or ANDX
Series A Preferred Unit, as applicable, until the Certificate (or affidavit of
loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section 4.7) or Book-Entry Unit
is surrendered for exchange in accordance with this Article IV. Subject to
the effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable Laws, following such surrender,
there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of record of the whole MPLX
Common Units issued in exchange for Public Unitholder Eligible Units or
Affiliated Unitholder Eligible Units, or whole MPLX Series B Preferred Units
issued in exchange for ANDX Series A Preferred Units, in accordance with this
Article IV, without interest, (a) at the time of such surrender, the
distributions in respect of MPLX Common Units or MPLX Series B Preferred
Units, with a record date at or after the Effective Time and payment date
prior to or on the date of surrender and (b) at the appropriate payment date,
the distributions payable with respect to such whole MPLX Common Units or
MPLX Series B Preferred Units, as applicable, with a record date at or after
the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender.

 

4.4. _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the unit transfer books of ANDX of the ANDX Common Units or ANDX
Series A Preferred Units that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

4.5. _No Fractional Units_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no fractional MPLX Common Units will be issued upon the conversion
of ANDX Common Units pursuant to Section 3.1. All fractional MPLX Common Units
that a holder of Public Unitholder Eligible Units or Affiliated Unitholder
Eligible Units would be otherwise entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.1
shall be aggregated and rounded to three decimal places. Any holder of Public
Unitholder Eligible Units or Affiliated Unitholder Eligible Units otherwise
entitled to receive a fractional unit of MPLX Common Units but for this
Section 4.5 shall be entitled to receive a cash payment, without interest,
rounded to the nearest cent, equal to the product of (A) the aggregated
amount of the fractional interest in MPLX Common Units to which such holder
would, but for this Section 4.5, be entitled and (B) an amount equal to the
average of the volume weighted average price per unit of MPLX Common Units on
the NYSE (as reported by Bloomberg L.P. or, if not reported therein, in
another authoritative source mutually selected by MPLX and ANDX) on each of
the ten (10) consecutive trading days ending with the complete trading day
immediately prior to the Effective Time. No holder of Public Unitholder
Eligible Units or Affiliated Unitholder Eligible Units shall be entitled by
virtue of the right to receive cash in lieu of fractional units of MPLX Common
Units described in this Section 4.5 to any distributions, voting rights or
any other rights in respect of any fractional unit of MPLX Common Units. The
payment of cash in lieu of fractional units of MPLX Common Units is not a
separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical
rounding-off of the fractions in the exchange.

 

4.6. _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund and any MPLX
Common Units) that remains unclaimed twelve months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to MPLX.

 



\- 20 -

    

 Any holder of Public Unitholder Eligible Units, Affiliated Unitholder
Eligible Units or ANDX Series A Preferred Units who has not theretofore
complied with this Article IV shall thereafter look only to MPLX for delivery
of the Public Unitholder Merger Consideration, Affiliated Unitholder Merger
Consideration or the ANDX Series A Consideration, as applicable, and payment
of any cash and distributions in respect thereof payable and/or issuable
pursuant to Section 3.1, Section 4.3 and Section 4.5, in each case, without
any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving
Entity, MPLX, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any
former holder of ANDX Common Units or ANDX Series A Preferred Units for any
amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. If any Certificate or Book-Entry
Unit has not been surrendered prior to the date on which the Public
Unitholder Merger Consideration or Affiliated Unitholder Merger Consideration
would escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any Public
Unitholder Merger Consideration, Affiliated Unitholder Merger Consideration
and the cash, if any, to be paid in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Unit shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to
such time become the property of MPLX, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

4.7. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
representing Public Unitholder Eligible Units, Affiliated Unitholder Eligible
Units or ANDX Series A Preferred Units shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the MPLX Parties, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and
upon such terms as may be required by the MPLX Parties as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Public Unitholder Merger Consideration, Affiliated Unitholder
Merger Consideration or ANDX Series A Consideration, as applicable, and any
cash or unpaid distributions that would be payable or deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement had such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate been surrendered.

 

4.8. _Withholding Rights_. Each of MPLX, the Surviving Entity and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code
or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law (and to the
extent deduction and withholding is required, such deduction and withholding
may be taken in MPLX Common Units). To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by MPLX, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such
withheld amounts (a) shall be timely remitted by MPLX, the Surviving Entity
or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity,
and (b) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of whom such withholding was made. If
withholding is taken in MPLX Common Units, MPLX, the Surviving Entity or the
Exchange Agent shall be treated as having sold such MPLX Common Units for an
amount of cash equal to the fair market value of such MPLX Common Units at
the time of such deemed sale and paid such cash proceeds to the appropriate
Governmental Entity.

4.9. _No Dissenters_ __ _Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights shall
be available with respect to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 



\- 21 -

    

4.10. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement to the earlier
of the Effective Time and termination in accordance with Article IX, the
issued and outstanding ANDX Common Units or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for ANDX Common Units or the issued and
outstanding MPLX Common Units or securities convertible or exchangeable into
or exercisable for MPLX Common Units, shall have been changed into a different
number of units or securities or a different class by reason of any
reclassification, unit split (including a reverse unit split), unit
distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or
other similar transaction, or a distribution paid in units with a record date
within such period shall have been declared, then the Public Unitholder
Merger Consideration and Affiliated Unitholder Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted to provide the holders of ANDX Common Units and MPLX the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event,
and such items, so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be
the Public Unitholder Merger Consideration and Affiliated Unitholder Merger
Consideration, as applicable. Nothing in this Section 4.10 shall be construed
to permit MPLX or ANDX to take any action except to the extent consistent
with, and not otherwise prohibited by, the terms of this Agreement. For the
avoidance of any doubt, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, this Section 4.10 shall not apply to, and nothing in this Agreement
shall prohibit, the issuance of MPLX Common Units for cash or cash equivalents
or in connection with the issuance of equity compensation.

(c) For a period of not less than six years from and after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Entity shall, and the MPLX Parties shall cause the Surviving
Entity to, maintain for the benefit of the directors and officers of ANDX GP,
as of the Effective Time, an insurance and indemnification policy that
provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the " _D
andO Insurance_") that is substantially equivalent to and in any event not less
favorable in the aggregate than the existing policies of the ANDX Parties or,
if such substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best
coverage that is reasonably available; _provided_ , that in no event shall the
annual cost of the DandO Insurance exceed 300% of the current annual premium
paid by the ANDX Parties for such purpose; and _provided_ , _further_ , that
if the cost of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Surviving
Entity shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding such amount. In lieu of the foregoing, at or prior to the
Effective Time, the ANDX Parties may obtain, at its election, prepaid
policies, which policies provide such directors and officers with coverage for
an aggregate period of at least six years with respect to claims arising from
facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,
that the ANDX Parties shall in no event spend more than an amount equal to
six multiplied by 300% of the current annual premium paid by the ANDX Parties
for the existing policies of the ANDX Parties. If such prepaid policies have

Entity shall, and the MPLX Parties shall cause the Surviving Entity to

properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the MPLX Parties or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.12.

 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.12 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the ANDX Partnership
Agreement, the ANDX GP LLC Agreement, under Delaware Law or any other
applicable Law, or under any other agreement of such Indemnified Person with
the ANDX Parties. These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and
are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified
Person.

7.13. _Distributions_.

 

(a) Between the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, subject to
Section 7.13(b), the ANDX GP shall (and MPC shall directly or indirectly
cause its representatives on the ANDX Board to) determine, declare and cause
ANDX to pay regular quarterly cash distributions on the ANDX Common Units for
each quarter in accordance with the ANDX Partnership Agreement in the
ordinary course and consistent with past practice, including with respect to
amount and timing of record dates and payment dates; provided, however that,
subject to applicable Law, Section 7.13(b) and the ANDX Partnership Agreement,
any such regular quarterly distribution shall not be less than $1.03 per ANDX
Common Unit without the separate determination and approval of the ANDX
Conflicts Committee.

so that no holder of ANDX Common Units shall receive two distributions, or
fail to receive one distribution, for any single calendar quarter with respect
to its applicable ANDX Common Units or MPLX Common Units received pursuant to
the Merger in exchange therefor.

 

7.14. _Section_ __ _ 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the ANDX Board
and MPLX Board shall take all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate
to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any other
dispositions of equity securities of ANDX or acquisitions of MPLX Common Units
(including derivative securities) in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by any individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
ANDX or will become subject to such reporting requirements with respect to
MPLX, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law.

Committee either as a member of such board or such committee, without the
affirmative vote of the MPLX Board or ANDX Board, as applicable, including
the affirmative vote of a majority of members of the applicable conflicts
committee. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 7.15 shall not apply to

of any director.

The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the personal jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such Court of Chancery
shall lack subject matter jurisdiction, the Federal courts of the United
States of America located in the State of Delaware, solely in respect of the
interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of (and any claim or cause
of action arising under or relating to) this Agreement and of the documents
referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in

or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or

such document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the parties hereto
irrevocably agree that all claims relating to such action, proceeding
or transactions shall be heard and determined in such courts. The parties

(c) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached (and, more specifically, that

and the holders of ANDX Common Units did not receive the aggregate
consideration payable to them in accordance with the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement). It is accordingly agreed that the parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if said Court
of Chancery shall lack subject matter jurisdiction, any Federal court of the
United States of America located in the County of New Castle, Delaware, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which such Party is entitled at law
or in equity. In the event that any action is brought in equity to enforce
the provisions of this Agreement, no Party shall allege, and each Party hereby
waives the defense or counterclaim, that there is an adequate remedy at law.
Each Party further agrees that no other Party or any other Person shall be
required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this
Section 10.5(c), and each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to
require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar
instrument.

survives termination of this Agreement) when expressly available to such

representations and warranties made with respect to such other Subsidiary as
of the date of such designation; _provided_ that any such designation shall
