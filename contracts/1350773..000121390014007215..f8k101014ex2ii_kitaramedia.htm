 BY AND AMONG 
 KITARA MEDIA CORP., KITARA MERGER SUB, INC., AND

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (the " _Agreement_ "), dated as of
October 10, 2014, is by and among Kitara Media Corp., a Delaware corporation
(the " _Company_ "), Kitara Holdco Corp., a Delaware corporation ("
_New Kitara_ "), and Kitara Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
_Merger Sub_ ").

  

WHEREAS, the Company has an authorized capital stock consisting of
300,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "
_Company Common Stock_ "), of which 95,884,241 shares are issued and
outstanding as of the date hereof, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock,
par value $0.0001 per share, of which no shares are issued and outstanding on
the date hereof;

  

WHEREAS, New Kitara has an authorized capital stock consisting of 500,000,000
shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the " _New Kitara Common
Stock_ "), of which 100 shares are issued and outstanding and are held by the
Company on the date hereof, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par
value $0.0001 per share, none of which are outstanding on the date hereof;

  

WHEREAS, Merger Sub has an authorized capital stock consisting of 1,000
shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the " _Merger Sub Common

on the date hereof;

  

WHEREAS, the Company and New Kitara have entered into a Unit Exchange
Agreement (" _Unit Exchange Agreement_ ") with Future Ads LLC, a California
limited liability company (" _Future Ads_ "), and the members of Future Ads
pursuant to which following the Merger (defined below), New Kitara will
acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Future Ads
(the " _Future Ads Acquisition_ ");

  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined that it would
be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to effect a

consummated simultaneously with the Future Ads Acquisition or immediately
prior thereto;

  

WHEREAS, upon the consummation of the Merger, each issued and outstanding
share of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the effective time of the
Merger will be automatically converted into one share of New Kitara Common
Stock and following the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist (the "
_Reorganization_ ");

  

WHEREAS, the board of directors of New Kitara has resolved that each share of
New Kitara Common Stock into which a share of Company Common Stock is
converted by virtue of the Merger shall be uncertificated until such time as
the holder of such share of Company Common Stock surrenders the Company
Certificate (as defined herein) formerly representing such share of Company
Common Stock held by such holder to New Kitara;

WHEREAS, the boards of directors of the Company, New Kitara and Merger Sub
each desire that, to facilitate the Reorganization, the Merger be consummated
pursuant to Section 251 of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") on the terms set forth in this Agreement, which is
intended to constitute, inter alia, an agreement of merger for the
purposes of the DGCL, and the boards of directors of the Company, New Kitara
and Merger Sub have each approved this Agreement and declared its
advisability and directed that this Agreement be submitted to a vote of their
respective stockholders;

  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has directed that this
Agreement be submitted to a vote of the Company's stockholders at a special
meeting of stockholders (the " _Special Meeting_ "); and

  

WHEREAS, New Kitara, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, and the Company,
as the sole stockholder of New Kitara, shall, promptly after the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, each adopt this Agreement.

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and mutual agreements herein
contained, the parties hereto agree as follows.

Article 2

  

CONVERSION OF SHARES

  

Section 2.01. _Company Common Stock._ At the Merger Effective Time,
automatically by virtue of the Merger and without any further action by any
of the parties hereto or any other person, each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding or held by the Company as treasury stock immediately
prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be automatically converted into one
share of New Kitara Common Stock.

  

Section 2.02. _Merger Sub Common Stock._ At the Merger Effective Time,
automatically by virtue of the Merger and without any further action by any
of the parties hereto or any other person, each share of Merger Sub Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be

Article 3

  

NEW KITARA STOCK; EXCHANGE OF STOCK CERTIFICATES

  

Section 3.01. _Conversion of Company Stock; Deemed Receipt of New Kitara
Stock_. As set forth in Section 2.01 above, at the Merger Effective Time,
each outstanding share of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the
Merger Effective Time shall be automatically converted into, and each such
Company stockholder shall be deemed to have received, one share of New Kitara
Common Stock in respect thereof. Initially, all shares of New Kitara Common
Stock will not be represented by certificates, but rather will be
uncertificated and exist as entries on the books and records of New Kitara's
transfer agent.

  

Section 3.02. _Appointment of Exchange Agent for Certificated Company
Common Stock._ As soon as practicable following the completion of the
Reorganization, New Kitara shall appoint an exchange agent (" _Exchange Agent_
") for the purpose of facilitating the exchange of certificates representing,
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, shares of Company Common
Stock (" _Company Certificates_ ") for certificates representing shares of New
Kitara Common Stock (" _New Kitara Certificates_ ").

  

Section 3.03. _Exchange of Certificates._ As soon as practicable after
the completion of the Reorganization, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each
holder of record of Company Certificates a form letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Company Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Company
Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Company Certificates in exchange for New Kitara
Certificates. Upon proper surrender of each Company Certificate for exchange
and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed
letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Company
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a New Kitara
Certificate representing one share of New Kitara Common Stock for each share
formerly represented by the surrendered Company Certificate. Failure to
exchange Company Certificates by a stockholder will not affect such
stockholder's interest in New Kitara, but such stockholder will not receive
New Kitara Certificates and will hold its interest in New Kitara in
uncertificated form represented by entries on the books and records of New
Kitara's transfer agent. From and after the Merger Effective Time and until
exchanged in accordance with this Article 3, each Company Certificate shall
not represent shares of New Kitara Common Stock but instead, shall represent
only the right to receive a New Kitara Certificate representing the shares of
New Kitara Common Stock into which the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Company Certificate were converted in accordance with
Section 2.01.

  

Section 3.04. _Issuance of New Kitara Certificate in a Different Name._
If any New Kitara Certificate is to be issued in a name other than that in
which the Company Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered,
it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Company Certificate
so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate
instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that
the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in
advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a
New Kitara Certificate in any name other than that of the registered holder
of the Company Certificate surrendered, or required for any other reason, or
shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has
been paid or is not payable.

Section 3.05. _No Transfers of Stock after the Merger Effective Time._
After the Merger Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock
which were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective
Time. If, after the Merger Effective Time, Company Certificates representing
such shares are presented for transfer, no transfer shall be effected on the
stock transfer books of the Company with respect to such shares and no New
Kitara Certificate shall be issued with respect thereto unless and until such
Company Certificate is delivered to the Exchange Agent together with properly
completed and duly executed copies of all documents required by Section
3.02 (or such other documents as are satisfactory to New Kitara and the
Exchange Agent in their sole discretion).

  

Section 3.06. _Lost Company Certificates._ In the event any Company
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Company Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by New Kitara, the posting by such
person of a bond in such amount as New Kitara may determine is reasonably
necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Company Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in
exchange for such lost, stolen, or destroyed Company Certificate, a New Kitara
Certificate representing the shares of New Kitara Common Stock deliverable
pursuant to this Agreement.

  

Article 4

  

CONDITIONS TO REORGANIZATION

the Merger Effective Time, whether before or after the adoption of this
Agreement by the stockholders of the Company; provided, however, that no
amendment shall be made after adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders

with its terms or (b) the Board of Directors determines that the consummation
of the Reorganization would not, for any reason, be advisable and in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders.
