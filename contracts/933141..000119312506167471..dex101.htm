SECTION II.

CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS AND TERMS OF MERGER

2.1 Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the
Effective Date, PIC will be merged with and into IBAC in accordance with the
Merger Agreement, this Agreement, the ABCA and the BCL.

2.2 Conversion of PIC Common Stock.

(a) As used herein, the term "Total Merger Consideration" shall mean: (i) a
number of shares of IBKC Common Stock with a total market value of $32.5
million based upon the trading price of IBKC Common Stock applicable to the
Fixed Exchange Ratio ($58.60 per share);plus (ii) a number of shares of IBKC
Common Stock with a total Market Value of $32.5 million based upon the
trading prices of IBKC Common Stock to be applicable to the Floating Exchange
Ratio; plus (iii) cash (without interest) in the total amount of $65.0
million, subject to adjustment under Sections 7.8 and 8.7 of this Agreement.



 

\- 4 - (b) Except for shares of PIC Common Stock as to which dissenters rights have
been perfected and not withdrawn or otherwise forfeited ("Dissenters
Shares") under the ABCA, and as otherwise provided herein, at the Effective
Date each issued and outstanding share of PIC Common Stock will be converted
into the " Per Share Merger Consideration" which shall mean:



     | (i) | shares of IBKC Common Stock based upon the Fixed Exchange
Ratio; plus 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | shares of IBKC Common Stock based upon the Floating
Exchange Ratio; plus 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | an amount of cash (without interest) determined by
dividing $65.0 million by the number of shares of PIC Common Stock outstanding
on the Effective Date (rounded to the nearest whole cent). 
---|---|--- 

(c) Shares of PIC Common Stock that are held by PIC and any PIC Subsidiary
(other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity) shall not be considered to
be outstanding and shall be cancelled (and not converted) by virtue of the
Merger at the Effective Date and without any further action by any party.

(d) If, before the Effective Date, IBKC should split, reclassify, recapitalize
or combine the IBKC Common Stock, or pay a stock dividend in IBKC
Common Stock, or otherwise change the IBKC Common Stock into any other
securities, or make any other dividend or distribution in respect of the IBKC
Common Stock (other than normal cash dividends consistent with past practices
as the same may be adjusted from time to time in accordance with or not in
violation of this Agreement), and the record date therefore is prior to the
Effective Date, then the Exchange Ratios will be appropriately and
proportionately adjusted to reflect such split, reclassification,
recapitalization, combination, stock dividend or other distribution or change.

(e) In lieu of issuing any fractional share of IBKC Common Stock which would
otherwise be distributable to a PIC stockholder as determined following
application of Section 2.2(a), each holder of PIC Common Stock who would
otherwise be entitled thereto, after aggregating into whole shares all
fractional shares of IBKC Common Stock to which such holder is entitled by
virtue of the Merger, upon surrender of the certificate(s) which represented
PIC Common Stock, will receive, without interest, cash equal to such
fractional share multiplied by $58.60.

(f) No later than the Effective Date, IBKC shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of PIC
Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.2, certificates
and cash (in immediately available funds) representing the Total Merger
Consideration to be paid. After the Effective Date, each holder of PIC Common
Stock (other than Dissenters Shares), upon surrender of such holders
Certificates in accordance herewith, will be entitled to receive the shares of
IBKC Common Stock and cash into which such holders shares have been
converted, less any applicable tax withholding. Until then, each Certificate
for PIC Common Stock will represent the Per Share Merger Consideration into
which the shares of PIC Common Stock represented thereby were converted,
except that IBKC may refuse to pay any dividend or other distribution payable
to holders of any unsurrendered Certificate for PIC Common Stock (without any
interest thereon) until surrender or if such dividend or distribution has
reverted in full ownership to IBKC under its Articles of Incorporation.
Whether or not a Certificate for PIC Common Stock is surrendered, after the
Effective Date it will not represent any interest in any Person other than
IBKC.

(g) Prior to the Effective Date, IBKC or the Exchange Agent shall mail to each
holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates a form of letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Per Share Merger
Consideration into which the shares of PIC Common Stock represented by such
Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to this Section
2.2. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to
the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal,
duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefore (i) a certificate representing that number of shares of
IBKC Common Stock to which such former holder of PIC Common Stock shall have
become entitled pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) a check (or, as provided
in Section 2.2(h) below, wire transfer of immediately available funds)
representing that amount of cash to which such former holder of PIC Common
Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to this Agreement.



 

\- 5 - (h) IBKC and the Exchange Agent shall within one (1) Business Day after the
Effective Date wire the cash amount of the Per Share Merger Consideration and
deliver by overnight courier certificates for shares of IBKC Common Stock to
any former holders of PIC Common Stock who request such payment and have
properly surrendered Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration
prior to the Effective Date.

(i) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the posting by such person of
a bond in such amount as IBKC may reasonably direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Per Share Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof.

(j) If the Person surrendering a Certificate and signing the accompanying
letter of transmittal is not the record holder thereof, then it shall be
a condition of the payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration that: (i)
such Certificate is properly endorsed to such Person or is accompanied by
appropriate stock powers, in either case signed exactly as the name of the
record holder appears on such Certificate, and is otherwise in proper form
for transfer, or is accompanied by appropriate evidence of the authority of
the Person surrendering such Certificate and signing the letter of transmittal
to do so on behalf of the record holder; and (ii) the person requesting such
exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other
similar taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or required for any other
reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such
tax has been paid or is not payable.

Ownership Plan Agreements, Deferred Compensation Agreements and Retention

set forth in Article VIII, the Merger shall become effective upon the approval

PIC or its Subsidiaries who does not remain employed by PIC or its
Subsidiaries after the Effective Date or does not receive a severance payment
in connection with the Merger shall receive a severance payment as if he or
she were an employee of IBKC for the entire time he or she were an employee of

(collectively, a "PIC health plan"), IBKC and IBERIABANK shall make available
to Continuing Employees and their dependents, employer-provided health
care coverage under health plans provided by IBKC and IBERIABANK. Unless a
Continuing Employee affirmatively terminates coverage under a PIC health plan
prior to the time that such Continuing Employee becomes eligible to

existing condition exclusions, nondiscrimination and special enrollment
rights. All PIC employees who cease participating in a PIC health plan and
become participants in a comparable IBKC health plan shall receive credit for
any co-payment and deductibles paid under PICs health plan, to the extent
such credit would be provided under PICs health plan, for purposes of
satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under the
IBKC health plan, upon substantiation, in a form reasonably satisfactory to
IBKC, that such co-payment and/or deductible has been satisfied.

(a) IBKC agrees that all rights to indemnification and all limitations of
liability existing in favor of any director or officer of PIC or any
PIC Subsidiary (the "Indemnified Parties") as provided in PICs or the PIC
Subsidiarys articles of incorporation or bylaws (including without limitation
the right to the advancement of expenses) with respect to matters occurring
on or prior to the Effective Date shall survive the Merger and shall continue
in full force and effect, without any amendment thereto, for a period of six
(6) years from the Effective Date; _provided, however_ , that all rights
to indemnification in respect of any claim, suit, proceeding, investigation,
or other action ("Claim") asserted or made within such period shall continue
until the final disposition of such Claim; _provided further_ , however,
that nothing contained in this Section 4.4(a) shall be deemed to preclude the
liquidation, consolidation or merger of PIC or any PIC Subsidiary, in which
case all of such rights to indemnification and limitations on liability shall
be deemed to so survive and continue notwithstanding any such liquidation,
consolidation or merger and shall constitute rights which may be asserted
against IBKC. Nothing contained in this Section 4.4(a) shall be deemed to
preclude any rights to indemnification or limitations on liability provided
in PICs or any PIC Subsidiarys articles of incorporation with respect to
matters occurring subsequent to the Effective Date to the extent that the
provisions establishing such rights or limitations are not otherwise amended
to the contrary.

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section 4.4,
upon learning of any claim, shall notify IBKC thereof in writing as promptly
as is practicable; provided, however, that failure to so notify IBKC shall not
relieve IBKC from any liability that would otherwise arise under this Section
4.4 except to the extent such failure prejudices IBKC. IBKC shall have the
right to assume the defense thereof and shall not be liable for any expenses
subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the
defense thereof, except that if IBKC does not assume or continue to pursue
such defense, or counsel for the Indemnified Party advises in writing that
issues raise conflicts of interest between IBKC and the Indemnified Party,
then the Indemnified Party may retain counsel satisfactory to such
Indemnified Party (and reasonably satisfactory to IBKC) at IBKCs expense;
provided, however, that (i) IBKC shall not be obligated to pay for more than
one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction except as may be
required due to conflicts of interest; (ii) the Indemnified Parties will
cooperate (to the extent reasonably appropriate under the circumstances) in
the defense of any such claim; and (iii) IBKC shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without the prior written consent of IBKC, which consent
may be withheld unless such settlement is reasonable in light of such claims,
actions, suits, proceedings or investigations against, and defenses
available to, such Indemnified Party.

(c) PIC will, for total premiums not to exceed $161,000 (the "Maximum
Amount"), purchase a continuation of their current directors and officers
liability insurance for a coverage period of three (3) years after the Merger,
provided that if the amount of the annual premiums necessary to maintain or
procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, IBKC shall
maintain the most advantageous policies of directors and officers insurance
obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount.

(d) If IBKC or any of its successors or assigns (i) reorganizes or
consolidates with or merges into or enters into another business
combination transaction with any other Person or entity and is not the
resulting, continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
reorganization, consolidation, merger or transaction or (ii) liquidates,
dissolves or transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person or entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions will
be made so that such surviving corporation or transferee and its successors
and assigns assume the obligations of IBKC set forth in this Agreement. The
obligations of IBKC under this Section 4.4 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and enforceable against IBKC directly by, the Indemnified Parties and
their heirs and representatives and shall be binding on all
respective successors and permitted assigns of IBKC. IBKC shall pay all
reasonable costs, including attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any
Indemnified Party in successfully enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations provided for in this Section 4.4 to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable law. The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be
in addition to any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under
applicable law. The provisions of this Section 4.4 shall survive the
Effective Date.

or other similar plan as in effect on the date of this Agreement, including,
without limitation, any "employee benefit plan", as that term is defined in

dependents, spouses or other beneficiaries of any of such directors, officers,
other employees or independent contractors of, any of the Warrantor Companies
(collectively, the "Warrantor Benefit Plans"), and (ii) PIC and the PIC

directors or officers of, PIC and the PIC Subsidiaries, which employment and
consulting agreements are, with respect to PIC and the PIC Subsidiaries,
included in the term "Warrantor Benefit Plans" as defined above. Any of the
Warrantor Benefit Plans which is an "employee pension benefit plan," as that
term is defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA, is referred to herein as a
"Warrantor ERISA Plan". No Warrantor has participated in or been a member of,
and no Warrantor Benefit Plan is or has been, a multi-employer plan within

a consolidated basis. With respect to the Warrantor Benefit Plans, no event

event," as that term is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA, for which the
30-day reporting requirement has not been waived has been required to be filed
for any Warrantor ERISA Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA within the
12-month period ending on the date of this Agreement. No Warrantor has

which is subject to Title IV of ERISA pursuant to Section 401(a)(20) of the
Code.

(c) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.11(c)_ , no Warrantor ERISA Plan which
is subject to Title IV of ERISA has any "unfunded current liability," as that
term is defined in Section 302(d)(8)(A) of ERISA, and the present fair market
value of the assets of each such plan exceeds the plans "benefit
liabilities", as that term is defined in Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA, when
determined under actuarial factors that would apply if the plan terminated as
of the date of this Agreement in accordance with all applicable legal
requirements.

5.12 Material Contracts. Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.12_ , none of the

affected by, or receives benefits under, any contract or agreement or
amendment thereto that in each case would be required to be filed as an
exhibit to a Form 10-K filed by Warrantor as of the date of this Agreement
and that was not so filed (each such contract, agreement or amendment, a
"Warrantor Material Contract"). No Warrantor Company is in default in any
material respect under any Warrantor Material Contract, and there has not
occurred any event that, with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or
both, would constitute such a default.



  

\- 12 - 5.13 Legal Proceedings. Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.13_ , there are no
actions, suits or proceedings instituted or pending or, to the knowledge of
Warrantors management, threatened against a Warrantor Company, or affecting

5.14 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since December 31, 2005, the

suffered any change in any respect that has had or is reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

Agreement), each of such reports and documents, including the financial
statements, exhibits and schedules thereto, complied in all material respects
with all of the statutes, rules and regulations enforced or promulgated by the
authority with which they were filed and did not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to
make the statements made therein in light of the circumstances under which
they were made not misleading.

5.16 Statements True and Correct. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Warrantor for inclusion in (i) the Registration Statement, (ii)
the Proxy Statement, and (iii) any other documents to be filed with the SEC or
any other Regulatory Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, will, at the respective times such documents are
filed, and, in the case of the Registration Statement, when it becomes
effective and, with respect to the Proxy Statement, when first mailed to the
stockholders of PIC and, if required by law or applicable NASDAQ listing
standards, IBKC, be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or
omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein not misleading, or, in the case of the Proxy Statement or any
amendment thereof or supplement thereto, at the time of the Stockholders
Meeting, be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in light of

Warrantor shall operate its business only in the ordinary course of business
of such Warrantor consistent with past practices, shall preserve intact its
business organizations and assets and maintain its rights and franchises, and
shall voluntarily take no action which would (i) adversely affect the ability
of any of them to obtain any necessary approvals of Regulatory Authorities
required for the transactions contemplated hereby without imposition of a
condition or restriction of the type referred to in the second sentence of
Section 8.5 of this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the ability of such

promptly to the other Warrantor concerning (i) any event which has had, or is
reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect on such Warrantor, or
(ii) the occurrence or impending occurrence of any event or circumstance
known to such Warrantor which would have needed to be reported in a Disclosure
Schedule hereunder if it had occurred or been pending on or prior to the date
of this Agreement, or which would cause or constitute a material breach of
any of the representations, warranties or covenants of such Warrantor
contained herein or that would reasonably be expected to materially and
adversely affect the timely consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each Warrantor shall use its reasonable best efforts to
prevent or to promptly remedy the same.



 

\- 16 - 6.4 Investigation and Confidentiality.

Prior to the Effective Date, each Warrantor will keep the other Warrantor
promptly advised of all material developments relevant to its business and
to the consummation of the Merger and may make or cause to be made such
investigation, if any, of the business, properties, operations and financial
and legal condition of the other Warrantor and its Subsidiaries as such
Warrantor reasonably deems necessary or advisable to familiarize itself and
its advisors with such business, properties, operations and condition;
provided, however, that such investigation shall be reasonably related to the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not interfere unnecessarily with
normal operations. Each Warrantor agrees to furnish the other Warrantor and
the other Warrantors respective advisors with such financial and operating
data and other information with respect to its business, properties and
employees as the other Warrantor shall from time to time reasonably request.
No investigation by one Warrantor shall affect the representations and
warranties of the other Warrantor and, subject to Section 9.3 of this
Agreement, each such representation and warranty shall survive any such
investigation. Each Warrantor agrees to furnish the other Warrantor with all
information necessary to expedite pre-conversion planning and implementation,
including, but not limited to, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable laws and regulations to plan, make effective and consummate
systems and branch conversions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither party

violate or prejudice the rights of any customer or contravene any law, rule,
regulation, order or judgment, nor to disclose board minutes of
any confidential discussion of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each Warrantor shall maintain the confidentiality of all

declare and pay consistent with past practices and prior to the Effective
Date, a quarterly cash dividend (in an amount per share not to exceed the
amount disclosed in _Schedule 6.6_ ), which with respect to the fiscal quarter
of the Effective Date shall be prorated based on the number of elapsed full
weeks prior to thereto and paid prior to the Closing.

shall not, and shall not enter into any agreement to, issue, sell,
or otherwise permit to become outstanding any additional shares of PIC Common

whom it reasonably believes is an "affiliate" of PIC for purposes of Rule 145
under the 1933 Act. Thereafter and until the Effective Date, PIC shall

to deliver to IBKC, prior to the Effective Date, a written agreement,
substantially in the form of _Exhibit II_.



 

\- 17 - 6.9 Certain Actions.

(a) Subject to Section 6.9(d) of this Agreement, PIC agrees that, from the
date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Date or the
termination of this Agreement, neither it nor any of its affiliates, nor any
of the officers and directors of it or its affiliates shall, and that it shall
cause its and its affiliates employees, agents and representatives (including
any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its
affiliates) not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, encourage
or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the making of any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) have any discussion with or provide any confidential
information or data to any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or
engage in any negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal, or knowingly
facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal,
(iii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal or (iv) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or
recommend, or execute or enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other
similar agreement or propose publicly or agree to do any of the foregoing
related to any Acquisition Proposal.

(b) PIC agrees that it will, and will cause its officers, directors and
representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations existing as of the date of this
Agreement with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal informing them that the Board of Directors no longer
seeks the making of any Acquisition Proposals.

(c) PIC agrees that it will use reasonable best efforts to promptly inform its
directors, officers, key employees, agents and representatives of the
obligations undertaken in this Section 6.9.

(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.9(a) of this Agreement, if any
Person after the date of this Agreement submits to PICs board of directors
an unsolicited, _bona_ _fide_ , written Acquisition Proposal, and PICs board
of directors reasonably determines in good faith, after receipt of advice from
outside legal counsel, that the failure to engage in discussions with such
Person concerning such Acquisition Proposal may cause PICs board of directors
to breach its fiduciary duties to PIC and its stockholders, and after
consultation with its financial advisor, then, in such case, (i) PIC may (A)
furnish information about its business to such Person under protection of an
appropriate confidentiality agreement containing customary limitations on the
use and disclosure of all non-public written or oral information furnished to
such Person, provided that PIC must contemporaneously furnish to IBKC all
such non-public information furnished to such Person, and (B) negotiate and
participate in discussions and negotiations with such Person; and (ii) if
PICs board of directors determines that such an Acquisition Proposal is a
Superior Proposal (defined below), PICs board of directors may (subject to
the provisions of this Section 6.9) (A) withdraw or adversely modify its
approval or recommendation of the Merger and recommend such Superior Proposal
or (B) terminate this Agreement, in each case, (i) at any time after five (5)
Business Days following IBKCc receipt of written notice (a "Notice of
Superior Proposal") advising IBKC that PICs board of directors has received
a Superior Proposal and enclosing a copy of the Acquisition Proposal,
identifying the Person submitting the Superior Proposal, specifying the
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, and (ii) subject to
IBKCs Right of First Refusal (defined below). In the event IBKC elects not to
exercise the Right of First Refusal, PIC shall provide IBKC with a final
written notice of acceptance before or simultaneous with accepting any
Superior Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means
any unsolicited, _bona_ _fide_ , written Acquisition Proposal for
consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, and otherwise on terms
which PICs board of directors determines, after consultation with its
financial advisor, are more favorable to PICs stockholders (in their
capacities as stockholders) from a financial point of view than the
Merger after giving effect to the provisions of Section 9.2 (or other revised
proposal submitted by IBKC). For the purposes of this Section 6.9(d), an
Acquisition Proposal shall be " _bona_ _fide_ " if the board of directors
of PIC reasonably determines that the Person submitting such Acquisition
Proposal is capable, from a financial, regulatory and other appropriate
perspectives, of consummating such Acquisition Proposal on the terms proposed.

(e) IBKC shall have the right ("Right of First Refusal") for five (5) Business
Days after receipt of Notice of Superior Proposal to make such adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable PIC to proceed with
the Merger on the basis of such adjusted terms. If IBKC fails to exercise such
Right of First Refusal within the time herein specified, PIC shall be at
liberty to accept the Superior Proposal, subject to the obligations of PIC
pursuant to Section 9.2 hereof.

substantially in the form of _Exhibit III_. PIC shall use its reasonable best
efforts to deliver to IBKC a Support Agreement executed by Mark Williamson.

the form of _Exhibit IV_.

6.15 IBKC Capital and Financing. To the extent necessary to obtain regulatory
approvals required to consummate the Merger, IBKC shall use its best efforts

twelve (12) months after the date of this Agreement; or

(h) By the Board of Directors of IBKC if the Board of Directors of PIC shall,
or shall have resolved to, withdraw, modify or change its recommendation to
PICs stockholders of this Agreement or the Merger, or recommend any
Acquisition Transaction other than the Merger; or

(i) By the Board of Directors of either Warrantor if the other Warrantor has
experienced, or is reasonably likely to experience, a Material Adverse Effect,
which is not remedied or cured within thirty (30) days after notice of
intention to terminate is given by the Warrantor invoking this Section 9.1(i),
which notice shall specify the nature of the matter or matters constituting
such Material Adverse Effect and which are the basis of such
intention; provided, however, that the right to terminate that is specified
in such notice of intention shall itself terminate unless notice of
termination is given by such Warrantor within fifteen (15) days following the
end of such remedial or curative period; or

(k) By the Board of Directors of PIC, pursuant to Section 6.9(d).

9.2 Effect of Termination.

(a) In the event of the termination and abandonment of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 9.1 of this Agreement, this Agreement shall become void and have no
effect and the parties hereto will be relieved of all obligations
and liabilities under this Agreement, except that: (i) the provisions of
Sections IX and X hereof shall survive any such termination and abandonment;
(ii) a termination pursuant to Section 9.1(b) of this Agreement shall not
relieve a breaching Warrantor from liability for any breach giving rise to
such termination and the provisions of Section 9.2(c) or (d), as applicable;
(iii) each Warrantor shall remain obligated under, and liable for any breach
of, any of the provisions of this Agreement that survive its termination.;
and (iv) in the event this Agreement is terminated because of a failure by
IBKC to comply with Section 6.15, IBKC shall remain liable for any breach of
Section 6.15. 

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated by IBKC pursuant to Section
9.1(b) hereof because of a willful breach of a representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement by PIC, or pursuant to Section 9.1(f) hereof if
the failure of the stockholders of PIC to approve this Agreement and the
Merger, occurs after the receipt by PIC of an Acquisition Proposal, or
pursuant to Section 9.1(h) hereof, or by PIC pursuant to Section 9.1(k)
hereof, and within twelve (12) months after the date of any such termination
PIC, without IBKCs prior written consent, accepts in a written agreement
an Acquisition Proposal, then PIC shall pay IBKC $6.4 million (the
"Termination Fee") not later than the fifth Business Day following the date
PIC accepts such Acquisition Proposal. Upon payment of the Termination Fee
pursuant to this Section 9.2(b), IBKC will not have any other rights or
claims against PIC or its Subsidiaries, or their respective officers and
directors, under this Agreement.

(c) In the event this Agreement is terminated as a result of IBKCs failure to
satisfy any of its representations, warranties or covenants set forth herein,
IBKC shall reimburse PIC for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses relating
to the Merger in an amount not to exceed $200,000, which amount shall not be
deemed an exclusive remedy or liquidated damages.

(d) In the event this Agreement is terminated as a result of PICs failure to
satisfy any of its representations, warranties or covenants set forth herein,
PIC shall reimburse IBKC for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses relating
to the Merger in an amount not to exceed $200,000, which amount shall not be
deemed an exclusive remedy or liquidated damages.



 

\- 24 - 9.3 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. The respective
representations, warranties, obligations, covenants and agreements of the
Warrantors shall not survive the Effective Date, except for those covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement which by their terms apply in whole
or in part after the Effective Date; provided, however, that no such
representations, warranties or covenants shall be deemed to be terminated or
extinguished so as to deprive any Warrantor (or any director, officer or
controlling Person thereof) of any defense in law or equity which otherwise
would be available against the claims of any Person, including, without
limitation, any stockholder or former stockholder of any Warrantor, the
aforesaid representations, warranties and covenants being material inducements
to consummation by the Warrantors of the transactions contemplated hereby.

SECTION X.

MISCELLANEOUS

Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

10.3 Entire Agreement. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this
Agreement, including the exhibits and schedules hereto, and the
Confidentiality Agreement contain the entire agreement among the parties
hereto with respect to the transactions contemplated hereunder
and thereunder, and such agreements supersede all prior arrangements or
understanding with respect thereto, written or oral. The terms and conditions
of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the
parties hereto and their respective successors. Nothing in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any party, other than the

IBKC) the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that such
modification shall not change the amount, kind, manner or basis in
which shares of PIC Common Stock will be exchanged for IBKC Common Stock or

result in adverse tax consequences to the stockholders of PIC, materially
delay consummation of the Merger or jeopardize the timely receipt of

\- 27 - EXHIBIT I

_AGREEMENT OF MERGER_

THIS AGREEMENT OF MERGER ("Agreement") is made as of  _
_, 2006, between IBERIABANK Corporation ("IBKC") and Pulaski Investment
Corporation ("PIC"), in connection with the Agreement and Plan of Merger,
dated as of August _ _, 2006 (the "Plan"), between IBERIABANK Acquisition
Corporation ("IBAC") and IBERIABANK Corporation on the one hand and PIC
on the other. Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have their
respective meanings set forth in the Plan.

ARTICLE 1: TERMS OF MERGER 

1.1 _Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, at the Effective
Date (defined herein), PIC shall be merged with and into IBAC (the "Merger"),
in accordance with, and with the effect provided in, the Louisiana Business
Corporation Law (the "BCL") and the Arkansas Business Corporation Act (the
"ABCA").

1.2 _Assumption of Rights and Liabilities_. At the Effective Date and
thereafter, all the rights and property, real, personal, and mixed, of
PIC, shall be deemed to be transferred to and vested in IBAC without further
act or deed; and the title to any real estate, or any interest therein, vested
in IBAC shall not revert or be in any way impaired by reason of the Merger.
All liabilities and obligations of PIC of every kind and description shall be
assumed by IBKC, and IBKC shall be bound thereby in the same manner and to the
same extent that PIC was so bound at the Effective Date.

ARTICLE 2: MANNER OF CONVERTING SHARES

2.1 _Conversion of PIC Common Stock_.

(a) Except for shares of PIC Common Stock as to which dissenters shares have
been perfected and not withdrawn or otherwise forfeited ("Dissenters
Shares") under the ABCA, and as otherwise provided herein and in the Plan, at
the Effective Date each outstanding share of PIC Common Stock will be
converted into the "Per Share Merger Consideration" which shall mean:

(i) .2274 shares of IBKC Common Stock (to the nearest ten-thousandth of a
share); plus

(ii) a number of shares of IBKC Common Stock equal to the quotient (rounded to
the nearest ten-thousandth of a share) obtained by dividing $13.323 by the
average of the daily average trading prices of the IBKC Common Stock on the
NASDAQ Global Market (or calculated by Bloomberg Screen AQR) on each of the
fifteen (15) trading days ending one (1) Business Day prior to the Effective
Date; plus

(iii) an amount of cash (without interest) determined by dividing $65.0
million by the number of shares of PIC Common Stock outstanding on the
Effective Date (rounded to the nearest whole cent). No payments or benefits to
officers of PIC or its Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger shall
constitute an excess parachute payment under Section 280G of the Code (or, if so, PIC may satisfy this condition by
reducing such total cash payment by an amount equal to the additional income
tax incurred by PIC and its Subsidiaries as a result of the disallowance of
the deduction applicable thereto).

(b) Shares of PIC Common Stock that are held by PIC and any PIC subsidiary
(other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity) shall not be considered to be
outstanding and shall be cancelled (and not converted) by virtue of the
Merger at the Effective Time and without any further action by any party.

(c) If before the Effective Date, IBKC should split or combine the IBKC
Common Stock, or pay a stock dividend in IBKC Common Stock, or otherwise
change the IBKC Common Stock into any other securities, or make any other
dividend or distribution in respect of the IBKC Common Stock (other
than normal cash dividends as the same may be adjusted from time to time in
accordance with or not in violation of this Agreement), then the Exchange
Ratio will be appropriately adjusted to reflect such split, combination,
dividend or other distribution or change.

(d) In lieu of issuing any fractional share of IBKC Common Stock, each holder
of PIC Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled thereto, after
aggregating into whole shares all fractional shares of IBKC Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled by virtue of the Merger, upon surrender of the
certificate(s) which represented PIC Common Stock, will receive cash (without
interest) equal to such fractional share multiplied by $58.60.

(e) No later than the Effective Date, IBKC shall deposit, or shall cause to
be deposited, with IBKCs transfer agent, or such other third party
experienced in the stock transfer business reasonably acceptable to PIC which
shall act as an exchange agent, for the benefit of the holders of PIC Common
Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.1 and the Plan,
certificates representing shares of IBKC Common Stock and the estimated amount
of cash to be paid to the holders of PIC Common Stock. After the Effective
Date, each holder of PIC Common Stock (other than Dissenters Shares), upon
surrender of such holders certificates in accordance herewith, will be
entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consolidation into which such
holders shares have been converted, less any applicable tax withholding.
Until then, each certificate for PIC Common Stock will represent the Per Share
Merger Consideration into which the shares of PIC Common Stock represented
thereby were converted, except that IBKC may refuse to pay any dividend or
other distribution payable to holders of any unsurrendered certificate for PIC
Common Stock (without any interest thereon) until surrender or if such
dividend or distribution has reverted in full ownership to IBKC under its
Articles of Incorporation. Whether or not a certificate for PIC Common Stock
is surrendered, after the Effective Date it will not represent any interest in
any person other than IBKC.

ARTICLE 3: EFFECTIVENESS

3.1 _Effectiveness_. Consummation of the Merger is conditioned upon the
approval of this Agreement by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System and necessary filings with the Louisiana Secretary of State and the
Arkansas Secretary of State, and the other conditions set forth in the Plan.
The Merger shall become effective on the date and at the time this Agreement
is filed with the Secretary of State of Louisiana and the Secretary of State
of Arkansas (the "Effective Date").



 

2 3.2 _Additional Actions_. If, after the Effective Date, IBAC shall believe any
act to be necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement,
PIC and its proper officers and directors shall be deemed to have granted to
IBKC an irrevocable power of attorney to do any such act, and the proper
officers and directors of IBKC are fully authorized in the name of PIC to
take any and all such action.

ARTICLE 4: MISCELLANEOUS

4.1 _Amendment_. This Agreement or any exhibit or schedule may be amended or
restated at any time by (i) the parties, by mutual agreement approved by
their Boards, except that the consideration to stockholders of PIC shall not
be amended after approval of the Plan by PICs stockholders or (ii) by the
parties chief executive officers or their designees to correct typographical
errors or to change erroneous references or cross references, or in any other
manner not material to the substance of the Merger; provided, however, that no
amendment shall be effective unless reduced to writing and executed by all
parties to this Agreement. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of or
noncompliance with any provision of this Agreement will not operate or be
construed as a continuing waiver or a waiver or any other or subsequent breach
or noncompliance hereunder. 

4.2 _Termination_. Prior to the Effective Date, this Agreement may be
terminated, and the Merger abandoned, as set forth in the Plan, and shall
terminate on any termination of the Plan.

4.3 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

4.4 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and interpreted in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Louisiana applicable to contracts
made and to be performed wholly within such State (except to the extent that
mandatory provisions of Federal law are applicable).
