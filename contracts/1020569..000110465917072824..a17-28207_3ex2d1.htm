1.3 _Other Definitional and Interpretive Matters_. (a) Unless otherwise
expressly provided herein, for purposes of this Agreement, the following rules
of interpretation shall apply:

 



 

(i) _Calculation of Time Period_. When calculating the period of time before
which, within which or following which any act is to be done or step taken
pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating
such period shall be excluded. If the last day of such period is a non-
Business Day, the period in question shall end on the next succeeding Business
Day.

 



 

(ii) _Currency_. All Dollar amounts contemplated by this Agreement, to the
extent applicable, shall be rounded down to the nearest penny.

 



 

(iii) _Annexes/Exhibits/Schedules_. The Annexes, Exhibits and Schedules to
this Agreement are hereby incorporated and made a part hereof and are an
integral part of this Agreement. As used in any Schedule, unless the context
would otherwise require, the term "material" and the concept of the "material"
nature of an effect upon the Company Group shall be measured relative to the
Company Group, taken as a whole. Any party may, at its option, include in the
Schedules items that are not material in order to avoid any misunderstanding,
and such inclusion, or any references to Dollar amounts, shall not be deemed
to be an acknowledgement or representation or warranty that such items are
material, to establish any standard of materiality or to define further the
meaning of such terms for purposes of this Agreement or otherwise. Any matter
set forth in any Section of any Schedule shall be deemed to be referred to and
incorporated in any other Section to which it is specifically referenced or
cross-referenced, and also in all other Sections of the Schedules to which
such matters application or relevance is reasonably apparent on the face of
such disclosure. Reference to any Contract set forth in the Schedules includes
all purchase orders and schedules thereto from time to time through the date
of this Agreement. Schedule, Section or Subsection references used in any
Annex, Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement are for convenience of reference
only and shall to no extent and in no event have the effect of amending or
changing the express description of the Sections as set forth in this
Agreement. Nothing contained in any Schedule should be construed as an
admission of Liability or responsibility of any party to any third party in
connection with any pending or threatened Legal Proceeding or otherwise.
Except as and to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement, in no event
shall the listing or disclosure of any information or document in any Schedule
or in the documents referred to or incorporated by reference in any such
Schedule

 



      
 

 



 

constitute or be deemed to imply any representation, warranty, undertaking,
covenant or other obligation of the Sellers or the Company not expressly set
out in this Agreement or shall such disclosure be construed as extending the
scope of any representation or warranty, undertaking, covenant or obligation
set out in this Agreement. Any capitalized terms used in any Annex, Schedule
or Exhibit but not otherwise defined therein shall be defined as set forth in
this Agreement.

 



 

(iv) _Gender and Number_. Any reference in this Agreement to gender shall
include all genders, and words imparting the singular number only shall
include the plural and vice versa.

 



 

(v) _Headings_. The provision of a Table of Contents, the division of this
Agreement into Articles, Sections and other subdivisions and the insertion of
headings are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect or be
utilized in construing or interpreting this Agreement. All references in this
Agreement to any "Article," "Section" or other subsection are to the
corresponding Article, Section or other subsection of this Agreement, unless
otherwise specified.

 



 

(vi) _Herein_. The words such as "herein," "hereinafter," "hereof," and
"hereunder" refer to this Agreement as a whole and not merely to a subdivision
in which such words appear unless the context otherwise requires.

 



 

(vii) _Including_. The word "including" or any variation thereof means
"including, without limitation" and shall not be construed to limit any
general statement that it follows to the specific or similar items or matters
immediately following it.

 



 

(b) _Joint Participation_. The parties hereto have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and, in the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as jointly drafted by the parties hereto and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any provision of this Agreement.

conditions requiring the removal of any mortgage or other monetary lien, and
(ii) any mortgage and other monetary lien(s) which may encumber the leasehold
estate shall be removed upon such closing of the transaction contemplated by

2.6 _Post-Closing Determination of Adjustment Amounts_.

 



 

(a) From and after the receipt by Sellers Representative of the Closing
Statement until the determination of the Final Closing Statement pursuant to
this _Section 2.6_, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including
the Sterling Company and the Company Group) to, permit the Sellers
Representative and its Representatives reasonable access to the personnel and
accountants of the Company Group involved in the preparation of the Closing
Statement, and provide access (with the right to make copies), during normal
business hours upon reasonable advance notice, to the books, records,
contracts, other documents (including auditors work papers) and properties of
the Company Group that are or would reasonably be expected to be relevant to
the calculations set forth in the Closing Statement or to the matters in set
forth in the Dispute Notice.

 



 

(b) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing, Buyer shall prepare and deliver
to Sellers Representative its good faith calculation of (i) the Purchase Price
(the " _Proposed Final Purchase Price_ "), (ii) the Purchase Price Elements
and (iii) (x) if the Proposed Final Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated
Purchase Price, the amount of such excess (the " _Positive Adjustment_

 



      
 

 



 

 _Amount_ ") or (y) if the Proposed Final Purchase Price is less than the
Estimated Purchase Price, the amount of such shortage (the " _Negative
Adjustment Amount_ "), in each case with reasonable supporting detail as to
each of the calculations. The calculations described under the foregoing
clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) are collectively referred to herein as the "
_Closing Statement_." Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
parties acknowledge and agree that the Final Closing Statement and the
component items and calculations therein, including the Purchase Price
Elements, shall be prepared in accordance with the terms (including the
definitions) of this Agreement, including the Accounting Principles. If Buyer
fails to timely deliver the Closing Statement within such sixty (60) day
period, then, at the election of the Sellers Representative in its sole
discretion either (x) the Estimated Closing Statement delivered by the Company
to Buyer pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_ shall be deemed to be the Final Closing
Statement for all purposes herein or (y) the Sellers Representative shall
retain (at the sole cost and expense of Buyer) a nationally recognized
independent accounting firm to provide an audit of the Companys and the
Sterling Companys books, determine the calculation of, and prepare, the
Closing Statement consistent with the provisions of this _Section 2.6_, the
determination of such accounting firm being conclusive, final and binding on
the parties hereto (absent manifest error); _provided_ , _however_ , that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers Representative reserves any and all
other rights granted to it in this Agreement. Buyer shall promptly reimburse
the Sellers Representative upon its request for all fees, costs and expenses
incurred by the Sellers Representative in connection with the foregoing clause
(y). The Closing Statement delivered to Sellers Representative in accordance
with the first sentence of this _Section 2.6(b)_ shall be conclusive, final
and binding on all parties (absent manifest error) unless the Sellers
Representative gives Buyer written notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") of any
disputes or objections thereto (collectively, the " _Disputed Items_ ") with
reasonable supporting detail as to such Disputed Items, within sixty (60) days
after receipt of the Closing Statement (such period, the " _Review Period_ ").
In the event the Sellers Representative fails to give Buyer a Dispute Notice
prior to the expiration of the Review Period or otherwise earlier notifies
Buyer in writing that the Sellers Representative has no disputes or objections
to the Closing Statement, the Closing Statement shall be conclusive, final and
binding on all parties and the Adjustment Escrow Account shall be distributed,
and payments (if any) shall be made by Buyer, in accordance with _Section
2.6(f)_.

 



 

(c) Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall, for a period of thirty (30)
days (or such longer period as Buyer and the Sellers Representative may agree
in writing) following delivery of a Dispute Notice to Buyer (the " _Resolution
Period_ "), attempt in good faith to resolve their differences (all such
discussions and communications related thereto shall (unless otherwise agreed
by Buyer and the Sellers Representative in writing) be governed by Rule 408 of
the Federal Rules of Evidence and any applicable similar state rule), and any
such resolution in writing by them as to any Disputed Items shall be
conclusive, final and binding on all parties absent manifest error. Any
Disputed Items agreed to by Buyer and the Sellers Representative in writing,
together with any items or calculations set forth in the Closing Statement not
disputed or objected to by the Sellers Representative in the Dispute Notice,
are collectively referred to herein as the " _Resolved Matters_." Any Resolved
Matters shall be conclusive, final and binding on all parties absent manifest
error, except to the extent such component could be affected by other
components of the calculations set forth in the Closing Statement that are the
subject of a Dispute Notice. If at the end of the Resolution Period, Buyer and
the Sellers Representative have been unable to resolve any differences that
they may have with respect to the matters specified in the Dispute Notice,
either of Buyer or the Sellers Representative may, upon written notice to the

 



      
 

 



 

other, refer all matters that remain in dispute with respect to the Dispute
Notice (the " _Unresolved Matters_ ") for resolution to the Designated Firm.
If one or more Unresolved Matters are submitted to the Designated Firm for
resolution, Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall enter into a customary
engagement letter with, and to the extent necessary, each party to this
Agreement will waive and, to the extent required, cause its controlled
Affiliates to waive any conflicts with, the Designated Firm at the time such
dispute is submitted to the Designated Firm and shall cooperate with the
Designated Firm in connection with its determination pursuant to this _Section
2.6_. Within ten (10) days after the Designated Firm has been retained, Buyer
and the Sellers Representative each shall furnish, at its own expense, to the
Designated Firm and substantially simultaneously to the other a written
statement of its position with respect to each Unresolved Matter. Within five
(5) Business Days after the expiration of such ten (10) day period, Buyer and
the Sellers Representative may deliver to the Designated Firm its response to
the others position on each Unresolved Matter; _provided_ , that it delivers
a copy thereof substantially simultaneously to the other. With each
submission, Buyer and the Sellers Representative may also furnish to the
Designated Firm such other information and documents as it deems relevant or
such information and documents as may be requested by the Designated Firm;
_provided_ , that it delivers a copy thereof substantially simultaneously to
the other. The Designated Firm may, at its discretion, conduct one or more
conferences (whether in person or by teleconference) concerning the
disagreement and Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall have the right to
present additional documents, materials and other information and to have
present its Representatives at such conferences.

 



 

(d) The Designated Firm shall be directed to promptly, and in any event within
thirty (30) days after its appointment pursuant to _Section 2.6(c)_, acting
as an expert in accounting and not as a valuation expert, render its decision
on the Unresolved Matters (and not on any other matter or calculation set
forth in the Closing Statement) in a manner consistent with the terms
(including the definitions) of this Agreement, including the Accounting
Principles. The Designated Firms determination as to each Unresolved Matter
shall be set forth in a written statement delivered to Buyer and the Sellers
Representative, which shall include the Designated Firms (i) determination as
to the calculation of each of the Unresolved Matters and (ii) the
corresponding corrective calculations set forth in the Closing Statement that
are derived from its determination as to the calculations of the Unresolved
Matters, all of which shall be conclusive, final and binding on all parties
(absent manifest error). In resolving any Unresolved Matter, the Designated
Firm may not assign a value to such item greater than the greatest value for
such item claimed by Buyer in the Closing Statement or by the Sellers
Representative in the Dispute Notice or less than the lowest value for such
item claimed by Buyer in the Closing Statement or by the Sellers
Representative in the Dispute Notice. The Designated Firm shall also determine
the proportion of its fees and expenses to be paid by Buyer and the Sellers
Representative based on the degree (as determined in good faith by the
Designated Firm) to which the Designated Firm has accepted the positions of
Buyer and the Sellers Representative. The Designated Firms fees and expenses
payable by Buyer shall be paid to the Designated Firm directly by Buyer, and
the Designated Firms fees and expenses payable by the Sellers Representative
(if any) shall only be paid from the funds in the Sellers Representative
Account pursuant to _Section 2.10_. To the extent the funds then held in the
Sellers Representative Account are insufficient to cover all of the Designated
Firms fees and expenses payable by the Sellers Representative, Sellers shall
pay any such remaining fees and expenses.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, subject to _Section 2.6(b)_, the " _Final
Closing Statement_ " shall be (i) in the event that no Dispute Notice is
delivered by the Sellers Representative to Buyer prior to the expiration of
the Review Period, the Closing Statement delivered by Buyer to the Sellers
Representative pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)_, (ii) in the event that a Dispute
Notice is delivered by the Sellers Representative to Buyer prior to the
expiration of the Review Period, the Closing Statement delivered by Buyer to
the Sellers Representative pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)_, as adjusted pursuant
to the agreement of Buyer and the Sellers Representative in writing, (iii) in
the event that a Dispute Notice is delivered by the Sellers Representative to
Buyer prior to the expiration of the Review Period and Buyer and the Sellers
Representative are unable to agree on all matters set forth in such Dispute
Notice, the Closing Statement delivered by Buyer to the Sellers Representative
pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)_, as adjusted by the Designated Firm to be
consistent with (A) the Resolved Matters and (B) the Designated Firms
determination as to the calculation of the Unresolved Matters in accordance
with _Sections 2.6(c)_ and _2.6(d)_ , or (iv) in the event that Buyer fails
to timely deliver the Closing Statement in accordance with _Section 2.6(b)_,
the Estimated Closing Statement shall be deemed to be the Final Closing
Statement.

 



 

(f) _Payment of the Adjustment Amounts_.

 



 

(i) In the event that there is a Positive Adjustment Amount, within two (2)
Business Days after the final determination of the Final Closing Statement,
Buyer shall deposit or cause to be deposited in immediately available funds
with the Escrow Agent in the Adjustment Escrow Account an amount in cash equal
to the Positive Adjustment Amount and promptly thereafter, Buyer and the
Sellers Representative shall provide a joint written instruction to the Escrow
Agent to deliver promptly from the Adjustment Escrow Account by wire transfer
of immediately available funds in accordance with this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement all proceeds in the Adjustment Escrow Account to the IO
Parent and Sterling Parent, in each case as set forth in _Section
2.6(f)(iv)_.

 



 

(ii) If the calculation of Purchase Price set forth on the Final Closing
Statement (the " _Final Purchase Price_ ") equals the Estimated Purchase
Price, then within two (2) Business Days after the final determination of the
Final Closing Statement, Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall provide a
joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to deliver promptly from the
Adjustment Escrow Account by wire transfer of immediately available funds in
accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement all proceeds in the
Adjustment Escrow Account to the IO Parent and Sterling Parent, in each case
as set forth in _Section 2.6(f)(iv)_.

 



 

(iii) In the event that there is a Negative Adjustment Amount, then within two
(2) Business Days after the final determination of the Final Closing
Statement, Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall provide a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent to deliver promptly from the Adjustment Escrow
Account by wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (A) the lesser of (1) the full amount
of the Negative Adjustment Amount and (2) the funds then held in the
Adjustment Escrow Account, to Buyer (or its designee), and (B) the funds
remaining (if any) in the Adjustment Escrow Account, after giving effect to
clause (A), to the IO Parent and Sterling Parent as set forth in _Section
2.6(f)(iv)_. In the event that the full amount

 



       
 

 



 

by which the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds the Final Purchase Price is
greater than the funds then held in the Adjustment Escrow Account, Buyer shall
have no recourse (other than as set forth in the foregoing sentence) against
any of the Sellers Representative or any of the Sellers or any other Person.

 



 

(iv) Subject to _Section 2.10(b)_ , all distributions of funds from the
Adjustment Escrow Account to the IO Parent and Sterling Parent pursuant to and

adjustment to the Purchase Price for all foreign, federal, state and local
income Tax purposes, to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 



 

(g) The parties acknowledge and agree that the Sellers Representative and any
of its Affiliates and Buyer and any of its Affiliates may engage Deloitte
and/or PricewaterhouseCoopers and its Affiliates to advise or represent them
in connection with the determination of any Positive Adjustment Amount or
Negative Adjustment Amount and the matters addressed by this _Section 2.6_.
Each party shall (and, to the extent necessary, shall cause its controlled
Affiliates to) enter into such waivers, indemnities and other agreements as
Deloitte and/or PricewaterhouseCoopers shall reasonably require to permit
PricewaterhouseCoopers and/or Deloitte to provide such advice or
representation.

 



 

2.7 _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Company, Buyer and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any payment payable pursuant to this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law; _provided_ , that, the parties
agree that no such deduction or withholding from any amounts shall be required
under current Law so long as Sellers provide properly executed and completed
IRS Forms W-9 on or prior to the Closing Date and comply with _Section 6.12_ ;
_provided_ , _further_ , that, if it is determined that any such deduction or
withholding would be required as a result of a change in Law, prior to making
any such deduction or withholding, the applicable withholding entity shall
provide notice to the recipient of the amounts subject to withholding and a
reasonable opportunity for such recipient to provide forms or other evidence
that would exempt such amounts from withholding Tax. The withheld amounts
shall be paid over to the appropriate Taxing authority and, to the extent
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing authority, the
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

 



 

2.8 _Sellers Representative; Power of Attorney_. At the Closing, and without
further act of the Company, the Sterling Company or any Seller, the Sellers
Representative shall be appointed as agent and attorney-in-fact for each
Seller, for and on behalf of each such Seller, to give and receive notices and
communications and to take any and all action on behalf each such Seller
pursuant to this Agreement, including in connection with the consummation of
the Sale, the determination whether the conditions to Closing set forth in
_Article 7_ have been satisfied and waiving any such condition, the Adjustment
Escrow Account, the Sellers Representative Account, the post-Closing
determination of a Positive Adjustment Amount or a Negative Adjustment Amount
in connection with this Agreement and releases (if any) to the IO Parent and

 



      
 

 



 

Sterling Parent from the Adjustment Escrow Account and the Sellers
Representative Account. The Person acting as Sellers Representative may be
changed from time to time by approval of the holders of a majority (directly
or indirectly) of the Company Units that were issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Closing upon not less than ten (10) Business Days
prior written notice to Buyer and the current Sellers Representative in
accordance with _Section 10.6_. Any vacancy in the position of Sellers
Representative may be filled by approval of the holders of a majority of the
Company Units that were issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Closing. No bond shall be required of the Sellers Representative, and the
Sellers Representative shall not receive compensation for its services;
_provided_ , that the Sellers Representative shall be entitled to
reimbursements of expenses pursuant to _Section 2.10_. Subject to _Section

to or from each of the Sellers.

 



 

2.9 _Actions of the Sellers Representative_. A decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Sellers Representative (acting in its capacity as the
Sellers Representative) shall constitute a decision of all the Sellers and
shall be conclusive, binding and final upon each such Seller, and Buyer may
rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers
Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each such
Seller. Each of Buyer and its Affiliates and Representatives are hereby
relieved from any Liability to any Person for any acts done by Buyer in
accordance with any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers
Representative.

 



 

2.10 _Sellers Representative Expenses Consideration_.

 



 

(a) All liabilities, losses, damages, claims, fees, costs, expenses, interest,
awards, judgments or penalties incurred by the Sellers Representative pursuant
to this Agreement, including any documented out-of-pocket fees, costs and
expenses of the Designated Firm pursuant to _Section 2.6(d)_ , or of any agent
or advisor utilized by the Sellers Representative in fulfilling its duties
hereunder or as agent for the Sellers shall be paid from the Sellers
Representative Account.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any
payments are due to the Sellers pursuant to _Section 2.6(f)_ as a result of
the release of any funds from the Adjustment Escrow Account, the Sellers
Representative shall have the option to direct any or all of such payments to
the Sellers Representative Account for the purpose of paying the amounts
contemplated by clause (a) of this _Section 2.10_ prior to the release of any
such funds to any Seller.

 



 

(c) Only after giving full effect to clause (a) of this _Section 2.10_ , the
funds remaining in the Sellers Representative Account (if any) shall be
promptly distributed to each Seller in an amount equal to such Sellers Pro
Rata Portion of such funds remaining in the Sellers Representative Account.

 



 

2.11 _Limitation on Liability of the Sellers Representative_.

 



 

(a) None of the Sellers Representative or any of its Affiliates or its or
their respective Representatives shall be liable for and/or incur any
liabilities, losses, damages, claims,

 



      
 

 



 

costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments or penalties to any of the
Sellers with respect to, any action taken, omitted to be taken or suffered by
such Person, including whether or not in reliance upon any notice, direction,
instruction, consent, statement or other documents believed by such Person to
be genuinely and duly authorized, nor to any Person for any other action or
inaction as or by the Sellers Representative, except to the extent directly
and primarily resulting from its own intentional and willful breach as may be
determined by a final, non-appealable order of a court of competent
jurisdiction. The Sellers Representative may, in all questions arising under
this Agreement, or any other agreement (including the Escrow Agreement) in
connection with this Agreement, rely on the advice of counsel, accountants and
other advisors, and the Sellers Representative shall not be liable to any
Seller for any action taken or omitted or suffered in good faith by the
Sellers Representative based on such advice. The Sellers Representative is
authorized by the Sellers to incur documented out-of-pocket fees, costs and
expenses on behalf of IO Parent and Sterling Parent in acting hereunder,
including expenses of counsel, accountants and other advisors. If the Sellers
Representative in connection with acting in such capacity shall incur any
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments or penalties in connection with acting as such that is not
reimbursed from the Adjustment Escrow Account or the Sellers Representative
Account, each Seller will, on the written request of the Sellers
Representative, reimburse the Sellers Representative for its Pro Rata Portion
of such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest,
awards, judgments or penalties. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Sellers Representative is authorized to deduct (or cause to be
deducted) from any payment or release due to any of the Sellers from the
Adjustment Escrow Account or the Sellers Representative Account, the amount of
such reimbursement. The Sellers Representative is acting solely on behalf of,
and as agent for, the Sellers and not in its personal capacity, and in no
event shall the Sellers Representative, any of its Affiliates or any of its or
its Affiliates former, current or future equityholders, controlling persons,
members, managers, limited or general partners or Representatives, or their
respective successors, predecessors or assigns (or any successors,
predecessors or assigns of the foregoing), be personally liable to any of the
Sellers hereunder, other than, solely in the case of the Sellers
Representative, to the extent directly and primarily resulting from its
intentional and willful breach as may be determined by a final, non-appealable
order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

 



 

(b) Each Seller agrees to indemnify the Sellers Representative, its Affiliates
and its and its Affiliates former, current and future equityholders,
controlling persons, members, managers, limited or general partners and
Representatives and their respective successors, predecessors or assigns (and
any successors, predecessors or assigns of the foregoing) (the " _Sellers
Representative Indemnified Persons_ ") for such Sellers Pro Rata Portion of
any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest,
awards, judgments and penalties (including the reasonable fees and expenses of
any legal counsel retained by the Sellers Representative) or disbursements of
any kind or nature whatsoever which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by
or asserted against any of the Sellers Representative Indemnified Persons in
any way relating to, or arising out of, or in connection with the acceptance
or administration of the Sellers Representatives duties hereunder or under
the Escrow Agreement or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or
therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the enforcement
of any of the terms hereof or thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Seller
shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they directly and
primarily result from the Sellers Representatives intentional and willful
breach as

 



      
 

 



 

may be determined by a final, non-appealable order of a court of competent
jurisdiction. The Sellers Representative shall be fully justified in refusing
to take or continuing to take any action hereunder unless it and each of the
other Sellers Representative Indemnified Persons shall first be fully
indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by the Sellers (based on their
respective Pro Rata Portions) against any liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties that may be
incurred by such Person by reason of the Sellers Representative taking or
continuing to take any such action.

 



 

(c) All obligations (but, for the avoidance of doubt, none of the rights) of
the Sellers Representative under this Agreement shall terminate upon the final
distribution of all of the funds in the Adjustment Escrow Account pursuant to
_Section 2.6(f)_ and the Escrow Agreement and the Sellers Representative
Account pursuant to _Section 2.10_.

 



 

2.12 _Other Purchase Price Adjustments_. Certain post-Closing Purchase Price
adjustments are set forth on _Schedule 8_.

Company Subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in

Subsidiary. Other than as contemplated in the Organizational Documents of each

any of the Company Subsidiaries.

and its Representatives, to have such access to the properties, business and

reasonably requests upon reasonable advance written notice in connection with
Buyers efforts to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Any such access and examination shall be conducted during regular business
hours and under reasonable circumstances and shall be subject to restrictions

cause any Company Subsidiary to limit, disclosure of any information to
certain Persons designated, at the request of the Sellers Representative, as a
"clean team" by Buyer (which Persons must be reasonably acceptable to the

herein, during the Interim Period, (x) without the prior written consent of
the Sellers Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Representatives
and Affiliates not to, contact any suppliers, customers, independent
contractors, landlords, lessors, banks, in each case, of any member of the
Company Group or any other Person with whom any member of the Company Group
have or have had a business relationship, other than in the ordinary course of
business of Buyer or any of its Affiliates with respect to matters not
involving the Sellers or the Company Group, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ , that the Company and the Sellers shall have
the right to have one or more their respective Representatives present during
any such contact in the event that it consents to such contact, and (y) Buyer

acknowledges that it may not rely on the accuracy or completeness of any such
information, in each case other than as expressly set forth in the
representations and warranties made by the Sellers or the Company contained in
_Article 3_ or _Article 4_; provided that no investigation pursuant to this
_Section 6.2_ by Buyer or its Representatives shall be deemed to modify any
of the representations and warranties made by the

 



      
 

 



 

Company or the Sellers contained in _Article 3_ or _Article 4_. Any
information obtained shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

6.3 _Confidentiality Agreement_. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the
information provided to it in connection with this Agreement (including

Representatives, for any competitive or any other purposes unrelated to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement prior to the
Closing, (ii) is subject to the terms of the confidentiality agreement between
the Company and Iron Mountain Information Management, LLC, dated as of
November 18, 2016 (as amended, restated, supplemented or modified from time to
time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the terms of which are
incorporated herein by reference, and (iii) to the extent it relates to IO
International or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
businesses, properties or operations, including their respective customer
Contracts, will not be used by Buyer, its Affiliates or Representatives, for
any competitive or any other purposes unrelated to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement prior to, at or after the Closing.
Without prejudice to clause (iii) above, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
survive any termination of this Agreement but shall terminate at the Closing.

 



 

6.4 _Consents_. Subject to _Section 10.12_, the Company shall use (and the
Company shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to use) commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all consents and approvals set forth on _Schedule 4.3(a)_ ;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, in connection therewith, (a) no Person shall be
obligated to pay any (i) fees, costs or expenses in connection therewith
(other than immaterial administrative or legal costs and expenses) or (ii)
consideration to any third party from whom any such consent or approval is
requested under any Contract. In addition, the consent of Buyer shall be
required for any amendment or modification to any Contract for the purposes of
obtaining any such consent or approval. Each of the parties acknowledges and
agrees that except for the consents set forth on _Schedule 6.4_ (the "
_Required Consents_ "), which Required Consents shall be, in accordance with
_Section 7.1(f)_, a condition to Buyers obligations hereunder, obtaining any
such consent or approval shall not be a condition to Closing.

 



 

6.5 _Further Assurances_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of the Company
and the Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other, agrees to use its
respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action,
and to do, or cause to be done as promptly as practicable, all things
necessary, proper and advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective as promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the satisfaction, but not waiver of the closing
conditions set forth in _Article 7_). Subject to reasonably appropriate
confidentiality protections, each of the Company and the Sellers, on the one
hand, and Buyer, on the other, shall furnish to the other such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as such other party may reasonably
request in connection with the foregoing.

 



 

(b) Each of the Company and the Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the
other, shall cooperate with one another and use their reasonable best efforts

necessary documentation to effect promptly all necessary filings with any
Governmental Body and (ii) obtain all consents, waivers and approvals of any
Governmental Body necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In addition, each of the Company and the Sellers shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer to obtain any
consents, waivers and approvals necessary to facilitate Buyers post-Closing
restructuring as related solely to its real estate investment trust structure;
_provided_ , that (i) any costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
foregoing shall be borne by Buyer, (ii) neither the Company nor the Sellers
shall be required to take any action that may have an adverse impact on the
Company, the Sellers or any of their Affiliates, or that may be unduly
burdensome to the Sellers or their personnel, as reasonably determined by the
Sellers, and (iii) the foregoing obligation to cooperate shall not affect any
of the Sellers or Buyers other obligations or rights under this Agreement or
Ancillary Agreements. Each of the Company and the Sellers, on the one hand,
and Buyer, on the other, shall (1) allow the other party to review in advance
and to the extent practicable, consult with one another on and consider in
good faith the views of the other with respect to any written communication or
submission to any Governmental Body relating to any inquiry, investigation or
proceeding involving the transaction/information relating to that party that
is to be submitted to any Governmental Body in connection with any inquiry,
investigation or proceeding relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (2) provide to the other copies of all correspondence between it
(or its Representatives) and any Governmental Body relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of the matters described in
this _Section 6.5_ on an "outside counsel" basis sufficient to complete such
filings and (3) promptly inform the other of any oral communication with, and
provide copies of written communications with, any Governmental Body regarding
any such filings or any such transaction. Neither the Company or the Sellers,
on the one hand, nor Buyer, on the other, shall independently participate in
any meeting or conference call with any Governmental Body in respect of any
such filings, investigation, or other inquiry without giving the other prior
notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Body,
the opportunity to attend or participate. The parties may, as they deem
advisable, designate any competitively sensitive materials provided to the
other under this _Section 6.5(b)_ or any other Section of this Agreement as
"outside counsel only." Such materials and the information contained therein
shall be given only to outside counsel of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the
recipient without the advance written consent of the party providing such
materials.

 



 

(c) From the date of this Agreement through the date the consents required
pursuant to _Section 6.5(b)_ are obtained, neither Buyer nor its Affiliates
shall take any action that could reasonably be expected to hinder or delay, as
applicable, the obtaining of the consents required pursuant to _Section
6.5(b)_.

 



 

6.6 _D andO Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall cause (i) the Organizational
Documents of the Sterling Company and each member of the Company Group to
contain provisions no less favorable to the individuals who at or prior to the
Closing were officers, directors or trustees of the Sterling Company or any
member of the Company Group and any Person who at or prior to the Closing was
a member of the Sterling Company or the Company (collectively, the " _D andO
Indemnitees_") with respect to advancement of expenses, indemnification

 



      
 

 



 

and exculpation from liabilities than are set forth on _Schedule 6.6(a)_ , and
(ii) any indemnification agreements that such DandO Indemnitees may have with
the Sterling Company or the Company Group to survive the Closing without any
amendment or modification thereto that is adverse to any DandO Indemnitee, in
each case through the sixth anniversary of the Closing (such period, the "
_Tail Period_ "), and, in the event that any Legal Proceeding is pending or
asserted or any claim made during the Tail Period, until the final disposition
of such proceeding or claim. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall, and
Buyer shall cause the Sterling Company and the Company Group to, advance such
expenses, indemnify and exculpate the DandO Indemnitees in accordance with the
provisions of the Organizational Documents of the Sterling Company or of each
member of the Company Group, as applicable, and any and all such
indemnification agreements as if the Closing had not occurred.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall and shall cause the Company Group
to, provide or maintain in effect for the Tail Period, through the purchase of
"run-off" coverage or otherwise, directors and officers and corporate
liability insurance covering those individuals who are covered by the
directors and officers and corporate liability insurance policy or policies
provided for trustees, directors and officers of the Sterling Company and the
Company Group as of the date hereof (the " _Existing Policy_ ") on terms
comparable in all respects to the Existing Policy and such coverage shall
contain minimum aggregate limits of liability for directors and officers and
corporate liability insurance coverage for trustees, directors and officers of
the Sterling Company and the Company Group with the amount of coverage at
least equal to that of the Existing Policy and deductibles no larger than the
Existing Policy; provided, however, that if such "run-off" or other coverage
is not available at a cost not greater than two hundred percent (200%) of the
annual premiums paid as of the date hereof under the Existing Policies (the "
_Insurance Cap_ "), then Buyer shall be required to obtain as much coverage as
is possible under substantially similar policies for such annual premiums as
do not exceed the Insurance Cap. For the avoidance of doubt, the premium for
any policies purchased pursuant to this _Section 6.6(b)_ shall be paid for by
Buyer.

 



 

(c) In the event that the Sterling Company or any member of the Company Group
or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates,
restructures, recapitalizes, merges with or into any other Person or otherwise
reorganizes and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation, restructuring, recapitalization, merger or other
restructuring; or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made by Buyer and the Company, as applicable, so that the
successors and assigns of the Sterling Company and the Company Group, as
applicable, shall assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in this
_Section 6.6_.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.6_: (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each DandO Indemnitee, his or her heirs
and his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have by Contract or otherwise.

 



 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Sterling Company, the Company Group or any

 



      
 

 



 

of their respective trustees, directors or officers, it being understood and
agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section 6.6_ is not
prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 



 

6.7 _Preservation of Records_. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall, and
shall cause the Sterling Company and the Company Group to, preserve and keep
the records held by them relating to the respective businesses of the Sterling
Company and the Company Group for a period of seven (7) years from the Closing
Date (or longer if required by applicable Law or Contract) and shall make such
records (or copies) and reasonably appropriate personnel available, at
reasonable times and upon reasonable advance notice, to the Sellers
Representative (and its Affiliates and Representatives), at the expense of the
Sellers Representative, as may be reasonably required by such Person in
connection with any insurance claims by, Legal Proceedings or Tax audits
against, governmental investigations of, compliance with Law by, or the
preparation of financial statements of, the Sellers Representative, the
Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates or otherwise in connection with
any other matter relating to or resulting from this Agreement; _provided_ ,
that any such access or copying shall be done in such a manner not to
unreasonably interfere with the normal conduct of Buyers or the Company
Groups business.

 



 

6.8 _Publicity_. Neither the Sellers or the Company, on the one hand, nor
Buyer, on the other hand, shall issue any press release or public announcement
or public comment concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby without obtaining the prior written approval of Buyer and the Sellers
Representative, respectively (which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), unless and only to the extent, in the
judgment of such Person upon the advice of its counsel, disclosure is required
by applicable Law (including the periodic reporting requirements under the
Exchange Act) or under the rules of any securities exchange on which the
securities of such Person are listed (including disclosure as may be required
in connection with any Buyer financing); _provided_ , that, to the extent such
disclosure is so required by applicable Law or the rules of any such
securities exchange, the party intending to make such release, announcement or
comment shall use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with
applicable Law to consult with the other parties with respect to the text
thereof in advance of such release, announcement or comment.

 



 

6.9 _Employment and Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) Buyer covenants to, for a period of one (1) year following the Closing
Date, provide to each Business Employee who remains employed with the Company
Group immediately prior to the Closing (collectively, the " _Continuing
Employees_ ") (i) annual base salary or base wages, and target annual cash
bonus opportunities, in each case, that are no less favorable than such annual
base salary or base wages, and target annual cash bonus opportunities provided
to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) severance
compensation and benefits to any Continuing Employee during the one (1) year
period following the Closing Date at levels that are no less favorable than
the levels of such severance compensation and benefits set forth on _Schedule
6.9(a)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such Continuing Employee is
entitled to severance benefits under an individual severance, employment or
similar agreement, that are greater than the severance benefits provided in
_Schedule 6.9(a)_ , the terms of such agreement and not this _Section 6.9(a)_
shall govern; and (iii)

 



      
 

 



 

employee benefits (other than equity-based compensation) that, taken as a
whole, are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those provided to
Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing.

 



 

(b) For purposes of eligibility, vesting and level of benefits (but not for
purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan) under the
benefit and compensation plans, programs, agreements and arrangements of
Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates in
which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate following the Closing
(the " _Buyer Plans_ "), Buyer shall cause to be credited each Continuing
Employee with his or her years of service with the Company or its Affiliates
and Subsidiaries and any predecessor or other entities, to the same extent as
such Continuing Employee was entitled immediately prior to the Closing to
credit for such service; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such service shall
be credited to the extent that it would result in a duplication of benefits
with respect to the same period of service. In addition, Buyer will cause (i)
each Continuing Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without
any waiting time, in any and all Buyer Plans, (ii) for purposes of each Buyer
Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any
Continuing Employee, all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-
work requirements of such Buyer Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee
and his or her covered dependents, to the extent such conditions were
inapplicable or waived under any comparable Benefit Plans in which such
Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing, and (iii)
for the plan year in which the Closing occurs, the crediting of each
Continuing Employee with any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket
expenses paid prior to the Closing in satisfying any applicable copayments,
deductibles or out-of-pocket requirements under any Buyer Plan.

 



 

(c) In the event that Buyer takes action which causes the termination of, or
cessation of participation by Continuing Employees in, an Insperity Benefit
Plan intended to qualify under _Section 401(a)_ of the Code, without limiting
_Section 6.9(a)_, Buyer shall cover (or cause to be covered) each Continuing
Employee under one or more defined contribution plans and trusts which shall
qualify under _Section 401(a)_ of the Code (the " _Buyer DC Plan_ "). As soon
as practicable following such cessation of participation, subject to
applicable Law (and in accordance with the terms of the Buyer DC Plan),
Continuing Employees shall be eligible to effect a "direct rollover" (as
described in _Section 401(a)(31)_ of the Code) of their account balances
(including participant loans) under the applicable Insperity Benefit Plans to
a Buyer DC Plan in the form of cash and participant loan notes. Sellers and
Buyer shall take all actions necessary to permit such rollovers as soon as
practicable after such cessation of participation.

 



 

(d) Buyer shall honor all accrued but unused paid time-off, vacation, sick
days, and "floating holidays" (collectively, " _Paid Time-Off_ ") for each
Continuing Employee as of the Closing Date to the same extent as the
applicable Paid Time-Off policy in effect immediately prior to the Closing.

 



 

(e) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this _Section 6.9_ with respect to employees are included for the sole
benefit of the respective parties hereto and shall not create any right (i) in
any other person, including without limitation, any employees, former
employees, any participant or any beneficiary thereof in any Benefit Plan or
Buyer Plan or (ii) to continued employment with the Company Group or Buyer (or
its

 



      
 

 



 

Affiliates). After the Closing, nothing contained in this _Section 6.9_ shall
interfere with Buyers right to amend, restate, replace, supplement or
otherwise modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan, Buyer Plan or the
Existing Services Agreement (subject to the provisions of this _Section 6.9_)
or to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee for any reason.

 



 

6.10 _280G Matters_. Unless the Company determines in good faith that no 280G
Shareholder Vote (as defined below) is necessary, (a) prior to the Closing
Date, the Sellers or the Company, as applicable, shall use their reasonable
best efforts as soon as practicable after the date hereof to obtain written
waivers of any "parachute payment" (within the meaning of _Section 280G_ of
the Code) from each person who has or reasonably may have a right to any
payments or benefits that would be deemed to constitute "parachute payments"
(within the meaning of _Section 280G_ of the Code) (such payments and
benefits, the " _Waived Benefit_ ") as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby so that all remaining payment or benefit applicable to
such person shall not be deemed to be a parachute payment that would not be
deductible under _Section 280G_ of the Code, and to accept in substitution
for the Waived Benefit the right to receive such remaining payment or benefit
only if approved in a manner that complies with _Section 280G(b)(5)(B)_ of
the Code, with each such waiver identifying the specific Waived Benefit and
providing that if such equityholder approval is not obtained, such payments
shall not be made and such person shall have no right or entitlement with
respect thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall this _Section
6.10_ be construed to require the Sellers or the Company to compel any person
to waive any existing rights under any contract that such Person has with the
Company or its Affiliates and in no event shall the Sellers or the Company
Group be deemed to be in breach of this _Section 6.10_ if any such Person
refuses to waive such rights, and (b) as soon as practicable thereafter but in
any event prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers or the Company, as
applicable, shall solicit the approval of the appropriate equityholders in a
manner that complies with _Sections 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii)_ and _280G(b)(5)(B)_
of the Code of all payments or benefits (including payments and benefits
waived pursuant to the preceding clause) that would, as a result of, or in
connection with, the transactions contemplated hereby, be deemed to constitute
"parachute payments" (the " _280G Shareholder Vote_ "). The determination of
which payments may be deemed to constitute parachute payments, form of waiver,
solicitation of approval, and disclosure materials, as required by _Section
280G_ of the Code, shall be provided to Buyer for Buyers advance review at
least seven (7) days prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

6.11 _Exclusivity; Alternative Transactions_.

 



 

(a) The Sellers shall, and shall cause the Sterling Company, the Company Group
and its and their respective Representatives and Affiliates to, promptly cease
and cause to be terminated any existing activities, including discussions or
negotiations with any Person (other than Buyer and their Representatives and
Affiliates) conducted prior to the date hereof, with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal (other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement).

 



 

(b) During the Interim Period, the Sellers shall not, and shall cause the
Sterling Company, the Company Group and its and their respective
Representatives and Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
initiate, or knowingly facilitate the submission of any Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to
any Person any information with respect to, or take any other action to
knowingly

 



      
 

 



 

facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes any
Acquisition Proposal (except to provide notice of the existence of the
restrictions in this _Section 6.11_), (iii) otherwise cooperate in any effort
to facilitate any other Persons attempt to make an Acquisition Proposal or
accept or implement any Acquisition Proposal or (iv) enter into any agreement
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that this _Section
6.11(b)_ shall not apply to any communications related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(c) The Sellers shall promptly notify Buyer if (i) any written inquiries,
proposal or offers related to an Acquisition Proposal are received by, (ii)
any information or data is requested from, or (iii) any negotiations or
discussions related to an Acquisition Proposal are sought to be initiated or
continued with, the Sellers or the Company Group or any of their respective
Representatives and Affiliates.

 



 

6.12 _FIRPTA Certificate_. The Sellers shall deliver to Buyer at Closing
certificates, duly executed and acknowledged, certifying any facts that would
exempt the transactions contemplated hereby from withholding pursuant to
_Section 1445_ of the Code and the Treasury regulations thereunder;
_provided_ , that Buyers sole recourse for breach of this _Section 6.12_
shall be to withhold amounts required by applicable Tax law to be withheld
from amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with _Section
2.7_.

 



 

6.13 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) IO Parent shall prepare and deliver to Buyer, within sixty (60) days
following the Closing, an allocation of the portion of the Estimated Purchase
Price payable to IO Parent and any other amounts treated as consideration for
IO Parents transfer of its Company Units for U.S. federal income tax purposes
among each of the assets of the Company and, as applicable, the Company
Subsidiaries in accordance with _Sections 743(b)_ , _755_ and _1060(d)_ of
the Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Tax
Allocation_ "). In connection with the foregoing, the Company shall, and Buyer
shall cause the Company to, furnish to IO Parent any information concerning
the Company that is reasonably requested by IO Parent to enable IO Parent to
prepare such Tax Allocation. Buyer shall have thirty (30) days from the later
of (i) the receipt of the Tax Allocation or (ii) the close of the quarter in
which the Closing occurs to review and comment in writing on the Tax
Allocation, after which the parties shall attempt in good faith to reasonably
agree on such Tax Allocation. IO Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to update the Tax Allocation in a manner consistent with _Sections
743(b)_ , _755_ and _1060(d)_ of the Code and the Treasury regulations
promulgated thereunder following any adjustments to the Purchase Price
pursuant to this Agreement, subject to review and comment by Buyer. If IO
Parent and Buyer agree on the Tax Allocation, as adjusted, then IO Parent and
Buyer shall report consistently with the Tax Allocation on all Tax Returns and
neither party shall take any position with a taxing authority that is
inconsistent with such Tax Allocation. If any disputed items regarding the Tax
Allocation cannot be resolved by the parties after attempting in good faith to
reasonably agree, then each of Buyer and IO Parent may use its own Tax
Allocation.

 



 

(b) The parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the Companys taxable year is
expected to terminate on the Closing Date under _Section 708(b)(1)(B)_ of the
Code as a result of IO Parents transfer of its Company Units under this
Agreement, and (ii) the Sterling Companys

 



      
 

 



 

taxable year is expected to end on or within three (3) months after the
Closing Date. In light of the foregoing, the Company shall, and Buyer shall
cause the Company to, furnish to IO Parent as soon as reasonably practicable
after the end of the taxable year of the Company (or a portion thereof) that
ends on the Closing Date all information concerning the Company that is
reasonably required for the preparation of income Tax Returns of IO Parent,
including Schedule K-1s and any other information reasonably requested by IO
Parent, in sufficient detail to enable IO Parent to prepare its federal,
state, local and other income Tax Returns with respect to Taxable periods (or
portions thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing. The Company shall, and
Buyer shall cause the Company to, deliver to the Sellers Representative for
review and comment draft U.S. federal, state and local income Tax Returns of
the Company (and the Company Subsidiaries) for the taxable years of the
Company that end on or before or that include the Closing Date and that have
not been filed on or prior to the Closing Date (each, a " _Closing Income Tax
Return_ ") as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date and shall
prepare such Closing Income Tax Returns in a manner consistent with past
practice; provided, that if the Companys taxable year does not terminate on
the Closing Date under Section 708(b)(1)(B), the parties acknowledge and agree
that the Company will be permitted to change its income tax accounting methods
for the taxable year that includes the Closing Date. The parties acknowledge
and agree that the Company will make and keep in effect a valid election under
Section 754 of the Code for the Taxable year of the Company that includes the
Closing Date. To the extent that the taxable year of the Company does not
terminate on the Closing Date for federal, state or local income Tax purposes,
such information shall be provided based upon a "closing of the books" of the
Company. The cost of preparing the Closing Income Tax Returns shall be borne
by the Sellers Representative. Buyer shall incorporate such comments to such
Closing Income Tax Returns provided by the Sellers Representative to the
extent that such comments are consistent with applicable law and facts, and
the Sellers Representative and Buyer shall act in good faith to resolve any
dispute with respect to such Closing Income Tax Returns prior to the date on
which the relevant Closing Income Tax Return is required to be filed. If such
parties cannot resolve any disputed item, the item in question shall be
resolved by the Designated Firm, whose decision shall be final and binding and
whose expenses shall be borne by the Sellers Representative. Buyer and the
Company shall not amend any income Tax Returns of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary for any Taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the
Closing Date without the written consent of the Sellers Representative (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed). The Sterling
Companys distributive share of the income, gain, loss, expense and deduction
of IO Parent and any intermediate partnership(s) through which the Sterling
Company holds an interest in IO Parent for the period from January 1, 2018
through the effective date of the Restructuring shall be determined based upon
a "closing of the books" of IO Parent and any such intermediate partnership(s)
as of the effective date of the Restructuring. Unless required by law, IO
Parent shall not amend any income Tax Returns of IO Parent or any such
intermediate partnership(s) for any Taxable period (or portion thereof) ending
on or before the Closing Date without the written consent of the Buyer (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed).

 



 

(c) Buyer shall deliver to the Sterling Parent for review and comment draft
U.S. federal, state and local income Tax Returns of the Sterling Company for
the taxable years of the Sterling Company that end on or before or that
include the Closing Date and that have not been filed on or prior to the
Closing Date (each, a " _Sterling Company Closing Income Tax Return_ ") as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date. Buyer shall incorporate
such

 



       
 

 



 

comments to such Sterling Company Closing Income Tax Returns provided by the
Sterling Parent to the extent that such comments are consistent with
applicable law and facts, and the Sterling Parent and Buyer shall act in good
faith to resolve any dispute with respect to such Sterling Company Closing
Income Tax Returns prior to the date on which the relevant Sterling Company
Closing Income Tax Return is required to be filed. If such parties cannot
resolve any disputed item, the item in question shall be resolved by the
Designated Firm, whose decision shall be final and binding. For the avoidance
of doubt, the fair market value of the assets distributed by the Sterling
Company pursuant to the Restructuring shall equal the value used to determine
the final Sterling Company Income Tax Amount pursuant to Section 2.6, and the
Sterling Companys Tax Returns shall be prepared consistently with such
agreed-upon value. No election shall be made with respect to the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement (A) under Section 336 or 338 of the Code, or
any similar provision of state, local or non  U.S. Law or (B) under Section
1.1502-76(b)(2) (ii)(D) of the Treasury Regulations.

 



 

(d) No party shall make any election to apply _Sections 6221_ through _6241_
of the Code, as amended by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, to the Company
or any Company Subsidiary prior to January 1, 2018.

 



 

(e) To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, any deductions or other
Tax benefits resulting from or attributable to (i) the payment of any
Transaction Costs; (ii) the payment of any sale bonuses or change in control
bonuses that become payable as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including amounts payable to an
employee of the Company, the Sterling Company, or any Subsidiary at the
election of such employee); (iii) the payment of any investment banking,
accounting, attorney or other professional fees incurred by the Company, the
Sterling Company, or any Company Subsidiary at or prior to the Closing; (iv)
the payment of any Indebtedness (or other amount described in _Section
2.5(d)_); (v) the payment of any amounts in respect of Arizona Property
Purchase Costs or any amounts creditable against the purchase price for the
Arizona Property under the Arizona Property Purchase Option Agreement; or (vi)
any election under Revenue Procedure 2011-29, 2011-18 I.R.B. 746 (the " _Rev.
Proc. 2011-29 Election_ "), shall in each case be allocated to a pre-Closing
Taxable period or portion thereof ending on the Closing Date for all Tax
purposes. The Company and/or the Sterling Company shall, at the election of
the Sellers Representative, in its sole discretion, file a Rev. Proc. 2011-29
Election to treat seventy percent (70%) of any success-based fees that were
paid by or on behalf of the Company, the Sterling Company, or any Company
Subsidiary prior to or on the Closing Date as an amount that did not
facilitate the transactions contemplated under this Agreement and, therefore,
treat seventy percent (70%) of such costs as deductible for federal income Tax
purposes.

 



 

6.14 [ _Intentionally Omitted_ ].

 



 

6.15 _Notice of Certain Matters_. During the Interim Period, each party shall
give prompt written notice to the other parties upon such original party
becoming aware of (i) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event which
occurrence or failure would or would be likely to cause any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate and (ii) any
failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to
be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, which, in each case,
would reasonably be expected to result in any conditions set forth in Article
7 not to be satisfied. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no notice under this
_Section 6.15_ shall be deemed to have modified any representation or
warranty or cured any breach of a covenant for purposes of

 



      
 

 



 

determining the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Article 7_ or a
partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Article 8_.

 



 

6.16 _Restructuring_. Promptly after the completion of the Restructuring, (i)
the Company shall deliver a certificate (the " _Ownership Certificate_ ") to
Buyer setting forth the number of Company Units held by IO Parent and by the
Sterling Company and (ii) Sterling Parent shall deliver a certificate (the "
_Sterling Ownership Certificate_ ") to Buyer setting forth the number of
Sterling Company Shares held by Sterling Parent.

 



 

6.17 _Real Estate Matters_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, except as may be required in furtherance of the
acquisition of the Arizona Property, and except as set forth on Schedule 6.17,
neither Sellers nor the Company shall permit any Company Subsidiary to amend,
modify, or terminate the Leases without the written consent of Buyer, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, using commercially reasonable efforts, the
Company shall satisfy all conditions precedent in order to complete the
transaction contemplated by the Arizona Property Purchase Option Agreement,
except for the payment of the Arizona Property Purchase Costs.

 



 

6.18 _Payoff Letter_. On or prior to the Closing, the Company shall request
from (a) the agent under the Closing Credit Agreement and (b) any other lender
of Indebtedness for borrowed money to the Company Group (and upon its receipt,
deliver to Buyer) an executed payoff letter (each, a " _Payoff Letter_ ") with
respect to the Closing Credit Agreement and the Indebtedness under the Closing
Credit Agreement or the applicable agreement related to Indebtedness for
borrowed money, as applicable, in each case in a form reasonably satisfactory
to Buyer (acting reasonably and in good faith), which Payoff Letter shall
indicate the total amount required to be paid to fully satisfy all
Indebtedness under the Closing Credit Agreement or other applicable agreement
on the anticipated Closing Date (the " _Payoff Amount_ "). In connection with
Closing, Buyer shall repay, or cause to be repaid, on behalf of the Company
Group, the Payoff Amount and any other outstanding amount of indebtedness of
the Company Group pursuant to the Closing Credit Agreement or other applicable
agreement by wire transfer of immediately available funds as provided for in
the applicable Payoff Letter.

 



 

6.19 _Replacement Letters of Credit; Guaranties_. Sellers shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause the Company Group to be fully released, effective as of
the Closing, from all obligations under each of the guarantees, letters of
credit, letters of comfort, bid bonds and performance bonds obtained by any
member of the Company Group for the benefit of IO International and its
Subsidiaries, including those guarantees, letters of credit, letters of
comfort, bid bonds and performance bonds that are set forth on _Schedule 4.7_
(collectively, the " _Guarantee Obligations_ "); _provided_ that, if required,
IO Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause itself or one or more of
its Affiliates or any other third party to be substituted in all respects for
each member of the Company Group in respect of such Guarantee Obligations. In
the event Sellers are unable to cause any member of the Company Group to be
fully released from the Guarantee Obligations prior to Closing, IO Parent
shall (i) indemnify such member of the Company Group against all Losses or
Liabilities of any kind whatsoever arising from, resulting

 



      
 

 



 

from or with respect to such Guarantee Obligations, including any damages that
may be sustained by such member of the Company Group as a result of such
Guarantee Obligation to the extent incurred from and after the Closing and
(ii) continue to use reasonable best efforts to cause such member of the
Company Group to be fully released as promptly as practicable after the
Closing.

 



 

6.20 _Financing Cooperation_.

 



 

(a) During the Interim Period, upon the request of Buyer, the Company shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause its and their Representatives to, at the sole expense of Buyer (other
than with respect to clause (ii) below), use its and their reasonable best
efforts to provide such cooperation as may reasonably be requested by Buyer in
connection with any Buyer financing, including any offering of securities and
any SEC filings to be made by Buyer, including, as applicable, by: (i)
designating one or more members of the Companys senior management to
participate in a small number of meetings, due diligence and drafting
sessions, rating agency presentations and road shows, if any, in each case,
upon reasonable advance notice and at reasonable times; (ii) providing
information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
including such qualitative and quantitative information with appropriate
financial metrics to provide disclosures to enable potential investors in any
securities offering to bridge the Financial Statements to be reflective of the
financial performance of the assets and operations being acquired by Buyer, as
reasonably requested by Buyer or its financing sources; (iii) providing
reasonable assistance as may be requested by Buyer in connection with
documentation to be prepared by it, including SEC filings to be made by Buyer,
offering memoranda, private placement memoranda, prospectuses, bank
confidential information memoranda, rating agency presentations and similar
documents; (iv) requesting that Deloitte and Touche LLP or other relevant
accountants of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries cooperate with Buyer,
including by participating in drafting sessions and accounting due diligence
sessions, and seeking to obtain the consent of, and customary comfort letters
(including customary "negative assurances") from, Deloitte and Touche LLP
(including by providing customary management letters and requesting legal
letters to obtain such consent) in connection with any securities offering by
Buyer if reasonably necessary or desirable for Buyers use of the Companys or
the Company Subsidiaries financial statements; and (v) cooperating reasonably
with Buyers legal counsel in connection with any legal opinions that such
legal counsel may be required to deliver in connection with any securities
offering, to the extent customary and reasonable. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this _Section 6.21_ shall (A) require the Company or
its Subsidiaries to take any action that would reasonably be expected to
conflict with or violate any applicable Law, Organizational Documents or any
Contracts, (B) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay any
commitment or similar fee, pay or reimburse any third party expense, provide
any indemnities (other than customary indemnities to Deloitte and Touche LLP),
or incur or assume any liability or obligation, in connection with such Buyer
financing, (C) unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (D) require the Company or its
Subsidiaries to adopt resolutions or execute consents to approve or authorize
the execution of such Buyer financing prior to the Closing.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall, (i) upon any request by the Company from time to time,
reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
and expenses

 



      
 

 



 

(including reasonable costs and expenses of counsel and accountants) incurred
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with any cooperation
of the Company and its Subsidiaries provided under this _Section 6.21_ and
(ii) indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and any of its
and their respective Representatives from and against any and all claim, loss,
damage, injury, liability, judgment, award, penalty, fine, cost (including
cost of investigation), expense (including fees and expenses of counsel and
accountants), settlement or other losses, in each case, actually suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of any Buyer
financing, except in the event such claim, loss, damage, injury, liability,
judgment, award, penalty, fine, cost, expense, settlement or other loss arises
out of or results from (A) the gross negligence, the willful misconduct or bad
faith of the Company or its Subsidiaries in fulfilling their obligations
pursuant to this _Section 6.21_, (B) information relating to the Company and
its Subsidiaries provided to the Buyer by or on behalf of the Company and its
Subsidiaries expressly for use in connection with any Buyer financing;
_provided_ , that such information was used (1) in an offering memorandum,
private placement memorandum, prospectus, bank confidential information
memorandum, rating agency presentation or similar document and (2) in a form
and context consented to in writing by or on behalf of the Company, or (C) the
breach of the terms of this Agreement by the Sellers or the Company. Subject
to Buyers indemnification obligations under this _Section 6.21_, the Company
hereby consents to the use of the Company Groups corporate logos in
connection with the initial syndication or marketing of the financing;
_provided_ , that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended
to, nor reasonably likely to, harm or disparage the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. To the extent that this _Section 6.21_ requires the Companys
and/or its Subsidiaries cooperation with respect to Buyers obligations
relating to any Buyer financing, the existence of any alternative financing
shall not operate to increase the Companys or its Subsidiaries respective
obligations under this _Section 6.21_ for purposes of _Article 7_ as
compared to such obligations in respect of any Buyer financing, in each case
without giving effect to any such alternative financing. For the avoidance of
doubt, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the provisions contained
in this _Section 6.21_ represent the sole obligation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives with respect to cooperation in
connection with the arrangement of any Buyer financing.

 



 

6.21 _Trademark License_. Effective upon the Closing Date, Buyer and the
Company hereby grant to IO International and its Subsidiaries (the " _Seller
Licensees_ ") a limited, revocable, non-exclusive license to use all
Trademarks set forth on _Schedule 6.21_ (the " _Buyer Marks_ ") in a manner
consistent with past practice and customary "phase out" use in connection with
the operation of the businesses of the Seller Licensees, for the following
time periods: (i) for 60 days, for uses on the Internet and in social media;
and (ii) for 90 days, for uses on publicly distributed physical and tangible
materials, including all internal office supplies and similar collateral that
are not visible to the public. After such time periods, the license granted
shall automatically terminate, provided that the Seller Licensees may continue
to use the Buyer Marks thereafter to the extent required by applicable Law.
For the avoidance of doubt, all such use shall solely be in connection with
the businesses of the Seller Licensees in the same manner, purpose, and scope
as the Buyer Marks are in use by such Persons immediately prior to the Closing
Date, and in no event shall such Persons: (a) increase the scope of use of the
Buyer Marks, including use on any new goods or services, or in any new media,
geographic territories, or channels of trade; and/or (b) alter or modify the
Buyer Marks in any way, or form composite marks of which any of the Buyer
Marks is a part. Sellers will, or shall cause IO International

 



      
 

 



 

and/or its Subsidiaries to, file with all applicable governmental authorities
within 30 days after the Closing Date to change all corporate, trade and d/b/a
name registrations that are owned by Sellers and/or their Affiliates that
contain any of the Buyer Marks, to new names that do not include any of the
Buyer Marks or any portion thereof. The Seller Licensees will diligently and
in good faith pursue such name changes. The Seller Licensees use of the Buyer
Marks, and the nature and quality of the products and services related thereto
shall be maintained at least at the levels of quality in existence on the
Closing Date. If Buyer and the Company reasonably determine that any of the
Seller Licensees fails to maintain a consistent level of quality in accordance
with the foregoing, then Buyer and/or the Company may request that Sellers
take, or cause IO International and its Subsidiaries to take, reasonable steps
to remedy any such deficiencies and Sellers shall, or shall cause IO
International and its Subsidiaries to, promptly comply with such requests.
Within (I) 60 days after the Closing Date, for uses on the Internet and in
social media; and (II) 90 days after the Closing Date, for uses on publicly
distributed physical and tangible materials, Buyer shall, and shall cause the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to, remove from such venues and items all
references to the Companys and its Subsidiaries Singapore business.

 



 

6.22 _Termination of Certain Services and Contracts; Transfer of Books and
Records_.

 



 

(a) Except as set forth on Schedule 6.22, prior to the Closing, Sellers shall,
and shall cause the Non-Company Affiliates to, take such actions as may be
necessary to terminate, sever, or assign to a Seller or a Non-Company
Affiliate (in each case with appropriate mutual releases) effective upon or
before the Closing (i) all services provided to and Contracts with Non-Company
Affiliates other than (W) as set forth in Section 6.6, (X) with individuals
employed or formerly employed by the Company or Insperity except that the
management services agreement between Mr. Wanger and Mr. Slessman,
respectively, shall be assigned to IO Parent prior to Closing, (Y) Contracts
with Baselayer Technology LLC and its Subsidiaries and (Z) customer contracts
for data center services of the Company and (ii) settle before the Adjustment
Time all intercompany receivables and payables (collectively, such terminated,
severed or assigned Affiliate arrangements and intercompany receivables and
payables, the " _Terminated Affiliate Arrangements_ "). From and after the
Closing, neither Buyer, nor the Company Group nor any of their respective
Affiliates shall have any further obligations or Liabilities pursuant to the
Terminated Affiliate Arrangements whatsoever.

 



 

(b) Prior the Closing, the Company shall be permitted to (i) transfer all
books and records held by the Company and its subsidiaries related to IO
International and the Singapore business and that are unrelated to the
business of the Company Group, in each case to IO International, and (ii)
provide IO Parent a copy of all books and records (including e-mails on its
servers) that relate to the operations of IO International.

(k) Buyer shall have received (i) the Ancillary Agreements duly executed by
the Sellers (or the applicable Affiliates), (ii) fully executed copies of any
applicable Payoff Letter, and (iii) copies of any applicable terminations or
releases of all Liens evidencing the Indebtedness (although the parties
acknowledge that such terminations and releases shall be filed by Buyer after
Closing or as otherwise set forth in the applicable Payoff Letter).

 



 

7.2 _Conditions Precedent to Obligations of the Sellers_. The obligations of
the Sellers and the Company to consummate the Sale are subject to the
fulfillment, at or prior to the Closing, of each of the following conditions
(any or all of which may be waived by the Sellers Representative, in whole or
in part, to the extent permitted by applicable Law):

 



 

(a) (i) the Buyer Fundamental Representations shall be true and correct in all
material respects as of the date hereof and as of the Closing as though made
at and as of the Closing (except for such representations and warranties that
are made as of a specific date, which shall be so true and correct only as of
such specified date) and (ii) the other representations and warranties of
Buyer set forth in _Article 5_ shall be true and correct (without giving
effect to materiality, Material Adverse Effect, or similar phrases in the
representations and warranties, other than to the extent that such
materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar phrases define the scope of
items or matters described on the Schedules) as of the date hereof and as of
the Closing as though then made at and as of the Closing (except for such
representations and warranties that are made as of a specific date, which
shall be so true and correct only as of such specified date), except where the
failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct,
individually or in the aggregate, would not prevent or materially delay or
impair Buyers ability to consummate the transactions set forth herein;

 



 

(b) Buyer shall have performed and complied in all material respects with all
covenants required by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by it on
or prior to the Closing;

 



 

(c) the Sellers Representative shall have received a certificate signed by an
officer of Buyer each dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the
conditions specified in _Sections 7.2(a)_ and _7.2(b)_ are satisfied;

 



 

(d) no Governmental Body having competent jurisdiction over the Sellers, the
Company, the Company Group or Buyer shall have enacted, issued, promulgated,
enforced or

 



      
 

 



 

entered any Law then in effect or issued an Order, in each case, prohibiting
consummation of the Sale substantially on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement; and

 



 

(e) the execution and delivery by Buyer of the Ancillary Agreements.

 



 

7.3 _Waiver of Conditions; Frustration of Closing Conditions_. All conditions
to Closing shall be deemed to have been satisfied or waived from and after the
Closing. None of the Sellers, the Company, Buyer may rely on the failure of
any condition set forth in _Sections 7.1 _or _7.2_ , as the case may be, if
such failure was caused by such partys failure to comply with any provision
of this Agreement.

 



 

ARTICLE 8

 



 

 _TERMINATION_

 



 

8.1 _Termination of Agreement_. Subject to _Section 10.1_, this Agreement may
be terminated at any time prior to the Closing as follows:

 



 

(a) at the election of the Sellers Representative or Buyer on or after
February 28, 2018 (the " _Outside Date_ "), if the Sale shall not have
occurred by 5:00 p.m. New York City time on such date; _provided_ , that
neither the Sellers Representative nor Buyer may terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 8.1(a)_ if, in the case of the Sellers
Representative, any Seller or the Company, and in the case of Buyer, it, is in
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement and such breach causes, or results in,
either (i) the failure to satisfy the conditions to the obligations of the
terminating party to consummate the Sale set forth in _Article 7_ prior to
the Outside Date or (ii) the failure of the Closing to have occurred prior to
the Outside Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that neither the Sellers
Representative nor Buyer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 8.1(a)_ in the event (x) the other party (or, in
the case of Buyer, the Sellers Representative, the Sellers or the Company) is
seeking, through Legal Proceedings, to specifically enforce this Agreement in
compliance with _Section 10.1_ while such Legal Proceedings are still pending
or prior to any ruling in such Legal Proceedings being fully complied with or
(y) on the Outside Date, the Sellers Representative has the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Sections 8.1(e)_ or _8.1(f)_ ;

 



 

(b) by mutual written consent of the Sellers Representative and Buyer;

 



 

(c) by the Sellers Representative or Buyer if any Governmental Body having
competent jurisdiction over the Sellers, the Company, the Company Group or
Buyer shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Law
then in effect or issued an Order, in each case, such that the conditions set
forth in _Sections 7.1(d)_ and _7.2(d)_ would not be satisfied, and such Law
or Order shall have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ , _however_ ,
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(c)_ shall
not be available to any party whose breach or breaches of this Agreement
resulted in the failure of such conditions;

 



 

(d) by Buyer if (i) Buyer is not in material breach of any of its respective
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this
Agreement and (ii) the Company or the Sellers are in breach of any of their
respective representations, warranties,

 



      
 

 



 

covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement that renders or
would render the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.1(a)_ or _7.1(b)_
incapable of being satisfied at least three (3) Business Days prior to the
Outside Date, and if such breach is either (A) not capable of being cured at
least three (3) Business Days prior to the Outside Date or (B) if curable, is
not cured prior to the earlier of (x) twenty (20) Business Days after the
giving of written notice by Buyer to the Company and the Sellers
Representative and (y) three (3) Business Days prior to the Outside Date;

 



 

(e) by the Sellers Representative if (i) the Company and the Sellers are not
in material breach of any of their respective representations, warranties,
covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement and (ii) Buyer is in
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement that renders or would render the
conditions set forth in _Sections 7.2(a)_ or _7.2(b)_ incapable of being
satisfied at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Outside Date, and if
such breach is either (A) not capable of being cured at least three (3)
Business Days prior to the Outside Date or (B) if curable, is not cured prior
to the earlier of (x) twenty (20) Business Days after the giving of written
notice by the Sellers Representative to Buyer and (y) three (3) Business Days
prior to the Outside Date; or

 



 

(f) by the Sellers Representative if (i) all the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.1_ have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that
by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, each of which shall be
capable of being satisfied if the Closing Date were the date that notice of
termination is delivered by the Sellers Representative to Buyer) and (ii)
Buyer does not complete the Sale by the day the Closing is required to occur
pursuant to _Section 2.1_.

 



 

8.2 _Procedure Upon Termination_. Subject to _Section 8.3_, in the event of a
valid termination by Buyer or the Sellers Representative, or both, pursuant to
_Section 8.1_ hereof, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the
other party or parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such
termination is made (other than in the case of a termination pursuant to
_Section 8.1(b)_), and this Agreement shall terminate, and the Sale shall be
abandoned, without further action by Buyer, the Sellers or the Company.

 



 

8.3 _Effect of Termination_. In the event that this Agreement is validly
terminated in accordance with _Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.2_, then each of
the parties hereto shall be relieved of its duties and obligations arising
under this Agreement after the date of such termination and such termination
shall be without Liability to Buyer, the Sellers or the Company; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) no such termination shall relieve any party hereto from
Liability for any Willful Breach or actual fraud, and (ii) the provisions of
_Article 1_ ( _Certain Definitions_ ), _Section 6.3_ ( _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ), the last sentence of _Section 6.5(c)_ ( _Further Assurances;
Regulatory Approvals_ ), _Section 6.8_ ( _Publicity, Confidentiality_ ), this
_Section 8.3_ ( _Effect of Termination_ ), _Article 10_ ( _Miscellaneous_ )
and Article 11 ( _Guaranty_ ) shall remain in full force and effect and
survive any termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

 



      
 

 



 

ARTICLE 9

 



 

SURVIVAL

 



 

9.1 _No Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. The respective
(a) representations and warranties of the Sellers and the Company contained in
_Article 3_ and _Article 4_ and of the Buyer contained in _Article 5_ and
(b) the respective covenants of the parties required to be performed or
complied with prior to the Closing, in each case, shall not survive the
effective time of the Closing and following the Closing there shall be no
liability in respect thereof, whether such liability has accrued prior to or
after the Closing Date, on the part of any party. For the avoidance of doubt,
those covenants and agreements that by their terms apply or are to be
performed in whole or in part at or after the Closing shall survive until
fully performed in accordance with their terms.

 



 

ARTICLE 10

 



 

 _MISCELLANEOUS_

 



 

10.1 _Specific Performance; Remedies_.

 



 

(a) The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur and
that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at Law in the event that
any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or other
legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such failure to perform
or any such breach. Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby
agree that in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Sellers or
the Company, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, of any of their
respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, Buyer, on the
one hand, and the Sellers Representative, on the other hand, respectively,
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other party (as
applicable), and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other party or parties
(as applicable) under this Agreement, without proof of actual damages or
inadequacy of legal remedy and without bond or other security being required.
The pursuit of specific enforcement or other equitable remedies by any party
hereto will not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to
pursue any other right or remedy (whether at Law or in equity) to which such
party may be entitled at any time.

 



 

(b) Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby,
or by Law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one
remedy will not preclude the exercise at any time of any other remedy.

 



 

(c) Each of the Sellers, the Sellers Representative and the Company, on the
one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, hereby agrees not to raise any
objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance
to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by
the Sellers, the Company or Buyer, as applicable, and to specifically enforce
the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
the Sellers, the Company or Buyer, as applicable, under this Agreement. The
parties hereto further acknowledge and agree that (i) by seeking the remedies
provided for in this _Section 10.1_, a party

 



       
 

 



 

shall not in any respect waive its right to seek at any time any other form or
amount of relief that may be available to a party under this Agreement
(including monetary damages) and (ii) nothing set forth in this _Section
10.1_ shall require any party hereto to institute any proceeding for (or limit
any partys right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under
this _Section 10.1_ prior or as a condition to exercising any termination
right under _Article 8_ (and pursuing damages after such termination (subject
to the terms of this Agreement)), nor shall the commencement of any Legal
Proceeding pursuant to this _Section 10.1_ or anything set forth in this
_Section 10.1_ restrict or limit any partys right to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article 8_ or pursue any other
remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.

 



 

10.2 _Payment of Transfer Taxes_. All sales, use, transfer, intangible,
recordation, real property transfer Tax, documentary stamp or similar Taxes or
charges, of any nature whatsoever, applicable to, or resulting from, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne by Buyer. Buyer
shall cause the Company, at its own expense, to, at or after the Closing,
timely file (or cause to be filed) any Tax Return or other document with
respect to such Taxes or charges, as required by applicable Law.

 



 

10.3 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each of the
Sellers, the Company, Buyer and Guarantor shall bear its and its Affiliates
own expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and each other agreement, document and instrument contemplated by
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby. Buyer shall pay the fees and expenses of the Company Group as
contemplated by _Sections 6.5(c)_ , _6.6(b)_ and _10.2_ and shall be
responsible for the fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent relating to the
Escrow Agreement.

 



 

10.4 _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement (including the
Exhibits and Schedules hereto), the Confidentiality Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements represent the entire understanding and agreement between
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may only
be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or waived by a
written instrument signed by the Buyer and the Sellers Representative. No
action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any investigation by or on
behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party
taking such action of compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant
or obligation contained herein. The waiver by any party of a breach of any
provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a further or
continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of any other or subsequent
breach. No failure on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay in
exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such right, power or
remedy by such party preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

 



 

10.5 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction_. This Agreement, and all
actions, causes of action, claims, cross-claims, third-party claims or Legal
Proceedings of any kind (whether at Law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement
(including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto), any certificate, instrument,
opinion or other documents delivered hereunder, or the negotiation, execution
or performance hereof or thereof (including any action, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim, third-party claim or

 



      
 

 



 

Legal Proceeding of any kind based upon, arising out of or related to any
representation or warranty made in or in connection herewith or therewith)
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Law of the State of
Delaware, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable
principles of conflicts of Laws. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally (i) submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery (or, only if the Delaware Court
of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any
Federal court of the United States of America sitting in the State of
Delaware), and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim or Legal Proceeding of any
kind arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any certificate,
instrument, opinion or other documents delivered hereunder, or the
negotiation, execution or performance hereof or thereof (including any action,
cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim or Legal Proceeding
of any kind based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or
warranty made in or in connection herewith or therewith), or for recognition
or enforcement of any judgment, and agrees that all claims in respect of any
such action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim or Legal
Proceeding of any kind shall be heard and determined in such Delaware Court of
Chancery (or, only if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any Federal court of the United States
of America sitting in the State of Delaware), (ii) waives, to the fullest
extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of any action, cause of action, claim,
cross-claim or third-party claim or Legal Proceeding of any kind arising out
of or relating to this Agreement, any certificate, instrument, opinion or
other documents delivered hereunder, or the negotiation, execution or
performance hereof or thereof (including any action, cause of action, claim,
cross-claim or third-party claim or Legal Proceeding of any kind based upon,
arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or in
connection herewith or therewith) in the Delaware Court of Chancery, any
Federal court of the United States of America sitting in the State of
Delaware, or in any Delaware State court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
such action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim or Legal
Proceeding of any kind in any such court and (iv) agrees that a final judgment
in any such action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim
or Legal Proceeding of any kind shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
Law. Each of the parties hereto agrees that service of process, summons,
notice or document by registered mail addressed to it at the applicable
address set forth in _Section 10.6_ below shall be effective service of
process for any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party
claim or Legal Proceeding of any kind brought in any such court.

 



 

10.6 _Notices_. All notices, demands and other communications to be given or
delivered under or by reason of the provisions of this Agreement shall be in
writing and shall be deemed given (a) when personally delivered, (b) when
transmission is confirmed (and each party agrees to promptly confirm if such
confirmation is requested) if by telecopy (or other facsimile device) or

10.7 _Releases_.

 



 

(a) Effective upon the Closing, each Seller, on behalf of itself and its
direct and indirect parent companies, hereby irrevocably waives, releases and
discharges the Buyer, the Sterling Company and the members of the Company
Group of and from any and all Liabilities and obligations to the Sellers of
any kind or nature whatsoever (including in respect of any rights of
contribution or indemnification), whether arising under any Contract or
otherwise at Law or in equity, and whether or not then known (other than
Liabilities that arise under this Agreement (including _Section 6.6_) or the
Ancillary Agreements), and each Seller agrees that it will not seek to recover
any such Liabilities in connection therewith or thereunder from the Buyer, the
Sterling Company or the members of the Company Group; _provided_ , however,
that nothing in this Section 10.7(a) shall be deemed to constitute a release,
discharge or covenant not to sue Buyer with respect to any claim, action,
cause of action or suit for breach of this Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Agreements.

 



 

(b) Effective upon the Closing, Buyer, on behalf of itself and its direct and
indirect parent companies, the Sterling Company and the members of the Company
Group, hereby irrevocably waives, releases and discharges the Sellers of and
from any and all Liabilities and obligations to Buyer, the Sterling Company
and the members of the Company Group of any kind or nature whatsoever
(including in respect of any rights of contribution or indemnification),
whether arising under any Contract or otherwise at Law or in equity, and
whether or not then known (other than Liabilities that arise under this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements), and Buyer, on behalf of itself and its
direct and indirect parent companies, the Sterling Company and the members of
the Company Group, agrees that it will not seek to recover any such
Liabilities in connection therewith or thereunder from the Sellers; _provided_
, however, that nothing in this Section 10.7(b) shall be deemed to constitute
a release, discharge or covenant not to sue the Sellers with respect to any
claim, action, cause of action or suit for breach of this Agreement or any of
the Ancillary Agreements.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) This _Section 10.7_ shall survive the Closing and is intended for the
benefit of and may be enforced directly by any Persons specifically released
pursuant to this _Section 10.7_ (the " _Released Persons_ ").

 



 

10.8 _Severability_. If any condition, term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any Law or
public policy, all other conditions, terms or provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party.

 



 

10.9 _Binding Effect; Assignment_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing in
this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall create or be
deemed to create in any Person not a party to this Agreement any rights,
benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the DandO Indemnitees are third
party beneficiaries of _Section 6.6_, (ii) the Released Persons are third
party beneficiaries of _Section 10.7_, (iii) the Non-Parties of the parties
are third party beneficiaries of _Section 10.10_, and (iv) STB is the third
party beneficiary of _Section 10.11_.

 



 

(b) No assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or obligations hereunder
may be made, directly or indirectly (by operation of Law or otherwise), by (i)
the Sellers or the Company, without the prior written consent of Buyer, or
(ii) Buyer, without the prior written consent of either the Company (prior to
the Closing) or the Sellers Representative (at and after the Closing),
respectively. Any attempted assignment without obtaining such required consent
shall be null and void.

 



 

10.10 _Non-Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or
implied in this Agreement, and except as set forth in the Confidentiality
Agreement, all claims, causes of action, obligations or liabilities that may
be based upon, arise under or relate to this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements (including the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby) may
only be enforced against the Persons that are expressly identified as parties
to such Contract (the " _Contracting Parties_ "). No Person who is not a
Contracting Party, including any current, former or future equityholder,
incorporator, controlling person, general or limited partner, member, manager,
Affiliate, assignee or Representative of, and any financial advisor or lender
to, any Contracting Party, or any current, former or future equityholder,
incorporator, controlling person, general or limited partner, member, manager,
Affiliate, assignee or Representative of, and any financial advisor or lender
to, any of the foregoing or any of their respective successors, predecessors
or assigns (or any successors, predecessors or assigns of the foregoing)
(collectively, " _Non-Parties_ "), shall have any Liability (whether in Law or
in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise) for any claims, causes
of action, obligations, or liabilities arising under or relating to this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement (or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby) or based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement (or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby);
_provided_ , that nothing herein shall limit the rights of any party to the
Confidentiality Agreement under the Confidentiality Agreement. Without
limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted by

 



      
 

 



 

Law, except to the extent otherwise set forth in the Confidentiality
Agreement, (a) each Contracting Party hereby waives and releases any and all
rights, claims, demands, or causes of action that may otherwise be available,
whether at Law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, to avoid or
disregard the entity form of a Contracting Party or otherwise impose Liability
of a Contracting Party on any Non-Party, whether granted by statute or based
on theories of equity, agency, control, instrumentality, alter ego,
domination, sham, single business enterprise, piercing the veil, unfairness,
undercapitalization, or otherwise, in each case arising under, out of, in
connection with, or related in any manner to this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement (or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby) or based on, in
respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation, execution,
performance, or breach (other than as set forth in the Confidentiality
Agreement); and (b) each Contracting Party disclaims any reliance upon any
Non-Parties with respect to the performance of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement (or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby) or any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement (or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein
or otherwise, after the Closing, no party may seek to rescind this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement (or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby).

 



 

10.11 _Provision Respecting Legal Representation_. Buyer and the Company (on
its behalf and on behalf of the Company Group and the Sterling Company) hereby
waives, and agrees to cause its Affiliates to waive, any conflicts that may
arise in connection with STB representing any of the Sellers or their
respective Affiliates (including the Sellers Representative) after the Closing
as such representation may relate to Buyer, the Company Group or the Sterling
Company or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Buyer and
the Company (on behalf of itself and the Company Group and the Sterling
Company) hereby agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises after the
Closing between Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the
Sellers Representative and/or the Sellers, on the other hand, STB may
represent any or all of the Sellers Representative, the Sellers in such
dispute even though the interests of such Sellers Representative and the
Sellers may be directly adverse to Buyer or any of its respective Affiliates,
and even though STB formerly may have represented the Company Group and/or the
Sterling Company in a matter substantially related to such dispute. In
addition, all communications involving attorney-client confidences by the
Sellers or their respective Affiliates in the course of, and to the extent
relating to, the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be attorney-client
confidences that belong solely to the Sellers (and not the Company Group or
the Sterling Company). Accordingly, the members of the Company Group, the
Sterling Company and their respective Affiliates shall not have access to any
such communications, or to the files of STB relating to the engagement
described in this _Section 10.11_, whether or not the Closing shall have
occurred. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the
Closing, (i) the Sellers and their respective Affiliates (and not the Company
Group, the Sterling Company or any of their respective Affiliates) shall be
the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to such
engagement, and none of the members of the Company Group, the Sterling Company
or any of their respective Affiliates shall be a holder thereof, (ii) to the
extent that the files of STB in respect of such engagement constitute property
of the client, only the Sellers and their respective Affiliates (and not the
Company Group, the Sterling Company or any of their respective Affiliates)
shall hold such property rights and (iii) STB shall have no duty whatsoever to
reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to any of
the members of the

 



      
 

 



 

Company Group, the Sterling Company or any of their respective Affiliates by
reason of any attorney-client relationship between STB and any of the members
of the Company Group or the Sterling Company; _provided_ , that none of the
Sellers or their respect Affiliates may waive such privilege or exercise such
property rights without the prior written consent of the Sellers
Representative, on behalf of all of the Sellers.

 



 

10.12 _Consents_. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that certain consents to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be required from parties to
Contracts (including Material Contracts) to which the Sellers, the Company or
one of their respective Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound, and such
consents may have not been obtained. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the
Sellers and their Affiliates will not have any Liability whatsoever to Buyer
or its Affiliates (and Buyer and its Affiliates will not be entitled to assert
any claims) arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any consents
that may have been or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or because of the default, acceleration or
termination of any such Contract as a result thereof; _provided_ , that this
_Section 10.12_ shall not be deemed to modify the Companys representations
and warranties contained in _Article 4_. For the avoidance of doubt, the
obtaining of any such consents other than the Required Consents is not a
condition to the Closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

10.13 _Counterparts; Delivery by Facsimile or Email_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement and any amendment, restatement, supplement or other
modification hereto or waiver hereunder, (i) may be executed in any number of
counterparts (including by means of facsimile or email in .pdf format), each
of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement and all of
which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same
agreement and (ii) to the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile
machine or scanned pages via e-mail, shall be treated in all manner and
respect as an original contract and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person.

 



 

(b) At the request of any party hereto, each other party hereto shall re-
execute original forms hereof and deliver them to all other parties. No party
hereto shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or email to deliver a
signature or the fact that any signature or agreement was transmitted or
communicated through the use of facsimile machine or email as a defense to the
formation of a contract, and each such party forever waives any such defense.

 



 

(c) This Agreement is not binding unless and until signature pages are
executed, delivered and confirmed as released by each of the parties hereto,
which confirmation may be given by any Person designated on _Exhibit C_
hereto as having the authority to so confirm with respect to the parties
hereto.

 



 

10.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, CAUSE OF
ACTION, CLAIM, CROSS-CLAIM OR THIRD-PARTY CLAIM OR LEGAL PROCEEDING OF ANY
KIND (WHETHER AT LAW, IN EQUITY, IN CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE) THAT MAY

LAW, IN EQUITY, IN CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND

SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 10.14_.

ARTICLE 11

 



 

 _GUARANTY_

 



 

11.1 _Guarantor Representations_. Guarantor hereby represents and warrants to
Sellers as follows: Guarantor is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has
all requisite corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform
this Agreement. The execution and delivery by Guarantor of this Agreement has
been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on its
part.

 



      
 

 



 

This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Guarantor
and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligations of Guarantor,
enforceable against Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except as may be
limited by the Enforceability Exceptions. The execution, delivery and
performance by Guarantor of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (i) conflict with or
violate the Organizational Documents of Guarantor, (ii) require the consent of
any Person or (iii) conflict with or violate, in any material respect, any Law
applicable to Guarantor.

 



 

11.2 _Guaranty_. Subject to the provisions of this _Section 11.2_, Guarantor
hereby fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as primary obligor
and not merely as surety, to Sellers and the DandO Indemnitees the due and
punctual payment of any and all payment and other monetary obligations of
Buyer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (the " _Buyer Guaranteed
Obligations_ ") subject to the terms and limitations hereunder and thereunder.
Guarantor hereby acknowledges that, with respect to all of the Buyer
Guaranteed Obligations, this guaranty shall be a guaranty of payment and not
of collection and shall not be conditioned or contingent upon the pursuit of
any remedies against Buyer. Except as expressly provided in this _Section
11.2_, Guarantor hereby waives (to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law) promptness, diligence, presentment, demand of payment and performance,
filing of claims with a court in the event of a merger or bankruptcy of Buyer,
any right to require a proceeding first against Buyer, the benefit of
discussion, protest or notice, all suretyship defenses, and all demands
whatsoever, and covenants that this guaranty will not be discharged as to any
Buyer Guaranteed Obligation except by satisfaction of such obligation in full.
To the fullest extent permitted by Law, the obligations of Guarantor hereunder
shall not be affected by (a) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification
of, or any release from any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement or
the invalidity or unenforceability (in whole or in part) of this Agreement,
unless consented to in writing by Sellers and (b) any change in the existence
(corporate or otherwise) of Buyer or Guarantor or any insolvency, bankruptcy,
reorganization or similar proceeding affecting any of them or their assets;
_provided_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Guarantor shall have the
full benefit of all defenses, counterclaims, reductions, diminutions or
limitations available to Buyer pursuant to or arising from this Agreement,
except for those arising out of (A) any legal limitation, disability or
incapacity of Buyer, (B) any bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or
liquidation of Buyer, or (C) any unenforceability or invalidity of any of the
Buyer Guaranteed Obligations and (ii) Guarantor shall have the full benefit
of, and does not waive or relinquish its rights and remedies accorded under,
applicable statutes of limitation and repose. In the event that any payment to
Sellers or the DandO Indemnitees in respect of the Buyer Guaranteed Obligations
is rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any reason whatsoever (other
than in circumstances where Guarantor is not liable to make such payment),
Guarantor shall remain liable hereunder with respect to the Buyer Guaranteed
Obligations as if such payment had not been rescinded or returned. Guarantor
acknowledges that it will receive direct and indirect benefits from the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and that the waivers set
forth in this _Section 11.2_ are knowingly made in contemplation of such
benefits.
