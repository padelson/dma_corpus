                            COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES

          Section 5.1 Consents and Approvals.

               (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
     Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees to use, and will cause its
     Affiliates to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
     taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or
     advisable under Applicable Law to consummate and make effective the
     transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable
     including the preparation and filing of all forms, registrations and
     notices required to be filed by such party in order to consummate the
     transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the taking of such actions
     as are necessary to obtain any approvals, consents, orders, exemptions or
     waivers of Governmental Authorities required to be obtained by such party
     in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
     Each party shall promptly consult with the other with respect to, provide
     any necessary information with respect to, and provide copies of all
     filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity or any other
     information supplied by such party to a Governmental Entity in connection
     with this Agreement and the Transition Services Agreement and the
     transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

               (b) If any objections are asserted with respect to the
     transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Transition Services
     Agreement under any anti-competition Law or if any suit or proceeding is
     instituted or threatened by any Governmental Entity or any private party
     challenging any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
     Transition Services Agreement as violative of any


                                       22

<PAGE>

     anti-competition Law, each of Seller and Buyer shall use its reasonable
     best efforts to promptly resolve such objections. Notwithstanding anything
     to the contrary in this Agreement, none of Seller or any of its Affiliates
     shall have any obligation to hold separate or divest any property or assets
     of Seller or any of its Affiliates in connection with any such claim under
     anti-competition law. In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer shall, and
     shall cause its Affiliates to, take all action, including agreeing to hold
     separate or to divest any of the businesses or properties or assets of
     Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Equity Interests) and to
     terminate any existing relationships and contractual rights and
     obligations, as may be required (i) by the applicable Governmental Entity
     in order to resolve such objections as such Governmental Entity may have to
     such transactions under any anti-competition Law or (ii) by any domestic or
     foreign court or other tribunal, in any action or proceeding brought by a
     private party or Governmental Entity challenging such transactions as
     violative of any anti-competition Law, in order to avoid the entry of, or
     to effect the dissolution, vacating, lifting, altering or reversal of, any
     order that has the effect of restricting, preventing or prohibiting the
     consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
     Transition Services Agreement. In addition, Buyer shall, and shall cause
     its Affiliates to, vigorously defend any action or proceeding brought by a
     private party or Governmental Entity challenging the transactions
     contemplated hereby or by the Transition Services Agreement as violative of
     any anti-competition Law, in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
     dissolution, vacating, lifting, altering or reversal of, any order that has
     the effect of restricting, preventing or prohibiting the consummation of
     the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Transition Services
     Agreement (including by pursuing any available appeal process).

          Section 5.2 Further Assurances.

          On and after the date hereof, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate and use
     their respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all
     appropriate actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or
     appropriate to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated
     hereby, including the execution of any additional assignment or similar
     documents or instruments of transfer of any kind, the obtaining of consents
     which may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to carry out any of the
     provisions hereof and the taking of all such other actions as such party
     may reasonably be requested to take by the other party hereto from time to
     time, consistent with the terms of this Agreement and the Transition
     Services Agreement, in order to effectuate the provisions and purposes of
     this Agreement and the Transition Services Agreement and the transactions
     contemplated hereby and thereby. Included without limitation within the
     foregoing assurances is Seller's agreement to take such further actions to
     evidence delivery to Buyer of title to the pipeline owned by the Jackson
     Pipeline Company in form and scope that is customary for properties of this
     type including obtaining at Seller's cost an opinion of outside counsel
     confirming the reasonable nature of such title if such an opinion is deemed
     necessary in the joint opinion of Buyer and Seller. As further detailed in
     the Transition Services Agreement, Seller shall continue to receive, record
     and deposit receivables of the Entities and irrevocably instruct the
     Entities' bank(s) to transfer all receipts to such bank and accounts as
     designated by Buyer in writing and to forward to Buyer all correspondence
     and invoices received by Seller that are directed to any of the Entities.

          Section 5.3 Employee Matters.

               (a) Subject to Section 5.3(b) and Section 5.3(c) below, on the
     date hereof (unless previously done), Seller shall give notice to all
     Affected Employees


                                       23

<PAGE>

     that the active participation of the Affected Employees in the Seller's and
     Entities' employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements (such plans,
     programs and arrangements, the "Seller Plans") shall terminate on the date
     hereof, and the Entities shall terminate participation of Affected
     Employees in the Seller Plans as of the date hereof. In addition, Seller
     shall retain all Liabilities and assets that arise with respect to current
     and former employees of the Entities by virtue of their employment with the
     Sellers or their Affiliates prior to the date hereof, including without
     limitation under the Pension Plan for Employees of Consumers Energy and
     Other CMS Energy Companies.

               (b) As of the date hereof, Buyer shall cause the Entities to
     continue to employ all of the Affected Employees for a period of at least
     six (6) months from and after the date hereof.

               (c) With respect to those employee benefit plans of Buyer or its
     Affiliates ("Buyer Plans") in which Affected Employees may participate on
     or after the date hereof, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Entities to,
     credit prior service of the Affected Employees with the Entities or other
     Affiliates of Seller for purposes of eligibility and vesting under Buyer
     Plans and for all purposes with respect to vacation, sick days and
     severance under such Buyer Plans. Affected Employees shall also be given
     pro rata credit for any deductible or co-insurance payment amounts payable
     in respect of the Buyer Plan year in which the date hereof occurs, to the
     extent that, following the date hereof, they participate in any Buyer Plan
     during such plan year for which deductibles or co-payments are required.

               (d) Buyer and the Entities shall be responsible for all
     Liabilities and obligations under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
     Notification Act and similar foreign, state and local rules, statutes and
     ordinances resulting from the actions of Buyer and the Entities after the
     date hereof

               (e) CMS Energy Corporation or its Affiliates shall retain all
     assets that are accumulated as of date hereof under Financial Accounting
     Standards Board Statement 106 (and deposited in various VEBA accounts and
     401(h) accounts of Seller or its Affiliates). Further, Seller or its
     Affiliates shall retain the liability for post-employment benefits other
     than pensions ("PBOPs") for the benefit of former employees of the Entities
     who are retirees of the Entities as of the date hereof, and Affected
     Employees who are eligible to retire and qualified for benefits under PBOPs
     as of the date hereof, and Seller or its Affiliates shall retain the
     responsibility for providing post-retirement benefits to such employees
     pursuant to the eligibility requirements of the Seller Plans. It is the
     intent of the parties that Buyer shall have no obligation whatsoever with
     respect to pension or any other post-employment benefits that any employee
     of the Entities, whether current or retired, is entitled to as a result of
     employment with the Entities or its Affiliates prior to the date hereof.

          Section 5.4 Tax Covenants.

               (a) Tax Return Filings, Refunds, and Credits.


                                       24

<PAGE>

               (i) Seller shall timely prepare and file (or cause such
     preparation and filing) with the appropriate Tax authorities all Tax
     Returns (including any Consolidated Income Tax Returns) with respect to the
     Entities for Tax periods that end on or before the Cut-off Date (the
     "Seller Returns"), and will pay (or cause to be paid) all Taxes due with
     respect to the Seller Returns. The taxes shown on the Tax Returns shall be
     correct and complete insofar as the Entities are concerned.

               (ii) Buyer shall timely prepare and file (or cause such
     preparation and filing) with the appropriate Tax authorities all Tax
     Returns (the "Straddle Period Returns") with respect to the Entities for
     all Tax periods ending after the Cut-off Date that include the Cut-off Date
     (the "Straddle Period"). All Straddle Period Returns shall be prepared in
     accordance with past practice. Buyer shall provide Seller with copies of
     any Straddle Period Returns at least forty-five (45) days prior to the due
     date thereof (giving effect to any extensions thereto), accompanied by a
     statement (the "Straddle Statement") setting forth and calculating in
     reasonable detail the Pre-Cut-off Taxes as defined below. If Seller agrees
     with the Straddle Period Return and Straddle Statement, Seller shall pay to
     Buyer (or Buyer shall pay to Seller, if appropriate) an amount equal to the
     Pre-Cut-off Taxes as shown on the Straddle Statement not later than two (2)
     Business Days before the due date (including any extensions thereof) for
     payment of Taxes with respect to such Straddle Period Return. If, within
     fifteen (15) days of the receipt of the Straddle Period Return and Straddle
     Statement, Seller notifies Buyer that it disputes the manner of preparation
     of the Straddle Period Return or the amount calculated in the Straddle
     Statement, then Buyer and Seller shall attempt to resolve their
     disagreement within the five (5) days following Seller's notification or
     Buyer of such disagreement. If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve their
     disagreement, the dispute shall be submitted to a mutually agreed upon
     nationally recognized independent accounting firm, whose expense shall be
     borne equally by Buyer and Seller, for resolution, if possible, within
     twenty (20) days of such submission. If the parties have not agreed on an
     independent accounting firm within fifteen days following Seller's
     notification of Buyer of such disagreement, on the request of any party
     such independent accounting firm shall be appointed by the ICC Centre. Any
     independent accounting firm appointed by the ICC Centre shall be an
     impartial and disinterested senior partner in an internationally recognized
     accounting firm. The decision of such accounting firm with respect to such
     dispute shall be binding upon Buyer and Seller, and Seller shall pay to
     Buyer (or Buyer shall pay to Seller, if appropriate) an amount equal to the
     Pre-Cut-off Taxes as decided by such accounting firm not later than two (2)
     Business Days before the due date (including any extensions thereof) for
     payment of Taxes with respect to such Straddle Period Return.

               (iii) From and after the Cut-off Date, Buyer and its Affiliates
     (including the Entities) will not file any amended Tax Return, carryback
     claim, or other adjustment request with respect to the Entities for any Tax
     period that includes or ends on or before the Cut-off Date unless Seller
     consents in writing; provided, however, that with respect to any Straddle
     Period Return, such


                                       25

<PAGE>

     consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, provided Buyer has made
     arrangements to the reasonable satisfaction of Seller to make Seller whole
     for any detriment or cost incurred (or to be incurred) by Seller as a
     result of such amended Tax Return, carryback claim or other adjustment
     request.

               (iv) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Taxes of
     the Entities that are payable with respect to any Straddle Period, the
     portion of any such Taxes that constitutes "Pre-Cut-off Taxes" shall be the
     excess of (A) (i) in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or
     related to income or receipts or (y) imposed in connection with any sale,
     transfer or assignment or any deemed sale, transfer or assignment of
     property (real or personal, tangible or intangible) be deemed equal to the
     amount that would be payable if the Tax period ended on the Cut-off Date
     and (ii) in the case of Taxes (other than those described in clause (i))
     imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the business or assets of the
     Entities, be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle
     Period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the
     amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding Tax period) multiplied
     by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the
     portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Cut-off Date and the
     denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle
     Period over (B) any prepayment or advances of Taxes or any payments of
     estimated Taxes with respect to the Straddle Period. For purposes of clause
     (i) of the preceding sentence, any exemption, deduction, credit or other
     item that is calculated on an annual basis shall be allocated to the
     portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Cut-off Date on a pro rata
     basis determined by multiplying the total amount of such item allocated to
     the Straddle Period by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
     calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Cut-off
     Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the
     entire Straddle Period. Pre-Cut-off Taxes include any Taxes attributable to
     a Person that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes
     as if such Person allocated Tax items to its partners in a manner
     consistent with this Section 5.4(b)(iv). In the case of any Tax based upon
     or measured by capital (including net worth or long-term debt) or
     intangibles, any amount thereof required to be allocated under this Section
     5.6(b)(iv) shall be computed by reference to the level of such items on the
     Cut-off Date. The parties hereto will, to the extent permitted by
     Applicable Law, elect with the relevant Tax authority to treat a portion of
     any Straddle Period as a short taxable period ending as of the close of
     business on the Cut-off Date. For purposes of this Agreement, "Post-Cut-off
     Taxes" shall include any Taxes of the Entities that are payable with
     respect to a Straddle Period, except for the portion of
     any such Taxes that constitutes Pre-Cut-off Taxes. For avoidance of doubt,
     Michigan property taxes shall be prorated using the "statutory" method.

               (v) Seller and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate in preparing and
     filing all Tax Returns with respect to the Entities, including maintaining
     and making available to each other all records reasonably necessary


                                       26

<PAGE>

     in connection with Taxes of the Entities and in resolving all disputes and
     audits with respect to all Tax periods relating to Taxes of the Entities.

               (vi) For a period of seven (7) years after the Cut-off Date, the
     Seller and its Representatives shall have reasonable access to the books
     and records (including the right to make extracts thereof) of the Entities
     to the extent that such books and records relate to Taxes and to the extent
     that such access may reasonably be required by Seller in connection with
     matters relating to or affected by the operation of the Entities prior to
     the Cut-off Date. Such access shall be afforded by Buyer upon receipt of
     reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours. If Buyer shall
     desire to dispose of any of such books and records prior to the expiration
     of such seven-year period, Buyer shall, prior to such disposition, give
     Seller a reasonable opportunity, at Seller's expense, to segregate and
     remove such books and records as Seller may select.

               (vii) If an Indemnified Party actually receives a refund or
     credit or other reimbursement with respect to Taxes for which it would be
     indemnified under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall pay over such
     refund or credit or other reimbursement to the Indemnifying Party.

               (viii) Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Entities to not,
     make, amend or revoke any Tax election if such action would reasonably be
     expected to adversely affect any of Seller or its Affiliates with respect
     to any Tax period ending on or before the Cut-off Date or for the
     Pre-Cut-off portion of any Straddle Period or any Tax refund or credit with
     respect thereto.

               (ix) For purposes of this Agreement a "Consolidated Income Tax
     Return" is any income Tax Return filed with respect to any consolidated,
     combined, affiliated or unified group provided for under Section 1501 of
     the Code and the Treasury Regulations under Section 1502 of the Code, or
     any comparable provisions of Applicable Law, other than any income Tax
     Return that includes only any one of the Entities.

               (b) Indemnity for Taxes.

               (i) Seller hereby agrees to indemnify the Buyer and its
     Affiliates against and hold them harmless from all liability for (i) all
     Taxes imposed on the Entities with respect to Tax periods ending on or
     before the Cut-off Date, (ii) Pre-Cut-off Taxes with respect to any
     Straddle Period, and (iii) all Taxes that are attributable to Seller or any
     member (other than the Entities) of an affiliated, consolidated, combined
     or unitary Tax group of which at least one of the Entities was a member
     prior to the Cut-off Date that is imposed under Treasury Regulation Section
     1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Tax law) by
     reason of the Entities being included in any such Tax group.

               (ii) Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify Seller and its Affiliates
     against and hold them harmless from all liability for (A) all Taxes of the


                                       27
<PAGE>

     Entities with respect to all Tax periods beginning after the Cut-off Date,
     (B) Post-Cut-off Taxes with respect to any Straddle Period, and (C)
     Transfer Taxes.

               (iii) The obligation of Seller to indemnify and hold harmless
     Buyer, on the one hand, and the obligations of Buyer to indemnify and hold
     harmless Seller, on the other hand, pursuant to this Section 5.4, shall
     terminate upon the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations
     with respect to the Tax Liabilities in question (giving effect to any
     waiver, mitigation or extension thereof).

               (iv) Any indemnification obligation under this Section 5.4(b)
     which relates to one of the Entities that is not wholly owned by Seller
     shall be reduced pro rata to reflect the elimination of the amount of Tax
     liability equivalent to the third-party's ownership percentage in such
     Entity.

               (c) Certain Payments. Buyer and Seller agree to treat (and cause
     their Affiliates to treat) any payment under this Section 5.4 as an
     adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes.

               (d) Contests.

               (i) After the Cut-off Date, Seller and Buyer each shall notify
     the other party in writing within ten (10) days of the commencement of any
     Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding affecting the Taxes of
     any of the Entities that, if determined adversely to the taxpayer (the "Tax
     Indemnified Party") or after the lapse of time would be grounds for
     indemnification under this Section 5.4 by the other party (the "Tax
     Indemnifying Party" and a "Tax Claim"). Such notice shall contain factual
     information describing any asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail and
     shall include copies of any notice or other document received from any Tax
     authority in respect of any such asserted Tax liability. Failure to give
     such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided in this
     Section 5.4 except to the extent the Tax Indemnifying Party shall have been
     prejudiced as a result of such failure (except that the Tax Indemnifying
     Party shall not be liable for any expenses incurred during the period in
     which the Tax Indemnified Party failed to give such notice). Thereafter,
     the Tax Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Tax Indemnifying Party, as
     promptly as possible but in no event later than ten (10) days after the Tax
     Indemnified Party's receipt thereof, copies of all relevant notices and
     documents (including court papers) received by the Tax Indemnified Party.

               (ii) In the case of an audit or administrative or judicial
     proceeding involving any asserted liability for Taxes relating to any
     Taxable years or periods ending on or before the Cut-off Date or any
     Straddle Period, Seller shall have the right, at its expense, to control
     the conduct of such audit or proceeding; provided, however, that (A) with
     respect to Straddle Periods, Seller shall keep Buyer reasonably informed
     with respect to the status of such audit or proceeding and provide Buyer
     with copies of all written correspondence with


                                       28

<PAGE>

     respect to such audit or proceeding in a timely manner and (B) if such
     audit or proceeding would be reasonably expected to result in a material
     increase in Tax liability of the Entities for which Buyer would be liable
     under this Section 5.6, Buyer may participate in the conduct of such audit
     or proceeding at its own expense.

               (iii) In the case of an audit or administrative or judicial
     proceeding involving any asserted liability for Taxes relating to any
     Taxable years or periods beginning after the Cut-off Date, Buyer shall have
     the right, at its expense, to control the conduct of such audit or
     proceeding.

               (iv) Buyer and Seller shall reasonably cooperate in connection
     with any Tax Claim, and such cooperation shall include the provision to the
     Tax Indemnifying Party of records and information which are reasonably
     relevant to such Tax Claim and making employees available on a mutually
     convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
     material provided hereunder.

               (e) Transfer and Similar Taxes. Notwithstanding any other
     provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, all sales, use, transfer,
     gains, stamp, duties, recording and similar Taxes (collectively, "Transfer
     Taxes") incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
     Agreement shall be borne by Buyer, and Buyer shall accurately file all
     necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to Transfer
     Taxes and timely pay all such Transfer Taxes. If required by Applicable
     Law, Seller will join in the execution of any such Return. Buyer shall
     provide copies of any Tax Returns with respect to Transfer Taxes to Seller
     no later than fifteen (15) days after the due dates of such Tax Returns.

               (f) Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements. On or prior to the
     Cut-off Date, Seller shall cause all Tax sharing agreements between the
     Seller or any of its Affiliates (as determined immediately after the
     Cut-off Date) on the one hand, and the Entities on the other hand, to be
     terminated, and all obligations thereunder shall be settled, and no
     additional payments shall be made under any provisions thereof after the
     Cut-off Date.

               (g) Special Rule. For purposes of applying this Section 5.4, when
     applying the definitions "Pre-Cut-off Taxes," "Post-Cut-off Taxes," and
     "Straddle Period," the term "Cut-off Date" as used in such definitions
     shall mean December 31, 2006.

          Section 5.5 Maintenance of Insurance Policies.

               (a) Seller and Buyer agree that Casualty Insurance Claims
     relating to the businesses of the Entities (including reported claims and
     including incurred but not reported claims) will remain with the Entities
     immediately following the consummation of the transaction contemplated in
     this Agreement. For purposes hereof, "Casualty Insurance Claims" shall mean
     workers' compensation, auto liability, general

     liability and products liability claims and claims for damages caused to
     the facilities of the Entities generally insured under all risk, real
     property, boiler and mechanical breakdown insurance coverage which are
     disclosed on Section 5.6(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter. The Casualty
     Insurance Claims are subject to the provisions of policies of insurance
     with insurance carriers and contractual arrangements with insurance
     adjusters maintained by Seller or its Affiliates prior to the date hereof
     (collectively, the "Insurance Policies"). With respect to the Casualty
     Insurance Claims, the following procedures shall apply: (i) Seller or its
     Affiliates shall continue to administer, adjust, settle and pay, on behalf
     of the Entities, all Casualty Insurance Claims with dates of occurrence
     prior to the date of hereof and (ii) Seller shall invoice Buyer at the end
     of each month for Casualty Insurance Claims paid on behalf of the Entities
     by Seller. In the event that Buyer does not pay, or cause to be paid, to
     Seller such amount due within fifteen (15) days of such invoice, interest
     at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum shall accrue on the amount of
     such invoice. Casualty Insurance Claims to be paid by Seller hereunder
     shall include all costs necessary to settle claims including compensatory,
     medical, legal and other allocated expenses. In the event that any Casualty
     Insurance Claims exceeds a deductible or self-insured retention under the
     Insurance Policies, Seller shall be entitled to the benefit of any
     insurance proceeds that may be available to discharge any portion of such
     Casualty Insurance Claim.

               (b) Seller makes no representation or warranty with respect to
     the applicability, validity or adequacy of any Insurance Policies, and
     Seller shall not be responsible to Buyer or any of its Affiliates for the
     failure of any insurer to pay under any such Insurance Policy.

               (c) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to provide or shall be
     construed as providing a benefit or release to any insurer or claims
     service organization of any obligation under any Insurance Policies. Seller
     and Buyer confirm that the sole intention of this Section 5.6 is to divide
     and allocate the benefits and obligations under the Insurance Policies
     between them as of the date hereof and not to effect, enhance or diminish
     the rights and obligations of any insurer or claims service organization
     thereunder. Nothing herein shall be construed as creating or permitting any
     insurer or claims service organization the right of subrogation against
     Seller or Buyer or any of their Affiliates in respect of payments made by
     one to the other under any Insurance Policy.

               (d) If Buyer requests a copy of an Insurance Policy relating to a
     pending or threatened Casualty Insurance Claim, Seller shall provide a copy
     of all relevant insurance policies which insure such Casualty Insurance
     Claims within five (5) Business Days, provided, that if Seller cannot
     provide such policy within five (5) days after exercising reasonable best
     efforts to locate such policy, Seller shall continue to exercise its
     reasonable best efforts to provide such policy to Buyer as soon as possible
     thereafter.

          Section 5.6 Transfers of Title and Possession of Assets of Entities.

          In those cases where a Material Contract, deed, easement, Permit,
     right of way or other asset was entered into or acquired for the benefit of
     one of the Entities or its business by any person other than one of the
     Entities, including an Affiliate of one of the Entities, and the rights and
     obligations of such Material Contract, deed, easement, Permit or other
     asset have not been assigned to one of the Entities as of the date hereof,
     Seller will use its reasonable best efforts at its reasonable expense to
     ensure that such assignments are made as soon as reasonably practicable.

          Section 5.7 Preservation of Records.

               (a) Buyer agrees that it shall, at its own expense, preserve and
     keep the records held by it relating to the respective businesses of the
     Entities that could reasonably be required after the consummation of the
     transaction contemplated in this Agreement by Seller for the time periods
     required pursuant to the applicable document retention program in effect on
     the date hereof (a copy of which has been provided to Buyer); provided,
     however, that upon expiration of such period, as applicable, Buyer shall
     give written notice to Seller if it or the custodian of such books and
     records proposes to destroy or dispose of the same. Seller shall have the
     opportunity for a period of thirty (30) days after receiving such notice to
     elect to have some or all of such books and records delivered, at Seller's
     expense and risk, to a location chosen by Seller. In addition, Buyer shall
     make such records available to Seller as may reasonably be required by
     Seller in connection with, among other things, any insurance claim, legal
     proceeding or governmental investigation relating to the respective
     businesses of Seller and its Affiliates, including the Entities. Seller
     agrees to maintain the confidentiality of all information provided by Buyer
     or the Entities hereunder during the time periods provided for in this
     Section.

               (b) Seller agrees that it shall, at its own expense, preserve and
     keep the records held by it relating to the respective business of the
     Entities which are contained in the records of Seller or its Affiliates
     that could reasonably be required after the consummation of the transaction
     contemplated by this Agreement by Seller for the time periods required
     pursuant to the applicable document retention program in effect on the date
     hereof. In addition, Seller shall make such records available to Buyer as
     may reasonably be required by Buyer in connection with, among other things,
     any insurance claim, legal proceeding or governmental investigation
     relating to the Entities.

          Section 5.8 Public Statements.

          No public or private release, announcement or regulatory filing
     concerning the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any of
     the parties without the prior consent of the other parties (which consent
     shall not unreasonably withheld), except for such press release,
     announcement or regulatory filing as is required by law, court process or
     stock exchange rule to be made by the party proposing to issue the same, in
     which case such party shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult in
     good faith with the other party prior to the issuance of any such press
     release, announcement or filing.

          Section 5.9 Use of Corporate Name; Transitional Use of Seller's Name.

          Promptly after the consummation of the transaction contemplated
     hereby, Buyer shall cause each of the Entities to make any necessary legal
     filings with the appropriate Governmental Authorities to register the
     change in their corporate names to names that do not include "CMS". Buyer
     and its Affiliates shall hold harmless and indemnify Seller and any of its
     Affiliates against all Damages resulting from or arising in connection with
     the use by Buyer or any of its Affiliates of the "CMS" name as provided in
     this Section 5.11.

          Section 5.10 Release of Guarantees.

          Unless previously done, Buyer shall, as soon as reasonably
     practicable, either (a) arrange for substitute letters of credit,
     guarantees and other obligations on commercially reasonable terms to
     replace in all respects the indemnities, performance bonds, performance
     guarantees, other guaranty obligations, letters of credit and other similar
     arrangements of Seller or its Affiliates (collectively, the "Released
     Parties") in favor of any of the Entities (collectively, "Guarantees" as
     further disclosed in Section 5.10 of the Seller Disclosure Letter) or (b)
     assume all obligations under each such Guarantee, obtaining from the
     creditor or other counter-party a full release of the Released Parties. As
     soon as reasonably practicable, Buyer shall terminate, or cause Buyer or
     one of its Affiliates to be substituted in all respects for the Released
     Parties in respect of, all obligations of the Released Parties under any
     such Guarantee. Buyer shall, to the extent the beneficiary or counter-party
     under any Guarantee refuses to accept such a substitute letter of credit,
     (i) obtain a letter of credit on behalf of Buyer and (ii) indemnify and
     hold harmless the Released Parties for any Losses arising from payments
     under such Guarantees that relate to events or circumstances arising after
     the date hereof. To the extent that any Released Party has performance
     obligations under any such Guarantee, Buyer shall (i) perform such
     obligations on behalf of such Released Party or (ii) otherwise take such
     action as reasonably requested by Seller so as to put such Released Party
     in the same position as if Buyer, and not such Released Party, had
     performed or was performing such obligations.

          Section 5.11 Confidentiality.

          Each of Buyer and Seller will hold, and will cause its Representatives
     to hold, in confidence, unless compelled to disclose by judicial or
     administrative process or by other requirements of Law, all confidential
     documents and information concerning the Entities furnished to Buyer in
     connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except to
     the extent that such information can be shown to have been (i) previously
     known on a non-confidential basis by Buyer or Seller, (ii) in the public
     domain through no fault of Buyer or Seller or (iii) later lawfully acquired
     by Buyer or Seller from sources other than the the other party; provided
     that Buyer may disclose such information to its Representatives in
     connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so long as
     such Persons are informed by Buyer of the confidential nature of such
     information and are directed by Buyer to treat such information
     confidentially. The obligation of each of Buyer and Seller to hold any such
     information in confidence shall


                                       32

<PAGE>

     be satisfied if it exercises the same care with respect to such information
     as it would take to preserve the confidentiality of their own similar
     information.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                            SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION

          Section 6.1 Survival.

               (a) All representations and warranties contained herein shall
     survive for a period of twelve (12) months following the date hereof except
     for the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Sections 3.1,
     3.2, and 3.3, and of Buyer in Sections 4.1 and 4.2, which shall survive
     indefinitely and those in Section 3.15 which shall survive for the
     applicable statutes of limitation periods referred to therein (such periods
     set forth above are referred to herein as the relevant "Indemnity Period").
     The parties intend to shorten the statute of limitations and agree that no
     claims or causes of action may be brought against Seller, Buyer or any of
     their respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling
     persons, agents or Representatives based upon, directly or indirectly, any
     of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement after the
     Indemnity Period; provided that if a written notice of claim for
     indemnification is made during the applicable Indemnity Period in
     accordance with this Article VIII, such claim shall survive until its
     resolution.

               (b) All covenants and agreements contained herein that by their
     terms are to be performed in whole or in part, or which prohibit actions,
     subsequent to the date hereof, shall survive the consummation of the
     transaction contemplated hereby in accordance with their terms.

               (c) Seller hereby covenants that CMS Enterprises Company shall
     maintain a consolidated net worth of at least $10,000,000 for a period of
     twelve (12) months following the date hereof.

          Section 6.2 Indemnification.

               (a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VI,
     subsequent to the consummation of the transaction contemplated hereby,
     Seller shall indemnify, defend, save and hold harmless Buyer and its
     Affiliates, their respective successors and permitted assigns, and their
     officers and directors (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified Parties"),
     from and against any and all Damages incurred by a Buyer Indemnified Party
     arising out of, resulting from or incurred in connection with:

               (i) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of
     Seller contained in this Agreement, in each case, when made or deemed made;
     and

               (ii) any breach in any material respect by Seller of any covenant
     or agreement contained in this Agreement.

<PAGE>

               (b) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VI,
     subsequent to the consummation of the transaction contemplated by this
     Agreement, Buyer shall indemnify, defend, save and hold harmless Seller and
     its Affiliates, their respective successors and permitted assigns, and
     their officers and directors (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified
     Parties") from and against any and all Damages to the extent incurred by
     the Seller Indemnified Party arising out of, resulting from or incurred in
     connection with:

               (i) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of
     such Buyer contained in this Agreement, in each case, when made or deemed
     made. For the avoidance of doubt, it is expressly understood that each of
     Lucid and Michigan Pipeline and Processing, LLC shall be severally, and not
     jointly, liable for Damages incurred by a Seller Indemnified Party as a
     result of a breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by
     such Person or for the breach of confidentiality obligations governed by
     Section 5.15 and, as a result, a Seller Indemnified Party shall not be
     entitled to make a Claim, seek contribution, assert joint and several
     liability or otherwise seek indemnification against the other Buyer based
     on such breach or inaccuracy or breach of confidentiality obligations; and

               (ii) any breach in any material respect by Buyer of any covenant
     or agreement contained in this Agreement.

               (c) Any Person providing indemnification pursuant to the
     provisions of this Section 6.2 is referred to herein as an "Indemnifying
     Party," and any Person entitled to be indemnified pursuant to the
     provisions of this Section 6.2 is referred to herein as an "Indemnified
     Party."

               (d) Seller's indemnification obligations contained in Section
     6.2(a)(i) shall not apply to any Claim for Damages unless and until the
     aggregate of all such Damages exceeds $300,000 (the "Threshold Amount"), in
     which event Seller's indemnity obligation contained in Section 6.2(a)(i)
     shall apply to all Claims for Damages in excess of the Threshold Amount,
     subject to a maximum liability to Seller, in the aggregate, of $5,000,000
     (the "Cap Amount"); provided, however, that any Claims for Damages for
     breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.1,
     Section 3.2 and Section 3.3, shall not be subject to the Threshold Amount,
     Cap Amount or Minimum Claim Amount (as defined below). Damages relating to
     any single breach or series of related breaches of Seller's representations
     and warranties shall not constitute Damages, and therefore shall not be
     applied towards the Threshold Amount or be indemnifiable hereunder, unless
     such Damages relating to any single breach or series of related breaches
     exceed $25,000 (the "Minimum Claim Amount").

               (e) Buyer's indemnification obligations contained in Section
     6.2(b)(i) shall not apply to any Claim for Damages unless and until the
     aggregate of all such Damages equals the Threshold Amount, in which event
     Buyer's indemnification obligation contained in Section 862(b)(i) shall
     apply to all Claims for Damages in excess of the Threshold Amount, subject
     to a maximum liability to the


                                       34

<PAGE>

     Buyer, in the aggregate, of the Cap Amount. Damages relating to any single
     breach or series of related breaches of Buyer's representations and
     warranties shall not constitute Damages, and therefore shall not be applied
     towards the Threshold Amount or be indemnifiable hereunder, unless such
     Damages relating to any single breach or series of related breaches exceed
     the Minimum Claim Amount.

               (f) The indemnification obligations of each party hereto under
     this Section 6.2 shall inure to the benefit of the Buyer Indemnified
     Parties and Seller Indemnified Parties, and such Buyer Indemnified Parties
     and Seller Indemnified Parties shall be obligated to keep and perform the
     obligations imposed on an Indemnified Party by this Section 6.2, on the
     same terms as are applicable to such other party.

               (g) In all cases in which a Person is entitled to be indemnified
     in accordance with this Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall be under a
     duty to take all commercially reasonable measures to mitigate all losses.

               (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, claims
     for indemnification with respect to Tax matters shall be governed by the
     provisions of Section 5.4 and claims for Environmental matters shall be
     governed by Section 6.6 of this Agreement, but in each such case the
     indemnification obligations for each party hereto shall remain subject to
     the remaining provisions of Section 6.2 including without limitation the
     application of the Cap Amount, Threshold Amount and Minimum Claim Amount.

               (i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no
     event shall any Indemnified Party be entitled to indemnification pursuant
     to this Article VI to the extent any Damages were attributable to such
     Indemnified Party's own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

               (j) The remedies provided in this Article VI shall be deemed the
     sole and exclusive remedies of the parties, from and after the date hereof,
     with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

          Section 6.3 Calculation of Damages.

               (a) The amount of any Damages suffered by any party hereto shall
     be reduced by (i) any amount that is reserved for sums held in reserve in
     respect of the indemnifiable event on the balance sheet of the Entities, as
     applicable, as of December 31, 2006 to the extent such Damages are suffered
     by a Buyer Indemnified Party, or (ii) any amount that an Indemnified Party
     is entitled to receive with respect thereto under any third party insurance
     coverage or from any other party alleged to be responsible therefor.

               (b) If an Indemnified Party makes a claim for indemnification
     under this Article VI, the Indemnified Party shall use its reasonable best
     efforts to collect any amounts available under such insurance coverage and
     from such other party alleged to have responsibility. If an Indemnified
     Party receives an amount under insurance coverage or from such other party
     with respect to Damages at any time subsequent to any


                                       35

<PAGE>

     indemnification provided by Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, pursuant
     to this Article VI, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse
     the Indemnifying Party for any payment made or expense incurred by the
     Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such indemnification up to
     such amount received by the Indemnified Party, but net of any expenses
     incurred by the Indemnified Party in collecting such amount. To the extent
     the Indemnifying Party makes any indemnification payment pursuant to this
     Article VII in respect of Damages for which an Indemnified Party has a
     right to recover against a third party (including an insurance company),
     the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to the right of the Indemnified
     Party to seek and obtain recovery from such third party; provided, however,
     that if the Indemnifying Party shall be prohibited from such subrogation,
     the Indemnified Party shall seek recovery from such third party on the
     Indemnifying Party's behalf and pay any such recovery to the Indemnifying
     Party net of expenses.

          Section 6.4 Procedures for Third-Party Claims.

          The obligations of any Indemnifying Party to indemnify any Indemnified
     Party under this Article VI with respect to Claim for Damages by third
     parties (including Governmental Entities) (a "Third-Party Claim"), shall be
     subject to the following terms and conditions:

               (a) The Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party
     written notice of any such Third-Party Claim reasonably promptly after
     learning of such Third-Party Claim, and the Indemnifying Party may, at its
     option, undertake the defense thereof by Representatives of its own
     choosing and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party, and shall
     provide written notice of any such undertaking to the Indemnified Party.
     Failure to give prompt written notice of a Third-Party Claim hereunder
     shall not affect the Indemnifying Party's obligations under this Article
     VI, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced
     by such failure to give prompt written notice. The Indemnified Party shall,
     and shall cause its employees and Representatives to, cooperate reasonably
     with the Indemnifying Party in connection with the settlement or defense of
     such Third-Party Claim and shall provide the Indemnifying Party with all
     available information and documents concerning such Third-Party Claim. The
     Indemnifying Party shall provide the Indemnified Party with copies of all
     non-privileged communications and other information in respect of the
     Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party, within thirty (30) days after
     written notice of any such Third-Party Claim, fails to assume the defense
     of such Third-Party Claim, or, after assuming defense, negligently fails to
     defend and fails to call after reasonable written notice of the same, the
     Indemnified Party against whom such Third-Party Claim has been made shall
     (upon further written notice to the Indemnifying Party) have the right to
     undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claim
     on behalf of and for the account and risk, and at the expense, of the
     Indemnifying Party, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party to
     assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim at any time prior to
     settlement, compromise or final determination thereof upon written notice
     to the Indemnified Party.


                                       36

<PAGE>

               (b) Anything in this Section 6.4 to the contrary notwithstanding,
     (i) the Indemnified Party shall not settle a Third-Party Claim for which it
     is indemnified without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party,
     which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed
     and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement or
     compromise of any action, suit or proceeding, or consent to the entry of
     any judgment for relief other than monetary damages to be borne by the
     Indemnifying Party, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
     Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
     delayed.

          Section 6.5 Procedures for Inter-Party Claims.

          In the event that an Indemnified Party determines that it has a Claim
     for Damages against an Indemnifying Party hereunder (other than as a result
     of a Third-Party Claim), the Indemnified Party shall give reasonably prompt
     written notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party, specifying the amount of
     such Claim and any relevant facts and circumstances relating thereto, and
     such notice shall be promptly given even if the nature or extent of the
     Damages is not then known. The notification shall be subsequently
     supplemented within a reasonable time as additional information regarding
     the Claim or the nature or extent of Damages resulting therefrom becomes
     available to the Indemnified Party. Any failure to give such reasonably
     prompt notice or supplement thereto or to provide any such facts and
     circumstances will not waive any rights of the Indemnified Party, except to
     the extent that the rights of the Indemnifying Party are actually
     materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
     Party shall attempt to negotiate in good faith for a thirty-day (30-day)
     period regarding the resolution of any disputed Claims for Damages. If for
     any reason, such dispute cannot be resolved by negotiation, on the request
     of any party it shall be resolved by arbitration in accordance with Section
     9.8 herein. Promptly following the final determination of the amount of any
     Damages claimed by the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party, subject
     to the limitations of the Minimum Claim Amount, Threshold Amount and the
     Cap Amount, shall pay such Damages to the Indemnified Party by wire
     transfer of immediately available funds.

          Section 6.6 Special Indemnification Provision Relating to
     Environmental Matters.

               (a) Buyer shall indemnify and hold the Seller harmless from all
     Damages arising in any way from the matters disclosed in Section 6.6(a) of
     the Seller Disclosure Letter. This includes, without limitation, all
     Damages arising from non-compliance with, or remediation under, any
     Environmental Law that arise out of actions or omissions that occurred
     before the date hereof and that have been disclosed to Buyer in Section
     6.6(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter. It is further agreed that nothing
     herein shall be deemed to require Seller to pursue any insurance or other
     third party claims, or, if received, to pay over any insurance or other
     third party proceeds to Buyer, in connection with the foregoing matters.


                                       37

<PAGE>

               (b) Buyer shall indemnify and hold the Seller harmless from all
     Damages resulting from non-compliance with, or remediation under, any
     Environmental Law that arise out of actions or omissions that occur after
     the date hereof.

               (c) Seller shall indemnify and hold Buyer harmless from all
     Damages under any Environmental Law that arise out of actions or omissions
     that occurred before the date hereof but were not disclosed in the Seller
     Disclosure Letter, if they relate to matters as to which written
     notification is given by Buyer to Seller during a period ending one year
     after the date hereof.

          To the extent, if any, that Seller may have responsibility for
     responding to any non-compliance or requirement for remediation under any
     Environmental Law with respect to a period for which it has indemnification
     obligations hereunder, Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with environmental
     response activities of Seller on the property of the Entities being
     transferred pursuant to this Agreement. Buyer shall ensure that Seller has
     reasonable access at all such times to investigate, monitor, and remediate
     said property, and to install, operate, and maintain facilities for the
     containment or treatment of the soil and groundwater, and to perform other
     environmental remediation and response activities, which shall not
     unreasonably interfere with the business of the Buyer or the Entities. In
     the event of an environmental remediation with respect to a period for
     which Seller may have indemnification obligations hereunder, Seller may
     elect to perform a cleanup in accordance with applicable industrial cleanup
     standards or (if applicable at the time of cleanup) commercial III or IV
     cleanup standards under the Michigan Natural Resources and Environmental
     Protection Act, Part 201 (Part 201), or similar standards which may be
     allowed under Michigan law in the future. In connection with such a
     cleanup, Buyer agrees to impose restrictions upon future use of the
     property, if required, including the restrictions required under Mich.
     Comp. Laws Section 324.20120a(1)(b) or (d). These may be included in a
     declaration of restrictive covenants, in the form approved by the Michigan
     Department of Environmental Quality, and which must be signed by Buyer and
     filed with the Register of Deeds. By way of example and not of limitation,
     these may include restrictions on site uses to commercial or industrial
     uses consistent with the cleanup standards, restrictions on groundwater
     use, and provisions for appropriate management of soils in accordance with
     the requirements of Part 201, provided, however, (i) Seller shall conduct
     any and all such investigation, monitoring, and remediation in compliance
     with applicable Environmental Laws; (ii) cleanup standards or cleanup
     criteria applicable to any remedial action by Seller at the property shall
     not be in any way inconsistent with current use of the subject property or
     expansion of uses of a similar nature at the property; (iii) no
     restrictions, declarations or covenants to be imposed on the subject
     property or recorded in the public registry shall be in any way
     inconsistent with current use of the subject property or expansion of uses
     of a similar nature at the property; and (iv) reasonable efforts shall be
     made to minimize the applicable area for any restrictions, declarations or
     covenants to be imposed on the subject property or recorded in the public
     registry by limiting them to portions of the property that are subject to
     such remedial actions.

     as provided by this Section 7.8.


                                       41

<PAGE>

               (a) If the Dispute has not been resolved by executive officer
     negotiation within thirty (30) days of the disputing party's notice
     requesting negotiation, or if the parties fail to meet within twenty (20)
     days from delivery of said notice, such Dispute shall be submitted to and
     finally settled by arbitration in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration
     of the International Chamber of Commerce in Detroit, Michigan ("ICC") then
     in effect (the "Rules"), except as modified herein.

               (b) The arbitration shall be held, and the award shall be
     rendered, in the English language. There shall be three arbitrators, one of
     whom shall be nominated by each of Buyer and Seller in accordance with the
     Rules. The two party appointed arbitrators shall have thirty (30) days from
     the confirmation of the nomination of the second arbitrator to agree on the
     nomination of a third arbitrator who shall serve as chair of the arbitral
     tribunal. On the request of any party, any arbitrator not timely appointed
     in accordance with this Agreement or the Rules shall be appointed by the
     ICC.

               (c) The award shall be final and binding upon the parties as from
     the date rendered, and shall be the sole and exclusive remedy between the
     parties regarding any claims, counterclaims, issues, or accounting
     presented to the arbitral tribunal. Judgment upon any award may be entered
     and enforced in any court having jurisdiction over a party or any of its
     assets. For the purpose of the enforcement of an award, the parties
     irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the jurisdiction of a competent
     court in any jurisdiction in which a party may have assets and waive any
     defenses to such enforcement based on lack of personal jurisdiction or
     inconvenient forum. This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the
     parties shall remain in full force and effect pending the award in any
     arbitration proceeding hereunder.

               (d) The Parties agree that any court action or proceeding to
     compel or in support of arbitration or for provisional remedies in aid of
     arbitration, including but not limited to any action to enforce the
     provisions of this Section 7.8, for temporary injunctive relief maintain
     the status quo or prevent irreparable harm prior to the appointment of the
     arbitral tribunal, shall be brought exclusively in the federal or state
     courts located in Jackson, Michigan (the "Michigan Courts"). The Parties
     hereby unconditionally and irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction
     of the Michigan Courts for such purpose, and to the non-exclusive
     jurisdiction of the Michigan Courts in any action to enforce any
     arbitration award rendered hereunder, and waive any right to stay or
     dismiss any such actions or proceedings brought before the Michigan Courts
     on the basis of forum non conveniens or improper venue. Without prejudice
     to such provisional remedies as may be available under the jurisdiction of
     a national court, the arbitral tribunal shall have full authority to grant
     provisional remedies and to direct the parties to request that any court
     modify or vacate any temporary or preliminary relief issued by such court,
     and to award damages for the failure of any party to respect the arbitral
     tribunal's orders to that effect.

          Section 7.9 No Right of Setoff.

          Neither party hereto nor any Affiliate thereof may deduct from, set
     off, holdback or otherwise reduce in any manner whatsoever any amount owed
     to it hereunder or


                                       42

<PAGE>

     pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement or any agreement related to
     the sale of the Argentine Businesses (the "Argentine Transaction
     Documents") against any amounts owed hereunder or pursuant to the
     Transition Services Agreement or the Argentine Transaction Documents by
     such Persons to the other party hereto or any of such other party's
     Affiliates.

          Section 7.10 Time is of the Essence.

          Time is of the essence in the performance of the provisions of this
     Agreement.

          Section 7.11 Specific Performance.

          Each party acknowledges and agrees that any breach of any provision of
     this Agreement would cause irreparable harm to the other party. Each party,
     without prejudice to any rights to judicial relief it may otherwise have,
     shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunction and specific
     performance. Each party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of such
     relief on the basis that the other party has not suffered irreparable harm
     or that the other party has an adequate remedy at law. Each party agrees
     that it will not seek and agrees to waive any requirement for the securing
     or posting of a bond in connection with the other party's seeking or
     obtaining such relief.

          Section 7.12 Entire Agreement.

          This Agreement, together with the Seller Disclosure Letter, Buyer
     Disclosure Letter, Annex I, the Exhibits hereto, the Transition Services
     Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement
     between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter herein and
     supersede all previous agreements, whether written or oral, relating to the
     subject matter of this Agreement and all prior drafts of this Agreement,
     all of which are merged into this Agreement. No prior drafts of this
     Agreement and no words or phrases from any such prior drafts shall be
     admissible into evidence in any action or suit involving this Agreement. In
     the case of any material conflict between any provision of this Agreement
     and any other agreement including the Transition Services Agreement, this
     Agreement shall take precedence.

          Section 7.13 Binding Nature; Third Party Beneficiaries.

          This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
     of the parties hereto and their respective successors (whether by operation
     of law or otherwise) and permitted assigns. Except as expressly provided
     herein, none of the provisions of this Agreement shall be for the benefit
     of or enforceable by any third party, including any creditor of either
     party or any of their Affiliates. Except as expressly provided herein, no
     such third party shall obtain any right under any provision of this
     Agreement or shall by reasons of any such provision make any Claim in
     respect of any Liability (or otherwise) against either party hereto.

          Section 7.14 Counterparts.

     This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more counterparts, each of
     which, when executed, shall be deemed to be an original and both of which
     together shall constitute one and the same document. Any counterpart or
     other signature to this Agreement that is delivered by facsimile or
     electronic mail shall be deemed for all purposes as constituting good and
     valid execution and delivery by such party of this Agreement.

          Section 7.15 Severability.

          If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or
     unenforceable under any applicable present or future law, and if the rights
     or obligations of either party under this Agreement will not be materially
     and adversely affected thereby, (i) such provision shall be fully
     severable, (ii) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such
     illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part
     hereof, (iii) the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in
     full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or
     unenforceable provision or by its severance herefrom and (iv) in lieu of
     such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there shall be added
     automatically as a part of this Agreement, a legal, valid and enforceable
     provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
     provision as may be possible.

          Section 7.16 Headings.

          The headings used in this Agreement have been inserted for convenience
     of reference only and do not define or limit the provisions hereof.

          Section 7.17 Waiver.

          Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at any time by
     the party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such waiver shall
     be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly executed by or
     on behalf of the party or parties waiving such term or condition. No waiver
     by any party of any term or condition of this Agreement, in any one or more
     instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same or
     any other term or condition of this Agreement on any future occasion. All
     remedies, either under this Agreement or by law or otherwise afforded, will
     be cumulative and not alternative.

          Section 7.18 Amendment.

          This Agreement may be altered, amended or changed only by a writing
     making specific reference to this Agreement and signed by duly authorized
     representatives of each party.
