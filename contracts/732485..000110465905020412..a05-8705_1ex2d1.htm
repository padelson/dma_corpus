# Section 2

  

# 

  

# CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

  

# 

  

## 2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any shares
of Company Common Stock or any shares of common stock of Sub ("Sub Common
Stock"):

  

## 

  

### (a) _Sub Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of Sub Common
Stock shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock._  All shares
of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and
any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Sub shall automatically
be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Conversion of Shares of Company Common Stock_.  Each issued and
outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than shares of Company
Common Stock to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b)) shall be
converted into the right to receive $33.00 (the "Per Share Price"), payable
to the holder thereof in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration").
From and after the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration therefor, without interest thereon, upon the surrender of such
certificate in accordance with Section 2.2.

  

### 

  

## 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  

## 

  

### (a) _Paying Agent_. Parent shall designate American Stock Transfer and
Trust Company or another bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as agent for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock in
connection with the Merger (the "Paying Agent") and to receive the funds to
which holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall become entitled
pursuant to Section 2.1(c). Parent shall provide or cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide to the Paying Agent on a timely basis, on or
prior to the Effective Time and as and when needed after the Effective Time,
cash necessary to pay for the shares of Company Common Stock converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration (such

  



  

3   

     
   

  



  

cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). If for any reason
the Exchange Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of shares
of Company Common Stock shall be entitled under Section 2.1(c), Parent shall
promptly deposit or cause the Surviving Corporation promptly to deposit
additional cash with the Paying Agent sufficient to make all payments of
Merger Consideration, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall in any
event be liable for payment thereof. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash
in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Paying
Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates,
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates"), whose shares were converted
pursuant to Section 2.1(c) into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
(i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such
form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify); and
(ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange
for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed
and properly completed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at
any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Section 2.2,
without interest thereon, and shall not evidence any interest in, or any
right to exercise the rights of a shareholder or other equity holder of, the
Company or the Surviving Corporation.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares of Company
Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates evidencing
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares
of Company Common Stock, except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Section 2.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. At any time following
six (6) months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including
any interest received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying
Agent and not disbursed (or for which disbursement is pending subject only to
the Paying AgentÂ’s routine administrative procedures) to holders of
Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to
the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger
Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates, without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation nor

  



  

4   

     
   

  



  

the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate for Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.  If Certificates are
not surrendered prior to two (2) years after the Effective Time, unclaimed
Merger Consideration payable with respect to such shares of Company Common
Stock shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property
of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the applicable Merger Consideration with respect thereto.

  

### 

  

## 2.3 _No Dissenters Â’ Rights_. Holders of Company Common Stock will not
have dissentersÂ’ rights under Section 180.1302(4) of the WBCL with
respect to the Merger.

appropriate committee of the Company Board of Directors) shall adopt such
resolutions or shall take such other actions as are required to approve the
transactions contemplated by this Section 2.4.  The Company shall use
reasonable efforts to obtain any necessary consents of the holders of Company
Stock Options or Company Restricted Stock Units to effect this Section 2.4.

  

### 

  

### (b) The Company shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that at the
Effective Time, each outstanding option to acquire shares of Company Common
Stock (a "Company Option" or "Company Options") granted under the CompanyÂ’s
Incentive Stock Option Plan, 1996 Stock Option Plan, 2002 Stock Option Plan
or 2003 Stock Option Plan (collectively, the "Option Plans"), without regard
to the extent then vested or exercisable, shall be cancelled and, in
consideration of such cancellation, the holder thereof shall be entitled to
receive promptly, but in no event later than ten (10) days after the
Effective Time, a cash payment in respect of such cancellation from the
Company in an amount equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of the
Per Share Price (or if required pursuant to the terms of the applicable
Option Plan, the closing price of the CompanyÂ’s Common Stock on the Closing
Date) over the exercise price of each such Company Option and (y) the number
of unexercised shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto (such payment,
if any, to be net of applicable Taxes withheld pursuant to Section 2.5).

  

### 

  

### (c) The Company shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that at the
Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock unit granted under any of
the Option Plans (the "Company Restricted Stock Units") shall be cancelled
and, in consideration of such cancellation, the holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive promptly, but in no event later than ten (10) days after
the Effective Time, a cash payment in respect of such cancellation from the
Company in an amount equal to the product of (x) the Price Per Share (or if
required pursuant to the terms of the applicable Option Plan, the closing
price of the CompanyÂ’s Common Stock on the Closing Date)

  



  

5   

     
   

  



  

and (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto (such
payment to be net of applicable Taxes withheld pursuant to Section 2.5).

  

### 

  

### (d) As of the Effective Time, the Option Plans shall terminate and all
rights under any provision of any other plan, program or arrangement
providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the
capital stock of the Company shall be cancelled.

  

### 

  

### (e) The Company shall use reasonable efforts to effectuate the foregoing,
including, but not limited to, sending out the requisite notices and seeking
to obtain all consents necessary to cash out and cancel all Company Options
and Company Restricted Stock Units or to ensure that, after the Effective
Time, no person shall have any right under the Option Plans, except as set
forth herein.

  

### 

  

## 2.5 _Withholding_.  Each of Parent and Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and
withhold, from any amounts payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder or former holder of shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Options such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") or
any provision of Tax (as defined in Section 3.15) law or under any other
applicable legal requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted
or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

  

## 

  

## 2.6 _Transfer Taxes_. If payment of the Merger Consideration payable to a
holder of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger is to be made
to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate
is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall have paid all
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the issuance to a person other
than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have
established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid
or is not applicable.

with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Exchange Act")
since June 30, 1999 and prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Company SEC
Reports"). As of their respective dates, such documents complied, and all
documents filed by the Company with the SEC between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing Date shall comply, in all material respects, with
applicable requirements of the Securities Exchange Act and did not, or in the
case of documents filed on or after the date hereof will not, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact

## 

  

## 3.6 _Financial Statements_. The financial statements contained in
the Company 10-K and in the CompanyÂ’s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for
the quarters ended September 30, 2004 and December 31, 2004 (collectively,
the "Company 10-Qs") have been prepared from, and are

  



  

9   

     
   

  



  

in accordance in all material respects with, the books and records of the
Company and presented fairly, in all material respects, the
financial condition and results of operations of the Company as of and for
the periods presented therein, and were prepared in accordance with United
States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a
consistent basis, except as otherwise indicated therein and subject in the
case of the unaudited financial statements included in the Company 10-Qs to
normal year-end adjustments, which in the aggregate are not material, and the
absence of notes. The Company maintains a system of "internal control over
financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act)
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP, that transactions are executed only in accordance with the
authorization of management and regarding prevention or timely detection
of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the CompanyÂ’s assets.
The CompanyÂ’s "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are reasonably designed to
ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
information is accumulated and communicated to the CompanyÂ’s management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications of the chief executive officer and chief financial
officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with respect to such
reports. The Company is not a party to, or does not have any commitment to
become a party to, any joint venture, off balance sheet partnership or any
similar contract (including any contract or arrangement relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among the Company, on the one hand,
and any unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured finance, special
purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand or any "off
balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K
under the Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of
such contract or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of ay material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company in the
CompanyÂ’s published financial statements or other Company SEC Reports.
 Since July 1, 2004, the Company has not received any oral or written
notification of any (x) "significant deficiency" or (y) "material weakness"
in the CompanyÂ’s internal controls over financial reporting. There is no
outstanding "significant deficiency" or "material weakness" which the
CompanyÂ’s independent accountants certify has not been appropriately and
adequately remedied by the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms
"significant deficiency" and "material weakness" shall have the meanings
assigned to them in Release 2004-001 of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board.

  

## 

  

## 3.7 _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_. As of June 30, 2004, the Company
had no material liabilities of any nature, whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise (including without limitation, liabilities as
guarantor or otherwise with respect to obligations of others or liabilities
for Taxes due or then accrued or to become due), required to be reflected or
disclosed in the balance sheet (the "Company Balance Sheet") dated June 30,
2004 (or the notes thereto) included in the Company 10-K that were not
adequately reflected or reserved against on the Company Balance Sheet (or
adequately disclosed in the notes thereto). The Company has no material
liabilities of any nature, whether accrued, absolute, contingent
or otherwise, other than liabilities (i) adequately reflected or
reserved against on the Company Balance Sheet, (ii) reflected on the
CompanyÂ’s unaudited balance sheet dated December 31, 2004, included in the
Form 10-Q filed by the Company for the quarter ended December 31, 2004, (iii)
included in the

  



  

10   

     
   

  



  

Company Disclosure Schedule, or (iv) incurred since December 31, 2004 in the

other agreement in material default under any of them, nor does any condition
exist that with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a material
default under any of them, except in each case except for defaults which

### (e) Other than agreements filed as exhibits to the Company 10-K or the
Company 10-Qs (including any incorporated therein by reference), unredacted
copies of which have previously been made available to Parent, the Company is
not a party to any agreement (i) involving research, development or the
license of Proprietary Rights (as defined in Section 3.12(a)), (ii) granting

in any twelve month period of more than $200,000.

  

### 

  

### (f) To the knowledge of the Company, no executive officer or director of
the Company has (whether directly or indirectly through another entity in
which such person has a material interest, other than as the holder of less
than 2% of a class of securities of a publicly traded company) any material
interest in any property or assets of the Company (except as a shareholder),
any competitor, customer, supplier or agent of the Company or any person that
is currently a party to any material contract or agreement with the Company.

  

### 

  

### (g) The Company is not a party to any interest rate, equity or other swap

### 

  

## 3.12 _Property_.

  

## 

  

### (a) The Company owns, is licensed to use, or otherwise has the right to
use all patents, trademarks, service marks, trade names, trade secrets,
franchises, inventions, copyrights and all other technology and intellectual
property (including, without limitation, biological materials), all
registrations of any of the foregoing, or applications therefor, and all
grants and licenses or other rights running to or from the Company relating
to any of the foregoing, that are material to its business as presently
conducted or as contemplated to be conducted (collectively, the "Proprietary
Rights"). To the knowledge of the Company, all patents, trademarks and
copyrights referred to above are valid and subsisting. On the Closing Date,
the Company shall provide Parent with a schedule of any Taxes, maintenance
fees or actions falling due within 90 days of the Closing Date with respect
to patents, trademarks and copyrights registrations of which the Company is
the owner of record (whether sole owner or co-owner) or otherwise required to
pay such maintenance fees or take such actions. To the knowledge of the
Company, there is no basis for any claim by any third party that the business
of the Company infringes upon the proprietary rights of others, nor has the
Company received any notice or claim of infringement from any third party. To
the knowledge of the Company, there is no existing or threatened infringement
by any third party on, or any competing claim of right to use or own any of,
the Proprietary Rights. To the knowledge of the Company, the Company has the
right to sell its products and services (whether now offered for sale or
under development) free from any royalty or other obligations to
third parties. To the knowledge of the Company, none of the activities of
the employees of the Company violates any agreement or arrangement which any
such employees have with former employers. To the knowledge of the Company,
all employees and consultants who contributed to the discovery or development
of any of the Proprietary Rights did so either (x) within the scope of their
employment such that, in accordance with applicable Law, all Proprietary
Rights arising therefrom became the exclusive property of the Company or (y)
pursuant to written agreements assigning all Proprietary Rights
arising therefrom to the Company. Assignment documents assigning to Company
all rights of such employees, contractors and consultants have been duly
filed in all relevant patent offices worldwide for all patent applications
and patents owned in whole or in part by Company. To the knowledge of the
Company, all employees engaged in the development of experimental data
relevant to the discovery or development of any of the Proprietary Rights
maintain contemporaneous records of their experiments in laboratory notebooks
which are signed, dated, witnessed and maintained in accordance with good
scientific practices. To the knowledge of the

  



  

15   

     
   

  



  

Company, each employee, contractor or consultant of the Company who
has proprietary knowledge of or information relating to the
manufacturing processes, or the formulation of the products, of the Company
has executed and delivered to the Company an agreement or agreements
restricting such personÂ’s right to (A) use and disclose confidential
information of the Company and (B) enter into certain employment, consulting
or similar contractual relationships with companies that are competitors of
the Company for a specified period of time. To the knowledge of the
Company, there are no settlements, forbearances to sue, consents, judgments,
or orders or similar obligations that: (i) restrict any Proprietary Rights;
(ii) restrict the conduct of the business of the Company or any of its
employees; or (iii) grant third parties any material rights under Proprietary
Rights. To the knowledge of the Company, no material trade secret of the
Company has been disclosed or is authorized to be disclosed to any third
party in violation of confidentiality obligations to the Company and, to the
knowledge of the Company, no party to a nondisclosure agreement with the
Company is in breach or default thereof. To the knowledge of the Company, no
current or former director, officer, consultant or employee of the Company
will, after giving effect to the Merger, own any of the Proprietary Rights.
To the knowledge of the Company, the execution of, the delivery of, the
consummation of the Merger contemplated by, and the performance of the
CompanyÂ’s obligations under, this Agreement will not result in any loss or
impairment of any Proprietary Rights.

  

### 

  

### (b) The Company has all assets, properties, rights and contracts
necessary to permit the Company to conduct its business as it is currently
being conducted, except where the failure to have such assets, properties,
rights and contracts would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company has marketable title to all of
its properties, interests in properties and assets, real and personal,
reflected in the Company Balance Sheet (except properties, interests in
properties and assets sold or otherwise disposed of since June 30, 2004 in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice), or with
respect to leased properties and assets, valid leasehold interests in such
properties and assets, in each case, free and clear of all imperfections of
title, restrictions, encroachments, liens and easements, except (i) liens for
current Taxes not yet due and payable, (ii) such imperfections of title,
restrictions, encroachments, liens and easements as do not and would not
reasonably be expected to materially detract from or interfere with the use
or value of the properties subject thereto or affected thereby, or otherwise
materially impair business operations involving such properties and (iii)
liens securing debt which are reflected on the Company Balance Sheet. There
are no written or oral subleases, licenses, occupancy agreements or other
contractual obligations that grant the right of use or occupancy of any real
property owned or leased by the Company (collectively, the "Real Property")
to another person, and there is no person in possession of the Real Property
other than the Company. There is no pending, or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened eminent domain, condemnation or similar proceeding
affecting any Real Property.  To the knowledge of the Company, the property
and equipment of the Company that are used in the operations of business are
(i) in good operating condition and repair and (ii) have been maintained in
accordance with normal industry practices. Section 3.12(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule lists all Real Property.

  

### 

  

## 3.13 _Insurance_.  All policies or binders of material fire, liability,
product liability, workersÂ’ compensation, vehicular, directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’
and other material insurance held by or on behalf of the Company are in full
force and effect in all material respects, are reasonably adequate for the
businesses engaged in by the Company and are in conformity in all material

  



  

16   

     
   

  



  

respects with any requirements of all leases or other agreements to which the
Company is a party and, to the knowledge of the Company, are valid and
enforceable in accordance with their terms.  The Company is not in default in
any material respect with respect to any material provision contained in such
policy or binder nor has the Company failed to give any notice or present any
material claim under any such policy or binder in due and timely fashion.
All premiums due and payable to date for each policy or binder have been paid
for the current period, and there are no outstanding premium finance payments
due for such period. There are no material outstanding unpaid claims under
any such policy or binder. The Company has not received notice of
cancellation or non-renewal of any such policy or binder. All applications
for the CompanyÂ’s currently effective directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ insurance were
true, correct and complete in all material respects when submitted to the
carrier.

  

## 

  

## 3.14 _Commercial Relationships_. Since June 30, 2004, none of the
CompanyÂ’s material suppliers, collaborators, manufacturers, distributors,
licensors or licensees has canceled or otherwise terminated its relationship
with the Company or has, during the last twelve months, materially altered
its relationship with the Company. To the knowledge of the Company, (a)
there is no plan or intention of any such entity, and the Company has not
received any threat or notice from any such entity, to terminate, cancel or
otherwise materially modify its relationship with the Company and (b) as of
the date of this Agreement, no such entity is experiencing financial or other
difficulties that would be reasonably likely to jeopardize its ability to
perform its contractual obligations to the Company. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company is in compliance in all material
respects with diligence obligations, and has not failed to achieve any
development milestones within applicable time periods, under material license
agreements.

  

## 

  

## 3.15 _Tax Matters_.

  

## 

  

### (a) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Tax" (and, with correlative
meaning, "Taxes" and "Taxable") means all United States federal, state and
local, and all foreign, income, profits, franchise, gross receipts, payroll,
transfer, sales, employment, social security, unemployment insurance,
workersÂ’ compensation, use, property, excise, value added, ad valorem,
estimated, stamp, alternative or add-on minimum, recapture, environmental,

predecessor entity. "Tax Return" means any return, declaration, report, claim
for refund, tax shelter disclosure statements or information return or
statement filed or required to be filed with any taxing authority
in connection with Taxes, including any attachments thereto and any
amendments thereof.

  

### 

  

### (b) All Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to the
Company have been filed within the time and in the manner prescribed by Law
(taking into account applicable extensions properly obtained), except where
the failure to so file would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. All such
Tax Returns are true, correct and complete, and all Taxes owed by
the Company, whether or not shown on any Tax Return, have been paid, except
where the failure to be true, correct or complete, or the failure to so pay,
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. No written claim has ever

  



  

17   

     
   

  



  

been made by a taxing authority in a jurisdiction where the Company does not
file Tax Returns asserting that the Company is or may be subject to material
Taxation by that jurisdiction.

  

###

any of the assets or properties of the Company, other than with respect to
Taxes which are not yet due and payable.

  

### 

  

### (d) No assessment, dispute or judicial or administrative proceeding is
currently pending or threatened in writing with respect to any Tax Return or
Taxes of the Company, except for any such assessment, dispute or proceeding
that, if determined adverse to the Company, would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to create a material liability to the
Company. No material deficiency for any Taxes has been proposed in writing
against the Company, which deficiency has not been paid in full.

  

### 

  

### (e) There are no outstanding written agreements extending the statutory
period of limitation applicable to any claim for, or the period for the
collection or assessment of, Taxes due from or with respect to the Company
for any taxable period. No power of attorney granted by or with respect to
the Company relating to Taxes is currently in force.

  

### 

  

### (f) All withholding and payroll Tax requirements required to be satisfied
by the Company (including requirements to deduct, withhold and pay over
amounts to any Governmental Entity and to comply with any record keeping and
reporting requirements in connection with amounts paid or owing to any
employee, independent contractor, creditor, shareholder or other third party)
have been satisfied, except where the failure to so satisfy any such
requirement would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

### 

  

### (g) The Company does not have any liability for the Taxes of any other
person (other than the Company) under Treasury Regulation 1.1502-6 (or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign Law).

  

### 

  

### (h) No payment, other benefit, or acceleration of the vesting of any
options, payments or other benefits (nor any agreement, contract, arrangement
or plan providing for any of the foregoing), will be, as a direct or indirect
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, an "excess
parachute payment" to a "disqualified individual," as those terms are defined
in Section 280G of the Code and the applicable regulations of the U.S.
Department of the Treasury.

  

### 

  

### (i) The Company is not, and during the applicable period specified in

### (k) The Company has delivered or made available to Parent complete and
correct copies of all U.S. federal and state income Tax Returns of the
Company with respect to

  



  

18   

     
   

  



  

the three taxable years ended prior to the date hereof for which such Tax
Returns have been filed. The Company has delivered or made available to
Parent written schedules of (i) the taxable years of the Company for which
the statute of limitations with respect to U.S. federal income taxes has not
expired and (ii) in the case of each U.S. federal income taxable year

completed, those years for which examinations are currently in progress,
those years for which examinations have not yet been initiated and those
years for which U.S. federal income Tax Returns have not yet been filed.

  

### 

  

### (l) The Company will not be required to include any item of income in, or
exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for any taxable period (or
portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date as a result of any: (i)
adjustment under Section 481 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar
provisions of state, local or foreign Tax law) made prior to the Closing Date
or (ii) "closing agreement" as described in Code Section 7121 (or any
corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign Tax law)

### (a) Each of the Company and its Representatives (as defined below) has

communications with any persons or entities with respect to any offer or
proposal or potential offer or proposal relating to any transaction or
proposed transaction or series of related transactions, other than the
transactions contemplated hereby, involving: (A) any acquisition or purchase
from the Company by any person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d)
of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) of more than
a twenty percent (20%) interest in the total outstanding voting securities of
the Company or any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would
result in any person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) beneficially
owning twenty percent (20%) or more of the total outstanding voting
securities of the Company, (B) any consolidation, business combination,

aggregate fair market value of all of the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock on the date prior to the date hereof; or (D) any
recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation or dissolution of the Company
(each of clauses (A)-(D), an "Acquisition Proposal"). Except as provided in
Section 5.2(b) or (c), from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of
termination of this Agreement or the Effective Time, the Company

  



  

30   

     
   

  



  

shall not and shall not authorize or permit its officers,
directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other
agents (collectively, "Representatives") to directly or indirectly (i)
initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage, or take any action to knowingly
facilitate the making of, any offer or proposal which constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into any
agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) engage in
negotiations or discussions with, or provide any information or data to, any
person (other than Parent or any of its affiliates or representatives)
relating to any Acquisition Proposal or grant any waiver or release under any
standstill or other agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
contained in this Section 5.2 or in Section 6.4 or any other provision hereof
shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board of Directors from (x) taking
and disclosing to the CompanyÂ’s shareholders its position with respect to any
tender or exchange offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (y) making such disclosure to the
CompanyÂ’s shareholders as in the good faith judgment of the Company Board of
Directors, after receipt of advice from outside legal counsel, is required
under applicable Law and that the failure to make such disclosure would cause
the Company Board of Directors to violate its fiduciary duties to the Company
Â‘s shareholders under applicable Law.

  

### 

  

### (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the date on which the Company
shareholders vote to approve the Merger, the Company may furnish information
concerning its business, properties or assets to any person pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to the Company than
those contained in the confidentiality agreement, dated as of December 28,
2004, between the Parent and the Company (as amended, the "Confidentiality
Agreement") and may negotiate and participate in discussions and negotiations
with such person concerning an Acquisition Proposal if the Company Board of
Directors determines in good faith by resolution duly adopted, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is
reasonably likely to constitute a Superior Proposal, but only if such
Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of Section 5.2(a).
For purposes of this Agreement, a "Superior Proposal" means any _bona fide_
written proposal made by a third party (i) involving the purchase or
acquisition, directly or indirectly of, all the shares of Company Common
Stock or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and (ii) which
is otherwise on terms which the Company Board of Directors determines in good
faith, by resolution duly adopted (A) would result in a transaction that, if
consummated, is more favorable to holders of Company Common Stock, from a
financial point of view, than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation), taking into account all the terms and conditions of such
proposal and this Agreement (including any proposal by Parent to amend the
terms of this Agreement) and (B) is reasonably capable of being completed on
the terms proposed, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and
other aspects of such proposal; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no proposal
shall be deemed to be a Superior Proposal if any financing required to
consummate the proposal is not then committed. The Company shall promptly
(and in any case within 24 hours) notify Parent (i) of any Superior Proposal,
which notice shall include a copy of such Superior Proposal, (ii) upon
receipt of any inquiries, proposals or offers received by, any request for
information from, or any discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated
or continued with, the Company or its Representatives concerning
an Acquisition Proposal or that could reasonably be expected to lead to
an Acquisition Proposal and disclose the identity of the other party and
the material terms of such inquiry, offer, proposal or request and, in the
case of written materials, provide copies of such materials and (iii)
provide Parent with

  



  

31   

     
   

  



  

copies of all written materials provided by the Company to such party. The
Company will keep Parent informed on a reasonably prompt basis (and, in any
case, within 24 hours of any significant development) of the status and
details (including amendments and proposed amendments) of any such Superior
Proposal or other inquiry, offer, proposal or request. The Company shall
promptly, following a determination by the Company Board of Directors that an
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, notify Parent of such
determination.

  

### 

  

### (c) Except as set forth herein, neither the Company Board of Directors
nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose to
withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, the approval or
recommendation by the Company Board of Directors or any such committee of
this Agreement or the Merger, (ii) approve or recommend or propose to approve
or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) enter into any agreement with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to
the date on which the CompanyÂ’s shareholders vote to approve the Merger, the
Company Board of Directors may (subject to the terms of this and the
following two sentences) withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of
this Agreement or the Merger, or recommend a Superior Proposal, in either
case at any time after (x) it has concluded in good faith, after receipt of
advice from outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would
result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the CompanyÂ’s shareholders or
(y) if the Company has received a Superior Proposal, the fifth (5th) business
day following the CompanyÂ’s delivery to Parent of written notice advising
Parent that the Company Board of Directors has received a Superior Proposal
(which notice shall include a copy of such Superior Proposal and identify the
Person making such Superior Proposal) and advising Parent that the Company
intends to withdraw or modify its recommendation of this Agreement or the
Merger or recommend a Superior Proposal (specifying which course of action
the Company intends to take) (a "Subsequent Determination"). After providing
such notice, the Company shall provide to Parent three (3) business days
from the date of such notice to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Board of Directors of
Company to avoid a Subsequent Determination; _provided, however,_  that any
such adjustments shall be at the discretion of the parties at such time. Any
such withdrawal, modification or change of the recommendation of the Company
Board of Directors, or recommendation or proposed recommendation of any
Superior Proposal shall not change the approval of the Company Board of
Directors for purposes of causing any state takeover statute or other state
Law to be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger.

  

### 

  

## 5.3 _Employee Matters_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Except with the prior written consent of the Parent, during the
period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company
shall not (i) make any discretionary contribution to the CompanyÂ’s 401(k)
plan, other than employer matching contributions at the rate in effect
immediately prior to the date of this Agreement, or (ii) make any required
contribution to the CompanyÂ’s 401(k) plan in Company Common Stock.  If
requested by the Parent in writing at least 30 days prior to the Effective
Time (provided that the Parent shall have at least 30 days after the date
hereof to make such request), the Company shall terminate the
CompanyÂ’s 401(k) plan immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

32   

     
   

  



  

### (b) Following the Merger, Parent shall provide that the employees of the
Surviving Corporation are covered under ParentÂ’s then-current benefit plans,
programs, policies and arrangements applicable to similarly-situated
employees of Parent. Years of service with the Company prior to the
Effective Time shall be treated as service with the Surviving Corporation or
Parent for eligibility and vesting purposes and for purpose of applicable
benefit accruals, including but not limited to vacation pay accruals, except
to the extent such treatment will result in a duplication of benefits.

  

### 

  

### (c) Following the Merger, Parent shall cause to be waived all limitations
as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to the employees who were
employed by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Affected
Employees") under any welfare benefit plans in which such employees are
eligible to participate after the Effective Time, other than limitations,
exclusions or waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to such
employees and that have not been satisfied as of the Effective Time under the
applicable welfare plan maintained for such employees by the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time. With respect to any waiting
period that is not waived, service with the Company will be credited in
accordance with Section 5.3(b). Parent shall credit under any welfare
benefit plan amounts previously paid by Affected Employees (or their
dependents) during the plan year or calendar year (as applicable) that
includes the Effective Time toward any applicable deductible, co-payment,
out-of-pocket maximum or similar provision of such Parent welfare benefit
plan.

  

### 

  

### (d) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall honor or cause to be honored
by the Surviving Corporation, in either case, in accordance with their terms,
all employment, bonus, incentive, severance and other agreements and
arrangements existing prior to the execution of this Agreement which are
between the Company and its current or former directors, officers, employees
or consultants, including those described in Section 3.16(e) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, except as otherwise expressly agreed in writing
between Parent or the Surviving Corporation and such person.

following the date of this Agreement, prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy
Statement in preliminary form, and each of the Company, Parent and Sub shall

any comments of the SEC with respect thereto. The Company shall notify Parent
promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any
request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement or for additional information and shall supply Parent with copies
of all correspondence between the Company or any of its representatives, on
the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to
the Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to receipt of the approval of

Approval") there shall occur any event that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly
prepare and mail to its shareholders such an amendment or supplement. The
Company shall not

  



  

33   

     
   

  



  

mail any Proxy Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, to which
Parent reasonably objects. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the CompanyÂ’s shareholders as

## 6.3 _Access to Information_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
be entitled, through its employees and representatives, to have such access
to the assets, properties, business and operations of the Company as is
reasonably necessary or appropriate in connection with ParentÂ’s investigation
of the Company with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. Any such
investigation and examination shall be conducted at reasonable times during
business hours upon reasonable advance notice and under reasonable
circumstances so as to minimize disruption to or impairment of the CompanyÂ’s
business and the Company shall cooperate fully therein. No investigation by
Parent or the Company (whether conducted prior to or after the date of this
Agreement) shall diminish or obviate any of the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the Company or Parent contained in this Agreement.
In order that Parent may have full opportunity to make such investigation,
the Company shall furnish the representatives of Parent during such period
with all such information and copies of such documents concerning the affairs
of the Company as such representatives may reasonably request and cause its
officers, employees, consultants, agents, accountants and attorneys to
cooperate fully with such representatives in connection with such
investigation. The information and documents so provided shall be subject to
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

## 

  

## 6.4 _Public Disclosure_. The initial press release concerning the Merger
shall be a joint press release and, thereafter, so long as this Agreement is
in effect, neither Parent, Sub nor the Company will disseminate any press
release or other announcement concerning the Merger or this Agreement or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than a press release
or other announcement that primarily relates to a Superior Proposal) to any
third party, except as may be required by Law or by any listing
agreement with the NASDAQ National Market ("Nasdaq"), without the prior
consent of each of the other parties hereto, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. The parties have agreed to the text of the joint
press release announcing the execution of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, without prior consent of the other parties, each party (a)
may communicate information that is not confidential information of any other
party with financial analysts, investors and media representatives in a

any written communications made without prior consultation with the other
parties.

will promptly inform the others of such occurrence and cooperate in filing
with the applicable Governmental Entity such amendment or supplement.

  

### 

  

### (d) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to

35   

     
   

  



  

contemplated hereby, and to carry out fully the purposes of, this Agreement.
In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and the
Company Board of Directors shall, if any state takeover statute or similar
statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement
or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, use all reasonable
efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on the Merger, this Agreement and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. In case at any time after the Effective
Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement, the proper officers and directors of the Company, Parent
and Sub shall use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
such necessary actions. Parent shall cause Sub to fulfill all SubÂ’s
obligations under, and pursuant to, this Agreement. Nothing in this
Agreement shall require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other
subsidiary of Parent to sell, hold separate, license or otherwise dispose of
any assets or conduct their business in a specified manner, or agree or
proffer to sell, hold separate, license or otherwise dispose of any assets or
conduct their business in a specified manner, or permit or agree to the sale,
holding separate, licensing or other disposition of any assets of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any other subsidiary of Parent or the Company,
whether as a condition to obtaining any approval from, or to avoid potential
litigation or administrative action by, a Governmental Entity or any other
person or for any other reason. Until this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with Section 8.1, Parent shall have the right to participate in
the defense of any action, suit or proceeding instituted or threatened
against the Company (or any of its directors or officers) before any court or
governmental or regulatory body, to restrain, modify or prevent
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, or to seek damages
or discovery in connection with such transactions.

  

### 

  

## 6.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each party shall give prompt notice
to the other parties of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event
the occurrence or non-occurrence of which would cause any representation
or warranty made by such party in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate
in any material respect at any time from the date hereof to the Effective
Time, (ii) any condition set forth in Section 7 that is unsatisfied in any
material respect at any time (except to the extent it refers to a specific
date), and (iii) any material failure of such party or any of its
representatives to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; _provided,
however,_  that no such notification shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties, the conditions to the

the party receiving such notification.

on the date of this Agreement for events occurring prior to the Effective
Time; _provided, however,_ Parent shall not be required to spend more than

## 8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Any termination of this Agreement under Section 8.1 hereof will be

the Termination Fee. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in Section 8.1 hereof, this Agreement shall forthwith become null
and void and be of no further force or effect, and there shall be no
liability on the part of Parent, Sub or the Company (or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, shareholders, agents
or representatives), except as set forth in the last sentence of Section
6.3, Section 8 and Section 9, each of which shall remain in full force

### 

  

### (b) If Parent shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(e), the Company shall pay Parent upon demand a termination fee (the
"Termination Fee") of $19,000,000. If the Company terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(f), it shall, currently with and as a condition to
such termination, pay Parent the Termination Fee. If (i) this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(ii), 8.1(c) or 8.1(g), (ii) prior to

Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise communicated to the
CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors and (iii) within twelve (12) months after the
date on which this Agreement shall have been terminated the Company enters
into a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or an
Acquisition Proposal is consummated, the Company shall pay to Parent the
Termination Fee upon the earlier of the execution of such definitive
agreement or upon consummation of such Acquisition Proposal. All amounts
due hereunder shall be payable by wire transfer in immediately available
funds to such account as Parent may designate in writing to the Company. If
the Company fails to promptly make any payment required under this Section
8.2(b) and Parent commences a suit to collect such payment, the Company shall
indemnify Parent for its fees and expenses (including attorneys fees and
expenses) incurred in connection with such suit and shall pay interest on the
amount of the payment at the prime rate of Bank of America (or its successors
or assigns) in effect on the date the payment was payable pursuant to this
Section 8.2(b).

equally all fees and expenses, other than attorneysÂ’ and accountants fees and
expenses, incurred in relation to the printing and filing with the SEC and
mailing of the Proxy Statement (including any preliminary materials related
thereto) and any amendments or supplements thereto, and the filing of any
documents required under the HSR Act or any comparable provisions under any
applicable pre-merger notification laws or regulations of
foreign jurisdictions; and _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that (i) if
Parent shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e), the
Company shall reimburse Parent and Sub upon demand for documented out-of-
pocket fees and expenses incurred or paid by or on behalf of Parent
in connection with this Agreement or the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in an amount that will not exceed
$900,000 (the "Expenses"); (ii) if the Company terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(f), it shall pay Parent the Expenses upon demand; and
(iii) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(ii), 8.1(c)
or 8.1(g), and prior to the time of termination and after the date of this
Agreement an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or
otherwise communicated to the Company Board of Directors, the Company shall
pay Parent the Expenses upon demand.

  

## 

  

## 8.4 _Amendment_.  Subject to applicable Law and as otherwise provided in
the Agreement, this Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented in
any and all respects, whether before or after any vote of the shareholders of
the Company contemplated hereby, by written agreement of the parties hereto,
by action taken by their respective Boards of Directors, but after the
approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company, no amendment
shall be made which by Law requires further approval by such shareholders
without obtaining such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties
hereto.

  

## 

  

## 8.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each party hereto
may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or

agreements of any other party or any conditions to its own obligations, in

## 

  

### (a) This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of the parties hereto

of the other parties, except that the Sub may assign, in its sole discretion
and without the consent of any other party, any or all of its rights,

### 

  

## 9.6 _Section Headings_. The headings of Sections in this Agreement are

together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

  

## 

  

## 9.8 _Severability_.  If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or

this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.  Any provision of this
Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree shall remain
in full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable. The
parties further agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable provision of
this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to

invalid or unenforceable provision.

  

## 

  

## 9.9 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver_. Each of the Company, Parent and
Sub irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or for recognition
and enforcement of any judgment in respect

  



  

44   

     
   

  



  

hereof brought by any other party hereto or its successors or assigns may be
brought and determined in the courts of the State of Delaware and each of the
Company, Parent and Sub hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any action
or proceeding for itself and in respect to its property, generally
and unconditionally, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid
courts. Each of the Company, Parent and Sub hereby irrevocably waives, and
agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or
otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a)
any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-
named courts for any reason other than the failure to lawfully serve process,
(b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such
court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and (c) to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, that (i) the suit, action or
proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the
venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement,
or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

  

## 

  

## 9.10 _Enforcement_. The parties recognize and agree that if for any reason
any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or are otherwise breached, immediate and irreparable
harm or injury would be caused for which money damages would not be an
adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party agrees that, in addition to other
remedies, any other party shall be entitled to an injunction (without posting
a bond or other undertaking) restraining any violation or threatened
violation of the provisions of this Agreement. In the event that any
action shall be brought in equity to enforce the provisions of the Agreement,
no party shall allege, and each party hereby waives the defense, that there
is an adequate remedy at law.

  

## 

  

## 9.11 _Rules of Construction; Certain Definitio_ _ns_.

45   

     
   

  



  

## 9.12 _No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative_. No failure or delay on the part of
any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder will impair such
right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of
any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor will any single or
partial exercise of any such right preclude other or further exercise thereof
or of any other right. All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement
are cumulative to, and not exclusive to, and not exclusive of, any rights
or remedies otherwise available.

  

## 

  

## 9.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF PARENT, COMPANY AND SUB
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
