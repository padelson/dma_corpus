power and corporate authority to conduct the Business as it is presently being conducted, to own,
lease or operate, as applicable, its assets and properties, and to perform all its obligations
under its Material Contracts (as defined below). The Company is duly qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of its
properties owned, leased or operated or the nature of its activities make such qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
the Company, and all amendments thereto, have heretofore been delivered to Parent and are accurate

incorporation or bylaws.

all action necessary, to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement, to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and to perform its obligations hereunder, subject to the adoption
of this Agreement by the Required Company Stockholder Vote. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby have been

Company, no other proceeding on the part of the Company or the stockholders of the Company is
necessary to authorize this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by the Company and is the legal, valid and binding obligation of
the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms except as enforcement may
be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws
affecting creditors&#146; rights generally and except insofar as the availability of equitable remedies
may be limited by Applicable Law.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.14. <U>Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers; Consent to Service of Process</U>. Except as
provided in Section&nbsp;2.13(h), each party hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
respect hereof brought by another party hereto or its successors or assigns shall be brought in the
Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law and,
to the extent not so permitted, in any court sitting in the State of Delaware, and each of the
parties hereto hereby (x)&nbsp;irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for
itself and in respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, to the exclusive personal
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated hereby, (y)&nbsp;agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court and (z)&nbsp;agrees that
it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby in
any court other than the aforesaid courts. Any service of process to be made in such action or
proceeding may be made by delivery of process in accordance with the notice provisions contained in
<U>Section&nbsp;9.3</U>. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to
assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with
respect to this Agreement, (a)&nbsp;the defense of sovereign immunity, (b)&nbsp;any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the
failure to serve process in accordance with this <U>Section&nbsp;9.14</U>, (c)&nbsp;that it or its property
is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and (d)&nbsp;to the fullest extent permitted
by Applicable Law that (i)&nbsp;the suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (ii)&nbsp;the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper and (iii)&nbsp;this
Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. To the extent
that a party to this Agreement is not otherwise subject to service of process in the State of
Delaware, such party hereby appoints National Registered Agents, Inc., 160 Greentree Drive, Suite
101, Dover, Delaware 19904, as such party&#146;s agent in the State of Delaware for acceptance of legal
process, and agrees that service made on such agent shall have the same legal effect as if served
upon such party personally within the State of Delaware.
