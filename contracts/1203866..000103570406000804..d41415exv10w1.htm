 2.8. _Conversion of Shares; Treatment of Company Options_. 

  

 (a) _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or the holder of any capital stock of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, all shares of common stock, par value $0.0001, of the Company (the "Common Stock") and shares of Series A convertible preferred stock, par value $0.0001, of the Company (the "Preferred Stock") (but excluding shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.8(d) and shares that are Dissenting Shares) shall no longer be outstanding and shall be cancelled automatically and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, without interest, the applicable Merger Consideration, upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.10. _Exhibit 2.8_ hereof sets forth: (i) the name of each Stockholder and holder of a Company Option; (ii) the portion of the Initial Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Section 2.8 to each Stockholder and holder of a Company Option at Closing assuming full compliance with the payment procedures contained in Section 2.10 (as set forth in column ii of Exhibit 2.8); (iii) the portion of the Initial Merger Consideration to be withheld from each Stockholder and holder of a Company Option pursuant to Section 2.10(a) in establishing the Escrow Account (as set forth in column iii of Exhibit 2.8) and the Equityholder Representatives Fund (as set forth in column iv of Exhibit 2.8); (iv) the portion of the Initial Merger Consideration to be paid to each Stockholder and holder of a Company Option at Closing after deduction for the amounts set forth in (iii) above and any amounts owed to the Company by any Stockholder (as set forth in column v of Exhibit 2.8); (v) the amount to be paid to each Stockholder and each holder of a Company Option at Closing upon the Escrow Expiration Date, expressed as a percentage of the amount remaining in the Escrow Account at the Escrow Expiration Date (as set forth in column vi of Exhibit 2.8); (vi) the amount to be paid to each Stockholder and each holder of a Company Option at Closing upon the termination of the Equityholder Representatives Fund, expressed as a percentage of the amount remaining in the Equityholder Representatives Fund upon termination of the Equityholder Representatives Fund (as set forth in column vi of Exhibit 2.8); (viii) the amount, expressed as a percentage, payable to each Stockholder and holder of a Company Option at Closing for the First MAA Subsequent Payment Amount, if any, after payment of the applicable Montgomery and Co., LLC fee (as set forth in column vii or viii, as applicable, of Exhibit 2.8); (ix) the amount, expressed as a percentage, payable to each Stockholder and holder of a Company Option at Closing for the First NDA Subsequent Payment Amount, if any after payment of the applicable Montgomery and Co., LLC fee (as set forth in column vii or viii, as applicable, of Exhibit 2.8); (x) the amount, expressed as a percentage, payable to each Stockholder and holder of a Company Option at Closing for the Second MAA Subsequent Payment Amount, if any, after payment of the

 (b) _Treatment of Options_. Effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, each unexpired and unexercised Company Option shall become fully vested and exercisable; _provided, however,_ that the exercise of any accelerated portion of any such Company Option shall be subject to and conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company or the holders of Company Options, each unexpired and unexercised Company Option shall terminate, be cancelled and cease to be outstanding and in exchange therefor, each holder of a Company Option shall, have the right to receive an amount in cash from Parent in respect thereof as set forth in _Exhibit 2.8_ equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of Common Stock subject or related to such Company Option, and (y) the excess, if any, of the Initial Merger Consideration applicable to the Common Stock over the exercise price or purchase price, as the case may be, per share of Common Stock subject or related to such Company Option (subject to any applicable withholding taxes, the "Cash Option Payment") plus the Subsequent Merger Consideration, if any, to be paid on such Company Option in accordance with Sections 2.10(e), (f), (g) and (h) as if such Company Option had been exercised and converted into Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (c) At the Effective Time, each of the 100 outstanding shares of the common stock, $0.0001 par value, of Merger Sub shall be converted into one share of common stock, $0.0001 par value, of the Surviving Corporation.

 (e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, including _Exhibit 2.8_, the aggregate Initial Merger Consideration payable by Parent pursuant to this Agreement shall not exceed $59,000,000.

 (a) _Escrow Amount_. At the Closing, ten percent (10%) of the Initial Merger Consideration (the "Escrow Amount") shall be deposited into an escrow account (the "Escrow Account") to be established by Parent with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the "Escrow Agent") to be held by the Escrow Agent, pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement mutually agreeable to Parent and the Company (the "Escrow Agreement"), to serve as a source of payment and remedy for any claim for Damages for which any Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to recovery pursuant to _Article VIII_. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) _Release of Escrow Amount_. Promptly following the Escrow Expiration Date, the Escrow Agent shall distribute to Paying Agent, who shall distribute to the Participating Rights Holders, in accordance with the percentage amounts to which each Participating Rights Holder is entitled under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement as set forth on _Exhibit 2.8_, the Escrow Amount then remaining in the Escrow Account _minus_ an amount equal to the aggregate dollar amount of claims for Damages made by all Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ hereof (the "Aggregate Outstanding Claims") which are then outstanding and unresolved (such amount of the retained Escrow Amount, as it may be further reduced after the Escrow Expiration Date by distributions to Participating Rights Holders as set forth below and recoveries by Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ hereof and the Escrow Agreement, the "Retained Escrow Amount"). For purposes of clarification, in the event that the amount of the Aggregate Outstanding Claims exceeds the remaining Escrow Amount, all the remaining Escrow Amount shall be retained in the Escrow Account as the Retained Escrow Amount. In the event and to the extent that after the Escrow Expiration Date any outstanding claim made by any Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ hereof is resolved against such Parent Indemnified Party, the Escrow Agent shall distribute to the Paying Agent, who shall distribute to the Participating Rights Holders, in accordance with the percentage amounts to which each Participating Rights Holder is entitled under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, as set forth on _Exhibit 2.8_, an aggregate amount of the Retained Escrow Amount equal to the amount of the outstanding claim resolved against such Parent Indemnified Party; _provided, however,_ that such distribution shall only be made to the extent that the Retained Escrow Amount remaining after such distribution would be sufficient to cover the amount of the Aggregate Outstanding Claims that are still unresolved at such time. In the event and to the extent that after the Escrow Expiration Date any outstanding claim made by any Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ hereof is resolved in favor of such Parent Indemnified Party, such Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ hereof an amount equal to the amount of the outstanding claim resolved in favor of such Parent Indemnified Party. 

   

 (c) _Escrow Agent Fees and Expenses_. Any fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent shall be paid by Parent. During the period in which the Escrow Amount (including any Retained Escrow Amount) is retained in the Escrow Account, all interest or other income earned from the investment of the Escrow Amount (the "Escrow Earnings") shall be retained as additional amounts in the Escrow Account. 

   

 2.10. _Distribution of the Merger Consideration_. 

  

 (a) At the Closing, Parent shall deliver to the Paying Agent an amount (the "Closing Amount") equal to the Initial Merger Consideration, less the Escrow Amount and less the Equityholder Representative Fund of Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000) to be deposited with an escrow agent for the purpose of paying the expenses if any, incurred by the Equityholder Representative in connection with this Agreement (the "Equityholder Representatives Fund"), and the Paying Agent shall, at or as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, subject to the provisions of the Paying Agent Agreement, pay and distribute to each Participating Rights Holder the portion of the Closing Amount set forth on _Exhibit 2.8_ for such Participating Rights Holder. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) Each holder of Shares that have been converted into a right to receive a portion of the Merger Consideration, upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a certificate or certificates formerly representing such Shares, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal covering such Shares in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_, will be entitled to receive from the Paying Agent payment of the portion of the Closing Amount set forth on _Exhibit 2.8_ opposite such holders name in column v. Each certificate that is surrendered pursuant to this _Section 2.10(b)_ shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered and except as otherwise set forth in  _Section 2.12_, each such certificate shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes, only the right to receive the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid or will accrue on such portion of the Initial Merger Consideration. 

   

 (c) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares. If, after the Effective Time, certificates formerly representing Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the portion of the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this _Article II_. 

   

 (d) In the event that any certificate evidencing Shares shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall pay in exchange therefor, upon making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, a portion of the Closing Amount due in respect of such Shares that is payable pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that the Paying Agent or Parent may, in its respective discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the delivery of a suitable bond or indemnity agreement by the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate. 

   

 (e) Upon the First MAA Subsequent Payment Date, Parent shall deliver an aggregate payment of $12,500,000 (the "First MAA Subsequent Payment Amount"), with such payment allocated to (i) the holders of Shares and holders of Company Options who have complied with the procedures set forth in this _Section 2.10_, with each such holders portion of the First MAA Subsequent Payment Amount determined in accordance with Section 2.8 and (ii) Montgomery and Co., LLC as set forth in  _Exhibit 2.8_. 

   

 (f) Upon the First NDA Subsequent Payment Date, Parent shall deliver an aggregate payment of $12,500,000 (the "First NDA Subsequent Payment Amount"), with such payment allocated to (i) the holders of Shares and holders of Company Options who have complied with the procedures set forth in this _Section 2.10_, with each such holders portion of the First NDA Subsequent Payment Amount determined in accordance with Section 2.8 and (ii) Montgomery and Co., LLC as set forth in  _Exhibit 2.8_. 

   

 (g) Upon the Second MAA Subsequent Payment Date, Parent shall deliver an aggregate payment of $10,000,000 (the "Second MAA Subsequent Payment Amount"), with such payment allocated to (i) the holders of Shares and holders of Company Options who have complied with the procedures set forth in this _Section 2.10_, with each such holders portion of the Second MAA Subsequent Payment Amount determined in accordance with Section 2.8 and (ii) Montgomery and Co., LLC as set forth in  _Exhibit 2.8_. 

   

 (h) Upon the Second NDA Subsequent Payment Date, Parent shall deliver an aggregate payment of $10,000,000 (the "Second NDA Subsequent Payment Amount"), with 

    ##### 

  

    

such payment allocated to (i) the holders of Shares and holders of Company
Options who have complied with the procedures set forth in this _Section
2.10_, with each such holders portion of the Second NDA Subsequent Payment
Amount determined in accordance with Section 2.8 and (ii) Montgomery and Co.,
LLC as set forth in _Exhibit 2.8_. 

   

 (i) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any portion of the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property escheat or similar law. If any certificate formerly representing Shares shall not have been surrendered prior to eighteen months after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority), any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 2.11. _Dissenting Shares_. Any holder of Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to which appraisal and/or dissenters rights, if any, are available by reason of the Merger pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL ("Company Dissenting Shares") shall not be entitled to receive any portion of the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.8_ , unless such holder fails to perfect, effectively withdraws or loses its appraisal rights and/or rights to dissent from the Merger under the DGCL. Such holder shall be entitled to receive only such rights as are granted under Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect, effectively withdraws or loses such appraisal and/or dissenters rights under the DGCL, such Company Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive (without interest) that portion of the Merger Consideration due pursuant to the provisions of _Section 2.8_. Any payments made with respect to Company Dissenting Shares shall be made solely by the Surviving Corporation, and no funds or other property have been or shall be provided by Parent, Merger Sub or any of Parents Affiliates for such payment. 

  

 2.12. _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of United States federal, state or local, or any foreign, Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to or deposited with the relevant Governmental Authority by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable holder of Shares or Company Options in respect of which Parent made such deduction and withholding. 

  

 2.13. _Equityholder Representative_. 

  

 (a) _Appointment_. As used in this Agreement, the term "Equityholder Representative" shall mean Stuart J. M. Collinson, or any Person appointed as a successor Equityholder Representative pursuant to _Section 2.13(b)_ hereof. Effective upon Closing, without any further action by any other Person, the Equityholder Representative shall be appointed and constituted in respect of each Participating Rights Holder, as his, her or its agent, to act in his, 

    ##### 

  

    

her or its name, place and stead, as such Participating Rights Holders
attorney-in-fact, as more fully set forth in _Section 2.13(c)_. 

   

 (b) _Election and Replacement_. From and after the Effective Time until the date when all obligations under this Agreement have been discharged (including all indemnification obligations under Article VIII hereof), Participating Rights Holders who are entitled to receive in excess of 50% of the Initial Merger Consideration (the "Majority"), may, from time to time upon written notice to the Equityholder Representative and Parent, remove any Equityholder Representative (including any appointed by Parent as provided below) or appoint a new Equityholder Representative to fill any vacancy created by the death, incapacitation, resignation or removal of any Equityholder Representative. If the Majority is required to but has not appointed a successor Equityholder Representative to fill any vacancy within twenty (20) Business Days from written notice from Parent to all Participating Rights Holders and a request by Parent to appoint a successor Equityholder Representative, Parent shall have the right to appoint an Equityholder Representative to fill any such vacancy from the directors of the Company prior to the Merger, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to advise all Participating Rights Holders of such appointment by written notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Majority shall thereafter retain the right to remove the Equityholder Representative or appoint a new Equityholder Representative pursuant to this _Section 2.13_. A copy of any appointment by the Majority of any successor Equityholder Representative shall be provided to Parent promptly after it shall have been effected.

The Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned, leased or operated or the nature of its activities make such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

   ##### 

  

 

ERISA (each a "Benefit Plan," collectively, the "Benefit Plans"). Benefit
Plans shall include each Benefit Plan maintained in the U.S. For each Benefit
Plan, true and complete copies of, where applicable, (i) the three (3) most
recent annual reports on Form 5500 (with schedules and attachments), (ii) the
actuarial reports and results of all nondiscrimination tests for the
last three (3) plan years and (iii) any plan document, summary plan
description, trust agreement, employment agreement and other governing
instrument, document or employee communication, have been delivered to Parent
as of the date hereof. 

   

 (b) No Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, and neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability (contingent or otherwise) with respect to any such Benefit Plan. Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates sponsors or has ever sponsored, maintained, contributed to, or incurred an obligation to contribute or incurred a liability (contingent or otherwise) with respect to any Multiemployer Plan or to a Multiple Employer Plan. For these purposes, "Multiemployer Plan" means a multiemployer plan, as defined in Sections 3(37) and 4001(a)(3) of ERISA, and "Multiple Employer Plan" means any Employee Benefit Plan sponsored by more than one employer, within the meaning of Sections 4063 or 4064 of ERISA or Section 413(c) of the Code. 

   

 (c) Each Benefit Plan has been maintained in all material respects, by its terms and in operation, in accordance with the requirements of Applicable Law (including with the requirements of ERISA and the Code). 

   

 (d) Each Benefit Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code has been determined by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") to so qualify and each Benefit Plan has adopted all amendments necessary to comply with the Code on or before the remedial amendment period deadline specified for each such amendment pursuant to Section 401(b) of the Code or IRS promulgations and has obtained a determination or opinion letter from the IRS which give reliance to such Benefit Plan that it complies with the requirements of the Code, and the trust created thereunder satisfies the provisions of Section 501(a) of the Code. The Company has provided to Parent a true and compete copy of the latest IRS determination or opinion letter with respect to each such Benefit Plan and nothing has since occurred that could cause the loss of such qualification or exemption and no such Benefit Plan has been operated in a manner which would reasonably be expected to cause it to be disqualified in operation. No Benefit Plan intended to be or is funded by a trust that is intended to be exempt from tax under the provisions of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code has been determined by the IRS to be so exempt. 

   

 (e) No Benefit Plan has participated in, engaged in or been a party to any transaction that is prohibited under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA (i) that is not exempt under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 408 of ERISA, respectively, or (ii) that could result in a material Liability to the Company or any ERISA Affiliate. With respect to any Benefit Plan, (i) neither the Company, nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has had asserted against it any material claim for taxes under Chapter 43 of Subtitle D of the Code and Section 5000 of the Code, or for material penalties under ERISA Sections 502(c), 502(i) or 502(l), nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, is there a basis for any such claim, and (ii) no officer, director or employee of the Company has committed a breach of any fiduciary responsibility or obligation imposed by Title I of ERISA that could result in a material Liability to the Company or any ERISA Affiliate. Other than routine claims for benefits, there is no material claim or proceeding

Company, threatened, involving any Benefit Plan by any Person or any
Governmental Authority.

The Company has delivered to Parent true and complete copies of all such agreements, plans, programs and other arrangements. 

   

 (g) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.14(g)(i)_, there will be no payment, accrual of additional benefits, acceleration of payments or vesting of any benefit under any Benefit Plan or any other agreement or arrangement to which the Company is a party, and no employee, officer or director of the Company will become entitled to severance, termination allowance or similar payments, solely by reason of entering into or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. _Schedule 4.14(g)(ii)_ sets forth a good faith estimate of the severance payments and other similar termination payments that may become payable to the employees of the Company as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any subsequent termination of such employees employment with the Surviving Corporation.

 4.15. _Compliance with Law_. The Company is in material compliance with all Regulations and all Court Orders applicable to the Company and required in the operations of the Business, except for such failure to be in compliance therewith as would not result in a breach of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Section 4.27 with respect to the Regulations in such section. The Company has not received any notice to the effect that, or otherwise been advised that, it is not in compliance with any such Regulations or Court Orders,

The Company is not in material Default, nor has it received any notice of any claim of Default, with respect to any such Permit.

No suspension or cancellation of any such Permits is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened.

The Company has no Knowledge of any Serious Adverse Event associated with clinical trials of the products containing the Compound of the Company whether conducted by or on behalf of the Company that have not been reported to the FDA, applicable Drug Regulatory Agencies and other applicable Governmental Authorities in accordance with Applicable Law.

POST-CLOSING COVENANTS OF ALL PARTIES  

  

 Each of the Company, Parent, and Merger Sub covenants and agrees as follows: 

  

 6.1. Indemnification of Directors and Officers. 

  

 (a) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Closing Date, Parent and the Surviving Corporation, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify (including the advancement of expenses) and hold harmless all past and present officers and directors of the Company ("DandO Indemnified Parties") to the same extent such individuals are entitled to indemnification by the Company pursuant to the Companys Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, employment agreements and/or indemnification agreements, each as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, and to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law, for any costs or expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, settlements, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to acts or omissions that occurred at or prior to the Effective Time. This Section 6.1 shall survive the consummation of the Merger, and is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be 

    ##### 

  

    

enforceable by, all past and present officers and directors of the Company,
their respective heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding upon
Parent and the Surviving Corporation. The obligations of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.1 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this
Section 6.1 applies without the express written consent of such affected
indemnitee. 

   

 (b) At the Effective Time and for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of it or any successor of it the provision set forth in _Schedule 6.1_. 

   

 (c) As soon as practicable following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be purchased a six year "tail" policy of directors and officers liability insurance for the benefit of the present and former officers and the present and former directors of the Company in an aggregate coverage amount not less than those set forth in the policies. 

   

 (d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of their properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.1. 

   

 (e) The rights of each past and present officer and director of the Company under this Section 6.1 shall be in addition to any rights such individual may have under the Companys Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws or under any applicable Law. 

   

 6.2. _Tax Matters_. 

  

 (a) Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Company for all Taxable Periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date which are filed after the Closing Date ("Parent-Prepared Tax Returns"). Parent shall permit Equityholder Representative to review and comment on each Parent-Prepared Tax Returns prior to filing and shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns as are requested by the Equityholder Representative, unless contrary to Applicable Law. All Parent-Prepared Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice of the Company. Each Parent-Prepared Tax Return shall be made available to the Equityholder Representative at least thirty (30) days prior to the filing due date for each Parent-Prepared Tax Return and Equityholder Representative shall provide Parent with comments no later than seven (7) days prior to the filing date for each Parent-Prepared Tax Return. 

   

 (b) The Parties shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective Affiliates, and Representatives to reasonably cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns and in resolving all disputes and audits (including any Tax Claims) with respect to all Tax Periods relating to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include maintaining and making available to each other all relevant records relating to Taxes, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information or explanation of any material provided 

    ##### 

  

    

hereunder, to testify at any proceedings relating to Taxes or to execute Tax
Returns. The Parties agree (i) to retain all books and records with respect
to Tax matters pertinent to the Companies relating to any Tax Period
beginning before the Closing Date until the applicable statute of limitations
(as may be extended) has expired and to abide by all record retention
agreements entered into with any Governmental Authority; (ii) to allow the
other party and its representatives at times and dates mutually acceptable to
the parties, to inspect, review and make copies of such records as such party
may deem necessary or appropriate from time to time, such activities to
be conducted during normal business hours at such partys expense; and (iii)
to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other party
so requests, to allow the other party to take possession of such books and
records. 

   

 (c) If, subsequent to the Closing, Parent or the Company receives notice of a Tax Contest with respect to any Tax Return for a Tax period beginning before the Closing Date, then within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such notice, the Parent shall notify the Equityholder Representative of such notice. The Equityholder Representative shall have the right to control the conduct and resolution of such Tax Contest, _provided_ , _however_ , that if any of the issues raised in such Tax Contest could have a material impact on Taxes of Company for a Post-Closing Tax Period, then the Equityholder Representative shall afford Parent the opportunity to control jointly the conduct and resolution of the portion of such Tax Contest which could have a material impact on Taxes of the Company in any Post-Closing Tax Period. If the Equityholder Representative shall have the right to control the conduct and resolution of a Tax Contest but elects in writing not to do so, then Parent shall have the right to control the conduct and resolution of such Tax Contest, provided that Parent shall keep the Equityholder Representative informed of all material developments on a timely basis. Each party shall bear its own costs for participating in such Tax Contest. For purposes of this Section, "Tax Contest" means any audit, other administrative proceeding or inquiry or judicial proceeding involving Taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Equityholder Representative shall not be entitled to control any claim relating to Taxes of the Parent, Company, or their Subsidiaries for any Tax period ending after the Closing Date and shall not be entitled to settle, either administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any claim for Taxes which could adversely affect the liability of Parent, the Company or their Subsidiaries for Taxes for any Tax Period (or portion thereof) after the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of Parent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. 

   

 (d) Company and/or Parent, as the case may be, will pay to Stockholders any and all refunds or reimbursements of Taxes attributable to Pre-Closing Tax Periods. 

   

 6.3. _Development and Commercialization of the Compound_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company hereby agrees and acknowledges that Parent has no obligation, implied or otherwise, and owes no duty to the Surviving Corporation or to the Participating Rights Holders under this Agreement to pursue the clinical development or commercialization of any product containing the Compound and no liability to the Surviving Corporation or to the Participating Rights Holders under this Agreement shall result from any decisions by Parent to terminate the clinical development and commercialization of any product containing the Compound. 

   ##### 

  

  

 6.4. _Conduct of Business_. The Company covenants and agrees that between the time of execution of this Agreement and the Effective Time it will conduct its operations only in the Ordinary Course of Business, and no dividends, distributions or similar payments shall be made to any Stockholder during such period.

ARTICLE VIII. 

   

INDEMNIFICATION  

  

 8.1. _Survival of Representations_. The representations and warranties contained herein shall survive the Effective Time until twelve (12) months thereafter; _provided_ , _however_ , that: (i) the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 4.1_ ("Organization"), _4.3_  ("Authorization"), _4.4_ ("Capitalization"), _5.1_ ("Organization") and _5.2_  ("Authorization") shall survive in perpetuity, and (ii) the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 4.12_ ("Taxes"), _4.13_ ("Environmental Matters") and _4.14_  (Employee Benefits) shall survive the Effective Time until sixty days following the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations (including any extensions thereof); provided, further, however, that in the case of actual fraud, intentional misrepresentation or active concealment, the representations and warranties shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. Any claims under this Agreement with respect to a breach of a representation and warranty must be asserted by written notice within the applicable survival period contemplated by this _Section 8.1_, and if such a notice is given, the survival period for such representation and warranty shall continue until the claim is 

   ##### 

  

 

fully resolved. The right to indemnification or other remedy based on the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein will not be
affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge (or
capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy
of or compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement. 

   

 8.2. _Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) (i) Subsequent to the Closing, subject to the limitations described below in _Section 8.5_ , each of Parent and its respective Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company) and each of its respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders and agents (the "Parent Indemnified Parties") shall be indemnified and reimbursed by the Participating Rights Holders, solely by means of deductions first from the Escrow Account and, to the extent that such funds in the Escrow Account (including the Escrow Earnings) are insufficient, as an offset against up to $5,900,000 of the Subsequent Merger Consideration Payments, when and if payable (as set forth in Section 8.5), and subject to the provisions of this Article VIII, from and against any and all damage, claim, loss, cost, liability or expense, including interest, penalties, reasonable attorneys fees and expenses of investigation, response action, removal action or remedial action (collectively, "Damages") incurred by such Parent Indemnified Party that arise out of, or relate to (x) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered to Parent and Merger Sub at Closing; (y) any failure to perform any covenant or obligation made by the Company in or pursuant to this Agreement; or (z) any Pre-Closing Taxes (determined as provided in _Section 8.7_). 

   

 (ii) Subsequent to the Closing, subject to the limitations described below in _Section 8.5_ , Parent and Merger Sub, jointly and severally, shall indemnify and reimburse each Participating Rights Holder, the Equityholder Representative and each of their respective representatives, heirs and Affiliates (the "Company Indemnified Parties" and collectively with the Parent Indemnified Parties, the "Covered Parties") from and against any and all Damages asserted against, suffered, sustained, accrued or incurred by such Company Indemnified Party arising out of or relating to (i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Parent and/or Merger Sub in this Agreement or any certificate delivered to the Company at Closing; and (ii) any failure to perform any covenant or obligation made by Parent and/or Merger Sub in or pursuant to this Agreement. Parent and Merger Subs liability for payments pursuant to this Section 8.2(a)(ii) shall be limited to the portion of the Initial Merger Consideration and/or any Subsequent Merger Consideration, as the case may be, that was not paid as a result of such failure to perform. 

  

 (b) The term "Damages" as used in this _Article VIII_ is not limited to matters asserted by third parties against the Covered Parties, but includes Damages incurred or sustained by such persons in the absence of third-party claims, and payments by a Covered Party shall not be a condition precedent to recovery, and shall be net of any insurance proceeds actually received within 12 months of when such Damages were incurred or sustained by such Covered Party that relate to the event giving rise to such Damages. 

   

 8.3. _Notice of Claims_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (a) Except with respect to claims for Taxes, which are addressed in Section 6.2(c), any Covered Party seeking indemnification hereunder shall, within the relevant limitation period provided for in _Section 8.1_ above, give to the Party which is obligated pursuant to this Article VIII to provide indemnification as set forth herein ("the "Indemnifying Party") a notice (a "Claim Notice") describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to any claims for indemnification hereunder and shall include in such Claim Notice (if then known) the amount or the method of computation of the amount of such claim, and a reference to the provision of this Agreement or any agreement, certificate or instrument executed pursuant hereto or in connection herewith upon which such claim is based; _provided_ , that a Claim Notice in respect of any action at law or suit in equity by or against a third Person as to which indemnification will be sought shall be given promptly after the action or suit is commenced; and _provided further_ , that failure to give such notice shall not affect such Covered Partys right to indemnification hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been materially prejudiced by such failure. 

   

 (b) The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty days after receipt of any Claim Notice pursuant hereto to (i) agree to the amount or method of determination set forth in the Claim Notice to pay such amount to (A) a Parent Indemnified Party in immediately available funds (solely to the extent that such funds are available in the Escrow Account) or to the extent that no funds are available in the Escrow Account, solely as an offset against up to $5,900,000 of the Subsequent Merger Consideration Payments, when and if payable, or (B) a Company Indemnified Party in immediately available funds or (ii) to provide such Covered Party with notice that they disagree with the amount or method of determination set forth in the Claim Notice and thereafter comply with the dispute resolution provisions set forth in _Section 2.13(h)_. 

   

 8.4. _Third Person Claims_. Except with respect to claims for Taxes, which are addressed in Section 6.2(c), if a claim by a third Person is made against a Covered Party, and if such party intends to seek indemnity with respect thereto under this _Article VIII_, such Covered Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such claims, setting forth such claims in reasonable detail. The Indemnifying Party shall be relieved of their indemnification obligations hereunder to the extent that notice is not delivered promptly and the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall have twenty days after receipt of such notice to deliver to the Covered Party a written acknowledgement that such claim is an indemnifiable claim under this _Article VIII_, that it will undertake, conduct and control (in accordance with the terms hereof), through counsel of their own choosing (provided that such counsel must be reasonably acceptable to the Covered Party) and at their own expense, the settlement or defense thereof, and the Covered Party shall cooperate with them in connection therewith; _provided_ that the Covered Party may participate in such settlement or defense through counsel chosen by such Covered Party and paid at its own expense, _provided further_ that, if in the reasonable opinion of counsel for Indemnifying Party, there is a reasonable likelihood of a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Covered Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel to such Covered Party in connection with such defense. So long as the Indemnifying Party is reasonably contesting any such claim in good faith, the Covered Party shall not pay or settle any such claim without the consent of the Equityholder Representative with respect to claims where the Participating Rights Holders are the Indemnifying Party and Parent where Parent and/or Merger Sub are the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Covered Party within ten days after receipt of the Covered Partys notice of a claim of indemnity hereunder that it elects to 

   ##### 

  

 

undertake the defense thereof, the Covered Party shall have the right to
undertake, at the Indemnifying Partys cost, risk and expense, the defense,
compromise or settlement of the claim but shall not thereby waive any right
to indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement. The Indemnifying Party
shall not, except with the consent of the Covered Party, enter into
any settlement that is not exclusively monetary and shall be paid entirely by
the Indemnifying Party and does not include as an unconditional term thereof
the giving by the person or persons asserting such claim to all Covered
Parties of an unconditional release from all liability with respect to such
claim or consent to entry of any judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to control any claim relating to
Taxes of the Parent, Company, or their Subsidiaries for any Tax period ending
after the Closing Date and shall not be entitled to settle, either
administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any claim for Taxes
which could adversely affect the liability of Parent, the Company or their
Subsidiaries for Taxes for any Tax period (or portion thereof) after the
Closing Date, without the prior written consent of Parent. 

   

 8.5. Limitation on Indemnity; Payments Out of Subsequent Merger Consideration. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything expressed or implied in this _Article VIII_ to the contrary, no Covered Party shall be entitled to make a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Agreement unless and until the aggregate of all Damages suffered by such Covered Parties hereunder exceeds $500,000 (the "Basket Amount"), whereupon, provided the other requirements of this  _Article VIII_ have been complied with, all subsequent Damages (not including the Basket Amount), shall become due and payable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Basket Amount shall apply to (i) the Companys representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 4.3_, _4.4_ ,  _4.10(b)_ , _4.12_ and _4.14(g)_ hereof, (ii) Parents and Merger Subs representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.2, (iii) a Covered Partys claim for indemnification hereunder to the extent a breach results from actual fraud, intentional misrepresentation or active concealment or (iv) _Section 8.2(a)(i)(z)_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in all cases determining whether there has been a breach of a representation or warranty by the Company for purposes of Section 8.2(a)(i)(x), or in determining the amount of any Damages with respect to such breach, such representations and warranties shall be read without regard to any materiality qualifier (including, without limitation, any reference to Material Adverse Effect) contained therein. 

   

 (b) Until the earlier to occur of (x) the disbursement in full of the Escrow Amount and (y) the termination of the Escrow Agreement pursuant to its terms, all claims for Damages by a Parent Indemnified Party shall to the fullest extent permitted by law be made first against the Escrow Amount in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Article VIII and the Escrow Agreement. 

   

 (c) To the extent permitted by Law, any payment made by a Person indemnifying a Covered Party pursuant to this Article VIII (any such Covered Party a "Payee" and any such indemnifying Party, a "Payor") shall be treated on the parties Tax Returns as an adjustment to the purchase price for all Tax purposes. 

   

 (d) In the event a claim for indemnification or reimbursement under this Article VIII shall have been finally determined in which the Indemnified Party is Parent and/or 

    ##### 

  

    

Merger Sub, the amount of the related Damages (after taking into account the
limitations of  _Section 8.5(a)_) shall be paid pursuant to and solely by
means of deductions first from the Escrow Account and, to the extent that the
amount of the Damages are in excess of the amount available in the Escrow
Account, as an offset against up to $5,900,000 of the Subsequent
Merger Consideration Payments, when and if payable, and neither the
Equityholder Representative nor any Participating Rights Holder shall have
any responsibility for any Damages resulting from a claim for indemnification
or reimbursement under this Article VIII other than by means of deductions
from the Escrow Account and/or such Subsequent Merger Consideration Payments,
if any. Any claim, the Indemnifying Partys liability therefor and the amount
of the related Damages shall be "finally determined" when the parties to such
claim have so determined by mutual written agreement or, if disputed, when a
final and non-appealable Order of a court of competent jurisdiction shall
have been entered concerning such matters. 

   

 8.6. _Remedies_. The remedies in this _Article VIII_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the parties with respect to any breach of the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise arising out of this Agreement, regardless of the theory or cause of action pled, and shall be paid pursuant to and solely by means of deductions from the Escrow Account and, to the extent that such funds in the Escrow Account (including the Escrow Earnings) are insufficient, as an offset against up to $5,900,000 of the Subsequent Merger Consideration Payments, when and if payable, except for the remedies of specific performance, injunction and other equitable relief; _provided_ , _however_ , that no party hereto shall be deemed to have waived any rights, claims, causes of action or remedies if and to the extent actual fraud, intentional misrepresentation or active concealment is proven on the part of a party by another party hereto or such rights, claims, causes of action or remedies as may not be waived under Applicable Law. 

  

 8.7. _Per Diem Taxes; Straddle Periods_. 

  

 (a) Real, personal and intangible property Taxes or other Taxes levied on a per diem basis (collectively, "Per Diem Taxes") for a Straddle Period that are allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the amount of such Per Diem Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the Straddle Period. 

   

 (b) With respect to Taxes other than Per Diem Taxes for a Straddle Period, the Company will, unless prohibited by Applicable Law, close the Taxable Period of the Company as of the close of business on the Closing Date. If Applicable Law does not permit the Company to close its Taxable Period on the Closing Date, then Taxes, if any, attributable to a Straddle Period shall be allocated (i) to the stockholders of the Company for the Pre-Closing Tax Period, and (ii) to the Parent for the Post-Closing Tax Period. Any allocation of income or deductions required to determine any Taxes attributable to a Straddle Period shall be made by means of a closing of the books and records of the Company as of the close of the Closing Date, _provided_ that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including, but not limited to, depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the period after Post-Closing Tax Period in proportion to the number of days in each such period. 

    ##### 

  

     

 8.8. _Transfer Taxes_. Parent shall pay all state and local sales, transfer or similar Taxes and all recording costs and fees, however styled or designated, that are required to be paid in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, regardless of the Party upon which such amounts would have been imposed absent this provision, and Parent shall cooperate with the Equityholder Representative in the preparation and filing of all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes, costs and fees. 

  

ARTICLE IX. 

   

MISCELLANEOUS  

  

 9.1. _Termination_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this Agreement may be terminated at any time before the Closing (a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent or (b) by Parent, in the event that the Company fails to obtain the Required Company Stockholder Vote and deliver evidence thereof satisfactory to Parent in its reasonable discretion not later than one hour after the execution of this Agreement by the Parties hereto. 

  

 9.2. _Binding Effect; Assignment_.

 9.4. _Choice of Law_. This Agreement shall be construed, interpreted and the rights of the parties determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, as applied to agreements among Delaware residents entered into and wholly to be performed within the State of Delaware (without reference to any choice of law rules that would require the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction). 

  

 9.5. _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement, together with the other documents and instruments referred to herein and all exhibits and schedules hereto, constitutes the entire agreement among the parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, of the parties. This Agreement may be supplemented, modified or amended by action by each party hereto, which in the case of the Company and Merger Sub shall be action taken by or on behalf of the board of directors of such party; _provided, however,_ that any amendment made subsequent to the adoption and approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company or Merger Sub as required by the DGCL which, under Applicable Law, requires further approval of such stockholders, shall not be made without further approval by such stockholders.

(whether or not similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver
unless otherwise expressly provided.

 9.7. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed or held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this Agreement shall be considered divisible and inoperative as to such provision to the extent it is deemed to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, and in all other respects this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any provision of this Agreement is deemed or held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable the parties agree to replace such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision with a provision that is legal, valid and enforceable and that achieves the original intent of the parties as closely as possible. Further, should any provision contained in this Agreement ever be reformed or rewritten by any judicial body of competent jurisdiction, such provision as so reformed or rewritten shall be binding upon all parties hereto.

The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to seek specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity without the necessity of demonstrating the inadequacy of monetary damages. 

  

 9.12. _No Strict Construction_. The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

 9.14. _Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers; Consent to Service of Process_. Except as provided in Section 2.13(h), each party hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect hereof brought by another party hereto or its successors or assigns shall be brought in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law and, to the extent not so permitted, in any court sitting in the State of Delaware, and each of the parties hereto hereby (x) irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby, (y) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court and (z) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Any service of process to be made in such action or proceeding may be made by delivery of process in accordance with the notice provisions contained in  _Section 9.3_. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a) the defense of sovereign immunity, (b) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve process in accordance with this _Section 9.14_, (c) that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and (d) to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper and (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. To the extent that a party to this Agreement is not otherwise subject to service of process in the State of Delaware, such party hereby appoints National Registered Agents, Inc., 160 Greentree Drive, Suite 101, Dover, Delaware 19904, as such partys agent in the State of Delaware for acceptance of legal process, and agrees that service made on such agent shall have the same legal effect as if served upon such party personally within the State of Delaware.

EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.
