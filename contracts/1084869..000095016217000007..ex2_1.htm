ARTICLE 2 
 Purchase and Sale

  

Section 2.01. Purchase and Sale. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, Seller agrees to sell to Buyer, and Buyer agrees to
purchase from Seller, the Shares at the Closing. The purchase price for the
Shares (the "Purchase Price") is U.S. $115,000,000 in cash. The Purchase Price
shall be paid as provided in Section 2.03 and shall be subject to adjustment
as provided in Section 2.05.

  

Section 2.02. Pre-Closing Transfers. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall have
transferred (or caused to be transferred) to the Company or its Subsidiaries
all of the Seller's and its Affiliates' right, title and interest to the
assets set forth on Schedule 2.02.

  

Section 2.03. Closing. The closing (the "Closing") of the purchase and sale of
the Shares hereunder shall take place at the offices of Davis Polk and Wardwell
LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, on the Business Day that is
five Business Days after the conditions set forth in Article 10 (other than
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of those
conditions at the Closing) are satisfied or, to the extent permissible, waived
by the party or parties entitled to the benefit of such conditions or at such
other time or place as Buyer and Seller may agree; provided that in no event
shall the Closing take place prior to May 30, 2017. At the Closing:

  

 

(a) Buyer shall deliver to Seller an amount equal to the sum of (i) the
Purchase Price and (ii) the Initial Working Capital Adjustment Amount, (the
"Closing Date Purchase Price") in immediately available funds by wire transfer
to an account of Seller with a bank in New York City designated by Seller, by
notice to Buyer, which notice shall be delivered not later than two Business
Days prior to the Closing Date;

  

(b) Seller shall deliver to Buyer certificates for the Shares duly endorsed or
accompanied by stock powers duly endorsed in blank, with any required transfer
stamps affixed thereto;

  

(c) Seller shall deliver to Buyer a counterpart to the Trademark Co-existence
Agreement duly executed by Seller;

  

(d) Buyer shall deliver to Seller a counterpart to the Trademark Co-existence
Agreement duly executed by Buyer;

  

(e) Seller shall deliver to Buyer a counterpart to the Transition Services
Agreement duly executed by Seller;

 

  


 

  

 

12  

  

  

 

(f) Buyer shall deliver to Seller a counterpart to the Transition Services
Agreement duly executed by Buyer;

  

(g) Seller shall deliver to Buyer a counterpart to the Supply and Distribution
Agreement duly executed by Seller;

  

(h) Buyer shall deliver to Seller a counterpart to the Supply and Distribution
Agreement duly executed by Buyer;

  

(i) Seller shall deliver to Buyer evidence of the release by JPMorgan of (i)
all Liens on the property or assets of any Company Entity and the Shares and
(ii) any guarantees by any Company Entity issued or outstanding under the
Credit Agreement.

 

  

Section 2.04. Estimated and Closing Working Capital. (a) No later than 5
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a
certificate of Seller (the "Estimate Certificate") setting forth Seller's good
faith estimate of the Closing Working Capital (the "Estimated Closing Working
Capital"). The Estimated Closing Working Capital set forth on the Estimate
Certificate shall be calculated in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis with the Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended July
3, 2016. Such Estimate Certificate shall be accompanied by reasonable
information and documentation supporting Seller's calculation. The amount of
Estimated Closing Working Capital shall be conclusive for the purposes of
calculating the consideration payable at Closing pursuant to Section 2.03(a).

  

(b) As promptly as practicable, but no later than 60 days after the Closing
Date, Buyer will cause to be prepared and delivered to Seller a certificate
setting forth Buyer's determination of the Closing Working Capital (the
"Closing Working Capital Certificate"). The Closing Working Capital set forth
on the Closing Working Capital Certificate shall be calculated in accordance
with GAAP applied on a consistent basis. Such Closing Working Capital
Certificate shall be accompanied by reasonable information and documentation
supporting Buyer's calculation. "Closing Working Capital" means the excess of
actual consolidated current assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents (but
including any cash or cash equivalent overdraft balances)) over actual
consolidated current liabilities of the Company and the Subsidiaries as of the
Closing, calculated consistently with what is set forth in document 16.1.1 of
the Merrill DataSite "Project Mulberry 2017" and excluding any Tax assets and
Tax liabilities (including any deferred Tax assets or Tax liabilities).

  

(c) If Seller disagrees with Buyer's calculation of Closing Working Capital
delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(b), Seller may, within 30 days after
delivery of the documents referred to in Section 2.04(b), deliver a notice to
Buyer disagreeing with such calculation and which specifies Seller's
calculation of such

  


 

  

 

13  

  


 

  

amount and in reasonable detail Seller's grounds for such disagreement (a
"Notice of Disagreement"). Any such Notice of Disagreement shall specify those
items or amounts as to which Seller disagrees, and Seller shall be deemed to
have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Closing Working
Capital Certificate and the calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered
pursuant to Section 2.04(b).

  


 

  

(d) If a Notice of Disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant to Section
2.04(c), Buyer and Seller shall, during the 20 days following such delivery,
use their reasonable best efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or
amounts in order to determine, as may be required, the amount of Closing
Working Capital, which amount shall not be less than the amount thereof shown
in Buyer's calculations delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(b) nor more than
the amount thereof shown in Seller's calculation delivered pursuant to Section
2.04(c). If Buyer and Seller are unable to reach such agreement during such
period, they shall promptly thereafter cause independent accountants of
nationally recognized standing reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and Seller
(who shall not have any material relationship with Buyer or Seller), promptly
to review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of
calculating Closing Working Capital. If Buyer and Seller are unable to reach
an agreement on the selection of the independent accountants, then, upon the
request of either Buyer or Seller, independent accountants of nationally
recognized standing will be appointed by the Chairman of the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants. In making such calculation, such
independent accountants shall consider only those items or amounts in the
Closing Working Capital Certificate or Buyer's calculation of Closing Working
Capital as to which Seller has disagreed. Such independent accountants shall
deliver to Buyer and Seller, as promptly as practicable, a report setting
forth such calculation. Such report shall be final and binding upon Buyer and
Seller absent manifest error; provided, however, that no such determination
shall be any more favorable to Buyer than is set forth in the Closing Working
Capital Certificate or any more favorable to the Seller than is proposed in
the Notice of Disagreement. The cost of such review and report shall be borne
fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by Seller.

  

(e) Buyer and Seller agree that they will, and agree to cause their respective
independent accountants and the Company and each Subsidiary to, cooperate and
assist in the preparation of the calculation of Closing Working Capital,
including the making available to the extent reasonably necessary of books,
records, work papers and personnel.

  

Section 2.05. Adjustment of Purchase Price. (a) If Final Working Capital minus
the Estimated Closing Working Capital (such difference, the "Final Working
Capital Adjustment Amount") is greater than zero, Buyer shall pay to Seller,
in the manner and with interest as provided in Section 2.05(b), an amount

  


 

  

 

14  

  


 

  

equal to the Final Working Capital Adjustment Amount. If the amount of the
Final Working Capital Adjustment Amount is less than zero, then Seller shall
pay to Buyer, as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, in the manner and with
interest as provided in Section 2.05(b), an amount equal to the Final Working
Capital Adjustment Amount. "Final Working Capital" means the Closing Working
Capital (i) as shown in Buyer's calculation delivered pursuant to Section
2.04(b), if no Notice of Disagreement with respect thereto is duly delivered
pursuant to Section 2.04(c); or (ii) if such a notice of disagreement is
delivered, (A) as agreed by Buyer and Seller pursuant to Section 2.04(c) or
(B) in the absence of such agreement, as shown in the independent accountant's
calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(c); provided that in no event
shall Final Working Capital be less than Buyer's calculation of Closing
Working Capital delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(b) or more than Seller's
calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(c).

  

(b) Any payment pursuant to Section 2.05(a) shall be paid within 10 Business
Days after the Final Working Capital has been determined by wire transfer of
immediately available funds by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be. Any such
payments shall be made to such account or accounts as may be designated by the
party entitled to such payment. The amount of any payment to be made pursuant
to this Section 2.05 shall bear interest from and including the Closing Date
to but excluding the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the prime
rate as published in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition in effect from
time to time during the period from the Closing Date to the date of payment.
Such interest shall be payable at the same time as the payment to which it
relates and shall be calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and
the actual number of days elapsed.

  

Section 2.06. Withholding Rights. Except to the extent required by Applicable
Law, any payment by Buyer of any amount specified in this Agreement to Seller
shall be paid free and clear of, and without any deduction or withholding on
account of, any Tax; _provided_ , if any amount is required by Applicable Law
to be deducted or withheld in respect of any such payment on account of any
non-U.S. Tax, the amount payable by Buyer shall be increased by Buyer such
that, after all such deduction or withholding of such non-U.S. Tax (including
any deduction or withholding applicable to additional amounts payable under
this Section 2.06), Seller receives an amount equal to the amount it would
have received under this Agreement had no such deduction or withholding been
made; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall not be required to pay any
additional amounts under this Section 2.06 in respect of any non-U.S. Tax to
the extent that such non-U.S. Tax would not have been imposed but for a
present or former connection between Seller or any Company Entity and the
jurisdiction imposing such Tax (other than a connection arising from this
Agreement or the transactions occurring pursuant thereto). Any amounts
deducted or withheld by Buyer under this Section 2.06 shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having

  


 

  

 

15  

  


 

  

been paid to Seller. In all events, the parties shall cooperate in good faith
to minimize the amount of any withholding or deduction of any Tax in respect
of any amounts required to be paid under this Agreement. If Buyer intends to
deduct or withhold any Tax in respect of any payment to be made to Seller
under this Agreement, (1) Buyer will promptly (after making the determination
that a deduction or withholding will be required) notify Seller in writing of
Buyer's intention to deduct or withhold and (2) Buyer will timely pay any
amounts deducted or withheld to the applicable Taxing Authority and, promptly
thereafter, will provide Seller with a receipt (or other evidence reasonably
acceptable to Seller) of such payment.

from July 3, 2016, until the date hereof, there has not been any action taken

income for any Post-Closing Tax Period (or to exclude from taxable income in a
Post-Closing Tax Period any deduction the recognition of which was accelerated
from such Post-Closing Tax Period to a Pre-Closing Tax Period) under Section
481 of the Code (or any similar provision of the Tax laws of any jurisdiction)
as a result of a change in method of accounting made or required to have been
made for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) none of the Company Entities will be
required to include for a Post-Closing Tax Period an amount of taxable income
in respect of a transaction occurring prior to Closing as a result of (y) an
installment sale, an open transaction disposition, or the application of the
look-back method (as defined in Section 460(b) of the Code), and (z) any
election pursuant to Section 108(i) of the Code, and (iv) there are no closing
agreements under Section 7121 of the Code (or any similar provision of the Tax

Buyer shall not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of
Seller. Buyer shall bear all of the out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including attorneys' fees and expenses) reasonably incurred in connection
with the foregoing; provided, however, that the Seller shall not be required
to disclose any information or provide such access if such disclosure would,
in the Seller's reasonable discretion, (i) jeopardize any attorney-client
privilege or (ii) contravene any Applicable Laws or binding agreement entered
into prior to the date hereof. Unless otherwise consented to in writing by
Buyer, Seller shall not be permitted, for a period of five years following the
Closing Date, to destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any material books and
records having material information with respect to the Company or any
Subsidiary relating to periods on or prior to the Closing Date without first
giving reasonable prior written notice to Buyer and offering to surrender to
Buyer such books and records or such portions thereof at Buyer's sole cost and
expense.

  

Section 5.03. Notices of Certain Events. Seller shall promptly notify Buyer
of:

  

 

(a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  

(b) any notice or other material communication from any Governmental Authority
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

  

(c) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to
its knowledge threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting Seller or the Company or any Subsidiary that, if pending on the date
of this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to
Section 3.13 or that relate to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

 

  

38

5.03 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to
the party receiving that notice.

all officers and directors of the Company and each Subsidiary who will be

Affiliates from (i) engaging in a bona fide general solicitation or
advertisement that is not specifically directed to any of the Persons
referenced in the foregoing, (ii) retaining search firms, employment agencies
or other similar entities, provided that such entities have been specifically
instructed by Seller not to solicit any of the Persons referenced in the

above once they have no longer been employed by the Company or any of its

referred to above with the prior written consent of the Buyer.

  

(b) If any provision contained in this Section 5.05 shall for any reason be
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this
Section, but this Section shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. It is the intention
of the parties that if any of the restrictions or covenants contained herein
is held to cover a geographic area or to be for a length of time which is not
permitted by Applicable Law, or in any way construed to be too broad or to any
extent invalid, such provision shall not be construed to be null, void and of
no effect, but to the extent such provision would be valid or enforceable
under Applicable Law, a court of competent jurisdiction shall construe and
interpret or reform this Section to provide for a covenant having the maximum
enforceable geographic area, time period and other provisions (not greater
than those contained herein) as shall be valid and enforceable under such
Applicable Law. Seller acknowledges that Buyer would be irreparably harmed by
any breach of this Section and that there would be no adequate remedy at law
or in damages to compensate Buyer for any such breach. Seller agrees that
Buyer shall be entitled to injunctive relief requiring specific performance by
Seller of this Section, and Seller consents to the entry thereof.

event within 15 Business Days (except with respect to appropriate filings in
Albania, within 20 Business Days) of the date hereof, and Seller shall use its
reasonable best efforts to provide any information required from Seller or the
Company for such filings as promptly as practicable. Buyer and Seller shall
supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and any Applicable Law
for the jurisdictions listed on Section 4.03 of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule

issue, or cause the publication of any public release or announcement
concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior
written consent of both the Buyer and Seller (such consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the foregoing shall not restrict or prohibit any of the parties hereto from
making any release or announcement required by Applicable Law or the rules or
regulations of any securities exchange; provided that if practicable and
permitted by Applicable Law such party shall consult with the other party
hereto before issuing such release or information. Each party hereto shall be
responsible for any breach of this Section 7.03 by one or more of its
Affiliates.

  

Section 7.04. Trademarks; Tradenames. (a) Except as set forth in the other
subsections of this Section 7.04, after the Closing, Buyer shall not permit
the Company or its Subsidiaries to use any of the marks or names set forth on
Schedule 7.04 (collectively or individually as the context requires, the
"Seller Trademarks and Tradenames").

  

(b) After the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall have the right
to sell existing inventory and to use existing packaging, labeling,
containers, supplies, advertising materials, technical data sheets and any
similar materials bearing any Seller Trademarks and Tradenames until the
earlier of (i) one year after the Closing Date and (ii) the date existing
stocks are exhausted. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall have the right to
use the Seller Trademarks and Tradenames in advertising that cannot be changed
by them using reasonable efforts for a period not to exceed 75 days after the
Closing Date. Buyer shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to comply
with all Applicable Laws in any use of packaging or labeling containing the
Seller Trademarks and Tradenames.

  

(c) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be obligated to change the
Seller Trademarks and Tradenames on goods in the hands of dealers,

Trademarks and Tradenames pursuant to this Section 7.04.

  

(d) Buyer agrees to cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to use reasonable
efforts to cease using the Seller Trademarks and Tradenames on buildings,
cars, trucks and other fixed assets as soon as possible within a period not to
exceed one year after the Closing Date.

  

(e) Seller agrees that its consent to a reasonable extension of this Section
for a reasonable period to be agreed which shall not exceed six months will
not be unreasonably withheld if the Company and its Subsidiaries cannot
exhaust existing inventory within one year of the Closing Date after using
commercially reasonable efforts to dispose of such inventory.

Section 7.05. Intercompany Accounts. All intercompany accounts between Seller
or its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company or any Subsidiary, on the
other hand, as of the Closing shall be deemed to be settled (irrespective of
the terms of payment of such intercompany accounts) at or prior to Closing.

  

Section 7.06. Transition Services Agreement. Between the date hereof and the
Closing Date, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith and finalize the

days of the date of this Agreement (including the amendments to Exhibit A to
the Transition Services Agreement and the Transition Services Agreement to
allow for the providing of certain services by the Company Entities to Seller
as reasonably requested by Seller). Exhibit A to the Transition Services
Agreement will be based substantially on the term sheet attached hereto as
_Exhibit B_ ; provided, however, if the Buyer requests additional services
that are reasonably necessary to the operation of the business and can be
reasonably provided by Seller, the Seller will provide such services under the
Transition Services Agreement and the parties will negotiate in good faith the
cost and time periods of such services. At or prior to the Closing, the
parties or their applicable Affiliates providing or receiving services
thereunder will enter into the Transition Services Agreement. If Seller
reasonably determines that it is unable to provide to the Company any of the
transition services described on _Exhibit B_ or otherwise requested by Buyer,
Seller will promptly notify Buyer of such determination, and Seller will
cooperate with Buyer to develop commercially suitable alternatives for such
transition services in order to implement such alternatives prior to Closing.
Prior to Closing (and for a further 90 day period after Closing as provided in
the Transition Services Agreement), Seller will transfer any required or
relevant knowledge to Company personnel, including through training and
coaching, in order to prepare the Company to operate independently of Seller
after Closing.

ARTICLE 8 
 Tax Matters

  

Section 8.01. Preparation of Pre-Closing Tax Returns. (a) Seller shall prepare
all affiliated, combined, consolidated, unitary or similar Tax Returns that
any Company Entity is required to file jointly with Seller or any of Seller's
post-Closing Affiliates for a Pre-Closing Tax Period (each, a "Consolidated or
Combined Tax Return"). Seller shall prepare the portion of each such Tax
Return that is a Company Return in a manner consistent with the past practices
of the Company, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law. All Taxes shown
as due on such Tax Returns shall be timely paid by Seller.

  

(b) With respect to any Income Tax Return that is not a Consolidated or
Combined Tax Return and that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of a Company
Entity (including a Straddle Period) but is required to be filed after the
Closing Date, Seller shall prepare each such Income Tax Return in a manner
consistent with the past practices of the Company, unless otherwise required
by Applicable Law. Seller shall deliver to Buyer, at least twenty (20) days
prior to the due date (taking into account extensions) for the filing of each
such Income Tax Return, a draft of such Income Tax Return for Buyer's review.
Seller shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments that Buyer submits
to Seller in writing no less than ten (10) Business Days before the due date
for filing such Income Tax Return and shall not finalize the form of such
Income Tax Return without Buyer's prior written consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided that, if the parties are unable to
finalize any such Income Tax Return at least five (5) Business Days before the
due date for filing such Income Tax Return, any disputed items shall be
addressed on such Income Tax Return in the manner proposed by Buyer and the
dispute shall be submitted to independent accountants for resolution pursuant
to the procedures set forth in Section 2.04(d). No less than two (2) Business
Days before the due date for filing such Income Tax Return, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer the final form of such Income Tax Return and a cash payment
equal to the amount of any Taxes shown as due on such Income Tax Return (or,
in the case of a Straddle Period Income Tax Return, the portion of the amount
of any Taxes shown as due on such Income Tax Return that is attributable to
the Pre-Closing Tax Period under Section 8.03) to the extent such Taxes are
Indemnified Taxes; provided that, if any portion of any such disputed Taxes is
resolved in Seller's favor, Buyer shall, no later than ten (10) Business Days
thereafter, pay to Seller in immediately available funds the disputed amount
resolved in Seller's favor. Buyer shall timely file, or shall cause to be
filed, with the relevant Taxing Authority each such Income Tax Return and
timely pay to the relevant Taxing Authority all Taxes due with respect to each
such Income Tax Return.

  


 

  

 

46  

  


 

  

(c) With respect to any Tax Return of the Company that is (i) attributable to
a Pre-Closing Tax Period (including any Straddle Period) and (ii) not an
Income Tax Return, Seller shall engage KPMG LLP ("KPMG") to prepare such Tax
Return in a manner consistent with the past practices of the Company and
Section 8.03, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law. Seller shall
instruct KPMG to deliver simultaneously to Seller and Buyer a draft of each
such Tax Return for each party's review as promptly as practicable and the
parties shall cooperate to finalize such Tax Return in a timely manner;
provided that, if the parties are unable to finalize any such Tax Return at
least three (3) Business Days before the due date for filing such Tax Return,
Seller shall instruct KPMG to resolve any disputed items in the manner
proposed by Buyer and the dispute shall be submitted to independent
accountants for resolution pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section
2.04(d). No less than two (2) Business Days before the due date for filing
each such Tax Return, KPMG shall deliver to Buyer the final form of such Tax
Return and Seller shall deliver to Buyer a cash payment equal to the portion
of the amount of any Taxes shown as due on such Tax Return that is
attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period (determined, in the case of a
Straddle Period, under Section 8.03); provided that, if any portion of any
such disputed Taxes is resolved in Seller's favor, Buyer shall, no later than
ten (10) Business Days thereafter, pay to Seller in immediately available
funds the disputed amount resolved in Seller's favor. Buyer shall timely file,
or shall cause to be filed, with the relevant Taxing Authority each such Tax
Return and timely pay to the relevant Taxing Authority all Taxes due with
respect to each such Tax Return.

  

Section 8.02. Cooperation in Tax Matters. Buyer and Seller agree to, and agree
to cause their Affiliates to cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other parties, in connection with (i) the preparation and
filing of any Tax Return relating to the Company Entities with respect to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period and (ii) the conduct of any Tax audit, litigation or
other action. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
party's request) the provision within 10 Business Days of the other party's
reasonable request of records and information that are relevant to any such
audit, litigation or other action and making employees available as and to the
extent reasonably necessary to provide assistance in such matters and in the
preparation of such Tax Returns, including through the provision within 10
Business Days of the other party's reasonable request of additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Buyer and
Seller agree (i) to retain all books and records (that are in the possession
of such party or its post-Closing Affiliates) with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to any Company Entity relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period until
the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority for all
periods required by such Taxing Authority, and (ii) to use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide the other party with at least 30 Business Days'
prior written notice before destroying any such books and records, during
which period the party receiving the notice can elect to take possession, at
its own expense, of such books and records.

  


 

  

 

47  

  


 

  

Section 8.03. Straddle Periods. For all purposes of this Agreement, in the
case of a Straddle Period, (x) ad valorem property Taxes allocable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire
taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period and (y) the amount of
all other Taxes (other than Transfer Taxes) of the Company Entities for a
Straddle Period which relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed
based on interim closing method as if such Tax period ended as of the close of
business on the Closing Date.

  

Section 8.04. Tax Claims. (a) From and after the Closing, each Party shall
notify the other Party in writing within ten (10) Business Days of the receipt
by it (or its Affiliates) of notice of any pending or threatened U.S. federal,
state, local or non-U.S. Tax audits, assessments or other claims, suits,
actions, litigations or proceedings that could reasonably be expected to give
rise to an indemnity claim under this Agreement (a "Tax Claim"). Any failure
by a Party to so notify the other Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall
have materially and adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

  

(b) (i) With respect to any audit, claim, suit, action, litigation or
proceeding (including any Tax audit) related to any Tax Claim (a "Tax
Controversy") involving a Consolidated or Combined Tax Return, Seller shall
have exclusive control of such Tax Controversy. Seller shall keep Buyer
reasonably informed regarding the status of such Tax Controversy to the extent
related to any Company Entity.

  

(ii) With respect to any Tax Controversy for a Pre-Closing Period (other than
a Straddle Period) that is not related to a Consolidated or Combined Tax
Return, Seller shall have exclusive control of such Tax Controversy; provided
that Buyer shall have the right (but not the duty) to participate in such Tax
Controversy at Buyer's expense. Seller shall keep Buyer reasonably informed
regarding the status of such Tax Controversy. To the extent a settlement of
any issue in any such Tax Controversy would adversely affect any Company
Entity in a Post-Closing Tax Period, Seller may not settle such issue without
the prior written consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed).

  

(iii) With respect to any Tax Controversy that relates to a Straddle Period,
Buyer and Seller shall jointly control such Tax Controversy and neither Party
shall settle any Tax Controversy without the consent of the other Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).

  


 

  

 

48  

  


 

  

Section 8.05. Transfer Taxes. All Transfer Taxes shall be borne equally by
Buyer and Seller. The parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
minimize the incurrence of any such Transfer Taxes. If required by Applicable
Law, either Party shall, and shall cause its post-Closing Affiliates to, join
in the execution of any applicable Tax Returns relating to Transfer Taxes.

  

Section 8.06. Tax Refund. Seller shall be entitled to the amount of any refund
of Taxes (including any related interest received from the applicable
Governmental Authority) of any Company Entity with respect to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period that is received (in cash or as an offset to Taxes that would be
payable in cash) by Buyer or its Affiliates (including any Company Entity)
after the Closing, other than any refund (i) of any Tax that is not an
Indemnified Tax or (ii) subject to Section 8.07, attributable to a carryback
of a Tax attribute from a Post-Closing Tax Period. Buyer shall pay, or cause
to be paid, to Seller any amount to which Seller is entitled pursuant to the
prior sentence within ten (10) Business Days of the receipt of the applicable
refund by Buyer or any of its Affiliates; provided, however, that Buyer shall
be entitled to offset any such refund against any outstanding indemnification
obligation of Seller pursuant to Article 11 of this Agreement and any such
refund shall be net of any out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred by Buyer
in obtaining such refund.

  

Section 8.07. Limitations on Amended Returns and Carrybacks. Except as
required by law, without the prior written consent of Seller (not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), Buyer shall not cause or permit any (i)
amendment of any Company Return for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) carryback
of any Tax attributes from any Post-Closing Tax Period of any Company Entity
to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iii) self-assessment of additional Tax for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period of any Company Entity, or (iv) Company Entity to pursue
any Tax amnesty, voluntary disclosure agreement or similar agreement or
arrangement regarding any Pre-Closing Tax Period of any Company Entity.

  

Section 8.08. No Section 338 Election. Buyer shall not make or permit to be
made any election under Section 338 of the Code (or other similar state, local
or foreign Law) with respect to any Company Entity.

  

Section 8.09. Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements. Any and all existing Tax
Sharing Agreements between any Company Entities (on the one hand) and Seller
and/or any of its post-Closing Affiliates (one the other hand) shall be
terminated (or modified) as of the Closing Date such that there shall be no
continuing liability on the part of any Company Entity.

under any defined benefit pension plan), (i) qualifying service under any
Employee Plan that is a qualified retirement plan shall be treated as
qualified service under Buyer Plans that are qualified retirement plans
following the Closing and (ii) qualifying service under any other Employee
Plan shall be treated as qualified service under any similar Buyer Plans,
including, without limitation, and vacation pay plans; provided that the
foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. Buyer
shall recognize and provide and shall cause its Affiliates (including the
Company and its Subsidiaries) to recognize and provide all accrued but unused
vacation, discretionary and sick pay of the Continuing Employees as of the
Closing Date, provided that with respect to any Continuing Employees such
accrued (i) vacation days shall not exceed three (3) weeks and (ii) sick days
shall not exceed one (1) week.

  

Section 9.03. Eligibility. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Buyer Plans that are welfare benefit plans that cover the Continuing

restrictions and limitations for preexisting conditions or insurability and
(ii) cause any payments made by the Continuing Employees under any Employee
Plan that is a medical benefit plan or group health plan to be credited to

group health plans, so as to reduce the amount of any deductible and out of
pocket requirements that the Continuing Employees must meet under such Buyer
Plans.

contribution plan sponsored by the Company or its Affiliates that includes a

permit Continuing Employees with account balances under Seller's 401(k) Plan
to make rollover contributions of their account balances (including
participant loans) to Company's 401(k) Plan.

Section 9.05. Third Parties. Notwithstanding anything in this Article 9 to the
contrary, nothing contained herein, whether express or implied, (i) is
intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other than Buyer, Seller and the
Company), including any Continuing Employee or any current or former Service

contrary contained in this Agreement, the aggregate maximum liability for
indemnification by Seller under this Article 11 shall not exceed the Purchase
Price.

  

(c) Effective at and after the Closing, Buyer hereby indemnifies the Seller,
its directors, managers, partners, officers, employees, agents, trustee,
representatives or other Affiliates and their respective successors and
assignees against and agrees to hold each of them harmless from any and all
Damages incurred or suffered by Seller, any of its Affiliates or any of their
respective successors and assignees arising out of any Warranty Breach or
breach of covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Buyer pursuant to
this Agreement (other than a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
made or to be performed pursuant to Article 8); provided that with respect to
indemnification by Buyer for Warranty Breaches pursuant to this Section, (i)
Buyer shall not be liable unless the aggregate amount of Damages with respect
to such Warranty Breaches exceeds $750,000 and then only to the extent of such
excess and (ii) Buyer's maximum liability shall not exceed $11,500,000. In
addition, Seller, its Affiliates and their respective successors and assignees
shall not have been deemed to have incurred any Damages for any Warranty
Breaches unless the Damages arising from an individual claim (or series of
claims so substantially related that they should be considered as a single
claim), exceed $25,000.

  

(d) The amount of any Damages otherwise indemnifiable under this Section 11.02
shall be reduced by any actual cash Tax savings (calculated on a with and
without basis) actually realized by the Indemnified Party and/or any of its
post-Closing Affiliates as a result of any losses, deductions or credits
attributable to such Damages with respect to any taxable year through and
including the second taxable year following the taxable year in which such
Damages were incurred.

  

Section 11.03. Third Party Claim Procedures. (a) The party seeking
indemnification under Section 11.02 (the "Indemnified Party") agrees to give
prompt notice in writing to the party against whom indemnity is to be sought
(the "Indemnifying Party") of the assertion of any claim or the commencement
of any suit, action or proceeding by any third party ("Third Party Claim") in
respect of which indemnity may be sought under such Section. Such notice shall
set forth in reasonable detail such Third Party Claim and the basis for
indemnification (taking into account the information then available to the
Indemnified Party). The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the
extent such failure shall have materially and adversely prejudiced the
Indemnifying Party.

  


 

  

 

55  

  


 

  

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
any Third Party Claim and, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Section, shall be entitled to control and appoint lead counsel for such
defense, in each case at its own expense.

  

(c) The Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or maintain control
of the defense of any Third Party Claim and shall pay the fees and expenses of
counsel retained by the Indemnified Party if the Third Party Claim pursuant to
Section 11.03(a), (i) the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection
with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation,
(ii) the Indemnified Party reasonably believes an adverse determination with
respect to the Third Party Claim would be materially detrimental to the
reputation or future business prospects of the Indemnified Party or any of its
affiliates, (iii) the Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable
relief against the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates or (iv) the
Indemnifying Party has failed or is failing to prosecute or defend the Third
Party Claim.

  

(d) If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the control of the defense of any
Third Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this Section 11.03, the
Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned)
before entering into any settlement of such Third Party Claim, if the
settlement does not expressly unconditionally release the Indemnified Party
and its affiliates from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such
Third Party Claim or the settlement imposes injunctive or other equitable
relief against the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates.

  

(e) In circumstances where the Indemnifying Party is controlling the defense
of a Third Party Claim in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) above, the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any Third
Party Claim and to employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose, in
which case the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne
solely by the Indemnified Party; provided that in such event the Indemnifying
Party shall pay the fees and expenses of such separate counsel (i) reasonably
and necessarily incurred by the Indemnified Party prior to the date the
Indemnifying Party assumes control of the defense of the Third Party Claim or
(ii) if representation of both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party by the same counsel would in the opinion of such counsel create a
conflict of interest.

  

(f) Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective affiliates to
cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and shall
furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals,
as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

  


 

  

 

56  

  


 

  

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the procedures set forth in Section 8.04
shall apply to any Tax Claim and this Section 11.03 and Section 11.04 shall
not apply.

  

Section 11.04. Direct Claim Procedures. In the event an Indemnified Party has
a claim for indemnity under Section 11.02 against an Indemnifying Party that
does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party agrees to give
prompt notice in writing of such claim to the Indemnifying Party. Such notice
shall set forth in reasonable detail such claim and the basis for
indemnification (taking into account the information then available to the
Indemnified Party). The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the
extent such failure shall have materially and adversely prejudiced the
Indemnifying Party or the survival period with respect to such claims has
elapsed in accordance with Section 11.01. If the Indemnifying Party does not
notify the Indemnified Party within 45 days following the receipt of a notice
with respect to any such claim that the Indemnifying Party disputes its
indemnity obligation to the Indemnified Party for any Damages with respect to
such claim, such Damages shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnifying Party shall promptly pay to the
Indemnified Party any and all Damages arising out of such claim. If the
Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its indemnity obligation for any
Damages with respect to such claim, the parties shall proceed in good faith to
negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through
negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by arbitration pursuant to
Section 13.07.

  

Section 11.05. Purchase Price Adjustment. To the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, any amount paid under Article 11 shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price.

  

Section 11.06. Other Indemnification Matters.

  

(a) Payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to Article 11 in Article 11 in
respect of any Damages shall be limited to the amount of any Damages that
remain after deducting therefrom any insurance proceeds actually received (net
of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in obtaining such recovery and
any increase in insurance premiums to the extent directly attributable to the
payment of such cash recovery or the existence of such Damages) by the
Indemnified Party in respect of any such claim.

  


 

  

 

57  

  


 

  

(b) With respect to any Damages or any Damages reasonably likely to be
incurred, any Indemnified Party shall, and to the extent possible shall cause
their respective Affiliates to, take all commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate such Damages or Damages reasonably likely to be incurred.

  

(c) Seller shall not be liable under this Article 11 for any Damages based
upon or arising out of any inaccuracy in or breach of any representations or
warranties of Seller, the Company or any Subsidiary contained in this
Agreement if Buyer had actual knowledge of such inaccuracy or breach prior to
the date hereof. Buyer shall not be liable under this Article 11 for any
Damages based upon or arising out of any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representations or warranties of Buyer contained in this Agreement if Seller
had actual knowledge of such inaccuracy or breach prior to the date hereof.

  

(d) Seller shall not be required to indemnify Buyer for those portions of any
Damages reflected as a liability in calculating the Final Working Capital and
paid for by Seller through any Working Capital Adjustment Amount payment
pursuant to Section 2.05.

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, except in the
case of actual fraud, no party shall be liable for any consequential damages
(including loss or diminution in value of assets or securities) or punitive,
special, exemplary or indirect damages or any damages based upon multiples of
earnings or any other similar value metrics (unless such punitive, special,
exemplary or indirect damages are awarded to any third party by any court or
arbitrator) relating to any breach of representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement.

  

Section 11.07. Sole and Exclusive Remedy. Subject to the last sentence of this
Section 11.07, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
from and after the Closing, indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this
Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties
for any misrepresentation or the failure of any representation and warranty to
not be true and correct, or any breach of any covenant or other provision or
agreement contained in this Agreement and for any and all other Damages or
claims arising under, out of or related to this Agreement, the negotiation or
execution hereof, or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no
Indemnified Party shall have any other entitlement, remedy or recourse, at law
or in equity, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, it being agreed that all
of such other remedies, entitlements and recourse are expressly waived and
released by the Indemnified Parties, respectively, on behalf of themselves and
their respective Affiliates, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable
Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary, nothing in
this Section 11.07 shall limit the right of any Party to (x) specific
performance or injunctive relief against any Party in respect of a breach by
such other Party of any covenant or agreement hereunder, (y) any

  


 

  

 

58  

  


 

  

claims of the Parties as expressly contemplated by the Transaction Agreements
or any other agreement with respect to performance or failure to perform after
the Closing (and then only to the extent of the specific obligations
undertaken by each such named party in the Transaction Agreements or such
other agreements) or (z) any claims based upon actual fraud (or against a
Party for its actual fraud) in connection with this Agreement or otherwise
pursuant to this Agreement.

  

ARTICLE 12 
 Termination

  

Section 12.01. Grounds for Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at
any time prior to the Closing:

  

 

(a) by mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer;

  

(b) by either Seller or Buyer if the Closing shall not have been consummated
on or before June 30, 2017 (the "Outside Date"); provided that if as of the
Outside Date all conditions to closing set forth in Article 10 (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at Closing) have
been satisfied or waived except for the condition set forth in Section
10.01(a) solely with respect to Serbia or Albania, then either Buyer or Seller
may, at their option, extend the Outside Date to July 31, 2017; or

  

(c) by either Seller or Buyer if there shall be any Applicable Law that makes
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby illegal or otherwise
prohibited or if consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby would
violate any nonappealable final order, decree or judgment of any Governmental
Authority having competent jurisdiction.

 

  

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.01(b) or
Section 12.01(c) shall give written notice of such termination to the other
party.

  

Section 12.02. Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated as
permitted by Section 12.01, such termination shall be without liability of
either party (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee, agent,
consultant or representative of such party) to the other party to this
Agreement; provided that if such termination shall result from the intentional
breach of any covenant or other obligation of either party to this Agreement,
such party shall be fully liable for any and all Damages incurred or suffered
by the other party as a result of such breach. The provisions of Sections
6.01, 13.04, 13.06, 13.07 and 13.09 shall survive any termination hereof
pursuant to Section 12.01.

requests and other communications shall be deemed received on the date of
receipt by the recipient thereof if received prior to 5:00 p.m. in the place
of receipt and such day is a Business Day in the place of receipt. Otherwise,
any such notice, request or communication shall be deemed not to have been

Section 13.02. Amendments and Waivers. (a) Any provision of this Agreement may
be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing
and is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement,
or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be
effective.

  

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by law.

  

Section 13.03. Disclosure Schedule References. The parties hereto agree that
any reference in a particular Section of either the Seller Disclosure Schedule
or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule shall only be deemed to be an exception to
(or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (a) the representations and
warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the relevant party that are
contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement and (b) any other
representations and warranties of such party that is contained in this
Agreement, but only if the relevance of that reference as an exception to (or
a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and warranties would be
readily apparent.

  

Section 13.04. Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such cost or expense.

  

Section 13.05. Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns; provided that no party may assign, delegate
or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement
without the consent of each other party hereto; except that Buyer may transfer
or assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from
time to time in part, to one or more of its Affiliates at any time; provided
that no such transfer or assignment shall relieve Buyer of its obligations
hereunder or enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other party hereto
or due to Buyer.

  


 

  

 

61  

  


 

  

Section 13.06. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York, without regard
to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

  

Section 13.07. Arbitration. (a) Any dispute arising out of or in connection
with this Agreement, whether such dispute arises before or after the
termination of this Agreement, which cannot be settled by discussion and
mutual accord within 60 Business Days after the date a party notifies the
other in a writing specifying such dispute, shall be settled by arbitration
administered by the International Centre for Dispute Resolution (the "ICDR")
in accordance with the then most current version of its commercial arbitration
rules (the "ICDR Rules") and as set forth in this Agreement (the
"Arbitration").

  

(b) The Arbitration shall be conducted by a panel of three arbitrators of whom
one arbitrator shall be appointed by Buyer, one by Seller and a third by the
two arbitrators so appointed. If a party fails to appoint its arbitrator
within 30 Business Days after the other party's arbitrator is appointed and
such party is served written notice of such appointment, or if the two
arbitrators so appointed are unable to agree upon the appointment of the third
arbitrator within 30 Business Days from the appointment of the second
arbitrator, then the missing arbitrator shall be a New York law-qualified
attorney with at least ten years of experience with such arbitrations
appointed by the ICDR. Each party shall submit the case to the arbitrators
within 30 Business Days after the appointment of all the arbitrators.

  

(c) In addition to the ICDR Rules chosen by the parties, the parties agree
that the arbitration shall be conducted according to the IBA Rules of Evidence
adopted on May 29, 2010. Any discovery conducted pursuant to such arbitration
(A) shall be subject to the following (i) there shall be production of
electronic documents only from sources used in the ordinary course of
business. Absent a showing of compelling need, no such documents are required
to be produced from backup servers, tapes or other media; (ii) absent a
showing of compelling need, the production of electronic documents shall
normally be made on the basis of generally available technology in a
searchable format that is usable by the party receiving the e-documents and
convenient and economical for the producing party. Absent a showing of
compelling need, the parties need not produce metadata, with the exception of
header fields for email correspondence; and (iii) where the costs and burdens
of e-discovery are disproportionate to the nature and gravity of the dispute
or to the amount in controversy, or to the relevance of the materials
requested, the arbitrator will either deny such requests or order disclosure
on condition that the requesting party advance the reasonable cost of
production to the other side, subject to the allocation of costs in the final
award.

  


 

  

 

62  

  


 

  

(d) The situs of the Arbitration shall be New York, New York, United States.

  

(e) The arbitrators shall have the power to award compensatory money damages
and interest thereupon, and shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the entire
matter in dispute, including any question as to its arbitrability; but shall
not have the power to award any exemplary or punitive damages, however
denominated, whether or not multiplied. The arbitrators shall not have power
to alter, amend or add to the provisions of this Agreement.

  

(f) The decision of the arbitrators shall be that made by the majority of the
arbitrators, based upon a hearing, in which evidence may be introduced without
following the strict rules of evidence, but in which cross-examination and
rebuttal will be allowed. The decision of the arbitrators shall be accompanied
by a reasoned opinion, which shall be in writing, signed by a majority of the
arbitrators and including findings of fact and conclusions of law. The
arbitrators will render their decision within 60 Business Days following the
termination of the hearing, unless the parties consent to an extension.

  

(g) The decision of the arbitrators shall be final and binding on the parties.
Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators pursuant to their decision
may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof, and shall be
enforceable against the parties.

  

(h) Except as may be required by law or this Agreement, neither party may
disclose the existence, content, or results of the Arbitration without the
prior written consent of both parties, and the parties will use their
reasonable best efforts to cause the arbitrators to maintain the
confidentiality of the Arbitration.

  

(i) Each party will jointly and equally bear the expense of the Arbitration.

  

Section 13.08. Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third Party Beneficiaries. This
Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be
an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were
upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each
party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the
other parties hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart
hereof signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect
and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue
of any other oral or written agreement or other communication). No provision
of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies,
obligations, or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than (i) the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns and (ii) the
Persons (or categories of Persons) specifically described in Section 6.04.

  


 

  

 

63  

  


 

  

Section 13.09. Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements
and understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement.

  

Section 13.10. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

  

Section 13.11. Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in any New
York State or Federal court sitting in the borough of Manhattan, New York, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

  

Section 13.12. Waiver of Conflicts. (a) Recognizing that Cahill Gordon and
Reindel llp has acted as legal counsel to Seller, the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates prior to the Closing and that
Cahill Gordon and Reindel llp intend to act as legal counsel to Seller and its
Affiliates after the Closing, each of Buyer and the Company and its
Subsidiaries hereby waives, on its own behalf and agrees to cause its
Affiliates to waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection with Cahill
Gordon and Reindel llp representing Seller or its Affiliates after the Closing
as such representation may relate to Buyer, the Company, any Subsidiary or the
transactions contemplated hereby. In addition, all communications involving
attorney-client confidences between Seller, the Company and its Subsidiaries
and their respective Affiliates and Cahill Gordon and Reindel llp in the course
of the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that
belong solely to Seller and its Affiliates (and not the Company or any
Subsidiary). Accordingly, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not have
access to any such communications, or to the files of Cahill Gordon and Reindel
llp relating to such engagement, from and after the Closing. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (i) Seller and
its Affiliates shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with
respect

  


 

  

 

64  

  


 

  

to such engagement, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be holders
thereof, (ii) to the extent that files of Cahill Gordon and Reindel llp in
respect of such engagement constitute property of the client, only Seller and
its Affiliates shall hold such property rights and (iii) Cahill Gordon and
Reindel llp shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such
attorney-client communications or files to the Company or any Subsidiary by
reason of any attorney-client relationship between Cahill Gordon and Reindel llp
and the Company, any Subsidiary or otherwise.

  

(b) Each of Buyer and the Company agrees that immediately prior to the
Closing, without the need for any further action, all right, title and
interest of the Company in and to any attorney-client communication between
Cahill Gordon and Reindel llp and the Seller and its Affiliates relating to this
Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, whether in the possession of the Company or Cahill Gordon
and Reindel llp, shall thereupon transfer to and be vested solely in the Seller.
Seller agrees that neither the Buyer nor the Company are waiving any right,
title or interest in or to any attorney-client communication between Cahill
Gordon and Reindel llp and solely the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that
occurred prior to Closing and are unrelated to the transactions contemplated
hereby.

  

(c) Buyer agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Company), that from and after the Closing,
(i) the attorney-client privilege or any other immunity from disclosure, and
the expectation of client confidence, as to all attorney-client communications
between Cahill Gordon and Reindel llp and the Seller and its Affiliates relating
to this Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby belong to the Seller and will not pass to or
be claimed by Buyer, the Company, or any of their Affiliates, and (ii) the
Seller will have the exclusive right to control, assert or waive the attorney-
client privilege, any work product doctrine, and the expectation of client
confidence with respect to such attorney-client communications. Accordingly,
Buyer will not, and will cause each of its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Company) not to, assert any attorney-client privilege, any work
product doctrine, or expectation of client confidence with respect to any
attorney-client communication between Cahill Gordon and Reindel llp and the
Seller and its Affiliates relating to this Agreement, the other Transaction
Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, except in the
event of a post-Closing dispute with a Person that is not the Seller or an
Affiliate of Seller. Furthermore, Buyer agrees, on its own behalf and on
behalf of each of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company),
that in the event of a dispute between the Seller or an Affiliate of Seller,
on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, arising out of or
relating to any matter in which Cahill Gordon and Reindel llp jointly
represented both parties, if applicable, neither the attorney-client
privilege, the expectation of client confidence, nor any right to any other
evidentiary privilege or any work product

  

  

 


 

  

 

65  

  


 

 

  

  

doctrine will protect against or prevent Cahill Gordon and Reindel llp's
disclosure to such Seller or an Affiliate of Seller of any information or
documents developed or shared during the course of Cahill Gordon and Reindel
llp's joint representation. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, in the event that a dispute arises between Buyer
or its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company), on the one
hand, and a Person that is not Seller or an Affiliate of Seller, on the other
hand, Buyer and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company) may
assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential
communications to such third party. In the event that any third party shall
seek to obtain attorney-client communications from Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company), or from Seller and its
Affiliates, then Buyer or Seller, shall notify Seller or Buyer, as applicable,
of such application sufficiently in advance of any hearing on the application
to permit Seller or Buyer, as applicable, to participate in any such
proceedings.
