Players and who redeem Players Club credits on a date that is following the
Closing Date and prior to the six (6) month anniversary of the Closing Date,
which liability shall be in an amount equal to the cost incurred by Purchaser
in satisfying such Players Club Liability (the "RETAINED LIABILITIES").
Seller and Los Pueblos shall, and Parent shall cause Seller and Los Pueblos
to, discharge in a timely manner or shall make adequate provision for all of
the Retained Liabilities, provided that Seller and Los Pueblos shall have the
ability to contest, in good faith, any such claim of liability asserted in
respect thereof by any Person other than Purchaser and its Affiliates.

                  1.03. PURCHASE PRICE; ALLOCATION; ADJUSTMENT.

                  (a) PURCHASE PRICE. Subject to adjustment as set forth in
SECTION 1.03(c) and SECTION 1.05 below, the aggregate purchase price for the
Assets and the covenant contained in SECTION 4.11, is $185,000,000 (the
"PURCHASE PRICE"). $500,000 of the Purchase Price is allocable to, and deemed
to be in consideration of, the covenant contained in SECTION 4.11. The
remainder of the Purchase Price is allocable to, and deemed to be in
consideration of, the Assets.

                  (b) ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PRICE. Purchaser, Seller and Los
Pueblos shall negotiate in good faith prior to the Closing Date and determine
the allocation of the consideration paid by Purchaser for the Assets. Each
party hereto agrees (i) that any such allocation shall be consistent with
paragraph (a) above and the requirements of Section 1060 of the Code and the
regulations thereunder, (ii) to complete jointly and to file separately Form
8594 with its Federal income Tax Return consistent with such allocation for
the tax year in which the Closing Date occurs and (iii) that no party will
take a position on any income, transfer or gains Tax Return, before any
Governmental or Regulatory Authority charged with the collection of any such
Tax or in any judicial proceeding, that is in any manner inconsistent with
the terms of any such allocation without the consent of the other party.

                  (c) POST-CLOSING PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT. It is the
intention of the parties hereto that current assets shall equal current
liabilities as of the Closing Date.

                           (i) As promptly as practicable after the Closing
         Date, but in no event more than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date
         (such date on which the Closing Balance Sheet is delivered, the
         "CLOSING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DELIVERY DATE"), Purchaser will prepare
         and deliver to Seller a balance sheet of Seller as of the close of
         business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the
         "CLOSING BALANCE SHEET"). The Closing Balance Sheet shall be
         accompanied by a certificate of an officer of Purchaser to the effect
         that the Closing Balance Sheet presents fairly, in accordance with GAAP
         and the accounting practices of Seller applied on a consistent basis,
         the financial condition of Seller as of the close of business on the
         day immediately preceding the Closing Date.

                           (ii) In the event that there is a Deficiency with
         respect to the Net Current Assets, Seller shall pay, and Parent shall
         cause Seller to pay, to Purchaser, as an adjustment to the Purchase
         Price (as the same may have been adjusted at Closing pursuant to
         SECTION 1.05), an aggregate amount equal to the Deficiency, less any
         amount that the Purchase Price has been previously reduced or plus any
         amount that the Purchase Price has been previously increased, in each
         case pursuant to SECTION 1.05. If the Purchase Price was previously
         reduced pursuant to SECTION 1.05 and such reduction

                                       7

<PAGE>

         exceeded the amount of the Deficiency, then Purchaser shall pay the
         amount of such excess to Seller. Any payments required to be made by
         Parent or Seller pursuant to this SECTION 1.03(c)(ii) shall be made
         within ten (10) days of the Closing Financial Statements Delivery
         Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
         designated by Purchaser.

                           (iii) In the event that there is a Surplus with
         respect to the Net Current Assets, Purchaser shall pay to Seller, as an
         adjustment to the Purchase Price (as the same may have been adjusted at
         Closing pursuant to SECTION 1.05), an amount equal to the Surplus less
         any amount that the Purchase Price has been previously increased or
         plus any amount that the Purchase Price has been previously decreased,
         in each case pursuant to SECTION 1.05. Any payments required to be made
         by Purchaser pursuant to this SECTION 1.03(c)(iii) shall be made within
         ten (10) days of the Closing Financial Statements Delivery Date by wire
         transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
         Seller.

                  1.04. CLOSING. The Closing will take place at the offices of
Lionel, Sawyer & Collins, 1700 Bank of America Plaza, 300 South Fourth Street,
Las Vegas, Nevada, 89101, or at such other place as Purchaser and Seller
mutually agree, at 8:00 A.M. local time, on the Closing Date and shall be deemed
to occur at 11:59 p.m., Las Vegas time, on the Closing Date (the "TRANSFER

of immediately available funds to such accounts as Seller may reasonably direct
by written notice delivered to Purchaser by Seller at least two (2) Business
Days before the Closing Date, PROVIDED that $1,500,000 of the Purchase Price

(a) Seller and Los Pueblos will, and Parent will cause Seller and Los Pueblos
to, assign and transfer to Purchaser all of its right, title and interest in and

delivery of (i) a General Assignment and Bill of Sale substantially in the form
of EXHIBIT B hereto (the "GENERAL ASSIGNMENT"), duly executed by Seller, (ii) a
General Assignment, duly executed by Los Pueblos, (iii) grant, bargain and sale
deeds in proper statutory form for recording and otherwise in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser conveying title to the Real Property and
(iv) such other good and sufficient instruments of conveyance, assignment and
transfer, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Purchaser's counsel, as
shall be effective to vest in Purchaser good title to the Assets (the General
Assignment and the other instruments referred to in clauses (iii) and (iv) being
collectively referred to herein as the "ASSIGNMENT INSTRUMENTS"), and (b)
Purchaser will assume from Seller and Los Pueblos the due payment, performance
and discharge of the Assumed Liabilities by delivery of (i) an Assumption
Agreement substantially in the form of EXHIBIT C hereto (the "ASSUMPTION
AGREEMENT"), duly executed by Purchaser, and (ii) such other good and sufficient
instruments of assumption, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Seller's and Los Pueblos' counsel, as shall be effective to cause Purchaser to
assume the Assumed Liabilities as and to the extent provided in SECTION 1.02(a)
(the Assumption Agreement and such other instruments referred to in clause (ii)
being collectively referred to herein as the "ASSUMPTION INSTRUMENTS"). At the
Closing, there shall also be delivered to Seller, Los Pueblos and Purchaser

                                       8

<PAGE>

the opinions, certificates and other contracts, documents and instruments
required to be delivered under ARTICLES VI and VII.

                  1.05. PRE-CLOSING PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT.

                  (a) It is the intention of the parties hereto that current
assets shall equal current liabilities as of the Closing Date.

                  (b) On or before the fifth (5th) Business Day preceding the
Closing Date, Seller shall, and Parent shall cause Seller to, prepare and
deliver to Purchaser an interim balance sheet of the Seller as of the close of
business on the final day of the calendar month immediately preceding the
calendar month during which the Closing Date occurs; provided that if the
Closing Date occurs within the first five (5) days of a calendar month, the
interim balance sheet shall be as of the close of business on the final day of
the second calendar month immediately preceding the calendar month during which
the Closing Date occurs. Such interim balance sheet shall be accompanied by a
calculation of the Net Current Assets as of such date prepared from the interim
balance sheet, and a certificate of an officer of Seller to the effect that such
calculation was prepared in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and that
such interim balance sheet presents fairly, in accordance with GAAP and the
accounting practices of the Seller applied on a consistent basis, the financial
condition of the Seller as of the close of business on the final day of the
calendar month preceding the calendar month during which the Closing Date
occurs.

                  (c) In the event that there is a Deficiency with respect to
the Net Current Assets calculated in accordance with clause (b) above, the
Purchase Price shall be reduced in amount equal to 125% of such Deficiency.

                  (d) In the event that there is a Surplus with respect to the
Net Current Assets calculated in accordance with clause (b) above, Purchaser
shall pay to Seller at Closing as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, an amount
equal to the Surplus.

                  (e) In the event the results of the Phase I delivered pursuant
to SECTION 4.19 reveals an environmental condition as to the Real Property in
breach of the representations and warranties in SECTION 6.01, to the extent that
the cost of curing such condition is more than $100,000 and less than
$1,000,000, such breach shall not be considered material and the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by the amount equal to the reasonable estimated cost of
remedying such environmental condition; provided, however, that in the event the
cost of curing such condition is less than $100,000 there shall be no adjustment
to the Purchase Price.

                  1.06. FUNDS ESCROWED TO COMPLY WITH NRS. Parent, Seller and
Los Pueblos acknowledge and agree that there may be withheld from funds payable
to Seller at the Closing such amounts as shall be necessary to comply with the
provisions of NRS 360.525, 612.695, and 616B.269, or to satisfy requirements to
which the Real Property or a portion thereof may be subject pursuant to NRS
244.335. To the extent any such funds are withheld from Seller or Los Pueblos by
Purchaser, Purchaser shall deposit such funds into the Escrow Account to be held
by the Escrow Agent until such time as Seller or Los Pueblos furnishes the
Escrow Agent with receipts or certificates provided for in said statutes
certifying that the applicable obligations have been paid or discharged or that
funds out of the Purchase Price sufficient for such purpose are

                                       9

<PAGE>

held by the Escrow Agent. If Seller or Los Pueblos does not produce such
receipts, certificates or evidence within the time periods provided for in
said statutes, or if any lien or other claim therefor is asserted against
Purchaser or the Real Property (or any portion thereof) the Escrow Agent may
pay such sums as may be required by such statutes to the appropriate
authority.

                  1.07. PRORATIONS. The following prorations relating to the
Assets and the ownership and operation of the Business will be made as of the
Closing Date, with Seller or Los Pueblos liable to the extent such items
relate to any time period prior to the Closing Date and Purchaser liable to
the extent such items relate to periods beginning with and subsequent to the
Closing Date:

                  (a) Real estate taxes on or with respect to the Assets.

                  (b) Rents, additional rents, taxes and other items payable

connection with similar transactions.

Except as otherwise agreed by the parties, the net amount of all such
prorations will be settled and paid on the Closing Date. If the Closing shall
occur before a real estate tax rate is fixed, the apportionment of taxes
shall be based upon the tax rate for the preceding year applied to the latest
assessed valuation.

                  1.08. FURTHER ASSURANCES; POST-CLOSING COOPERATION.

                  (a) At any time or from time to time after the Closing, at
Purchaser's request and without further consideration, Seller and Los Pueblos
shall, and Parent shall cause Seller and Los Pueblos to, execute and deliver
to Purchaser such other instruments of sale, transfer, conveyance, assignment
and confirmation, provide such materials and information and take such other
actions as Purchaser may reasonably deem necessary or desirable in order more
effectively to transfer, convey and assign to Purchaser, and to confirm
Purchaser's title to, all of the Assets, and, to the full extent permitted by
Law, to put Purchaser in actual possession and operating control of the
Business and the Assets and to assist Purchaser in exercising all rights with
respect thereto, and otherwise to cause Seller and Los Pueblos to fulfill
their obligations under this Agreement and the Operative Agreements.

                  (b) Following the Closing, each party will afford the other
party, its counsel and its accountants, during normal business hours, reasonable
access to the books, records and other data relating to the Business in its
possession with respect to periods prior to the Closing and the right to make
copies and extracts therefrom, to the extent that such access may be reasonably
required by the requesting party in connection with (i) the preparation of Tax
Returns, (ii) the determination or enforcement of rights and obligations under
this Agreement,

Authority, (iv) the determination or enforcement of the rights and
obligations of any party to this Agreement or any of the Operative Agreements
or (v) in connection with any actual or threatened Action or Proceeding.
Further each party agrees for a period extending six (6) years after the
Closing Date not to destroy or otherwise dispose of any such books, records
and other data unless such party shall first offer in writing to surrender
such books, records and other data to the other party and such other party
shall not agree in writing to take possession thereof during the ten (10) day
period after such offer is made.

                  (c) If, in order properly to prepare its Tax Returns, other
documents or reports required to be filed with Governmental or Regulatory
Authorities or its financial statements or to fulfill its obligations
hereunder, it is necessary that a party be furnished with additional
information, documents or records relating to the Business not referred to in
paragraph (c) above, and such information, documents or records are in the
possession or control of the other party, such other party shall use its best
efforts to furnish or make available such information, documents or records
(or copies thereof) at the recipient's request, cost and expense. Any
information obtained by Seller or Los Pueblos in accordance with this
paragraph shall be held confidential by Seller or Los Pueblos, as the case
may be, in accordance with SECTION 14.06.

                  (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Section, if the parties are in an adversarial relationship in litigation
or arbitration, the furnishing of information, documents or records in
accordance with paragraphs (c) or (d) of this Section shall be subject to
applicable rules relating to discovery.

                  1.09. THIRD-PARTY CONSENTS. To the extent that any Real
Property Lease, Personal Property Lease, Business Contract or Business
License is not assignable without the consent of another party, this
Agreement shall not constitute an assignment or an attempted assignment
thereof if such assignment or attempted assignment would constitute a breach
thereof or a default thereunder. Parent, Seller and Los Pueblos, on the one
hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the consent of such other party to the assignment of any
such Real Property Lease, Personal Property Lease, Business Contract or
Business License to Purchaser in all cases in which such consent is or may be
required for such assignment. If any such consent shall not be obtained,
Parent, Seller and Los Pueblos shall cooperate with Purchaser in any
reasonable arrangement designed to provide for Purchaser the benefits
intended to be assigned to Purchaser under the relevant Real Property Lease,
Personal Property Lease, Business Contract or Business License, including
enforcement at the cost and for the account of Purchaser of any and all
rights of Seller or Los Pueblos against the other party thereto arising out
of the breach or cancellation thereof by such other party or otherwise. If
and to the extent that such arrangement cannot be made, Purchaser shall have
no obligation pursuant to SECTION 1.02 or otherwise with respect to any such
Real Property Lease, Personal Property Lease, Business Contract or Business
License. The provisions of this SECTION 1.09 shall not affect the right of
Purchaser not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
if the condition to its obligations hereunder contained in SECTION 6.06 has
not been fulfilled.

                  1.10. INSURANCE PROCEEDS. If any of the Assets are
destroyed or damaged or taken in condemnation, the insurance proceeds or
condemnation award or claim for insurance

                                       11

<PAGE>

proceeds or condemnation award with respect thereto shall be an Asset. At the
Closing, Seller and Los Pueblos shall, and Parent shall cause Seller and Los
Pueblos to, pay or credit to Purchaser any such insurance proceeds or
condemnation awards received by it on or prior to the Closing and shall
assign to or assert for the benefit of Purchaser all of its rights against
any insurance companies, Governmental or Regulatory Authorities and others
with respect to such damage, destruction or condemnation. As and to the
extent that there is available insurance under policies maintained by Seller
or Los Pueblos and their Affiliates, predecessors and successors in respect
of any Assumed Liability, except for any such insurance proceeds with respect
to which the insured is directly or indirectly self-insured or has agreed to
indemnify the insurer, Parent, Seller and Los Pueblos shall cause such
insurance to be applied toward the payment of such Assumed Liability. The
provisions of this SECTION 1.10 shall not affect the right of Purchaser not
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement if the
condition to its obligations hereunder contained in SECTION 6.01 has not been
fulfilled.

                  1.11. REDEMPTION OF GAMING CHIPS AND TOKENS. In the event
that Purchaser does not elect to acquire Seller's chips and tokens pursuant
to SECTION 1.01(b)(vii), Purchaser shall: (i) redeem as Seller's agent, but
without any liability therefor, any gaming chips, tokens, racebook,
sportsbook and keno tickets (from any series in use as of or prior to the
Transfer Time) of Seller relating to the use and operation of the Business,
which are presented by patrons of the Business or Purchaser within the
applicable Nevada statutory time periods for such redemptions; (ii) be
reimbursed by Seller for redeeming Seller's gaming chips, tokens, racebook,
sportsbook and keno tickets, to the extent redeemed by Purchaser during such
statutory periods; and (iii) be reimbursed as often as weekly by Seller, upon
delivery to Seller of such Seller's gaming chips, tokens, racebook,
sportsbook and keno tickets. In such event, Parent and Seller agree to make
arrangements for additional redemption of its gaming chips, tokens, racebook,
sportsbook and keno tickets as required by Nevada law.

                  1.12. COLLECTION OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. For a period of
ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts in the ordinary course of business to collect all accounts
receivable of the Business and promptly remit the proceeds to Seller. Upon
the expiration of such ninety (90) day period, Purchaser shall thereafter be
under no obligation to use such efforts to collect such accounts receivable;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any such accounts receivable actually collected
thereafter by Purchaser shall be promptly remitted to Seller.

         (which is defined as that area bounded by Paradise Road and straight
         extensions thereof on the East, Charleston Boulevard on the North, I-15
         on the West, and Sunset Road on the South) and (C) Downtown Las Vegas

         extensions thereof on the East, I-515 (U.S. Highway 93/95) on the
         North, I-15 on the West, and Charleston Boulevard on the South)). As
         used in this provision, "GAMING BUSINESS" means the operation of an

                  (b) The parties hereto recognize that the Laws and public
policies of the various states of the United States may differ as to the
validity and enforceability of covenants similar to those set forth in this
Section. It is the intention of the parties that the provisions of this Section
be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the Laws and policies of
each jurisdiction in which enforcement may be sought, and that the
unenforceability (or the modification to conform to such Laws or policies) of
any provisions of this Section shall not render unenforceable, or impair, the
remainder of the provisions of this Section. Accordingly, if any provision of
this Section shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity

                                     32

<PAGE>

or unenforceability shall be deemed to apply only with respect to the operation
of such provision in the particular jurisdiction in which such determination is
made and not with respect to any other provision or jurisdiction. If any of the
covenants contained in this SECTION 4.11, or any part thereof, is held to be
unenforceable because of the duration of such provisions or the area covered
thereby, Seller, Parent, Los Pueblos and each member of the Maloof family agree
that the court making such determination shall have the power to reduce the
duration and the area or both of any such provision and, in its reduced form,
said provision shall then be enforceable. The parties hereto intend to and
hereby confer jurisdiction to enforce the covenants contained in this SECTION
4.11 upon the courts of any Nevada within the geographical scope of such
covenants.

                  (c) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any remedy
at Law for any breach of the provisions of this SECTION 4.11 would be
inadequate, and Parent, Seller, Los Pueblos and each member of the Maloof family
hereby consent to the granting by any court of an injunction or other equitable
relief, without the necessity of actual monetary loss being proved, in order
that the breach or threatened breach of such provisions may be effectively
restrained. Parent, Seller, Los Pueblos and each member of the Maloof family
acknowledge and agree that the scope and duration of the provisions of this
SECTION 4.11 are reasonable in all respects.

transaction or circumstance. No notice given pursuant to this Section shall
have any effect on the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement for purposes of determining satisfaction of any

If Purchaser requests such transfer of the Tax Experience Rating, Seller

with SECTION 1.08.

                  8.03. PRE-CLOSING TAXES. Seller shall, and Parent shall cause

reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and costs resulting from, arising out of or
relating to (i) Pre-Closing Taxes and (ii) any Taxes of Seller measured by

the period commencing after the Closing Date.

                  (c) Purchaser will be responsible for and indemnify and hold

                  8.05. TAX COOPERATION. After the Closing Date, Seller and Los
Pueblos will, and Parent will cause Seller and Los Pueblos to, cooperate with
Purchaser, and Purchaser will cooperate with Seller and Los Pueblos, in the

costs incurred by Seller or Los Pueblos that are not refunded or reimbursed by
Purchaser, (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Purchaser in

contest, resolve and defend against any assessment, notice of deficiency or

Pre-Closing Taxes and shall be entitled to all refunds with respect to such

relating to all Taxes other than Pre-Closing Taxes by any taxing authority, and
shall have the right to initiate any claim for refund, file any amended returns,
contest, resolve and defend against any assessment, notice of deficiency or
other adjustment or proposed adjustment relating or with respect to Taxes other
than Pre-Closing Taxes, and shall be entitled to all refunds with respect to
such Taxes; provided that Purchaser will consult in good faith with Seller with
respect to any Taxes for periods that include the Closing Date, and Seller shall
be entitled to any refunds for such period to the extent the refund is
allocable, in accordance with the principles of SECTION 8.04(b) to that portion
of such period ending on the Closing Date.


                                   ARTICLE IX

                                   [RESERVED].



                                    ARTICLE X

                    SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES,
                            COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS


                  10.01. SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS AND
AGREEMENTS. Notwithstanding any right of Purchaser (whether or not exercised) to
investigate the Business or any right of any party (whether or not exercised) to
investigate the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other
party contained in this Agreement, Seller, Parent, Los Pueblos and Purchaser
have the right to rely fully upon the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the other parties in this Agreement. The representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of Seller, Parent, Los Pueblos and
Purchaser contained in this Agreement will survive the Closing (a) indefinitely
with respect to (i) the representations and warranties contained in SECTIONS
2.02, 2.26, 3.02 and 3.06 and (ii) the covenants and agreements contained in
SECTIONS 1.01, 1.02, 1.08, 8.05, 14.04 and 14.06, (b) until sixty (60) days
after the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitation (including all
periods of extension, whether automatic or permissive) with respect to matters
covered by SECTIONS 2.09 and 2.21 and (insofar as they relate to ERISA or the
Code) SECTION 2.12 and ARTICLE VIII, (c) until the date that is two years
following the Closing Date in the case of all other representations and
warranties and any covenant or agreement to be performed in whole or in part on
or prior to the Closing or (d) with respect to each other covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement, until sixty (60) days following the last date on
which such covenant or agreement is to be performed; provided that any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that would otherwise terminate
in accordance with clause (b), (c) or (d) above will continue to survive if a
Claim Notice or Indemnity Notice (as applicable) shall have been timely given
under ARTICLE XI on or prior to

                                     42

<PAGE>

such termination date, until the related claim for indemnification has been
satisfied or otherwise resolved as provided in ARTICLE XI.

                                 INDEMNIFICATION


                  11.01. INDEMNIFICATION.

                  (a) Subject to paragraph (c) of this Section and the other
Sections of this ARTICLE XI, Parent, Seller and Los Pueblos shall jointly and
severally indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in respect of, and hold
each of them harmless from and against, any and all Losses suffered, incurred or
sustained by any of them or to which any of them becomes subject, resulting
from, arising out of or relating to (i) any breach of representation or warranty
or nonfulfillment of or failure to perform any covenant or agreement on the part
of Parent, Seller, Los Pueblos or Maloof family members contained in this
Agreement (determined in all cases as if the terms "material" or "materially"
were not included therein) or (ii) any and all other Liabilities, obligations
and costs of Seller arising prior to the Closing Date (other than the Assumed
Liabilities), including, without limitation, any and all unfair labor practice
charges brought against Purchaser as a successor to Seller under the National
Labor Relations Act or any other federal, state or local labor laws or any
employment laws.

                  (b) Subject to the other Sections of this ARTICLE XI,
Purchaser shall indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties in respect of, and hold
each of them harmless from and against, any and all Losses suffered, incurred or
sustained by any of them or to which any of them becomes subject, resulting
from, arising out of or relating to (i) any breach of representation or warranty
or nonfulfillment of or failure to perform any covenant or agreement on the part
of Purchaser contained in this Agreement or (ii) an Assumed Liability.

                  (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, no amounts of indemnity shall be payable as a result of any claim in
respect of a Loss arising under paragraph (a)(i) of SECTION 11.01:

                           (i) unless, and until Purchaser Indemnified Parties
         have suffered, incurred, sustained or become subject to Losses referred
         to in this SECTION 11.01 in excess of $250,000 in the aggregate, in
         which event the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
         claim indemnity for the full amount of such Losses;

                           (ii) in excess of $20,000,000 in the aggregate.

Provided that this paragraph (c) shall not apply to a breach of a representation
or warranty contained in SECTION 2.02, SECTION 2.03, SECTION 2.04, SECTION 2.12,
SECTION 2.20, SECTION 2.21, SECTION 2.25, SECTION 2.26 or SECTION 8.01, or to
the breach of a covenant contained in SECTION 1.03(C), SECTION 1.08, SECTION
4.11, SECTION 8.05, SECTION 14.04 and SECTION 14.06.

                                     43

<PAGE>

                  11.02. METHOD OF ASSERTING CLAIMS. All claims for
indemnification by any Indemnified Party under SECTION 11.01 will be asserted
and resolved as follows:

                  (a) In the event any claim or demand in respect of which an
Indemnified Party might seek indemnity under SECTION 11.01 is asserted against
or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party by a Person other than
Seller, Los Pueblos or any Affiliate of Seller or of Purchaser (a "THIRD PARTY
CLAIM"), the Indemnified Party shall deliver a Claim Notice with reasonable
promptness to the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to provide
the Claim Notice with reasonable promptness after the Indemnified Party receives
notice of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be obligated
to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party's ability to defend has been irreparably
prejudiced by such failure of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party will
notify the Indemnified Party as soon as practicable within the Dispute Period
whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party
under SECTION 11.01 and whether the Indemnifying Party desires, at its sole cost
and expense, to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim.

                           (i) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the
         Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period that the Indemnifying Party
         desires to defend the Indemnified Party with respect to the Third Party
         Claim pursuant to this SECTION 11.02(a), then the Indemnifying Party
         will have the right to defend, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
         the Indemnified Party, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying
         Party, such Third Party Claim by all appropriate proceedings, which
         proceedings will be vigorously and diligently prosecuted by the
         Indemnifying Party to a final conclusion or will be settled at the
         discretion of the Indemnifying Party (but only with the consent of the
         Indemnified Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, in
         the case of any settlement that provides for any relief other than the
         payment of monetary damages as to which the Indemnified Party will be
         indemnified in full). The Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have
         waived its right to dispute its liability to the Indemnified Party
         under SECTION 11.01 with respect to any Third Party Claim as to which
         it elects to control the defense. The Indemnifying Party will have full
         control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or
         settlement thereof; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party may,
         at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnified Party, at any time
         prior to the Indemnifying Party's delivery of the notice referred to in
         the first sentence of this SECTION 11.02(a)(i), file any motion, answer
         or other pleadings or take any other action that the Indemnified Party
         reasonably believes to be necessary or appropriate to protect its
         interests; and provided further, that if requested by the Indemnifying
         Party, the Indemnified Party will, at the sole cost and expense of the
         Indemnifying Party, provide reasonable cooperation to the Indemnifying
         Party in contesting any Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party
         elects to contest. The Indemnified Party may retain separate counsel to
         represent it in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any
         Third Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
         SECTION 11.02(a)(i), and the Indemnified Party will bear its own costs
         and expenses with respect to such separate counsel except as provided
         in the preceding sentence and except that the Indemnifying Party will
         pay the costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (x) in the
         Indemnified Party's good faith judgment, it is advisable, based on
         advice of counsel, for the

                                     44

<PAGE>

         Indemnified Party to be represented by separate counsel because a
         conflict or potential conflict exists between the Indemnifying Party
         and the Indemnified Party which makes representation of both parties
         inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct or
         (y) the named parties to such Third Party Claim include both the
         Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and the Indemnified
         Party determines in good faith, based on advice of counsel, that
         defenses are available to it that are unavailable to the
         Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified
         Party may retain or take over the control of the defense or
         settlement of any Third Party Claim the defense of which the
         Indemnifying Party has elected to control if the Indemnified Party
         irrevocably waives its right to indemnity under SECTION 11.01 with
         respect to such Third Party Claim.

                           (ii) If the Indemnifying Party fails to notify the
         Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period that the Indemnifying Party
         desires to defend the Third Party Claim pursuant to SECTION 11.02(a),
         or if the Indemnifying Party gives such notice but fails to prosecute
         vigorously and diligently or settle the Third Party Claim, then the
         Indemnified Party will have the right to defend, at the sole cost and
         expense of the Indemnifying Party, the Third Party Claim by all
         appropriate proceedings, which proceedings will be prosecuted by the
         Indemnified Party in good faith or will be settled at the discretion of
         the Indemnified Party (with the consent of the Indemnifying Party,
         which consent will not be unreasonably withheld). The Indemnified Party
         will have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any
         compromise or settlement thereof; provided, however, that if requested
         by the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party will, at the sole cost
         and expense of the Indemnifying Party, provide reasonable cooperation
         to the Indemnified Party and its counsel in contesting any Third Party
         Claim which the Indemnified Party is contesting. Notwithstanding the
         foregoing provisions of this SECTION 11.02(a)(ii), if the Indemnifying
         Party has notified the Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period that
         the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability hereunder to the
         Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim and if such
         dispute is resolved in favor of the Indemnifying Party in the manner
         provided in clause (iii) below, the Indemnifying Party will not be
         required to bear the costs and expenses of the Indemnified Party's
         defense pursuant to this SECTION 11.02(a)(ii) or of the Indemnifying
         Party's participation therein at the Indemnified Party's request, and
         the Indemnified Party will reimburse the Indemnifying Party in full for
         all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnifying Party in
         connection with such litigation. The Indemnifying Party may participate
         in, but not control, any defense or settlement controlled by the
         Indemnified Party pursuant to this SECTION 11.02(a)(ii), and the
         Indemnifying Party will bear its own costs and expenses with respect to
         such participation.

                           (iii) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the
         Indemnified Party that it does not dispute its liability to the
         Indemnified Party with respect to the Third Party Claim under SECTION
         11.01 or fails to notify the Indemnified Party within the Dispute
         Period whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the
         Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim, the Loss
         arising from such Third Party Claim will be conclusively deemed a
         liability of the Indemnifying Party under SECTION 11.01 and the
         Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such Loss to the Indemnified
         Party on demand following the final determination thereof. If the
         Indemnifying Party has timely

                                     45

<PAGE>

         disputed its liability with respect to such claim, the Indemnifying
         Party and the Indemnified Party will proceed in good faith to
         negotiate a resolution of such dispute, and if not resolved through
         negotiations within the Resolution Period, such dispute shall be
         resolved by arbitration in accordance with SECTION 11.02(c).

                  (b) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim
under SECTION 11.01 against any Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall deliver an Indemnity Notice with
reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying Party. The failure by any Indemnified
Party to give the Indemnity Notice shall not impair such party's rights
hereunder except to the extent that an Indemnifying Party demonstrates that it
has been irreparably prejudiced thereby. If the Indemnifying Party notifies the
Indemnified Party that it does not dispute the claim described in such Indemnity
Notice or fails to notify the Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period
whether the Indemnifying Party disputes the claim described in such Indemnity
Notice, the Loss arising from the claim specified in such Indemnity Notice will
be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party under SECTION 11.01
and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such Loss to the Indemnified
Party on demand following the final determination thereof. If the Indemnifying
Party has timely disputed its liability with respect to such claim, the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will proceed in good faith to
negotiate a resolution of such dispute, and if not resolved through negotiations
within the Resolution Period, such dispute shall be resolved by arbitration in
accordance with SECTION 11.02(c).

                  (c) Any dispute submitted to arbitration pursuant to this
SECTION 11.02 shall be finally and conclusively determined by the decision of a
board of arbitration consisting of three (3) members (hereinafter sometimes
called the "BOARD OF ARBITRATION") selected as hereinafter provided. Each of the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall select one (1) member and the
third member shall be selected by mutual agreement of the other members, or if
the other members fail to reach agreement on a third member within twenty (20)
days after their selection, such third member shall thereafter be selected by
the American Arbitration Association upon application made to it for a third
member possessing expertise or experience appropriate to the dispute jointly by
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party. The Board of Arbitration shall
meet in Las Vegas, Nevada or such other place as a majority of the members of
the Board of Arbitration determines more appropriate, and shall reach and render
a decision in writing (concurred in by a majority of the members of the Board of
Arbitration) with respect to the amount, if any, which the Indemnifying Party is
required to pay to the Indemnified Party in respect of a claim filed by the
Indemnified Party. In connection with rendering its decisions, the Board of
Arbitration shall adopt and follow such rules and procedures as a majority of
the members of the Board of Arbitration deems necessary or appropriate. To the
extent practical, decisions of the Board of Arbitration shall be rendered no
more than thirty (30) days following commencement of proceedings with respect
thereto. The Board of Arbitration shall cause its written decision to be
delivered to the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party. Any decision made
by the Board of Arbitration (either prior to or after the expiration of such
thirty (30) day period) shall be final, binding and conclusive on the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and entitled to be enforced to the
fullest extent permitted by law and entered in any court of competent
jurisdiction. Each party to any arbitration shall bear its own expense in
relation thereto, including but not limited to such party's attorneys' fees, if
any, and the

                                     46

<PAGE>

expenses and fees of the Board of Arbitration shall be divided between the

All such notices, requests and other communications will (i) if delivered
personally to the address as provided in this Section, be deemed given upon
delivery, (ii) if delivered by facsimile transmission to the facsimile number
as provided in this Section, be deemed given upon receipt, and (iii) if
delivered by mail in the manner described above to the address as provided in
this Section, be deemed given upon receipt (in each case regardless of
whether such notice, request or other communication is received by any other
Person to whom a copy of such notice, request or other communication is to be
delivered pursuant to this Section). Any party from time to time may change
its address, facsimile number or other information for the purpose of notices
to that party by giving notice specifying such change to the other party
hereto.

                  14.02. BULK SALES ACT. The parties hereby waive compliance
with the bulk sales act or comparable statutory provisions of each applicable
jurisdiction.

                  14.03. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement and the Operative
Agreements supersede all prior discussions and agreements between the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

                  14.04. EXPENSES. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement (including, without limitation, as provided in SECTION 12.02),
whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, each
party will pay its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with the

or releases to the public with

                                       59

<PAGE>

respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the
consent of the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If
either party is unable to obtain the approval of its public report, statement
or release from the other party and the party seeking such approval
reasonably considers such report, statement or release to be required by Law
in order to discharge such party's disclosure obligations, then such party
may make or issue the legally required report, statement or release and
promptly furnish the other party with a copy thereof. Seller and Purchaser
will also obtain the other party's prior approval of any press release to be
issued immediately following the Closing announcing the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                  14.06. CONFIDENTIALITY. Each party hereto will hold, and
will use its best efforts to cause its Affiliates, and in the case of
Purchaser, any Person who has provided, or who is considering providing,
financing to Purchaser to finance all or any portion of the Purchase Price,
and their respective Representatives to hold, in strict confidence from any
Person (other than any such Affiliate, Person who has provided, or who is
considering providing, financing or Representative), unless (i) compelled to
disclose by judicial or administrative process (including, without
limitation, in connection with obtaining the necessary approvals of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby of Governmental or
Regulatory Authorities) or by other requirements of Law or (ii) disclosed in
an Action or Proceeding brought by a party hereto in pursuit of its rights or
in the exercise of its remedies hereunder, all documents and information
concerning the other party or any of its Affiliates furnished to it by the
other party or such other party's Representatives in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent that
such documents or information can be shown to have been (a) previously known
by the party receiving such documents or information, (b) in the public
domain (either prior to or after the furnishing of such documents or
information hereunder) through no fault of such receiving party or (c) later
acquired by the receiving party from another source if the receiving party is
not aware that such source is under an obligation to another party hereto to
keep such documents and information confidential; provided that following the
Closing the foregoing restrictions will not apply to Purchaser's use of
documents and information concerning the Business, the Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities furnished by Parent, Seller or Los Pueblos hereunder. In the
event the transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated, upon the
request of the other party, each party hereto will, and will cause its
Affiliates, any Person who has provided, or who is considering providing,
financing to such party and their respective Representatives to, promptly
(and in no event later than five (5) Business Days after such request)
redeliver or cause to be redelivered all copies of documents and information
furnished by the other party in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and destroy or cause to be destroyed all
notes, memoranda, summaries, analyses, compilations and other writings
related thereto or based thereon prepared by the party furnished such
documents and information or its Representatives.

                  14.07. WAIVER; REMEDIES; ATTORNEYS FEES. Any term or
condition of this Agreement may be waived at any time by the party that is
entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such waiver shall be effective unless
set forth in a written instrument duly executed by or on behalf of the party
waiving such term or condition. No waiver by any party of any term or
condition of this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to
be or construed as a waiver of the same or any other term or condition of
this Agreement on any future occasion.

                                       60

<PAGE>

All remedies, either under this Agreement or by Law or otherwise afforded,
will be cumulative and not alternative. The parties hereto agree that the
Business is a unique asset and that damages suffered by Purchaser as a result
of a breach of this Agreement by Parent, Seller or Los Pueblos would be
impracticable to determine. Accordingly, the parties hereto agree that
Purchaser shall be entitled to seek specific performance of the terms of this
Agreement in the event of a breach of the terms of this Agreement. In the
event of a dispute between the parties hereto arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or any breach hereof, the prevailing party in such dispute
will be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys fees and other costs and
expenses relating to such dispute from the non-prevailing party.

                  14.08. AMENDMENT. This Agreement may be amended,
supplemented or modified only by a written instrument duly executed by or on
behalf of each party hereto.

                  14.09. NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY. The terms and provisions
of this Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of each party hereto
and their respective successors or permitted assigns, and it is not the
intention of the parties to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any
other Person other than any Person entitled to indemnity under ARTICLE XI.

                  14.10. NO ASSIGNMENT; BINDING EFFECT. Neither this
Agreement nor any right, interest or obligation hereunder may be assigned by
any party hereto without the prior written consent of the other party hereto
and any attempt to do so will be void, except (a) for assignments and
transfers by operation of Law, (b) to a "qualified intermediary" for purposes
of Section 1031 of the Code and (c) that Purchaser may assign any or all of
its rights, interests and obligations hereunder (including, without
limitation, its rights under ARTICLE XI) to (i) a wholly-owned subsidiary,
provided that any such subsidiary agrees in writing to be bound by all of the
terms, conditions and provisions contained herein, (ii) any post-Closing
purchaser of the Business or a substantial part of the Assets or (iii) any
financial institution providing purchase money or other financing to
Purchaser from time to time as collateral security for such financing.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement is binding upon, inures to
the benefit of and is enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns.

                  14.11. HEADINGS. The headings used in this Agreement have
been inserted for convenience of reference only and do not define or limit
the provisions hereof.

                  14.12. CONSENT TO JURISDICTION; VENUE. Each party hereby
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States
District Court for the District of Nevada or any court of the State of Nevada
located in the City of Las Vegas in any action, suit or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the Operative Agreements or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and agrees that any
such action, suit or proceeding shall be brought only in such court,
provided, however, that such consent to jurisdiction is solely for the
purpose referred to in this Section and shall not be deemed to be a general
submission to the jurisdiction of said courts or in the State of Nevada other
than for such purpose. Each party hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to
the laying of the venue of any such action, suit or proceeding brought in
such a court and any claim that any such action, suit or proceeding brought
in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

<PAGE>

                  14.13. INVALID PROVISIONS. If any provision of this
Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present
or future Law, and if the rights or obligations of any party hereto under
this Agreement will not be materially and adversely affected thereby, (a)
such provision will be fully severable, (b) this Agreement will be construed
and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never
comprised a part hereof and (c) the remaining provisions of this Agreement
will remain in full force and effect and will not be affected by the illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance herefrom.

                  14.14. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Nevada applicable
to a contract executed and performed in such State, without giving effect to
the conflicts of laws principles thereof.

                  14.15. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of
which together will constitute one and the same instrument.
