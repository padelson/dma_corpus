"Agreement"), among Anthem, Inc., an Indiana corporation ("Purchaser"), AI Sub

of Purchaser ("Merger Sub"), and Trigon Healthcare, Inc., a Virginia corporation
("Company").

                                   WITNESSETH:

         WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Company and Purchaser
deem it advisable and in the best interests of each corporation and its
respective stockholders that Company and Purchaser engage in a business
combination in order to advance the long-term strategic business interests of
Company and Purchaser;

         WHEREAS, the combination of Company and Purchaser shall be effected by
the terms of this Agreement through a merger as outlined below (the "Merger");

         WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, the respective Boards of Directors of
Company, Purchaser and Merger Sub have approved or adopted this Agreement,
pursuant to which Company will be merged with and into Merger Sub on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, with each share of
Class A common stock, $0.01 par value, of Company ("Company Common Stock")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (as defined in
Section 1.3), other than Company Treasury Shares (as defined in Section 1.8(a))
and shares of Company Common Stock owned by Purchaser or Merger Sub, being
converted into (as such amount may be increased as set forth in Section 7.1(i)
hereof) the right to receive (i) $30.00 cash and (ii) 1.062 shares of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Purchaser ("Purchaser Common Stock");

         WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the
Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations promulgated
thereunder (the "Code") and that this Agreement shall constitute a plan of
reorganization within the meaning of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and

         WHEREAS, as an inducement to and condition of Purchaser's willingness
to enter into this Agreement, Company and Purchaser have entered into the Stock

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

                                   ARTICLE I
                                   THE MERGER

         1.1. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Virginia Stock Corporation Act


<PAGE>


("VSCA") and the Indiana Business Corporation Law ("IBCL"), Company shall be
merged with and into Merger Sub at the Effective Time. Upon consummation of the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of Company shall cease and Merger Sub
shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation") and
shall change its name to Trigon Healthcare, Inc.

         1.2. Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the closing
of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Closing") will take place on the second Business Day after the satisfaction or
waiver (subject to applicable law) of the conditions set forth in Article VI
(other than any such conditions which by their terms cannot be satisfied until
the Closing Date, which shall be required to be so satisfied or waived (subject
to applicable law) on the Closing Date), unless another time or date is agreed
to in writing by the parties hereto (the actual time and date of the Closing
being referred to herein as the "Closing Date"). The Closing shall be held at
the offices of Baker & Daniels, 300 North Meridian Street, Suite 2700,
Indianapolis, Indiana, unless another place is agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto.

         1.3. Effective Time. At the Closing, the parties shall file appropriate
articles of merger (the "Articles of Merger") in such form as is required by and
executed in accordance with the respective relevant provisions of the VSCA and
the IBCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the last to be filed
of the Articles of Merger are duly filed with the State Corporation Commission
of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the Secretary of State of the State of
Indiana or at such subsequent time as Purchaser and Company shall agree and as
shall be specified in the Articles of Merger (the date and time the Merger
becomes effective being the "Effective Time").

         1.4. Effects of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger
will have the effects set forth in the VSCA and the IBCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company and Merger Sub
shall be vested in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and
duties of Company and Merger Sub shall be the debts, liabilities and duties of
the Surviving Corporation.

         1.5. Articles of Incorporation. Except as contemplated by Section 1.1,
the articles of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable law.

         1.6. By-Laws. At the Effective Time and without any further action on
the part of Company and Merger Sub, the by-laws of Merger Sub shall be the
by-laws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter changed or amended or
repealed as provided therein or the articles of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation and by applicable law.

         1.7. Officers and Directors of Surviving Corporation. The officers of
Company as of the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation, until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal or
otherwise ceasing to be an officer or until their respective

                                      -2-

<PAGE>

successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. The directors of
Merger Sub as of the Effective Time shall serve as directors of the Surviving
Corporation until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal or
otherwise ceasing to be a director or until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified.

         1.8. Effect on Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock:

              (a)  All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by Company
         as treasury stock (the "Company Treasury Shares") or by Purchaser or
         Merger Sub shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and
         no cash, Purchaser Common Stock or other consideration shall be
         delivered in exchange therefor.

              (b)  Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
         immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Company
         Treasury Shares and shares of Company Common Stock owned by Purchaser
         or Merger Sub), shall be converted at the Effective Time into the right
         to receive (as such amounts may be increased as set forth in Section
         7.1(i) hereof) (i) $30.00 in cash (the "Cash Consideration") and (ii)
         1.062 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of Purchaser Common Stock (the
         "Merger Consideration"). Upon such conversion, all such shares of
         Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
         automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
         each Company Certificate (as defined in Section 1.9) shall thereafter
         represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration, cash for
         fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.5 and any dividends or
         other distributions pursuant to Section 2.3 upon the surrender of the
         Company Certificate in accordance with the terms hereof.

              (c)  Each share of common stock, par value $0.01, of Merger Sub
         (the "Merger Sub Common Stock") outstanding immediately prior to the
         Effective Time shall remain outstanding and unchanged following the
         Effective Time as shares of the Surviving Corporation.

         1.9. Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall
appoint an exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced shares of
Company Common Stock (the "Company Certificates") for the Merger Consideration.

         1.10. Company Stock Options and Restricted Stock. Company and Purchaser
shall take all action reasonably necessary so that each employee or director
stock option exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock (the "Company Stock
Options") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall have vested
and become exercisable by the Effective Time and shall be converted
automatically at the Effective Time into an option to purchase a number of
shares of Purchaser Common Stock (a "Converted Option") equal to the product of
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Option multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio (provided that any fractional
share resulting from such multiplication

                                      -3-

<PAGE>

shall be rounded to the nearest whole share). The Option Exchange Ratio shall
mean the sum of (i) 1.062 (as such amount may be increased as set forth in
Section 7.1(i) hereof) and (ii) a fraction the numerator of which is 30 (as such
amount may be increased as set forth in Section 7.1(i) hereof) and the
denominator of which is the closing trading price of Purchaser Common Stock on
the NYSE, as reported in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition (or such other
source as the parties shall agree in writing), on the Business Day prior to the
Effective Time. The terms and conditions of the Converted Option shall otherwise
remain the same as the terms and conditions of the Company Stock Option, except
that the exercise price per share of each Converted Option shall equal the
exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option divided by the Option
Exchange Ratio (provided that such exercise price shall be rounded to the
nearest whole cent). Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Company Stock Option
which is intended to be an "incentive stock option" (as defined under Section
422 of the Code) shall be adjusted in accordance with the requirements of
Section 424 of the Code. Purchaser shall, as of the Effective Time, assume the
obligations of Company under all plans and agreements pursuant to which a
Company Stock Option has been issued and shall take all corporate action
necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Purchaser
Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of the Converted Options. Purchaser
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the registration of the shares of
Purchaser Common Stock subject to the Converted Options to become effective as
part of a registration statement on Form S-8, no later than the Effective Time;
and, thereafter, Purchaser shall file one or more registration statements on
appropriate forms with respect to shares of Purchaser Common Stock subject to
the Converted Options and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements,
including the current status of any related prospectus, for so long as the
Converted Options remain outstanding. Company and Purchaser shall take all such
steps within their control as may be required to cause the transactions
contemplated by this Section 1.10 and any other deemed dispositions of Company
equity securities (including derivative securities) or deemed acquisitions of
Purchaser equity securities (including derivative securities) in connection with
this Agreement by each individual who (i) is a director or officer of Company or
(ii) at the Effective Time will become a director or officer of Purchaser, to
become exempt from liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to
Rule 16b-3 thereunder. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
Purchaser shall deliver or cause to be delivered to each holder of Converted
Options an appropriate notice setting forth such holder's rights pursuant to any
stock option or similar plan of the Company (the "Company Stock Option Plans")
and agreements evidencing the grants of such Converted Options, after giving
effect to the transactions hereunder. All shares of restricted Company Common
Stock held by current or former employees or directors of Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall vest automatically at the Effective Time.

         1.11. Certain Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, the outstanding Purchaser Common Stock or Company Common
Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or different
class by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split,
split-up, combination or exchange of shares or a stock dividend or dividend
payable in any other securities shall be declared with a record date within such
period, or any similar event shall have occurred, the Merger Consideration and
the Option Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to the
holders of Company Common Stock and


                                      -4-

<PAGE>

Company Stock Options the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement
prior to such event.


                                   ARTICLE II
                            EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

         2.1. Exchange Fund. At or prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of shares
of Company Common Stock, (i) certificates representing the Purchaser Common
Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.8 and (ii) cash sufficient to pay the cash
portion of the Merger Consideration. Purchaser agrees to make available to the
Exchange Agent from time to time as needed, additional cash sufficient to pay
cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.5 and any dividends and
other distributions pursuant to Section 2.3. Any cash and certificates of
Purchaser Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be
referred to as the "Exchange Fund."

         2.2. Exchange Procedures. Within five Business Days after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of a Company Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Company Certificates to the
Exchange Agent, and which letter shall be in customary form and have such other
provisions as Purchaser may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for
effecting the surrender of such Company Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Company Certificate to the Exchange Agent
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Company
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) one or more
shares of Purchaser Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry
form unless a physical certificate is requested) representing, in the aggregate,
the whole number of shares that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Sections 1.8 and (B) a check for the cash portion of the Merger Consideration
and for the cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this Article II, including cash in lieu of any fractional shares
of Purchaser Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.5 and dividends and other
distributions pursuant to Section 2.3. No interest will be paid or will accrue
on any cash payable for the cash portion of the Merger Consideration or pursuant
to Section 2.3 or Section 2.5. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of Company,
one or more shares of Purchaser Common Stock evidencing, in the aggregate, the
proper number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock and a check for the cash
portion of the Merger Consideration, the cash in lieu of any fractional shares
of Purchaser Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.5 and any dividends or other
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3, may be
issued with respect to such Company Common Stock to such a transferee if the
Company Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock is
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid.

                                      -5-

<PAGE>

         2.3. Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or
other distributions declared or made with respect to shares of Purchaser Common
Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Company Certificate with respect to the shares of Purchaser
Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of
such Company Certificate until such holder shall surrender such Company
Certificate in accordance with Section 2.2. Subject to the effect of applicable
laws, following surrender of any such Company Certificate, there shall be paid
to such holder of shares of Purchaser Common Stock issuable in exchange
therefor, without interest, (a) promptly after the time of such surrender, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date prior to such
surrender payable with respect to such shares of Purchaser Common Stock and (b)
at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such shares of
Purchaser Common Stock.

         2.4. No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All shares of
Purchaser Common Stock issued and cash paid upon conversion of shares of Company
Common Stock in accordance with the terms of Article I and this Article II
(including any cash paid pursuant to Sections 2.3 or 2.5) shall be deemed to
have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of Company Common Stock. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Article II, each Company Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration (and any cash to be paid pursuant to Sections 2.3 or 2.5).

         2.5. No Fractional Shares of Purchaser Common Stock.

              (a)  No certificates or scrip or shares of Purchaser Common Stock
         representing fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock or book-entry
         credit of the same shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
         Company Certificates and such fractional share interests will not
         entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a
         stockholder of Purchaser or a holder of shares of Purchaser Common
         Stock.

              (b)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each
         holder of shares of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the
         Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of
         a share of Purchaser Common Stock (after taking into account all
         Company Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu
         thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product of
         (i) such fractional part of a share of Purchaser Common Stock
         multiplied by (ii) the closing price for a share of Purchaser Common
         Stock on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. ("NYSE") Composite
         Transactions Tape on the date of the Effective Time or, if such date is
         not a Business Day, the Business Day immediately before the date on
         which the Effective Time occurs. As promptly as practicable after the
         determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of
         fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Purchaser, and
         Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit such amount
         with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward

                                      -6-

<PAGE>

              payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in
              accordance with the terms hereof.

         2.6. Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Certificates twelve months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Purchaser or otherwise on the
instruction of Purchaser and any holders of the Company Certificates who have
not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation and Purchaser for the Merger Consideration with respect to
the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby to which such
holders are entitled pursuant to Section 1.8 and Section 2.2, any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock to which such holders are
entitled pursuant to Section 2.5 and any dividends or distributions with respect
to shares of Purchaser Common Stock to which such holders are entitled pursuant
to Section 2.3.

         2.7. No Liability. None of Purchaser, Merger Sub, Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

         2.8. Investment of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Purchaser on a daily
basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall
promptly be paid to Purchaser.

         2.9. Lost Certificates. If any Company Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in
such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Company
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Company Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with
respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby, any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock, and unpaid
dividends and distributions on shares of Purchaser Common Stock deliverable in
respect thereof, in each case, pursuant to this Agreement.

         2.10. Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation and

Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local
or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving
Corporation or Purchaser, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Purchaser, as the case may
be, and such amounts shall be delivered by the Surviving Corporation or
Purchaser, as the case may be, to the applicable taxing authority.

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         3.1. Representations and Warranties of Purchaser. Purchaser represents
and warrants to Company as follows:

              (a)  Organization, Standing and Power; Subsidiaries. Each of
         Purchaser and each of its material Subsidiaries (as defined in Section
         8.13) is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
         standing under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of incorporation
         or organization, has the requisite power and authority to own, lease
         and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being
         conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, existing and in
         good standing or to have such power and authority would not reasonably
         be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
         Adverse Effect on Purchaser, and is duly qualified and in good standing
         to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business
         or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification
         necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure so to
         qualify or to be in good standing would not reasonably be expected to
         have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
         Purchaser. The copies of the articles of incorporation and by-laws of
         Purchaser which were previously furnished or made available to Company
         are true, complete and correct copies of such documents as in effect on
         the date of this Agreement.

              (b) Capital Structure. The authorized capital stock of Purchaser
         consists of (i) 900,000,000 shares of Purchaser Common Stock of which
         103,323,299 shares were issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2002 and
         (ii) 100,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, without par value, none of
         which are outstanding. Since March 31, 2002 to the date of this
         Agreement, there have been no issuances of shares of the capital stock

                                      -8-

<PAGE>

         of Purchaser or any other securities of Purchaser other than issuances
         of shares pursuant to the demutualization of Purchaser's Subsidiary and
         pursuant to options or rights outstanding as of March 31, 2002 under
         the Benefit Plans (as defined in Section 8.13) of Purchaser. All issued
         and outstanding shares of the capital stock of Purchaser are duly
         authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and no class
         of capital stock is entitled to (or has been issued in violation of)
         preemptive rights. There were outstanding as of March 31, 2002 no
         options, warrants or other rights to acquire capital stock from
         Purchaser other than options, restricted stock and share equivalents
         representing in the aggregate the right to purchase no more than
         1,500,000 shares of Purchaser Common Stock and contracts included in
         Purchaser's 6% Equity Security Units issued on November 2, 2001 to
         purchase up to 6,394,000 shares of Purchaser Common Stock. All shares
         of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger
         and the other transactions contemplated hereby (including without
         limitation all shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued upon
         exercise of the Converted Options) will, when issued in accordance with
         the terms hereof, have been duly authorized, validly issued, full paid
         and non-assessable, free and clear of all Liens. Section 3.1(b) of the
         Purchaser Disclosure Schedule delivered by Purchaser to Company prior
         to the execution of this Agreement (each section of which qualifies the
         correspondingly numbered representation and warranty or covenant to the
         extent specified therein and any other representation and warranty to
         which its relevance is reasonably apparent) (the "Purchaser Disclosure
         Schedule") sets forth a complete and correct list, as of the date
         hereof, of the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock subject to
         options or other rights to purchase or receive Purchaser Common Stock
         granted under Benefit Plans of Purchaser. As of the date hereof, there
         are no stockholder agreements, voting trusts or other agreements or
         understandings to which Purchaser is a party or by which it is bound
         relating to the voting of any shares of the capital stock of
         Purchaser, other than proxies outstanding in connection with
         Purchaser's annual meeting of stockholders to be held in May of 2002.

              (c) Authority, No Conflicts.

                   (i) Purchaser has all requisite corporate power and authority
              to enter into this Agreement and the Option Agreement and to
              consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
              including, without limitation, the issuance of the shares of
              Purchaser Common Stock to be issued in the Merger (the "Share
              Issuance") and upon the exercise of Converted Options, subject in
              the case of the consummation of the Share Issuance to the Required
              Purchaser Vote (as defined in Section 3.1(g)). The execution and
              delivery of this Agreement and the Option Agreement and the
              consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
              have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the
              part of Purchaser, subject in the case of the consummation of the
              Share Issuance to the Required Purchaser Vote. This Agreement and
              the Option Agreement have been duly executed and delivered by
              Purchaser and, assuming that this Agreement and the Option
              Agreement constitute the valid and binding agreements of Company,
              constitute valid and binding agreements of Purchaser, enforceable

                                      -9-

<PAGE>

              against it in accordance with their respective terms, except as
              such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
              reorganization, moratorium and similar laws relating to or
              affecting creditors generally or by general equity principles
              (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
              proceeding in equity or at law) or by an implied covenant of good
              faith and fair dealing.

                   (ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
              Option Agreement by Purchaser does not or will not, as the case
              may be, and the consummation by Purchaser of the Merger and the
              other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not,
              conflict with, or result in any violation of, or constitute a
              default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under,
              or give rise to a right of termination, amendment, cancellation or
              acceleration of any obligation or the loss of a material benefit
              under, or the creation of a Lien on any assets (any such conflict,
              violation, default, right of termination, amendment, cancellation
              or acceleration, loss or creation, is hereinafter referred to as a
              "Violation") pursuant to: (A) any provision of the articles of
              incorporation or by-laws of Purchaser or any material Subsidiary
              of Purchaser or (B) except as set forth in Section 3.1(c) of the
              Purchaser Disclosure Schedule or as would not reasonably be
              expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
              Adverse Effect on Purchaser, and subject to obtaining or making
              the consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations,
              declarations and filings referred to in paragraph (iii) below, any
              loan or credit agreement, note, mortgage, bond, indenture, lease,
              benefit plan or other agreement, obligation, instrument, permit,
              concession, franchise, license, judgment, order, decree, statute,
              law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to Purchaser or any
              material Subsidiary of Purchaser, or their respective properties
              or assets.

                   (iii) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
              registration, declaration or filing with, any supranational,
              national, state, municipal, local or foreign government, any
              instrumentality, subdivision, court, administrative agency or
              commission or other authority thereof, or any quasi-governmental
              or private body exercising any regulatory, taxing, importing or
              other governmental or quasi-governmental authority (a
              "Governmental Entity"), is required by or with respect to
              Purchaser or any Subsidiary of Purchaser in connection with the
              execution and delivery of this Agreement by Purchaser or Merger
              Sub, the Option Agreement by Purchaser or the consummation of the
              Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
              except for those required under or in relation to (A) the
              Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended
              (the "HSR Act"), (B) state securities or "blue sky" laws (the
              "Blue Sky Laws"), (C) the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
              the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Securities
              Act"), (D) the Exchange Act; (E) the VSCA and the IBCL with
              respect to the filing of the Articles of Merger, (F) rules and
              regulations of the NYSE, (G) the Virginia State Corporation
              Commission and the Indiana Department of Insurance and (H) such
              consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations,
              declarations and filings the failure of which to make

                                      -10-

<PAGE>

              or obtain would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
              or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser.
              Consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations,
              declarations and filings required under or in relation to any of
              the foregoing clauses (A) through (G) are hereinafter referred to
              as "Necessary Consents."

              (d) Reports and Financial Statements.

                   (i) Purchaser has filed or will file prior to Closing all
              required registration statements, prospectuses, reports,
              schedules, forms, statements and other documents required to be
              filed by it with the SEC since January 1, 2001 until the Closing
              (collectively, including all exhibits thereto, the "Purchaser SEC
              Reports"). No Subsidiary of Purchaser is required to file any
              form, report, registration statement, prospectus or other
              document with the SEC. None of the Purchaser SEC Reports, as of
              their respective dates (and, if amended or superseded by a filing
              prior to the date of this Agreement or the Closing Date, then on
              the date of such filing), contained or will contain any untrue
              statement of a material fact or omitted or will omit to state a
              material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
              the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
              they were made, not misleading. Each of the financial statements
              (including the related notes) included in the Purchaser SEC
              Reports presents fairly, in all material respects, the
              consolidated financial position and consolidated results of
              operations and cash flows of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries as of
              the respective dates or for the respective periods set forth
              therein, all in conformity with generally accepted accounting
              principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis throughout the
              periods involved except as otherwise noted therein, and subject,
              in the case of the unaudited interim financial statements, to
              normal and recurring adjustments that were not or are not
              expected to be material in amount, and lack of footnote
              disclosure. All of such Purchaser SEC Reports, as of their
              respective dates (and as of the date of any amendment to the
              respective Purchaser SEC Report), complied as to form in all
              material respects with the applicable requirements of the
              Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
              promulgated thereunder.

                   (ii) Except (A) to the extent reflected in the balance sheet
              of Purchaser included in the Purchaser SEC Reports last filed
              prior to the date hereof, (B) as set forth in Section 3.1(d) of
              the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule or (C) incurred in the ordinary
              course of business since the date of the balance sheet referred to
              in the preceding clause (A), Purchaser does not have any
              liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether known or
              unknown, absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether
              due or to become due, that have or would reasonably be expected to
              have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
              on Purchaser.

              (e)  Information Supplied.

                   (i) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by
              Purchaser or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by
              reference in (A) the registration statement on Form S-4 to be
              filed with the SEC by Purchaser in connection with the Share
              Issuance, or any of the amendments or supplements thereto
              (collectively, the "Form S-4") will, at the time the Form S-4 is
              filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented or
              at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain
              any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
              material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
              the statements therein not misleading, and (B) the joint proxy
              statement for use relating to the approval by the stockholders of
              Company of this Agreement and by the stockholders of Purchaser
              approving the Share Issuance, or any of the amendments or
              supplements thereto (collectively, the "Joint Proxy Statement")
              will, on the date it is first mailed to Company stockholders and
              Purchaser stockholders or at the time of the Company Stockholders
              Meeting (as defined in Section 5.1(b)) and the Purchaser
              Stockholders Meeting (as defined in Section 5.1(e)), contain any
              untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
              fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
              the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
              they were made, not misleading. The Form S-4 will comply as to
              form in all material respects with the requirements of the
              Exchange Act and the Securities Act and the rules and regulations
              of the SEC thereunder.

                   (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
              3.1(e), no representation or warranty is made by Purchaser with
              respect to statements made or incorporated by reference in the
              Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement based on information
              supplied by Company.

              (f)  Board Approval. The Board of Directors of Purchaser, by
         resolutions duly adopted at a meeting duly called and held and not
         subsequently rescinded or modified in any way (the "Purchaser Board
         Approval"), has unanimously approved this Agreement and the Option
         Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
         including the Merger.

              (g)  Vote Required. The affirmative vote of a majority of the
         votes cast by the holders of Purchaser Common Stock at the Purchaser
         Stockholders Meeting, provided that the total vote cast represents over
         50% in interest of all securities entitled to vote, in favor of the
         Share Issuance ("Required Purchaser Vote") is the only vote of the
         holders of any class or series of Purchaser capital stock necessary to
         consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

              (h)  Brokers or Finders. No agent, broker, investment banker,
         financial advisor or other firm or Person is or will be entitled to any
         broker's or finder's fee or any other similar commission or fee in
         connection with any of the transactions contemplated

                                      -12-

         by this Agreement, based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of
         Purchaser, except Goldman, Sachs & Co. (the "Purchaser Financial
         Advisor"), whose fees and expenses will be paid by Purchaser in
         accordance with Purchaser's agreement with such firm.

              (i) Company Stock. Neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries
         (including Merger Sub) is, nor at any time during the last three years
         has any of such been, an "interested shareholder" of Company as defined
         in Article 14 of the VSCA. Neither Purchaser nor any of its
         Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) owns, (directly or indirectly,
         beneficially or of record) and none of them is a party to any
         agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring,
         holding, voting or disposing of, in each case, any shares of capital
         stock of Company (other than as contemplated by this Agreement and the
         Option Agreement).

              (j) Litigation, Compliance with Laws.

                   (i) Except as disclosed in the Purchaser SEC Reports filed
              prior to the date of this Agreement or as set forth in Section
              3.1(j) of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, there is no suit,
              action, investigation or proceeding pending or, to the knowledge
              of Purchaser, threatened, against or affecting Purchaser or any
              Subsidiary of Purchaser having, or which would reasonably be
              expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
              Adverse Effect on Purchaser, nor is there any judgment, decree,
              injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator
              outstanding against Purchaser or any Subsidiary of Purchaser
              having, or which reasonably would be expected to have,
              individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
              Purchaser.

                   (ii) Except as disclosed in the Purchaser SEC Reports filed
              prior to the date of this Agreement and except as would not
              reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
              a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser, Purchaser and its
              Subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses, variances, exemptions,
              orders and approvals of all Governmental Entities necessary for
              the operation of the businesses of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries,
              taken as a whole (the "Purchaser Permits"). Purchaser and its
              Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the Purchaser
              Permits, except where the failure to so comply would not
              reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
              a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser. Except as disclosed in the
              Purchaser SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement,
              the businesses of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries are not being
              conducted in violation of, and Purchaser has not received any
              notices of violations with respect to, any law, ordinance or
              regulation of any Governmental Entity, except for possible
              violations which would not reasonably be expected to have,
              individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
              Purchaser.

                   (iii) Purchaser is in compliance in all material respects
              with all material rules and regulations of the BCBSA.

         incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Option Agreement or
         the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, since December 31,
         2001 there has not been any change, circumstance or event which has
         had, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
         aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser.

              (l) Opinion of Purchaser Financial Advisor. The Board of Directors
         of Purchaser has received the opinion of Purchaser Financial Advisor,
         dated the date of this Agreement, to the effect that, as of such date,
         the Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to
         Purchaser, a copy of which opinion will promptly be made available to
         Company after receipt by Purchaser.

              (m) Taxes. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
         individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
         Purchaser, or as set forth in Section 3.1(m) of the Purchaser
         Disclosure Schedule, Purchaser and each of its Subsidiaries (i) have
         prepared in good faith and duly and timely filed (taking into account
         any extension of time within which to file) all Tax Returns (as defined
         below) required to be filed by any of them and all such filed Tax
         Returns are complete and accurate in all material respects; (ii) have
         paid all Taxes that are shown as due and payable on such filed Tax
         Returns or that Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries are obligated to
         pay without the filing of a Tax Return; (iii) have paid all other
         assessments received to date in respect of Taxes other than those being
         contested in good faith for which provision has been made in accordance
         with GAAP on the most recent balance sheet included in Purchaser's
         Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001; (iv)
         have withheld from amounts owing to any employee, creditor or other
         Person all Taxes required by law to be withheld and have paid over to
         the proper governmental authority in a timely manner all such withheld
         amounts to the extent due and payable; (v) have not waived any
         applicable statute of limitations with respect to United States federal
         or state income or franchise Taxes and have not otherwise agreed to any
         extension of time with respect to a United States federal or state
         income or franchise Tax assessment or deficiency; (vi) have never been
         members of any consolidated group for United States federal income tax
         purposes other than the consolidated group of which Purchaser is the
         common parent; and (vii) are not parties to any tax sharing agreement
         or arrangement other than with each other. Except as would not
         reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
         Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser, no liens for Taxes exist with
         respect to any of the assets or properties of Purchaser or its
         Subsidiaries, except for statutory liens for Taxes not yet due or
         payable or that are being contested in good faith. Purchaser has made
         available to Company true and correct copies of all material federal,
         state and local Tax Returns filed by Purchaser and its Subsidiaries on
         which the statute of limitations has not expired. None of Purchaser or
         its Subsidiaries has been a party to a Section 355 transaction that
         could give rise to a Tax liability pursuant to Section 355(e) of the
         Code. Except as set forth in Section 3.1(m) of the Purchaser Disclosure
         Schedule, there are not being conducted or threatened in writing any
         material audits, examinations, investigations, litigation, or other
         proceedings in respect of Taxes of Purchaser or any Subsidiary; and
         none of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries has any material deferred gains

                                      -14-

         created by any other transaction, or has any material excess loss
         accounts. Purchaser is not aware of any fact or circumstance that could
         reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
         reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

              (n)  Financing. Purchaser has provided to Company a copy of an
         executed financing commitment letter related to this Agreement and the
         transactions contemplated hereby. Purchaser will have available to it
         on the Closing Date sufficient funds to enable it to consummate the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

              (o)  Accounting and Financial Matters. Since January 1, 2001,
         Purchaser has not received written notice from the SEC or any other
         Governmental Entity that any of its accounting policies or practices
         are or may be the subject of any review, inquiry, investigation or
         challenge by the SEC or other Governmental Entity other than comments
         received from the staff of the SEC in connection with the initial
         public offering of Purchaser Common Stock. Since January 1, 2001,
         Purchaser's independent public accounting firm has not informed
         Purchaser that it has any material questions, challenges or
         disagreements regarding or pertaining to Purchaser's accounting
         policies or practices. Since January 1, 2001, no officer or director of
         Purchaser has received, or is entitled to receive, any material
         compensation from any entity that has engaged in or is engaging in any
         material transaction with the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries. Set
         forth on Section 3.1(o) of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule is a list
         of all off-balance sheet special purpose entities and financing
         arrangements of Purchasers and its Subsidiaries.

         3.2. Representations and Warranties of Company. Company represents and
warrants to Purchaser as follows:

              (a) Organization, Standing and Power; Subsidiaries.

                   (i) Each of Company and each of its Subsidiaries is a
              corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
              under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of incorporation or
              organization, has the requisite power and authority to own, lease
              and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now
              being conducted, except where the failure to be so organized,
              existing and in good standing or to have such power and authority
              would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
              aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Company, and is duly
              qualified and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction
              in which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of
              its properties makes such qualification necessary, other than in
              such jurisdictions where the failure so to qualify or to be in
              good standing would not reasonably be expected to have,
              individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
              Company. The copies of the articles of incorporation and by-laws
              of Company and its material Subsidiaries which were previously
              furnished or made available to Purchaser are true, complete and
              correct copies of such documents as in effect on the date of this
              Agreement.

                   (ii) Except as set forth in Section 3.2(a) of the Company
              Disclosure Schedule delivered by Company to Purchaser prior to the
              execution of this Agreement (each section of which qualifies the
              correspondingly numbered representation and warranty or covenant
              to the extent specified therein and any other representation and
              warranty to which its relevance is reasonably apparent) (the

              capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each Subsidiary
              have been validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and
              are owned directly or indirectly by Company, free and clear of all
              Liens and free of any other restriction (including any restriction
              on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital
              stock or other ownership interests). Except as explicitly set
              forth in the Company SEC Reports (as defined in Section 3.2(d)) or
              in Section 3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither
              Company nor any of its Subsidiaries directly or indirectly owns
              any equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible
              into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any corporation,
              partnership, joint venture or other business association or
              entity, that is or would reasonably be expected to be material to
              Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

                   (i) The authorized capital stock of Company consists of (A)
              300,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock, of which 35,786,194

              Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and reserved for
              issuance upon exercise of the rights (the "Company Rights")
              distributed to the holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to the

              aggregate the right to purchase no more than 3,522,415 shares of
              Company Common Stock under the Company Stock Option Plans. Section

              granted under the Company Stock Option Plans or otherwise, and the
              dates of grant, vesting dates, expiration dates, exercise prices

              2002, the number of shares of restricted Company Common Stock
              outstanding, and the dates of grant, vesting dates, expiration

              Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Option
              Agreement or as set forth in Section 3.2(b) of the Company
              Disclosure Schedule, such shares of Company Common Stock will be

              obligating Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or
              sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares
              of capital stock or other voting securities of Company or any of
              its Subsidiaries or obligating Company or any of its Subsidiaries

              of capital stock of Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

              (c) Authority; No Conflicts.

                   (i) Company has all requisite corporate power and authority
              to enter into this Agreement and the Option Agreement and to
              consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
              subject to the approval of this Agreement by the Required Company
              Vote (as defined in Section 3.2(h)). The execution and delivery of
              this Agreement and the Option Agreement and the consummation of
              the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly
              authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of
              Company, subject to the approval of this Agreement by the Required
              Company Vote. This Agreement and the Option Agreement have been
              duly executed and delivered by

                                      -17-

<PAGE>

              Company and, assuming that this Agreement and the Option Agreement
              constitute the valid and binding agreements of Purchaser and, in
              the case of this Agreement, Merger Sub, constitute valid and
              binding agreements of Company, enforceable against it in
              accordance with their respective terms, except as such
              enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
              reorganization, moratorium and similar laws relating to or
              affecting creditors generally or by general equity principles
              (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
              proceeding in equity or at law) or by an implied covenant of good
              faith and fair dealing.

                   (ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
              Option Agreement by Company does not or will not, as the case may
              be, and the consummation by Company of the Merger and the other
              transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not, conflict
              with, or result in a Violation pursuant to: (A) any provision of
              the articles of incorporation or by-laws of Company or any
              Subsidiary of Company or (B) except as set forth in Section 3.2(c)
              of the Company Disclosure Schedule or would not reasonably be
              expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
              Adverse Effect on Company, and subject to obtaining or making the
              consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations,
              declarations and filings referred to in paragraph (iii) below, any
              loan or credit agreement, note, mortgage, bond, indenture, lease,
              benefit plan or other agreement, obligation, instrument, permit,
              concession, franchise, license, judgment, order, decree, statute,
              law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to Company or any
              Subsidiary of Company or their respective properties or assets.

                   (iii) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
              registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity
              is required by or with respect to Company or any Subsidiary of
              Company in connection with the execution and delivery of this
              Agreement or the Option Agreement by Company or the consummation
              of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
              thereby, except the Necessary Consents and such consents,
              approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and
              filings the failure of which to make or obtain would not
              reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
              a Material Adverse Effect on Company.

              (d) Reports and Financial Statements.

                   (i) Company has filed or will file prior to Closing all
              required registration statements, prospectuses, reports,
              schedules, forms, statements and other documents required to be
              filed by it with the SEC since January 1, 1999 until the Closing
              (collectively, including all exhibits thereto, the "Company SEC
              Reports"). No Subsidiary of Company is required to file any form,
              report, registration statement or prospectus or other document
              with the SEC. None of the Company SEC Reports, as of their
              respective dates (and, if amended or

                                      -18-

<PAGE>

              superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement or the
              Closing Date, then on the date of such filing), contained or will
              contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or will
              omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
              necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
              circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of
              the financial statements (including the related notes) included in
              the Company SEC Reports presents fairly, in all material respects,
              the consolidated financial position and consolidated results of
              operations and cash flows of Company and its Subsidiaries as of
              the respective dates or for the respective periods set forth
              therein, all in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis
              throughout the periods involved except as otherwise noted therein,
              and subject, in the case of the unaudited interim financial
              statements, to normal and recurring adjustments that were not or
              are not expected to be material in amount, and lack of footnote
              disclosure. All of such Company SEC Reports, as of their
              respective dates (and as of the date of any amendment to the
              respective Company SEC Report), complied as to form in all
              material respects with the applicable requirements of the
              Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
              promulgated thereunder.

                   (ii) Except (A) to the extent reflected in the balance sheet
              of Company included in the Company SEC Report last filed prior to
              the date hereof, (B) as set forth in Section 3.2(d) of the Company
              Disclosure Schedule or (C) incurred in the ordinary course of
              business since the date of the balance sheet referred to in the
              preceding clause (A), Company does not have any liabilities or
              obligations of any nature, whether known or unknown, absolute,
              accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due,
              that have or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or
              in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Company.

              (e)  Reserves. The loss reserves and other actuarial amounts of
         Company and its Subsidiaries recorded in their respective financial

              Adverse Effect on Company, nor is there any judgment, decree,
              injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

         5.1. Preparation of Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement;
Stockholders Meetings.

              (a)  Promptly following the date of this Agreement, Company and
         Purchaser shall prepare and file with the SEC the Joint Proxy
         Statement, and Purchaser shall prepare and file with the SEC the Form
         S-4, in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a
         prospectus. Each of Company and Purchaser shall use its reasonable best
         efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities
         Act as promptly as practicable after such filing. Each of Company and
         Purchaser will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy
         Statement to be mailed to its stockholders as promptly as practicable
         after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act.
         Purchaser shall also take any action (other than qualifying to do
         business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified)
         required to be taken under any applicable state securities law in
         connection with the Share Issuance, and Company shall furnish all
         information concerning Company and the holders of Company Common Stock
         and rights to acquire Company Common Stock pursuant to the Company
         Stock Option Plans as may be reasonably required in connection with any
         such action. Each of Purchaser and Company shall furnish all
         information concerning itself to the other as may be reasonably
         requested in connection with any such action and the preparation,
         filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and the preparation, filing and
         distribution of the Joint Proxy Statement. Company, Purchaser and
         Merger Sub each agree to promptly correct any information provided by
         it for use in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement that shall have
         become false or misleading.

              (b) Company, acting through its Board of Directors, shall, subject
         to and in accordance with its articles of incorporation and by-laws,
         promptly and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold as soon as
         practicable following the date upon which the Form S-4 becomes
         effective a meeting of the holders of Company Common Stock (the
         "Company Stockholders Meeting") for the purpose of voting to approve
         this Agreement, and (i) except as otherwise provided in the following
         sentence, recommend approval of this Agreement and include in the Joint
         Proxy Statement such recommendation and (ii) use its reasonable best
         efforts to solicit and obtain such approval. In the event that prior to
         the approval of this Agreement by the Company's stockholders, the Board
         of Directors of Company receives a Superior Proposal (as defined in
         Section 8.13) and the Board of Directors of Company determines in good
         faith by resolution duly adopted after consultation with its outside
         counsel that the failure to take such action would reasonably be
         expected to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under Virginia
         law, the Board of Directors of Company may withdraw, amend or modify,
         in a manner adverse to Purchaser, its recommendation, provided that
         before withdrawing, amending or modifying its recommendation, it gives
         Purchaser five business days' prior written notice of its intention to
         do so and during such time, Company, if requested by Purchaser, shall
         have engaged in good faith negotiations to amend this Agreement such
         that the Board of Directors of Company may continue to recommend the
         approval of this Agreement. The


                                      -36-

<PAGE>

         parties agree that nothing in this Section 5.1 shall in any way limit
         or otherwise affect Purchaser's right to terminate this Agreement
         pursuant to Section 7.1(c) at such time as the requirements of such
         subsection have been met. Any such withdrawal, amendment or
         modification of the recommendation shall not (x) change the adoption of
         this Agreement or any other approval of the Board of Directors of
         Company in any respect that would have the effect of causing the
         threshold restrictions on Company Common Stock ownership in Company's
         articles of incorporation, the Company Rights Agreement and any
         Virginia corporate takeover statute or other similar statute to be
         applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
         Merger, or the transactions contemplated by the Option Agreement, or
         (y) change the obligation of Company to present this Agreement for
         approval at the Company Stockholders Meeting on the earliest
         practicable date. At any such meeting following any withdrawal,
         amendment or modification of Company's recommendation of this
         Agreement, Company may submit this Agreement to its stockholders
         without recommendation (although the adoption of this Agreement by the
         Board of Directors of Company may not be rescinded or amended), in
         which event the Board of Directors of Company may communicate the basis
         for its lack of a recommendation to its stockholders in the Joint Proxy
         Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the
         extent required by law. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
         prohibit Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
         position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange
         Act or from making disclosure of the fact that a proposal for an
         Alternative Transaction has been made, the identity of the party making
         the proposal or the material terms of such proposal in the Form S-4 or
         the Joint Proxy Statement, to the extent disclosure of such facts,
         identity or terms is advisable under applicable law (and the disclosure
         of such facts, by itself, shall not be deemed a withdrawal or adverse
         modification or amendment of its approval or recommendation to
         stockholders of the Merger).

              (c)  During the term of this Agreement, Company shall not take any
         actions to exempt any Person other than Purchaser and Merger Sub from
         the Company Rights Agreement, the threshold restrictions on Company
         Common Stock ownership in Company's articles of incorporation, or make
         any Virginia state takeover statute or similar statute inapplicable to
         any Alternative Transaction unless, in any such case, the Board of
         Directors of Company determines in good faith after consultation with
         its outside counsel that failure to take such action would reasonably
         be expected to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under
         Virginia law.

              (d) Company will cause its transfer agent to make stock transfer
         records relating to Company available to the extent reasonably
         necessary to effectuate the intent of this Agreement.

              (e) Purchaser, acting through its Board of Directors, shall,
         subject to and in accordance with its articles of incorporation and
         by-laws, promptly and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold as
         soon as practicable following the date on which the Form S-4 becomes
         effective, a meeting of the holders of Purchaser Common Stock (the
         "Purchaser Stockholders Meeting") for the purpose of voting to approve
         the Share


                                      -37-

<PAGE>

         Issuance. Purchaser shall recommend such approval to its stockholders
         and use its reasonable best efforts to solicit and obtain such
         approval. The Board of Directors of Purchaser shall not withhold,
         withdraw, amend or modify in any manner adverse to Company its
         recommendation referred to in the preceding sentence (or announce
         publicly its intention to do so). Nothing contained in this Agreement
         shall prohibit Purchaser from making any factual disclosure regarding
         this Agreement, the Option Agreement, the parties hereto, or any of the
         transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, if such disclosure is
         advisable under applicable law (and the disclosure of such information,
         by itself, shall not be deemed a withdrawal or adverse modification or
         amendment of its approval or recommendation to its stockholders of the
         Share Issuance).

              (f) Company and Purchaser shall endeavor to hold the Company
         Stockholder Meeting and the Purchaser Stockholder Meeting as closely
         together in time as practicable and, to the extent possible, on the
         same date.

         5.2. Accountant's Letters.

              (a) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be
         delivered to Company a letter from Purchaser's independent public
         accountants, dated (i) the date on which the Form S-4 shall become
         effective, and (ii) the Closing Date, addressed to Purchaser, in form
         and substance reasonably satisfactory to Company and customary in scope
         and substance for comfort letters delivered by independent public
         accountants in connection with registration statements similar to the
         Form S-4.

              (b) Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be
         delivered to Purchaser a letter from Company's independent public
         accountants, dated (i) the date on which the Form S-4 shall become
         effective, and (ii) the Closing Date, addressed to Company and
         Purchaser, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser
         and customary in scope and substance for comfort letters delivered by
         independent public accountants in connection with registration
         statements similar to the Form S-4.

         5.3. Access to Information. Upon reasonable notice, each party shall
(and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford to the officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives of the other
party reasonable access during normal business hours, during the period prior to
the Effective Time, to such of its properties, books, contracts, commitments,
records, officers and employees as the other party may reasonably request and,
during such period, such party shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to)
furnish promptly to the other party (a) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed, published, announced or
received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of Federal or
state securities laws, as applicable (other than documents which such party is
not permitted to disclose under applicable law), and (b) consistent with its
legal obligations, all other information concerning it and its business,
properties and personnel as such other party may reasonably request; provided,
however, that either party may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that
any law, treaty, rule or regulation of any Governmental Entity applicable to
such party requires such party or its Subsidiaries to restrict access to any
properties or information (but only if such


                                      -38-

<PAGE>

party shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to get any such
restriction waived). The parties will hold any such information which is
non-public in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the
provisions of the confidentiality agreement between Company and Purchaser (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"). Any investigation by Purchaser or Company shall
not affect the representations and warranties of Company or Purchaser, as the
case may be.

         5.4. Reasonable Best Efforts.

              (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each
         party will use its reasonable best efforts to prepare and file as
         promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary
         applications, notices, petitions, filings, tax ruling requests and
         other documents and to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents,
         waivers, licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits, tax
         rulings and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from
         any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate
         the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
         Agreement or any transaction contemplated by the Option Agreement. Upon
         the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, each party will use its
         reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, to
         do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary to satisfy the
         conditions to Closing set forth herein and to consummate the
         transactions contemplated hereby.

              (b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each
         party hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and
         Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
         contemplated hereby and by the Option Agreement as promptly as
         practicable after the date hereof and to supply as promptly as
         practicable any additional information and documentary material that
         may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act. Each of Purchaser and Company
         shall cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any
         filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other
         inquiry under the HSR Act.

              (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the
         parties agree that Purchaser shall make as promptly as practicable such
         filings as are required in connection with this Agreement and the
         transactions contemplated hereby on its behalf, including the "Form A"
         regulatory filings to be made with the Virginia State Corporation
         Commission and shall, in consultation with Company, coordinate the
         conduct of any hearing or hearings before the Virginia State
         Corporation Commission in connection with such filings. Company and
         Purchaser will reasonably cooperate with regard to the content of the
         filings referred to in the first sentence of this Section 5.4(c).
         Company and Purchaser, as the case may be, shall submit all such
         filings and hearing testimony, witness lists and other similar
         materials relating to any hearing to the other for its review prior to
         filing and shall incorporate the reasonable comments of the other
         party.

              (d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.4 shall be construed as
         requiring Purchaser to agree to any conditions which would impose (i)
         any limitations on Purchaser's ownership or operation of all or any
         portion of its, any of its Subsidiaries', or


                                      -39-

<PAGE>

         Company's (or any of its Subsidiaries') business or assets, or to
         compel Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of or hold
         separate all or any portion of its, any of its Subsidiaries' or
         Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' business or assets, (ii) any
         limitations on the ability of Purchaser to acquire or hold or to
         exercise full rights of ownership of the Company Common Stock, (iii)
         any obligations on Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or Company or
         any of its Subsidiaries to maintain facilities, operations, places of
         business, employment levels, products or businesses or (iv) any other
         obligation, restriction, limitation, qualification or other conditions,
         which, in the case of any of clauses (i) through (iv) above, would be
         reasonably likely to have a material and adverse effect on Purchaser
         and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, have a material and adverse
         effect on Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or materially
         impair the long-term benefits sought to be derived from the Merger.

         5.5. No Solicitation of Transactions. Company agrees that, during the
term of this Agreement, it shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of
its Subsidiaries or any of its or its Subsidiaries' directors, officers,
employees, agents or representatives (including any investment banker, attorney
or accountant retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries), directly or
indirectly, to solicit, initiate, encourage or facilitate, or furnish or
disclose non-public information in furtherance of, any inquiries or the making
of any proposal with respect to any Alternative Transaction (as defined in
Section 8.13), or negotiate, explore or otherwise engage in discussions with any
Person (other than Purchaser, Merger Sub or their respective directors,
officers, employees, agents and representatives) with respect to any Alternative
Transaction or enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding requiring
it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Option Agreement; provided
that, at any time prior to the approval of this Agreement by Company's
stockholders, Company may furnish information to, and negotiate or otherwise
engage in discussions with, any party who delivers a bona fide written proposal
for an Alternative Transaction which was not solicited or encouraged after the
date of this Agreement, if and so long as the Board of Directors of Company
determines in good faith by resolution duly adopted after consultation with its
outside legal counsel that the failure to provide such information or engage in
such negotiations or discussions is or would reasonably be expected to
constitute a breach of the directors' fiduciary duties under Virginia law and
determines in good faith that such a proposal is a Superior Proposal. Company
shall notify Purchaser promptly of such inquiries, proposals or offers received
by, or any such discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated or continued
with, any of its representatives, indicating the name of such Person and
providing to Purchaser a copy of such written proposal or offer for an
Alternative Transaction. Prior to providing any information or data to, or
entering into any negotiations or discussions with, any Person in connection
with a proposal or offer for an Alternative Transaction, Company shall (i) give
to Purchaser five business days' prior written notice of its intention to do so,
and during such time shall, if requested by Purchaser, engage in good faith
negotiations to amend this Agreement such that the Board of Directors of Company
will not be required to provide such information pursuant to its fiduciary
duties, and (ii) receive from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement
containing terms and provisions at least as restrictive as those contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement (which shall not preclude discussions or
negotiations relating to the proposal or offer from such Person). Company agrees
that it will keep Purchaser


                                      -40-

<PAGE>

informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and terms of any such proposals or
offers and the status of any such discussions or negotiations and that it will
deliver to Purchaser copies of (or, if oral, summaries of) any changes to any
proposals or offers. Company agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
parties conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to any
Alternative Transaction and will not waive any rights under any standstill or
confidentiality agreements entered into with such parties.

         5.6. Employee Benefits Matters.

              (a) Continuation and Comparability of Benefits. From the Effective
         Time until December 31, 2003 (the "Benefits Continuation Period"), the
         Surviving Corporation shall provide compensation and Benefits Plans to
         the current and former employees of Company and its Subsidiaries (other
         than those current and former employees whose terms and conditions of
         employment are subject to a collective bargaining agreement) that are
         in the aggregate no less favorable than those provided to the current
         and former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
         Effective Date. On or prior to January 1, 2004, the Purchaser shall
         have caused the compensation and Benefit Plans providing compensation
         and benefits to the current and former employees of Purchaser (other
         than current and former employees of the Surviving Corporation and its
         Subsidiaries) on the one hand, and the current and former employees of
         the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, to
         be in the aggregate comparable for similarly situated current and
         former employees.

              (b) Pre-Existing Limitations; Service Credit. With respect to any
         Benefit Plans in which any Company employees first become eligible to
         participate, on or after the Effective Time, and which are plans that
         the Company employees did not participate in prior to the Effective
         Time (the "New Company Plans"), Purchaser shall: (A) waive all
         pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
         participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Company
         employees under any health and welfare New Company Plans in which such
         employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time, and
         deductibles, coinsurance or maximum out-of-pocket payments made by
         Company employees during the calendar year in which the Effective Time
         occurs shall reduce the amount of deductibles, coinsurance and maximum
         out-of-pocket payments under the New Company Plans; provided that such
         Company employee and covered family members were enrolled in comparable
         coverage under the Benefit Plans of Company on the Effective Time and
         continuously thereafter until the effective time of coverage in the New
         Company Plans, and (B) recognize service of the Company employees with
         Company (or otherwise credited by Company) accrued prior to the
         Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting
         credit (and levels of benefits) in any New Company Plan in which such
         employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time, to
         the extent service is taken into account under the applicable New
         Company Plan; provided, however, in no event shall any credit be given
         to the extent it would result in the duplication of benefits for the
         same period of service. Service with Company will also be recognized
         under any New Company Plan that is a

                                      -41-

<PAGE>

         defined benefit pension plan with a benefit formula based upon final
         average compensation, with an offset for any benefit payable for the
         same period of service with Company under any defined benefit plan of
         Company.

              (c) Retention Agreements. Company and Purchaser have entered into
         binding employment arrangements with the certain executives of Company
         set forth on Exhibit B hereto.

              (d) Company Plans. From and after the Effective Time, Purchaser
         shall and shall cause its affiliates (including the Surviving
         Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to honor all Company Plans in
         accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the
         Effective Time, subject to any amendment or termination thereof that
         may be permitted by such terms. Without limiting the generality of the
         foregoing sentence, Purchaser shall cause the Company to continue (i)
         its Retirement Program without modification through December 31, 2003
         and shall maintain the defined benefit portion of such plan, without
         modification, through October 1, 2003; and (ii) its annual and long
         term incentive plans (the "Bonus Plans") in effect throughout the
         Benefits Continuation Period; provided that (i) the Purchaser or
         Company may modify the performance measures under the Bonus Plans to
         reflect equitably and appropriately the transactions contemplated by
         this Agreement subject to the consent of the CEO of the Company as of
         the date hereof, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; (ii)
         the target bonus as a percentage of base salary shall not be reduced
         throughout the Benefits Continuation Period; and (iii) the Company
         performance in respect of calculations made under the Bonus Pans for
         2002 and 2003 calendar years shall be calculated without taking into
         account any changes, expenses or costs associated with or arising as a
         result of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement or any
         non-recurring charges that would not reasonably be expected to have
         been incurred had the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not
         occurred, and Company may modify the Bonus Plans accordingly.

              (e) Subsequent Disposition. If Purchaser disposes of Company or
         any of its Subsidiaries or all or substantially all of their respective
         assets during the Benefits Continuation Period, Purchaser shall require
         the purchaser of Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective assets,
         as the case may be, to expressly agree to assume and perform the
         provisions of this Section 5.6 through the remainder of the Benefits
         Continuation Period with respect to provision of compensation and
         benefits.

              (f) Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Company shall take all action to
         the extent necessary (including amending the Company ESPP) such that
         the Company ESPP will terminate immediately prior to the Effective Time
         and all participants will automatically exercise their purchase rights
         immediately prior to the termination of the plan. Purchaser shall take
         all action to the extent necessary (including amending the Purchaser
         ESPP) such that the employees of Company or its Subsidiaries prior to
         the Effective Time who become employees of Purchaser or one of its
         Subsidiaries after the Effective Time shall be eligible to participate
         in the Purchaser ESPP as soon as practicable after the Effective Time.

         5.7. Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.

              (a) The Surviving Corporation shall, and Purchaser shall cause the
         Surviving Corporation to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless, and provide
         advancement of expenses to, all past and present (as of the Effective
         Time) directors, officers and employees of Company and its Subsidiaries
         (the "Indemnified Persons") to the same extent such persons are
         indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date
         of this Agreement by Company pursuant to Company's articles of
         incorporation, by-laws and indemnification agreements, if any, in
         existence on the date hereof with any current or former directors,
         officers and employees of Company and its Subsidiaries (but in any
         event to the fullest extent permitted by law) for acts or omissions
         occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including for acts or
         omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement
         and the Option Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
         contemplated hereby and thereby), and (ii) purchase as of the Effective
         Time a tail policy to the current policy of directors' and officers'
         liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
         Company which tail policy shall be effective for a period from the
         Effective Time through and including the date six years after the
         Closing Date with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
         occurred on or before the Effective Time, and which tail policy shall
         contain substantially the same coverage and amounts, and contain terms
         and conditions no less advantageous, in the aggregate, as that coverage
         currently provided by such current policy; provided, however, that in
         no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend, for the
         entire tail policy, in excess of 400% of the annual premium currently
         paid by Company for its current policy of directors' and officers'
         liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance; and, provided,
         further, that if the premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such
         amount, the Surviving Corporation after consultation with Company shall
         be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available
         for a cost not exceeding such amount.

              (b) To the extent permitted by the IBCL, the articles of
         incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain
         provisions with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
         exculpation from liability at least as favorable to the Indemnified
         Persons as those set forth in the current articles of incorporation and
         by-laws of Company, and for a period of six years from the Effective
         Time, those provisions shall not be repealed or amended or otherwise
         modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
         thereunder as of the Effective Time of the Indemnified Persons, except
         to the extent, if any, that such modification is required after the
         Effective Time by applicable law.

              (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim,
         action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at
         or after the Effective Time) is made against any Indemnified Persons on
         or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions
         of this Section 5.7 shall continue in effect until the final
         disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

                                      -43-

              (d) The covenants contained in this Section 5.7 are intended to be
         for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the
         Indemnified Persons and their respective heirs and legal
         representatives and shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights
         to which an Indemnified Persons is entitled, whether pursuant to law,
         contract or otherwise.

              (e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its
         successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
         Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
         entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all
         or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then,
         and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
         successors or assigns of the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,
         shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 5.7.

         5.8. Notification of Certain Matters. Company shall use reasonable
commercial efforts to give prompt notice to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall use
reasonable commercial efforts to give prompt notice to Company, to the extent
that either acquires actual knowledge of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of
any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which would be reasonably likely
to cause any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue
or inaccurate and (ii) any failure of Company, Purchaser or Merger Sub, as the
case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to
be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.8 shall not limit or otherwise
affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

         5.9. Public Announcements. Purchaser and Company shall develop a joint
communications plan and each party shall (i) ensure that all press releases and
other public statements with respect to this Agreement, the Option Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consistent with such
joint communications plan, and (ii) unless otherwise required by applicable law
or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any
securities exchange, consult with each other a reasonable time before issuing
any press release or otherwise making any public statement, and mutually agree
upon any such press release or public statement, with respect to this Agreement,
the Option Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. In
addition to the foregoing, except to the extent disclosed in the Joint Proxy
Statement in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.1, neither Purchaser
nor Company shall issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement
or disclosure concerning the other party or the other party's business,
financial condition or results of operations without the consent of the other
party.

         5.10. Listing of Shares of Purchaser Common Stock. Prior to the Closing

         5.11. Affiliates. Promptly after execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Company shall deliver to Purchaser a letter identifying all persons
who, in the opinion of Company, may be deemed as of the date hereof "affiliates"
of Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act, and such list
shall be updated as necessary to reflect changes from the date thereof. Company

"Affiliate Agreement").

         5.12. Transition Team. Promptly following execution of this Agreement,
the parties shall establish a transition planning team (the "Transition Team")
comprised of an equal number of representatives of Company and Purchaser. The
Transition Team shall be responsible for facilitating a transition and
integration planning process to ensure the successful combination of the
operations of Company with those of Purchaser. The Transition Team shall be
responsible for developing, and monitoring the development of, and deliverables
due under, an action plan for the combination of the businesses. The Transition
Team shall also meet regularly to review the financial performance of Company

Region of Purchaser, and of Trigon Blue Cross and Blue Shield, shall be in

         5.14. Tax-Free Reorganization Treatment. The parties hereto shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to be treated as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and shall not
knowingly take or fail to take any action which action or failure to act would
prevent (a) the qualification of the Merger as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or (b) the receipt of the opinions of Tax
counsel in such form and upon such matters as described in Section 6.2(c) and
Section 6.3(c). Unless required by law, each of Purchaser, Merger Sub, and
Company shall not file any Tax Return or take any position inconsistent with the
treatment of the Merger as a reorganization described in Section 368(a) of the
Code. Prior to the Effective Time, the parties shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the opinions of tax counsel in such form and upon
such matters as described in Section 6.2(c) and Section 6.3(c).

         5.15. Representation on Purchaser Board. Immediately after the
Effective Time, Purchaser shall appoint three of Company's current directors
(none of whom shall be an employee of Company) to the Board of Directors of
Purchaser. Such directors shall be appointed to each of the three classes of the
Board of Directors of Purchaser such that their terms of office expire at the
annual meeting of stockholders of Purchaser in 2003, 2004 and 2005,
respectively.

                                      -45-

It is the current intention of the parties that each such director shall be
nominated for election upon the expiration of his or her term of office.

         5.16. Other Obligations. From and after the date hereof, Company (i)
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet the goal of repurchasing, by
the Closing Date, in accordance with prudent business practices, for cash all
commercial paper issued by Company or any of its Subsidiaries (whether
outstanding as of the date hereof or issued hereafter) and (ii) shall, in
accordance with prudent business practices, pursue as a goal the existence of
cash and/or cash equivalents at Closing in an aggregate amount in accordance
with disclosures made to rating agencies prior to the date hereof with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby. The parties acknowledge that
contingencies may arise and facts may change, including the value of Company's
investment portfolio, such that Company may, in its reasonable judgment, vary
from the foregoing as appropriate; provided that Company consult and cooperate
with Purchaser in good faith prior to any such variance.

         Merger; and (ii) no Governmental Entity shall have instituted any
         action or proceeding (which remains pending at what would otherwise be

                                  ARTICLE VII
                            TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

         7.1. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the Closing Date,
whether before or after approval of matters presented in connection with the
Merger by the stockholders of Company or Purchaser:

              (a) By mutual written consent of Purchaser and Company;

              (b) By either Purchaser or Company, if the Merger shall not have
         been consummated on or before the date that is 9 months after the date
         of this Agreement (other than due principally to the failure of the
         party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform any obligations
         under this Agreement required to be performed at or prior to the
         Effective Time);

              (c) By Purchaser, if (i) the Board of Directors of Company shall
         withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation that its stockholders
         approve this Agreement in a manner adverse to Purchaser or (ii) the
         Board of Directors of Company adopts or recommends any Alternative
         Transaction.

              (d) By Purchaser, if any required approval of the stockholders of
         Company of this Agreement shall not have been obtained by reason of the
         failure to obtain the Required Company Vote at the Company Stockholders
         Meeting or at any adjournment thereof;

              (e) By Purchaser or Company, if any required approval of the
         stockholders of Purchaser of the Share Issuance shall not have been
         obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the Required Purchaser Vote
         at the Purchaser Stockholders Meeting or at any adjournment thereof;

              (f) By Purchaser or Company, if any court or other governmental
         body of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final order, decree
         or ruling or taken any other final action restraining, enjoining or
         otherwise prohibiting the Merger and such order, decree, ruling or
         other action is or shall have become final and nonappealable;

                                      -49-

<PAGE>

              (g) By Company, if (i) prior to the Closing Date there shall have
         been a breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty, covenant
         or agreement on the part of Purchaser or Merger Sub contained in this
         Agreement, which breach would (A) give rise to the failure of a
         condition set forth in Section 6.3 and (B) is incapable of being cured
         prior to the Closing Date by Purchaser or is not cured within 45 days
         of notice of such breach, or (ii) any of the conditions set forth in
         Section 6.1 (other than 6.1(e)) shall have become incapable of
         fulfillment;

              (h) By Purchaser, if (i) prior to the Closing Date there shall
         have been a breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty,
         covenant or agreement on the part of Company contained in this
         Agreement, which breach would (A) give rise to the failure of a
         condition set forth in Section 6.2 and (B) is incapable of being cured
         prior to the Closing Date by Company or is not cured within 45 days of
         notice of such breach or (ii) any of the conditions set forth in
         Section 6.1 shall have become incapable of fulfillment; and

              (i) By Company, at any time during the five Business Day period
         commencing the day after the Determination Date, if both of the
         following conditions are satisfied:

                  (1) the Average Purchaser Price on the Determination Date of
                  shares of Purchaser Common Stock shall be less than $55.00;
                  and

                  (2) (i) the number obtained by dividing the Average Purchaser
                  Price on the Determination Date by $70.70 (such number being
                  referred to herein as the "Purchaser Common Stock Ratio")
                  shall be less than (ii) the number obtained by dividing the
                  Index Price on the Determination Date by the Index Price on
                  April 26, 2002, and subtracting 0.15 from the quotient in this
                  clause (2) (ii)(such number being referred to herein as the
                  "Index Ratio");

         subject, however, to the following sentences of this Section 7.1(i). If
         Company elects to exercise its termination right pursuant to the
         immediately preceding sentence, it shall give prompt written notice to
         Purchaser; provided, that such notice of election to terminate may be
         withdrawn at any time within the aforementioned five Business Day
         period. During the five Business Day period commencing with its receipt
         of such notice, Purchaser shall have the option of either (I) adjusting
         the Exchange Ratio to equal a number equal to a quotient (rounded to
         the nearest one-thousandth), the numerator of which is the product of
         $55.00 and the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) and the denominator
         of which is the Average Purchaser Price, (II) increasing the Cash
         Consideration by an amount (the "Top-Up Amount") equal to the product
         of (x) the Average Purchaser Price and (y) the positive difference
         between (A) the adjusted Exchange Ratio determined by performing (for
         purposes of this clause (II) only) the calculation set forth in the
         preceding clause (I) and (B) 1.062 or (III) increasing each of the Cash
         Consideration and adjusting the Exchange Ratio as Purchaser may
         determine, so long as the sum of (i) the amount of the increase of the
         Cash Consideration and (ii) the

                                      -50-

<PAGE>

         value of the product of (x) the Average Purchaser Price and (y) the
         Exchange Ratio as adjusted pursuant to this clause (III) minus 1.062,
         is equal to the Top-Up Amount; provided, that Purchaser shall not be
         entitled to elect to increase the Cash Consideration pursuant to
         clauses (II) or (III) unless the parties agree (each acting reasonably
         and in good faith) that the transaction, as adjusted pursuant to this
         Section 7.1(i), qualifies as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
         Section 368 of the Code. If Purchaser makes an election contemplated by
         the preceding sentence, within such five Business Day period, it shall
         give prompt written notice to Company of such election and the revised
         Exchange Ratio or the amount of the increase in the Cash Consideration,
         or both, as applicable, whereupon no termination shall be deemed to
         have occurred pursuant to this Section 7.1(i) and this Agreement shall
         remain in effect in accordance with its terms (except as the Exchange
         Ratio or the Cash Consideration, as applicable, shall have been so
         modified), and any references in this Agreement to "Exchange Ratio" or
         "Cash Consideration", as applicable shall thereafter be deemed to refer
         to the Exchange Ratio or Cash Consideration, as applicable, as adjusted
         pursuant to this Section 7.1(i).

         7.2. Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement shall terminate, except for the obligations in the confidentiality
provisions of Section 5.3, and all of the provisions of this Section 7.2,
Section 7.3 and Section 8.1, and there shall be no liability on the part of any
party hereto; provided, however, that no party hereto shall be relieved or
released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its willful breach of
any provision of this Agreement. The termination of this Agreement shall not
affect the Option Agreement other than pursuant to its terms, which shall remain
in full force and effect.

         7.3. Fees and Expenses.

              (a) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to:

                   (i) (x) Section 7.1(c)(i) in a case where (i) the Board of
              Directors of Company was aware of the existence of a bona fide
              proposed Alternative Transaction or the intention to propose a
              bona fide Alternative Transaction and (ii) such proposed
              Alternative Transaction or intention had not been withdrawn prior
              to the taking of the actions set forth in Section 7.1(c)(i) and
              (except as provided for below in this Section 7.3(a)) at the time
              of such termination by Purchaser or (y) Section 7.1(c)(ii);

                   (ii) Section 7.1(d), if prior to the Company Stockholders
              Meeting there has been a public announcement of a bona fide
              proposed Alternative Transaction (and such proposed Alternative
              Transaction had not been publicly withdrawn at least two Business
              Days prior to the time of such meeting); or

                   (iii) Section 7.1(h)(i), based on a material breach by
              Company of Section 5.1(b), Section 5.1(c) or Section 5.5, in a
              case where (x) the Board of Directors of Company was aware of the
              existence of a bona fide proposed Alternative Transaction or the
              intention to propose a bona fide Alternative Transaction and (y)
              such proposed

                                      -51-

<PAGE>

              Alternative Transaction or intention had not been withdrawn prior
              to such breach,

         then, (x) in the case of a termination contemplated by Section
         7.3(a)(i) (so long as (a) such termination occurs by the end of the
         first Business Day following the day on which Purchaser receives
         written notice from Company in accordance with Section 8.2 of the
         actions by the Board of Directors of Company contemplated by Section
         7.1(c)(i) or (c)(ii) and (b) the proposed Alternative Transaction or
         intention had not been withdrawn prior to the time of such termination
         by Purchaser), (I) Company shall pay to Purchaser within one Business
         Day following termination of this Agreement, a fee, in cash, of
         $94,605,750.00 and (II) if Company within 12 months after such
         termination either consummates an Alternative Transaction or enters
         into a definitive agreement with respect to an Alternative Transaction,
         Company shall pay to Purchaser $94,605,750.00 simultaneously with such
         consummation or entering into such definitive agreement, as the case
         may be, and (y) in the case of a termination pursuant to any of Section
         7.3(a)(i) (but (a) after the end of the first Business Day following
         the day on which Purchaser receives written notice from Company in
         accordance with Section 8.2 of the actions by the Board of Directors of
         Company contemplated by Section 7.1(c)(i) or (c)(ii) or (b) in a case
         in which the proposed Alternative Transaction or intention had been
         withdrawn prior to the time of such termination by Purchaser), Section
         7.3(a)(ii) or Section 7.3(a)(iii), if Company within 12 months after
         such termination either consummates an Alternative Transaction or
         enters into a definitive agreement with respect to an Alternative
         Transaction, Company shall pay to Purchaser $189,211,500.00
         simultaneously with such consummation or entering into such definitive
         agreement, as the case may be.

              (b) Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, each party
         shall bear its own Expenses in connection with this Agreement and the
         transactions contemplated hereby, except that each Purchaser and
         Company shall bear and pay one-half of the costs and expenses incurred
         in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of the Form S-4 and
         the Joint Proxy Statement; provided, however, that if Company
         withdraws, amends or modifies its recommendation with respect to this
         Agreement or the Merger, Purchaser shall not be responsible for any
         costs or expenses related to any materials sent or delivered to
         Company's stockholders in respect thereof. As used in this Agreement,
         "Expenses" includes all out-of-pocket expenses (including, without
         limitation, all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment
         bankers, experts and consultants to a party hereto and its affiliates)
         incurred by a party or on its behalf in connection with or related to
         the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and performance

         8.3. Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of or
Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of
contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The parties have participated jointly in the negotiating and
drafting of this Agreement and the Option Agreement. In the event of an
ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement and
the Option Agreement shall each be construed as if drafted jointly by the
parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this
Agreement or the Option Agreement.

         8.4. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of
the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that both
parties need not sign the same counterpart.

         8.5. Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries.

              (a) This Agreement, including the schedules hereto, the Option
         Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
         agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both
         written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter
         hereof and thereof.

                                      -54-

<PAGE>

              (b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the
         benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or
         implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any
         right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
         this Agreement; provided, however, that Sections 1.10 and 5.7 may be
         enforced against Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
         may be, by the Persons identified or described therein.

         8.6. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Indiana (except to the extent that
Virginia law applies to the internal and corporate affairs of Company).

         8.7. Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy, all
other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to
the greatest extent possible.

         8.8. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by
action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time
before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger
by the stockholders of Company and the stockholders of Purchaser, but, after any
such approval, no amendment shall be made which by law or in accordance with the
rules of any relevant stock exchange requires further approval by such
stockholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties
hereto.

         8.9. Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto,
(ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (iii) waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the
part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. The failure of
any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

         8.10. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto, in whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without
the prior written consent of the other party, and any attempt to make any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void, except that Merger Sub
may assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of its rights, interests and
obligations under this Agreement to any direct wholly owned Subsidiary of
Purchaser without the consent of

                                      -55-

<PAGE>

Company, but no such assignment shall relieve Merger Sub of any of its
obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

         8.11. Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers. Each of Purchaser and
Company irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to
this Agreement or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect
hereof brought by the other party hereto or its successors or assigns shall be
brought and determined in the Courts of the State of Indiana and each of
Purchaser and Company hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action
or proceeding for itself and in respect to its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. Each of
Purchaser and Company hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by
way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason
other than the failure to lawfully serve process, (b) that it or its property is
exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process
commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to
judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise), and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, that (i)
the suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient
forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper and (iii)
this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such
courts.

         8.12. Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms. It is accordingly agreed that
the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.

                Form of Trigon Healthcare, Inc. Affiliate Letter




                                                            April 28, 2002



Anthem, Inc.
120 Monument Circle
Indianapolis, IN 46204

Ladies and Gentlemen:

         I have been advised that as of the date hereof, I may be deemed to be
an "affiliate" of Trigon Healthcare, Inc., a Virginia corporation (the
"Company"), as that term is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of
Rule 145 of the Rules and Regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").

         Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
April 28, 2002 (as it may be amended, supplemented or modified from time to
time, the "Merger Agreement"), among Anthem, Inc., an Indiana corporation
("Purchaser"), AI Sub Acquisition Corp., an Indiana corporation ("Merger Sub"),
and the Company, the Company will be merged with and into Merger Sub (the
"Merger"). Capitalized terms used herein but not defined shall have the
respective meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement.

         In consideration of the agreements contained herein, Purchaser's
reliance on this letter in connection with the consummation of the Merger and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, I hereby represent, warrant and agree that I will not
make any sale, transfer or other disposition of any shares of Purchaser Common
Stock received by me pursuant to the Merger in violation of the Securities Act
or the Rules and Regulations.

         I have been advised that the issuance of the shares of Purchaser Common
Stock pursuant to the Merger will have been registered with the Commission under
the Securities Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4. I have also been
advised, however, that since I may be deemed to be an affiliate of the Company
at the time the Merger is submitted for a vote of the stockholders of the
Company, the Purchaser


<PAGE>


Common Stock received by me may be disposed by me only (i) pursuant to an
effective registration under the Securities Act, (ii) in conformity with the
volume and other limitations of Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under the
Securities Act, (iii) in reliance upon an exemption from registration that is
available under the Securities Act or (iv) after receipt of an opinion of
counsel reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, or under a no-action or
interpretative letter obtained from the Commission, stating that, such sale,
transfer or other disposition will not violate or is otherwise exempt from
registration under the Securities Act.

         I also understand that instructions will be given to Purchaser's
transfer agent with respect to the Purchaser Common Stock to be received by me
pursuant to the Merger and that there will be placed on the certificates
representing such shares of Purchaser Common Stock, or any substitutes therefor,
a legend stating in substance as follows:

         "THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE BEEN ISSUED IN A
         TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF
         1933, AS AMENDED, APPLIES AND MAY ONLY BE SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED
         IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF RULE 145 OR PURSUANT TO A
         REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THAT ACT OR AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH
         REGISTRATION."

         It is understood and agreed that the legend set forth above shall be
removed upon surrender of certificates bearing such legend by delivery of
substitute certificates without such legend if (i) one year shall have elapsed
from the date that I received Purchaser Common Stock in the Merger and the
provisions of Rule 145(d)(2) are then applicable to me, (ii) two years shall
have elapsed from the date that I received Purchaser Common Stock in the Merger
and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(3) are then applicable to me, or (iii) I have
delivered to Purchaser an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Purchaser, or a no-action or interpretative letter obtained from
the Commission, to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of
the Securities Act..

         I further understand and agree that Purchaser is under no obligation to
register the sale, transfer or other disposition of Purchaser Common Stock by me
or on my behalf under the Securities Act or to take any other action necessary
in order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration available.


         Neither execution of this letter nor any provisions set forth herein
should be construed as an admission on my part that I am an "affiliate" of the
Company as described in the first paragraph of this letter, or a waiver of any
right I may have to object to any claim that I am such an affiliate on or after
the date of this letter.


<PAGE>


         By Purchaser's acceptance of this letter, Purchaser hereby agrees with
me that, for a period of two years after the Effective Time (as defined in the
Merger Agreement), it shall use its reasonable efforts to (i) file, on a timely
basis, all reports and data required to be filed with the Commission by it
pursuant to Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act"), and (ii) furnish to me upon request a written statement as to
whether Purchaser has complied with such reporting requirements during the 12
months preceding any proposed sale of Purchaser Common Stock by me under Rule
145.

         This letter agreement constitutes the complete understanding between
Purchaser and me concerning the subject matter hereof. Any notice required to be
sent to either party hereunder shall be sent by registered or certified mail,
return receipt requested, using the addresses set forth herein or such other
address as shall be furnished in writing by the parties. This letter agreement
shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with, the laws
of the State of Indiana.

         If you are in agreement with the foregoing, please so indicate by
signing below and returning a copy of this letter to me, at which time this
letter shall become a binding agreement between us.


                                                     Very truly yours,


                                                     -----------------------
