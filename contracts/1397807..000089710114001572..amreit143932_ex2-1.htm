      **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

  

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") dated as of October
31, 2014, among Edens Investment Trust, a Maryland statutory trust ("
_Parent_ "), Edens Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership ("
_Operating Partnership_ "), Saturn Subsidiary, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Operating
Partnership (" _Merger Sub_ ", and together with Parent and Operating
Partnership, the " _Buyer Parties_ "), and AmREIT, Inc., a Maryland
corporation (the " _Company_ ").

  

WHEREAS, the parties wish to effect a business combination through a merger
of the Company with and into Merger Sub on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement (the " _Merger_ ") and in accordance
with the Maryland General Corporation Law (the " _MGCL_ ") and the Delaware
Limited Liability Company Act (the " _LLC Act_ ");

  

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
(i) approved and declared advisable this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively with the Merger, the
" _Transactions_ ") and (ii) determined that the terms of the Merger and the
other Transactions are advisable and in the best interests of the Company;

  

WHEREAS, the Company Board has directed that the Merger and, to the extent
stockholder approval is required, the other Transactions be submitted for
consideration at a meeting of the Companys stockholders and has resolved to
recommend that the Companys stockholders vote to approve the Merger and, to
the extent stockholder approval is required, the other Transactions;

  

WHEREAS, the Buyer Parties have approved this Agreement and the Merger and
declared that this Agreement and the Merger are advisable on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein;

  

WHEREAS, the parties intend that, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, the
Merger will be treated as a taxable sale by the Company of all of the
Companys assets to the Operating Partnership in exchange for the Merger
Consideration (as defined herein) and the assumption of all of the Companys
liabilities, followed by a distribution of such Merger Consideration to the
stockholders of the Company in liquidation pursuant to Sections 331, 336 and
562 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and
that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of liquidation" of the Company
for U.S. federal income Tax purposes; and

  

WHEREAS, the Buyer Parties and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

  

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows (capitalized terms not
defined at the first use of such terms shall have the meanings ascribed to
such terms in Section 9.03 hereof or as otherwise ascribed to such terms
herein):

   **ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER**

  

1.01   _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the MGCL and the LLC Act, the

in the Merger (" _Surviving LLC_ ").

  

1.02   _Closing_. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger shall
take place at the offices of Morrison and Foerster LLP, 2000 Pennsylvania
Avenue N.W., Suite 6000, Washington, D.C., at 9:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) on the
second (2nd) Business Day following the satisfaction (or, to the extent
permitted by Law, waiver by all parties hereto) of the conditions set
forth in Article VII (other than those that by their terms are to be
satisfied or waived at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of such conditions at the Closing), or at such other time and date as shall be
agreed upon in writing among the Buyer Parties and the Company. The date on
which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing
Date_ ".

  

1.03   _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date or as soon as practicable
thereafter, the parties hereto shall duly file (a) articles of merger in a
form that complies with the MGCL (the " _Articles of Merger_ "), with the

accordance with the relevant provisions of the MGCL and (b) a certificate of
merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Office of the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Secretary of State_ ") in
accordance with the LLC Act. The parties shall make all other filings or
recordings required under the MGCL and the LLC Act. The Merger shall become
effective at such time as the Articles of Merger and the Certificate of
Merger have been accepted for record by the SDAT and duly filed with the
Delaware Secretary of State, respectively, or at such other date and time
(not to exceed thirty (30) days from the date the Articles of Merger are
accepted for record by the SDAT and the Certificate of Merger is duly filed
with the Delaware Secretary of State) as the Buyer Parties and the
Company shall agree and designate in such filing in accordance with the MGCL
and the LLC Act (the time that the Merger becomes effective being the "
_Effective Time_ ").

  

1.04   _Effects_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the
MGCL and the LLC Act.

  

1.05   _Operating Company Agreement; Certificate of Formation_. The
limited liability company operating agreement of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the limited liability
company operating agreement of Surviving LLC until thereafter amended as
provided therein or by law (the " _Operating Agreement_ "). The certificate
of formation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the certificate of formation of Surviving LLC until thereafter
amended as provided therein or by law

  

1.06   _Members and Officers of Surviving LLC_. Parent, the sole member
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the sole
member of Surviving LLC and the officers of Merger Sub, if any, immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial

   officers of Surviving LLC, each to hold office in accordance with the terms of
the Operating Agreement of Surviving LLC.

  

1.07   _Pre-Merger Transactions_. The Buyer Parties shall have the
option, in their sole discretion and without requiring the further consent of
the Company, the Company Board or the Companys stockholders, upon reasonable
notice to the Company, to request that the Company, immediately prior to the
Closing, (a) convert or cause the conversion of one or more of the
Companys subsidiaries (" _Company Subsidiaries_ ") that are organized as
corporations into limited liability companies (or other entities) and one or
more Company Subsidiaries that are organized as limited partnerships or
limited liability companies into other entities, on the basis of
Organizational Documents as reasonably requested by the Buyer Parties, (b)
sell or cause to be sold all of the capital stock, shares of beneficial
interests, partnership interests or limited liability interests
owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company in one or more Company
Subsidiaries to any person at a price and on terms all as designated by the
Buyer Parties, and (c) sell or cause to be sold any of the assets of the
Company or one or more Company Subsidiaries to any person at a price and on
terms all as designated by the Buyer Parties (clauses (a), (b) and (c) being "
_Requested Transaction_ s"); provided, however, that (i) none of the
Requested Transactions shall delay or prevent the completion of the Merger,
(ii) the Requested Transactions shall be implemented as close as possible to
the Effective Time (but after the Buyer Parties shall have waived or
confirmed that all conditions to the consummation of the Merger have been
satisfied), (iii) neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be
required to take any action in contravention of any Law or
Organizational Document, (iv) the consummation of any such Requested
Transactions shall be contingent upon the receipt by the Company of a
written notice from the Buyer Parties confirming that all of the conditions
set forth in Sections 7.01 and 7.02 have been satisfied (or, with respect to
Section 7.02, at the option of the Buyer Parties, waived) and that the Buyer
Parties are prepared to proceed immediately with the Closing (it being
understood that in any event the Requested Transactions will be deemed to have
occurred prior to the Closing), (v) the Requested Transactions (or the
inability to complete the Requested Transactions) shall not affect or
modify in any respect the obligations of the Buyer Parties under this
Agreement, including payment of the Merger Consideration, (vi) neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be required to take any such action
that could adversely affect the classification of the Company as a "real
estate investment trust" (a " _REIT_ ") within the meaning of Section 856 of
the Code, and (vii) neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be
required to take any such action that would reasonably be expected to result
in any Taxes being imposed on, or any adverse Tax consequences to, any
stockholder or other equity interest holder of the Company, or other adverse
consequences to the stockholders or equity holders of the Company as a whole,
incrementally greater than the Taxes or other adverse consequences to such
party in connection with the consummation of this Agreement in the absence of
such action taken pursuant to this Section 1.07 unless such holders are
indemnified by the Buyer Parties for such incremental Taxes. The Buyer
Parties shall upon request by the Company advance to the Company all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs to be incurred by the Company or, promptly
upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-
pocket costs incurred by the Company in connection with any actions taken by
the Company in accordance with this Section 1.07 (including reasonable fees
and expenses of their Representatives). The Buyer Parties, on a joint and
several basis, hereby agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, and their Representatives from and against any and
all liabilities,

   losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and
penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with or as a result of
taking such actions. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the
representations, warranties or covenants of the Company shall be deemed to
apply to, or deemed breached or violated by, any of the Requested
Transactions.

  

 **ARTICLE II 
 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER**

  

2.01   _Effects on Shares and Membership Interests_. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder of any shares of the common stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per
share (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), or holders of any membership
interests in Merger Sub:

  

(a)   _Membership Interests of Merger Sub_. Each membership interest
in Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall remain as one issued and outstanding membership interest in Surviving
LLC.

  

(b)   _Conversion of the Company Common Stock_.

  

(i)  Subject to Section 2.01(c), each share of the Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
automatically converted into the right to receive an amount equal to $26.55
per share of the Company Common Stock, in cash and without interest (the "
_Merger Consideration_ ").

  

(ii)  As of the Effective Time, all such shares of the Company Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of shares of Company Common Stock (the "
_Shares_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such Shares
in accordance with Section 2.02, without interest.

  

(iii)  As provided in Section 2.02(g), the right of any holder of
Shares to receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by
the amount of any withholding that is required under applicable Tax Laws.

  

(c)   _Company Restricted Stock_. The Buyer Parties acknowledge that
all outstanding shares of Company Common Stock subject to vesting or other
forfeiture conditions or repurchase rights by the Company or a Company
Subsidiary (such shares, the " _Company Restricted Stock_ ") that remain
unvested or otherwise subject to forfeiture conditions or repurchase shall
automatically become fully vested and free of any such forfeiture conditions
or repurchase rights immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each share
of Company Restricted Stock shall be considered an outstanding share of
Company Common Stock for all purposes of this Agreement, including the right
to receive the Merger Consideration.

  

2.02   _Exchange of Shares_.

  

(a)   _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer Parties
shall select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to
act as paying agent (the " _Paying_

   _Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of
Shares. Prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer Parties shall, or shall cause
the Surviving LLC to, deposit with the Paying Agent to be held in trust for
the benefit of holders of Shares all of the cash necessary to pay for the
shares of the Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(b) (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Buyer Parties shall,
or shall cause the Surviving LLC to, promptly deposit additional funds with
the Paying Agent in an amount equal to any deficiency in the amount required
to make such payment.

  

(b)   _Exchange Procedure_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in
any event within five (5) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving LLC or the
Buyer Parties shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of
Shares that were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.01, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in
customary form and have such other provisions as the Buyer Parties and the
Company shall reasonably agree) and (ii) instructions for effecting the
exchange of Shares for the Merger Consideration. Upon delivery of such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents
as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Shares
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of Merger
Consideration into which the Shares shall have been converted pursuant to
Section 2.01. In the event of a transfer of ownership of the Company Common
Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment
may be made to a person other than the person in whose name such records
indicate, if Surviving LLC shall be presented with a proper form for such
transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any Transfer Taxes
or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the
registered holder of such Shares or shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Buyer Parties that such Taxes have been paid or are not
applicable. Until the procedures set forth in this Section 2.02 have been
satisfied, each Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of Merger
Consideration, without interest, into which the Shares have been converted
pursuant to Section 2.01. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the cash
payable upon surrender of any Shares.

  

(c)   _No Further Ownership Rights in the Company Common Stock_. The
Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II
upon conversion of any Shares shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares, _subject_ , _however_ ,
to the Surviving LLCs obligation to pay any dividends or to make any
other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may
have been declared or made by the Company on such Shares in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and that
remain unpaid at the Effective Time; and after the Effective Time there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving LLC of Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Shares are presented to the
Surviving LLC or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II.

  

(d)   _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Company Common Stock
for twelve (12) months after the

   Effective Time shall be delivered to the Parent upon demand, and any holder of
the Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article
II shall thereafter look only to the Buyer Parties and the Surviving LLC
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws) as general creditors
thereof with respect to the payment of its claim for Merger Consideration,
without any interest thereon.

  

(e)   _No Liability_. None of the Buyer Parties, the Surviving LLC,
the Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Shares have not
been surrendered prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration in
respect of such Shares would otherwise escheat to or become the property of
any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration in respect of such
Shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property
of the Surviving LLC, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.

  

(f)   _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest

Corporation, respectively, or a combination of the foregoing and, in any such
case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three (3) months, or
in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment category
granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of investment. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent, or as directed by, the Buyer Parties. In no event, however, shall
such investment or any such payment of interest or income delay the receipt
by holders of Shares of the Merger Consideration, or otherwise impair such
holders rights hereunder.

  

(g)   _Withholding Rights_. The Buyer Parties, the Surviving LLC or
the Paying Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of shares of the Company Common Stock or any holder of Company
Restricted Stock such amounts as the Buyer Parties, the Surviving LLC or the
Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign
Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Entity responsible for the
assessment, determination, collection or administration of any Tax (" _Taxing
Authority_ ") by the Buyer Parties, the Surviving LLC or the Paying Agent,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of shares of the Company Common Stock or the
holder of Company Restricted Stock, as the case may be, in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by the Buyer Parties, the
Surviving LLC or the Paying Agent.

  

2.03   _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split or combination, or any stock dividend thereon
with a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration and any other
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted.

informational purposes promptly after the date hereof. Jefferies LLC has
consented to the inclusion of such opinion in the Proxy Statement.

 **ARTICLE IV 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE BUYER PARTIES**

  

The Buyer Parties, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to the

validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of
Maryland. Each of the Operating Partnership and Parent has the requisite
organizational power and authority to own, lease or otherwise hold and
operate its properties and assets and to conduct its businesses as presently
conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good
standing or have such power and authority, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to have Buyer Material Adverse
Effect. In this Agreement, the term " _Buyer Material Adverse Effect_ " means
any Event that prevents or materially delays any of the Buyer Parties from
performing its obligations under this Agreement in any material respect or
the consummation of the Merger or the other Transactions.

hold and operate its properties and assets and to conduct its businesses as
presently conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, existing or
in good standing or have such power and authority, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to have a Buyer Material
Adverse Effect.

  

(c)  Each of the Buyer Parties is duly qualified or licensed to do
business and is in good standing (to the extent the concept is recognized by
such jurisdiction) in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or
its ownership, leasing or operation of its properties make such qualification
or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or
licensed or to be in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be likely to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

  

4.02   _Organization of Merger Sub; No Prior Activities_. Merger Sub is
a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Merger Sub was formed solely for the
purpose of engaging in the Transactions and Merger Sub has not conducted any
activities other than in connection with its organization, the negotiation

   necessary organizational action, on the part of the Buyer Parties, and no
other organizational actions, on the part of either the Buyer Parties are
necessary to authorize this Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions.
Neither the approval nor adoption of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the Merger or the other Transactions requires any approval of the partners,
members or trustees of the Buyer Parties, as applicable. Each of the Buyer
Parties has duly executed and delivered this Agreement, and, assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, this Agreement
constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

  

4.04   _No Conflicts; Consents_.

  

(a)  The execution and delivery by each of the Buyer Parties of this
Agreement do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the
other Transactions and compliance with the terms hereof will not, conflict
with, or result in any violation or breach of or default (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of, or result
in, termination, cancelation or acceleration of any obligation or loss of a
material benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties or assets of the Buyer Parties or any of the Buyer Parties
subsidiaries under, any provision of (i) the Organizational Documents of the
Buyer Parties or any of the Buyer Parties subsidiaries, (ii) any Contract to
which the Buyer Parties or any of the Buyer Parties subsidiaries is a party
or by which any of their respective properties or assets is bound or
(iii) subject to the filings and other matters referred to in Section
4.04(b), any Judgment or Law applicable to the Buyer Parties or any of the
Buyer Parties subsidiaries or their respective properties or assets, other
than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, any such items that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to have a
Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

  

(b)  No Consent of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any
Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by or with respect to
the Buyer Parties or any of the Buyer Parties subsidiaries in connection with
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or the consummation

supplied by the Buyer Parties for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the Companys
stockholders or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading.

  

4.06   _Brokers_. None of the Buyer Parties, nor any of their respective
officers, directors or employees has employed any broker or finder or

4.07   _Absence of Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is no suit,
action or proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of any of the Buyer

or affiliate of any of the Buyer Parties is, nor at any time during the last
five (5) years has been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company as defined
in Section 3-601 of the MGCL.

  

4.09   _Solvency_. None of the Buyer Parties is, nor will any of the
Buyer Parties after giving effect to the Transactions (including the
Financing) be, insolvent (either because its financial condition is such that
the sum of its debts is greater than the fair market value of its assets or
because the fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required
to pay its probable liabilities on its existing debts as they mature). None
of the Buyer Parties has, nor will the Buyer Parties after giving effect to
the Transactions (including the Financing) have, (a) unreasonably small
capital with which to engage in its business or (b) incurred debts beyond its
ability to pay as they become due.

  

4.10   _Financing_. The Buyer Parties have delivered to the Company

Knickerbocker Edens LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and BREP Edens
Investment Partners L.P., Delaware limited partnership, dated as of
December 19, 2013 (the " _Equity Commitment Agreements_ "), pursuant to

party thereto has agreed and committed to provide the equity financing set
forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_ "), and (ii) Operating Partnerships
Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of March 18, 2014 (as
amended, the " _Amended Credit Agreement_ ", and together with the Equity
Commitment Agreements, the " _Financing Documents_ "), pursuant to which, and
subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the Financing Sources party
thereto have agreed and committed to provide the debt financing set forth
therein (the " _Debt Financing_ ", and together with the Equity Financing,
the " _Financing_ "). The Financing Documents have not been amended, restated
or otherwise modified or waived prior to the date of this Agreement and the
commitments contained in the Financing Documents have not been withdrawn,
modified or rescinded in any respect prior to the date of this Agreement. As
of the date of this Agreement, the Financing Documents are in full force and
effect and are the valid, binding and enforceable obligations of the Operating
Partnership and the other parties thereto (except for the Bankruptcy and
Equity Exception). There are no conditions precedent to the funding of the
full amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in or
contemplated by the Financing Documents. Subject to the terms and conditions
of the Financing Documents, the net proceeds contemplated from the Financing,
together with other financial resources of the Buyer Parties, including cash
on hand of the Buyer Parties and the

   Company on the Closing Date, will, in the aggregate, be sufficient for the
satisfaction of all of the Buyer Parties obligations under this Agreement,
including the payment of any amounts required to be paid by the Buyer Parties
pursuant to Article I and Article II and of all fees and expenses required to
be paid by the Buyer Parties and reasonably expected to be incurred in
connection herewith. The Buyer Parties have fully paid all fees required to
be paid prior to the date of this Agreement pursuant to the Financing
Documents. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be
expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of the Buyer Parties
or, to the knowledge of the Buyer Parties, any other parties thereto, under
the Financing Documents. As of the date of this Agreement, none of the Buyer
Parties is not aware of any fact, occurrence or condition that makes any of
the assumptions or statements set forth in any of the Financing Documents
inaccurate in any material respect, nor does it have any reason to believe
that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied or that the
Financing will not be available to the Buyer Parties on the date of the
Closing. The consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions will not
result in the violation of any covenant under or other breach of or default
under any Financing Document.

    

4.11   _No Other Representations and Warranties_. In entering into this
Agreement, each of the Buyer Parties has relied solely upon its independent
investigation and analysis of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and the
JV Entities, and each of the Buyer Parties acknowledges and agrees that it

agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar instrument
contemplating or otherwise relating to a Company Takeover Proposal.

  

(b)  Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 5.03(a) to the
contrary, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, if (i) the
Company or any of its Representatives shall have received an unsolicited bona
fide written Company Takeover Proposal that the Company Board reasonably
believes, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Company
Proposal, (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the
failure to take action with respect to such Company Takeover Proposal would
be inconsistent with the duties of the members of the Company Board under
applicable Law, (iii) such Company Takeover Proposal was not the result of a
breach of this Section 5.03 and (iv) the Company provides to the Buyer Parties
in accordance with Section 5.03(d) the information required to be delivered
by the Company to the Buyer Parties, then, so long as the foregoing
conditions in the immediately preceding clauses (i)-(iv) remain satisfied,
the Company, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, may (A)
engage in negotiations or discussions with such Person and its Representatives
with respect to the Company Takeover Proposal, and (B) furnish to such Person
or its Representatives non-public information relating to the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement; _provided_ that the Company shall concurrently provide to the
Buyer Parties any such information that is provided to any such Person which

(c)  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company
Board may (i) (x) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in respect of a
Company Takeover Proposal, or (y) enter into an agreement providing for a
transaction that constitutes a Superior Company Proposal, if (1) the Company
shall have received a Company Takeover Proposal that was not the result of a
breach of Section 5.03(a) that the Company Board determines, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
constitutes a Superior Company Proposal and the Company shall have
otherwise complied with the provisions of Section 5.03, (2) the Company

   Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take action with respect to such Superior Company
Proposal would be inconsistent with the duties of the members of the Company
Board under applicable Law, (3) the Company has previously notified the Buyer
Parties in writing that it intends to take such action (a " _Section 5.03
Notice_ "), (4) the Company shall have made its Representatives available to
discuss in good faith with the Buyer Parties Representatives any proposed
modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement during the three
(3) Business Day period following delivery by the Company to the Buyer Parties
of the Section 5.03 Notice delivered to the Buyer Parties, (5) if the Buyer
Parties shall have delivered to the Company a written, binding
and irrevocable offer capable of being accepted by the Company to alter the
terms or conditions of this Agreement during such three (3) Business Day
period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors), after
considering the terms of such offer by the Buyer Parties, that the Superior
Company Proposal giving rise to such Section 5.03 Notice continues to be a
Superior Company Proposal, and (6) in the case of clause (y) above, the
Company terminates this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.01(f), or (ii)
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change other than in respect of a Company
Takeover Proposal if (A) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect such
Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the duties of the
members of the Company Board under applicable Law, (B) the Company has
previously delivered to the Buyer Parties a Section 5.03 Notice that it
intends to take such action, (C) the Company shall have made its
Representatives available to discuss in good faith with the Buyer
Parties Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement during the three (3) Business Day
period following delivery by the Company to the Buyer Parties of the Section

shall have delivered to the Company a written, binding and irrevocable offer
capable of being accepted by the Company to alter the terms or conditions of
this Agreement during such three (3) Business Day period, the Company Board
shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel and after considering the terms of such offer by the Buyer
Parties, that the failure to effect such Adverse Recommendation Change would
be inconsistent with the duties of the members of the Company Board under
applicable law. If any Superior Company Proposal that is the subject of clause
(i) of this Section 5.03(c) is revised, including any revision to price, then
the Company shall deliver to the Buyer Parties a new Section 5.03 Notice and
again comply with the requirements of clause (i) of this Section 5.03(c) with
respect to such revised Superior Company Proposal, on each occasion on which
a revised Superior Company Proposal is submitted, _provided_ that in
connection with each new Section 5.03 Notice contemplated by this sentence,
each reference to a three (3) Business Day period in the preceding sentence
shall be deemed to be a reference to a two (2) Business Day period.

  

(d)  The Company shall promptly (and in any event within one (1)
Business Day) advise the Buyer Parties orally and in writing of the receipt
by the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any inquiries, discussions
negotiations, proposals or expressions of interest with respect to a Company
Takeover Proposal, or that the Company believes could reasonably be expected
to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall also provide the
identity of the Person making, submitting, inquiring about or
expressing interest with respect to such Company Takeover Proposal and (i) if

Takeover Proposal within twenty-four (24) hours of any such change. The
Company shall not, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, enter
into any contract, arrangement, or commitment with any Person subsequent to
the date of this Agreement, and neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries is or shall become party to any contract, arrangement, or
commitment, in each case, that prohibits the Company from providing such
information to the Buyer Parties.

  

(e)  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company
from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under
the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders
if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, failure to so disclose
would be inconsistent with the duties of the members of the Company Board
under applicable Law; _provided_ , that any disclosure of a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act other than (A) a "stop, look and listen"
communication limited solely to the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under
the Exchange Act, (B) any express rejection of any applicable Company
Takeover Proposal or (C) any express reaffirmation of the Company Board
Recommendation, shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change. No
change, withdrawal or modification of the Company Board Recommendation shall
change the approval of the Company Board for purposes of causing any Law to be
inapplicable to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

(f)  During the period from the date of this Agreement through the
earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Article VIII, the Company shall not terminate, amend, modify or waive any
provision of any confidentiality agreement relating to a Company Takeover
Proposal, or any standstill agreement to which the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries is a party (other than any between the Company and any
of the Buyer Parties), in each case unless the Company Board determines
after consulting with its outside legal counsel that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the duties of the members of the Company
Board under applicable Law; _provided_ that the Company shall not enforce and
hereby waives any provision of any such agreement that would prohibit a third
party from requesting such termination, amendment, modification or waiver
or from communicating confidentially a Company Takeover Proposal to the
Company Board (i.e., a "dont ask, dont waive" provision).

promptly of the receipt of any comments or communications (whether written or
oral) from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff
for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional
information and shall make available to the Buyer Parties copies of all
correspondence between the Company and the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval there shall occur any event that should be set forth in

prepare and mail to its stockholders such an amendment or supplement. The
Company shall provide the Buyer Parties and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review the Proxy Statement prior to its being filed with the
SEC and shall provide the Buyer Parties and their counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review all amendments and supplements to the Proxy Statement

duly call, establish a record date for, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the
purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder Approval. The Company shall cause
the Company Stockholder Meeting to be held (on a date selected by the
Company in consultation with the Buyer Parties) as promptly as practicable
after the mailing of the Proxy Statement; provided, however, that such date
is in accordance with all applicable Laws with respect to the Company
Stockholder Meeting. The notice of such Company Stockholder Meeting shall
state that a proposal to approve the Merger and the other Transactions, a
proposal to adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting if necessary or
appropriate to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to approve
the Merger and the other Transactions, and a non-binding advisory proposal to
approve change-in-control payments to executives of the Company will be
considered and voted upon at the Company Stockholder Meeting and, except to

6.02   _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to applicable
Law, and upon reasonable prior written notice, the Company shall, and shall
cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to, afford to the Buyer Parties and to
their Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours during
the period prior to the Effective Time to all of their properties, offices,
personnel and books and records and, during such period, the Company shall,
and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the
Buyer Parties all financial, operating and other data and information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as the Buyer Parties may
reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such access shall not
interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries or otherwise result in any unreasonable interference
with the prompt and timely discharge by such employees of their normal duties.
None of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be required to (i)
provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure
would reasonably be expected to jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries (provided that the Company shall use
its reasonable efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that
would not reasonably be expected to jeopardize the attorney-client privilege)
or contravene any Law or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement or (ii) provide access to or to disclose such portions of
documents or information relating to pricing or other matters that are highly
sensitive where such access or disclosure is reasonably likely to result in
antitrust difficulties for the Company or any of its affiliates; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in
which any of the preceding restrictions apply. No investigation made pursuant
to this Section shall affect any representation or warranty in this Agreement
or any condition to the obligations of the parties hereto to consummate the
Merger. In connection with the continuing operation of the business of the
Company and the Companys Subsidiaries between the date hereof and the
Effective Time, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
consult on a regular basis with the representatives of the Buyer Parties and
their subsidiaries with regard to material operational developments and the
general status of ongoing operations pursuant to procedures reasonably
requested by the Buyer Parties, their subsidiaries or such Representatives,
provided that such procedures do not interfere unreasonably with the
conduct of the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and shall
not require disclosure of information not required to be disclosed by the
preceding provisions of this Section 6.02. All information

  exchanged pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall be subject to the non-
disclosure agreement, dated as of August 15, 2014, between the Company and the
Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

  

6.03   _Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification_.

  

(a)  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of the Buyer Parties and the Company agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, all things necessary to fulfill all conditions applicable to such party
pursuant to this Agreement and to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other Transactions,
including (i) obtaining all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers,
Consents and qualifications from Governmental Entities and making all
necessary registrations, filings and notifications and taking all reasonable
steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval, clearance, non-action
letter, waiver or exemption from any Governmental Entity; (ii) obtaining all
necessary Consents, qualifications, approvals, waivers or exemptions from
non-governmental third parties; (iii) the defending of any lawsuit or other
legal proceeding, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions under any antitrust
or competition Law, including seeking to have any stay or temporary
restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated
or reversed; and (iv) executing and delivering any additional documents or
instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and to carry out this
Agreement. In connection with obtaining any consent or approval from any non-
governmental third parties with respect to the Transactions, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (A) without the prior written
consent of the Buyer Parties (not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or
delayed), the Company shall not and shall not permit any of the Company
Subsidiaries or JV Entities to pay or commit to pay, to such Person whose
approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make
any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation due to such
Person or modify any Contract and (B) none of the Buyer Parties or their
affiliates shall be required to pay or commit to pay to such Person whose
approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make
any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation.

  

(b)  Without limiting Section 6.03(a), each of the Company and the
Buyer Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to make any required
filing or submissions under any antitrust Law that the Company or the Buyer
Parties determines should be made, in each case with respect to the
Transactions, and to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested
pursuant to such applicable antitrust Law.

  

(c)  The Company and the Buyer Parties shall reasonably cooperate
with each other in connection with the making of all such filings, including
furnishing to the others such information and assistance as a party may
reasonably request in connection with its preparation of any filing or
submission that is necessary or allowable under applicable competition or
other Law or requested by any competition authorities. The Company and the
Buyer Parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to furnish to
each other all information required for any application or other filing to be
made pursuant to any Law (including all information required to be included
in the Companys disclosure documents) in connection with the Transactions. To

  the extent permitted by applicable Law or any relevant Governmental Entity,
and subject to all applicable privileges, including the attorney-client
privilege, each party hereto shall (i) give the other parties hereto prompt
notice upon obtaining knowledge of the making or commencement of any request,
inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding by or before any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger or any of the other
Transactions, (ii) keep the other parties hereto informed as to the status of
any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding and
(iii) promptly inform the other parties hereto of any material communication
to or from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice,
any foreign competition authority or any other Governmental Entity
regarding the Merger or any of the other Transactions. The parties hereto
will consult and reasonably cooperate with one another, and consider in good
faith the views of one another, in connection with, and provide to the other
parties in advance, all analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals to be made or submitted by or on
behalf of any party hereto, including reasonable access to any materials
submitted in connection with any proceedings under or relating to any
applicable federal, state or foreign competition, merger control, antitrust
or similar Law, including any proceeding under 16 C.F.R. § 803.20.

  

(d)  Any party may, as it deems advisable and necessary, reasonably
designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other parties
under this Section 6.03 as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal
counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers or directors of the recipient, unless express written
permission is obtained in advance from the source of such materials. In
addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any
Law, each party hereto will permit authorized Representatives of the other
parties to be present at each meeting or telephone conference of which such
party shall have advance notice (other than telephone conversations to the
extent they relate to administrative matters) with representatives of any
Governmental Entity relating to any such request, inquiry, investigation,
action or legal proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in
connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any
Governmental Entity in connection with any such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or proceeding.

  

(e)  Without limiting any other obligation of the Buyer Parties
hereunder, the Buyer Parties shall respond to and seek to resolve as promptly
as reasonably practicable any objection asserted by any Governmental Entity
with respect to the Transactions, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to defend any action, suit, dispute, litigation, proceeding, hearing,
arbitration or claim by or before any Governmental Entity, whether judicial
or administrative, whether brought by private parties or Governmental
Entities or officials, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions. The Buyer Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to
take such action as reasonably necessary to ensure that no Governmental Entity
enters any order, decision, Judgment, decree, ruling, injunction (preliminary
or permanent), or establishes any Law, rule, regulation or other action
preliminarily or permanently restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the
consummation of the Merger or the other Transactions, or to ensure that no
Governmental Entity with the authority to clear, authorize or otherwise
approve the consummation of the Merger, fails to do so by the Outside Date.
In the event that any action is threatened or instituted challenging the
Merger as violative of any Law, the Buyer Parties shall use their reasonable
best efforts to take such action

   as reasonably necessary to avoid or resolve such action and in the event that
any permanent or preliminary injunction or other order is entered or becomes
reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that would make
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would restrain, enjoin or otherwise
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions, the Buyer
Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to take such steps as
reasonably necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or order so
as to permit such consummation prior to the Outside Date; _provided_ , that
each of the parties hereto shall cooperate with one another in connection
with all proceedings related to the foregoing and the Buyer Parties
shall have final decision-making authority with respect thereto. The required
actions by the Buyer Parties hereunder shall include, without limitation, the
proposal, negotiation and acceptance by the Buyer Parties prior to the Outside
Date of (i) any and all divestitures of the businesses or assets of it or its
subsidiaries or its affiliates or of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, (ii) any agreement to hold any assets of the Buyer Parties or
their subsidiaries or their affiliates or of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries separate, (iii) any limitation to or modification of any
of the businesses, services or operations of the Buyer Parties or their
subsidiaries or its affiliates or, following the Closing, of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries, and (iv) any other action (including any
action that limits the freedom of action, ownership or control with respect
to, or ability to retain or hold, any of the businesses, assets, properties
or services of the Buyer Parties or their subsidiaries or their affiliates or
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries), in each case as may be
required by any applicable Governmental Entity in order to obtain approval
for the Transactions. If the Buyer Parties elect to propose, negotiate, or
offer to commit to and effect by consent decree, hold separate order, or
otherwise, any sale, divestiture, license, disposition, prohibition or
limitation or other action of a type described in the immediately preceding
sentence with respect to any assets or businesses of the Buyer Parties or any
of their Subsidiaries, or effective as of the Effective Time, the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries or the Surviving LLC or its Subsidiaries, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to, reasonably cooperate in all respects as requested by the
Buyer Parties in connection with any such sale, divestiture,
license, disposition, prohibition or limitation or other action of a type
described in the immediately preceding sentence, so long as such sale,
divestiture, license, disposition, prohibition or limitation or other action
is to be effective only as of the Effective Time.

  

(f)  Each of the Company, on the one hand, and the Buyer Parties, on
the other hand, shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and any
relevant Governmental Entity and subject to all privileges (including the
attorney-client privilege), promptly (and in any event within two (2)
Business Days) notify the other party in writing of:

  

(i)  any notice or other communication from any person alleging that
the Consent of such person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions;

  

(ii)  any action, suit, claim, investigation or proceeding commenced
or, to its knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the
Buyer Parties or any of their subsidiaries, as the case may be, that, if
pending on the date of this Agreement, would

   have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to any of the
representations and warranties contained herein, or that relate to the
consummation of the Transactions;

  

(iii)  any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement at any time during the term hereof that would reasonably be
likely to cause the conditions set forth in Article VII not to be satisfied;

  

(iv)   any notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity
in connection with the Merger;

  

(v)  in the case of the Company, any Event which, either
individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be likely
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or would reasonably be likely to
materially impair or delay the ability of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to consummate the Merger;

  

(vi)  in the case of the Buyer Parties, any change or development
that would reasonably be likely to materially impair or delay the ability of
the Buyer Parties to consummate the Merger; and

  

(vii)  any failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by
it hereunder.

  

(g)  The parties hereto agree that this Section 6.03 shall not govern
the obligations of the parties hereto with respect to obtaining the
Financing, which obligations are set forth in Section 6.06.

  

6.04   _Certain Tax Matters_. For U.S. federal income Tax purposes, the
parties agree to report and treat the Merger as a taxable sale by the Company
of all of the Companys assets to the Operating Partnership in exchange for
the Merger Consideration to be received by holders of Company Common Stock
and the assumption of all of the Companys liabilities, followed by
the Companys liquidating distribution of the Merger Consideration to its
stockholders under Sections 331, 336 and 562 of the Code. This Agreement
shall constitute a "plan of liquidation" of the Company for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes adopted by the Company Board.

  

6.05   _Benefit Plans_.

  

(a)  For a period of at least twelve (12) months following the
Effective Time, the Buyer Parties shall, and shall cause the Surviving LLC
to, provide to those individuals who are employed by the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Company
Employees_ "): (i) base compensation that is no less favorable to each Company
Employee than the base compensation provided to such Company Employee by the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time; (ii) incentive compensation
opportunities (exclusive of any equity-based compensation) that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than those available to such employees under the
Companys incentive compensation programs and arrangements as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (iii) employee benefits that,
taken as a whole, are no less favorable to such Company Employees in the
aggregate than those provided to (A) such Company Employees under the Company
Benefit Plans or (B)

   similarly situated employees of the Buyer Parties and their subsidiaries.
Such compensation and employee benefits may be provided through the Surviving
LLCs continuation of one or more of the Company Benefit Plans, through the
admission of the Company Employees to any one or more employee benefit
policies, plans or programs maintained by the Buyer Parties or their
affiliates from time to time, or through a combination of the foregoing
alternatives, as determined in the Buyer Parties sole and absolute
discretion.

  

(b)  Without limiting Section 6.05(a), for a period of at least
twelve (12) months following the Effective Time, the Buyer Parties shall, and
shall cause the Surviving LLC to, provide severance payments and benefits to
Company Employees who are not party to an employment, severance, change in
control or similar agreement that provides severance benefits, and who are
terminated by the Buyer Parties or an affiliate other than for cause (as
determined based on the Companys policies as of the date hereof), which
severance payments shall be no less favorable than the greater of (i) the
severance payments and benefits based on the Companys current policies, as
set forth on Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter and (ii) the
severance payments and benefits provided by the Buyer Parties and their
subsidiaries to similarly situated employees of the Buyer Parties and their
subsidiaries, provided that the Buyer Parties may condition such payments and
benefits upon execution by the applicable Company Employee of a commercially
standard release of claims in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer
Parties.

  

(c)  The Buyer Parties shall, or shall cause the Surviving LLC to,
assume and honor the obligations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
under each Company Benefit Plan, in accordance with their terms, subject to
the right to make amendments or modifications to the extent permitted by such
terms. The Buyer Parties hereby acknowledge that (i) the Merger will
constitute a "Change in Control" (or concept of similar import) under the
Company Benefit Plans and (ii) as a result of the Merger, the
individuals identified in Schedule 6.05(c) will be deemed to have experienced
a "Good Reason" event (or concept of similar import), as applicable, for all
purposes under the Company Benefit Plans.

  

(d)  The Buyer Parties shall, and shall cause the Surviving LLC to,
give each Company Employee full credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting,
benefit accrual and determination of the level of benefits under any employee
benefit plans or arrangements that such employees may be eligible to
participate in after the Effective Time for such Company Employees service
with the Company or any Company Subsidiary to the same extent recognized by
the Company or any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time; provided that the foregoing shall not apply (i) for benefit
accrual purposes under any defined benefit pension plan, (ii) as would result
in the duplication of benefits for the same period of service or (iii) for any
newly established plan of the Buyer Parties for which similarly situated
employees of the Buyer Parties do not receive past service credit.

  

(e)  The Buyer Parties shall, and shall cause the Surviving LLC to,
use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Company Employees
under any welfare benefit plans that such employees may be eligible to
participate in after the Effective Time, other than limitations or waiting
periods that are already in effect with

   respect to such employees and that have not been satisfied as of the
Effective Time under any welfare plan maintained for the Company Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) provide each Company
Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid in the plan year
in which the Effective Time occurs in satisfying any applicable deductible or
out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare plans in which employees are
eligible to participate after the Effective Time.

  

(f)  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board, or an
appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a
resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the
disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a covered person
of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder (" _Section 16_ ") of shares of Company Common
Stock (including Company Common Stock acquired upon the vesting of any shares
Company Restricted Stock) pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger shall be
an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16.

  

(g)  Unless the Buyer Parties request otherwise in writing, the
Company Board shall adopt resolutions terminating, effective no later than
the day prior to the Effective Time, any Company Benefit Plan which is
intended to meet the requirements of Section 401(k) of the Code, and which is
sponsored, or contributed to, by the Company or any Company Subsidiary (each,
a " _401(k) Plan_ "). At the Closing, the Company shall provide to the Buyer
Parties (a) executed resolutions of the Board of Directors of the
Company authorizing such termination, and (b) an executed amendment to the
401(k) Plan sufficient to assure compliance with all applicable requirements
of the Code and regulations thereunder so that the tax-qualified status of the
401(k) Plan will be maintained at the time of termination.

  

(h)  This Section 6.05 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the
benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section
6.05. In no event shall the terms of this Agreement be deemed to (i)
establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit Plan or any other benefit
plan, program, agreement, policy or arrangement maintained or sponsored by the
Buyer Parties, the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their
respective affiliates, (ii) alter or limit the ability of the Buyer Parties
or any of its subsidiaries (including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving
LLC or any subsidiary of the Surviving LLC) to amend, modify or terminate any
of the Company Benefit Plans or any other benefit or employment plan, program,
agreement, policy or arrangement after the Effective Time, or (iii) confer
upon any current or former employee or other service provider of the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries, any right to employment or continued employment
or continued service with the Buyer Parties or any of its subsidiaries
(including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving LLC or any subsidiary
of the Surviving LLC), or constitute or create an employment or agreement
with, or modify the at-will status of any, employee or other
service provider.

   6.06   _Financing_.

  

(a)  Unless, and to the extent, the Buyer Parties have sufficient
cash from other sources sufficient to consummate the Merger, and the other
Transactions and to pay the Merger Consideration and all other amounts
required to be paid by the Buyer Parties in connection with the consummation
of the Transactions and any other related fees and expenses, the Buyer Parties
shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Financing Documents
and in a timely manner, including (i) maintaining in effect the Financing
Documents, (ii) satisfying on a timely basis all conditions to the funding of
the Financing on the Closing Date applicable to the Buyer Parties in the
Financing Documents and the definitive agreements with respect thereto and
comply with their obligations thereunder, (iii) fully enforcing all of their
rights, and all of the obligations of the institutions parties to the
Financing Documents, under the Financing Documents and any definitive
agreements relating thereto, and (iv) causing the institutions parties to the
Financing Documents to fund the Financing at or prior to the Closing. The
Buyer Parties shall have the right from time to time to amend, replace,
supplement or otherwise modify, or waive any of their rights under, the
Financing Documents and/or substitute other debt or equity financing for all
or any portion of the Financing from the same and/or alternative financing
sources, provided that any such amendment, replacement, supplement or other
modification to or waiver of any provision of the Financing Documents and the
definitive agreements with respect thereto that amends the Financing and/or
substitution of all or any portion of the Financing shall not impose
additional conditions precedent to the Financing as set forth in the Financing
Documents that could reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay
the consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Buyer
Parties shall not amend, replace, supplement or otherwise modify or waive any
provision of the Financing Documents or the definitive agreements with
respect thereto in a manner that (A) adversely impacts the ability of the
Buyer Parties to enforce their rights against the other parties to the Equity
Commitment Agreements or the definitive agreements with respect thereto, or
(B) adversely impacts the ability of the Buyer Parties or the Company to
enforce their respective rights against the other parties to the Amended
Credit Agreement or the definitive agreements with respect thereto. The Buyer
Parties shall not release or consent to the termination of the obligations of
the Financing Sources under the Financing Documents, except for
assignments and replacements of an individual lender under the terms of or in
connection with the syndication of the Debt Financing or as otherwise
expressly contemplated by the Financing Documents. The Buyer Parties shall be
permitted to reduce the amount of Financing under the Financing Documents in
their reasonable discretion, provided that the Buyer Parties shall not reduce
the Financing to an amount committed below the amount that is required,
together with the financial resources of the Buyer Parties, including cash on
hand of the Buyer Parties and the Company, to consummate the Transactions, and
provided, further, that such reduction shall not impose additional conditions
precedent to the Financing as set forth in the Financing Documents that could
reasonably be likely to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
Transactions. If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable in
the manner or from the sources contemplated in the Financing Documents and
such portion is reasonably required to fund the Merger Consideration, the
Buyer Parties shall arrange and obtain alternative financing in an amount
sufficient to consummate the Transactions as promptly as reasonably
practicable

   following the occurrence of such event. The Buyer Parties shall promptly
provide the Company with the documentation evidencing such alternative
sources of financing, including all relevant agreements, other financing
documents and any proposed amendments or waivers thereto, and shall give the
Company prompt notice (but in any event within two (2) Business Days) of any
material breach by any party to a Commitment Letter or any termination of a
Commitment Letter. The Buyer Parties shall keep the Company reasonably
informed on a current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of their
effort to arrange the Financing.

  

(b)  For the avoidance of doubt, if the Buyer Parties fail to obtain
the Financing contemplated by the Financing Documents or any
alternative financing, the Buyer Parties shall continue to be obligated to
perform their obligations under this Agreement, including this Section 6.06,
and to consummate the Transactions on the terms contemplated hereby (subject
only to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01
and Section 7.02) unless and until this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with Article VIII. The parties hereby agree and acknowledge that, with
respect to the Buyer Parties obligations pursuant to this Section 6.06, time
is of the essence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
there shall be no cure period for any breach by the Buyer Parties of this
Section 6.06.

  

6.07   _Indemnification_.

  

(a)  The Buyer Parties agree that all rights to indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including any matters
arising in connection with the Transactions) in favor of the current or
former directors or officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as
provided in the Companys Organizational Documents, and the Organizational
Documents of the Company Subsidiaries, and any indemnification or other
agreements of the Company (in each case, as in effect on the date of this
Agreement) shall be assumed by the Surviving LLC in the Merger, without
further action, at the Effective Time, and shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to any claims
against such directors or officers arising out of such acts or omissions (and
until such later date as such claims and proceedings arising therefrom shall
be finally disposed of), and from and after the Effective Time the Buyer
Parties shall ensure that the Surviving LLC complies with and honors the
foregoing obligations.

  

(b)  The Buyer Parties shall cause to be maintained for a period of
not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time (and until such later
time as any proceedings commenced during such period shall be finally disposed
of) the Companys current directors and officers insurance and
indemnification policies ( _provided_ that the Buyer Parties may substitute
therefor policies with reputable and financially sound carriers of at least
the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no
less favorable to the Indemnified Parties) with respect to events occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") for all persons who
are currently covered by such DandO Insurance, so long as the annual premium
therefor would not be in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid prior
to the date of this Agreement (such 300% amount, the " _Maximum Premium_ ");
provided that (i) if the annual premiums for such DandO Insurance exceed the
Maximum Premium, the Buyer Parties shall

  maintain the most favorable policies of directors and officers insurance
obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium and (ii) the
Buyer Parties may satisfy their obligations under this Section 6.07(b) by
causing the Company to obtain, on or prior to the Closing Date, prepaid (or
"tail") directors and officers liability insurance policy at the Buyer
Parties expense, the material terms of which, including coverage and amount,
are no less favorable to such directors and officers than the insurance
coverage otherwise required under this Section 6.07(b).

  

(c)  From and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, the Buyer Parties shall and shall cause the Surviving LLC
to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses
to, the present and former officers and directors of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries and any employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
who acts as a fiduciary under any Company Benefit Plan (each an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement (in the case of settlements,
with the approval of the indemnifying party (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld)) (collectively, " _Losses_ "), as incurred (payable
monthly upon written request, which request shall include reasonable evidence
of the Losses set forth therein) to the extent arising from, relating to, or
otherwise in respect of, any actual or threatened action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, in respect of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time in connection with such Indemnified Partys duties as an
officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, including in
respect of this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions, or as a
fiduciary under any Company Benefit Plan; provided, however, that (i) an
Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to indemnification under this Section
6.07(c) for Losses arising out of actions or omissions by the Indemnified
Party (A) constituting a material breach of this Agreement or (B) which were
material to the matter giving rise to the proceeding and (1) were committed
in bad faith or (2) were the result of active and deliberate dishonesty, (C)
which resulted in the actual receipt of an improper benefit in money, property
or services or (D) with respect to any criminal proceeding, the Indemnified
Party had reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful, and
(ii) any person to whom expenses are to be advanced has provided an
affirmation that the standards in the immediately foregoing clause (i) have
been satisfied and an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined by final adjudication that such person is not entitled to
indemnification. If any action, suit, proceeding or investigation is brought
against any Indemnified Party in which indemnification or advancement of
expenses could be sought by such Indemnified Party under this Section 6.07(c),
the Surviving LLC shall have the right to control the defense thereof after
the Effective Time, provided, however, that, none of the Buyer Parties nor
the Surviving LLC shall (and the Buyer Parties shall cause the Surviving LLC
not to) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or
otherwise terminate any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation of a
covered person for which indemnification may be sought under this Section
6.07(c) unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an
unconditional release of such person from all liability arising out of such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation or such person otherwise
consents.

  

(d)  This Section 6.07 is intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective
heirs and legal representatives. The rights

  provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights
to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract
or otherwise.

  

(e)  In the event that, the Buyer Parties or the Surviving LLC or any
of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of their properties and assets to any person, or if the
Buyer Parties dissolve the Surviving LLC then, and in each such case, the
Buyer Parties shall cause the successors and assigns of the Buyer Parties
or the Surviving LLC, as applicable, to assume the obligations of the Buyer
Parties or the Surviving LLC, as applicable, set forth in this Section 6.07.

  

(f)  The Buyer Parties shall pay all reasonable expenses, including
reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in
enforcing the indemnity, advancement and other obligations provided in this
Section 6.07.

  

6.08   _Fees and Expenses_.

  

(a)  Except as provided below, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions shall
be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the
Merger is consummated.

  

(b)  If this Agreement is terminated:

  

(i)  by (A) the Buyer Parties pursuant to Section 8.01(d) or (B) the
Company pursuant to Section 8.01(f), then the Company shall pay to the Buyer
Parties (or an affiliate of the Buyer Parties designated in writing by the
Buyer Parties to the Company) in immediately available funds a termination
fee equal to $16,500,000 (the " _Company Termination Fee_ "). The Company
Termination Fee shall be payable (1) two (2) Business Days following the
termination of this Agreement by the Buyer Parties pursuant to
Section 8.01(d), or (2) concurrently with the termination of this Agreement
by the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(f).

  

(ii)  by the Buyer Parties or the Company pursuant to Section
8.01(b)(i) or Section 8.01(b)(iii), and in any such case, (A) after
the execution of this Agreement and prior to any such termination, a Company
Takeover Proposal is made to the Company or any person has publicly announced
an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a Company Takeover Proposal
(and such Company Takeover Proposal or publicly announced intention shall not
have been publicly withdrawn without qualification before such
termination) and (B) the Company, either (1) within nine (9) months after the
termination of this Agreement, consummates a transaction regarding a Company
Takeover Proposal (which need not be the same Company Takeover Proposal
referred to in clause (A) above), or (2) within nine (9) months after
termination of this Agreement, executes a definitive agreement which is later
consummated (which consummation may occur either during or after such nine
(9) month period) with respect to, a Company Takeover Proposal (which need not
be the same Company Takeover Proposal referred to in clause (A) above), then
the Company shall pay to the Buyer Parties (or an affiliate of

   the Buyer Parties designated in writing by the Buyer Parties to the Company)
in immediately available funds the Company Termination Fee not later than the
consummation of such transaction arising from such Company Takeover Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this Section 6.08(b)(ii), the
references to "twenty percent (20%)" in the definition of Company Takeover
Proposal shall each be deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%)".

  

(c)  If this Agreement is terminated:

  

(i)  by the Buyer Parties or the Company pursuant to Section
8.01(b)(i) or Section 8.01(b)(ii) and, in any such case, at the time of such
termination (A) the condition set forth in Section 7.01(b) has not been
satisfied due to a Judgment resulting from an action, suit or proceeding
brought by a Governmental Entity (other than with respect to any federal or
state securities laws applicable to the Company), and (B) all of the other
conditions set forth in Section 7.01 and Section 7.02 have been satisfied
(except those conditions that by their terms cannot be satisfied until the
Closing, provided that such conditions are then capable of being satisfied),
then the Buyer Parties shall pay to the Company (or an affiliate of the
Company designated in writing by the Company to the Buyer Parties) in
immediately available funds a termination fee equal to $40,000,000 (the "
_Reverse Termination Fee_ "), no later than two (2) Business Days following
such termination.

  

(ii)  by the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(e) (as a result of the
Buyer Parties or Merger Subs material breach of their obligations under
Section 6.03 or Section 6.06), and at the time of such termination all of the
other conditions set forth in Section 7.01 and Section 7.02 have been
satisfied (except those conditions that by their terms cannot be satisfied
until the Closing, provided that such conditions are then capable of being
satisfied), then the Buyer Parties shall pay to the Company (or an
affiliate of the Company designated in writing by the Company to the Buyer
Parties) in immediately available funds the Reverse Termination Fee, no later
than two (2) Business Days following such termination.

  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Buyer Parties agree that in the event that the Company Termination Fee
becomes payable pursuant to Section 6.08(b) and is paid in full in accordance
therewith, such payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of each member of the Buyer Group against all members of the
Company Group, at law or in equity or otherwise, with respect to (i) any loss
or damage suffered, directly or indirectly, as a result of the failure of the
Transactions to be consummated, (ii) the termination of this Agreement, (iii)
any liabilities or obligations arising under this Agreement, or (iv) any
claims or actions arising out of or relating to any breach, termination or
failure of or under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in
this Section 6.08(d) shall limit the right of the Buyer Parties (A) prior to
termination (but not after termination) of this Agreement to bring or maintain
any claim, suit, action or proceeding for injunction, specific performance or
other equitable relief as expressly provided for and subject to the
limitations in Section 9.11; _provided _ that under no circumstances shall
the Buyer Parties be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance of the obligation

  to close contemplated by Section 9.11 and all or any portion of the Company
Termination Fee; or (B) to bring or maintain any claim, suit, action or
proceeding against the Company arising out of or in connection with any breach
of the Confidentiality Agreement. The Buyer Parties further agree that in no
event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee
on more than one occasion, whether or not such Company Termination Fee may be
payable under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at
different times or upon the occurrence of different events.

  

(e)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Company agrees that in the event that the Reverse Termination Fee becomes
payable pursuant to Section 6.08(c) and is paid in full in accordance
therewith, such payment of the Reverse Termination Fee shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of each member of the Company Group against all members of
the Buyer Group, at law or in equity or otherwise, with respect to (i) any
loss or damage suffered, directly or indirectly, as a result of the
failure of the Transactions to be consummated, (ii) the termination of this
Agreement, (iii) any liabilities or obligations arising under this Agreement,
or (iv) any claims or actions arising out of or relating to any breach,
termination or failure of or under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.08(e) shall limit the right of the
Company (A) prior to termination (but not after termination) of this
Agreement to bring or maintain any claim, suit, action or proceeding for
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief as expressly
provided for and subject to the limitations in Section 9.11; _provided_  that
under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive
both a grant of specific performance of the obligation to close contemplated
by Section 9.11 and all or any portion of the Reverse Termination Fee; or (B)
to bring or maintain any claim, suit, action or proceeding against the Buyer
Parties arising out of or in connection with any breach of the
Confidentiality Agreement. The Company further agrees that in no event shall
the Buyer Parties be required to pay the Reverse Termination Fee on more than
one occasion, whether or not such Reverse Termination Fee may be payable under
more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times
or upon the occurrence of different events.

  

(f)  The Company Termination Fee and the Reverse Termination Fee
payable pursuant to this Section 6.08 shall be made by wire transfer of same
day funds. The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
Section 6.08 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, none of the Company or the
Buyer Parties would enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if (i) the
Company fails to promptly pay the amount due by the Company pursuant to
Section 6.08(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, any of the Buyer
Parties commences a suit which results in a binding nonappealable
judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction against the Company
for the fee or other amounts set forth in Section 6.08(b), the Company shall
pay to the Buyer Parties their reasonable costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, and (ii) the Buyer
Parties fail to promptly pay the amount due by the Buyer Parties pursuant to
Section 6.08(c), and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company commences
a suit which results in a binding nonappealable judgment rendered by a court
of competent jurisdiction against the Buyer Parties for the fee set forth in
Section 6.08(c), the Buyer Parties shall pay to the Company its reasonable
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with
such suit. In addition, if the Buyer Parties or the Company

  fails to promptly pay the amount due by such party pursuant to this Section
6.08, interest shall accrue on such amount from the date such payment was
required to be paid pursuant to the terms of this Agreement until the date of
payment at a rate per annum equal to three (3) percent plus the prime interest
rate published in _The Wall Street Journal_ on the date such interest begins
accruing.

  

(g)  If the Company or the Buyer Parties are required to make a
Termination Payment, then such Termination Payment shall be paid into the
Escrow Account on the date such payment is required to be paid pursuant to
Section 6.08 by wire transfer of immediately available funds. The amount
payable to the Termination Payment Recipient in any tax year of such
Termination Payment Recipient shall not exceed the sum of (A) the maximum
amount that can be paid to such Termination Payment Recipient without causing
such Termination Payment Recipient to fail to meet the requirements of
Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the relevant tax year,
determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income
described in Sections 856(c)(2) or 856(c) (3) of the Code
("Qualifying Income") and such Termination Payment Recipient has $1,000,000
of income from unknown sources during such year which is not Qualifying
Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income which is not Qualifying
Income), in each case, as determined by such Termination Payment Recipients
independent accountants, plus (B) in the event such Termination Payment
Recipient receives either (I) a letter from its counsel indicating that such
Termination Payment Recipient has received a ruling from the IRS as described
in Section 6.08(h) or (II) an opinion from such Termination Payment
Recipients outside counsel as described in Section 6.08(h), an amount equal
to the excess of the applicable Termination Payment less the amounts paid
under clause (A) above.

  

(h)  The Escrow Agreement shall provide that the Termination Payment
in the Escrow Account or any portion thereof shall not be released to the
Termination Payment Recipient unless the Escrow Agent receives any one or
combination of the following: (A) a letter from the Termination Payment
Recipients independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be
paid by the escrow agent to such Termination Payment Recipient without
causing such Termination Payment Recipient to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the
payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income and such
Termination Payment Recipient has $1,000,000 of income from unknown sources
during such year which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or
anticipated income which is not Qualifying Income), in which case the Escrow
Agent shall release such amount to such Termination Payment Recipient, or (B)
a letter from such Termination Payment Recipients counsel indicating that
(I) such Termination Payment Recipient received a ruling from the IRS holding
that the receipt by the Termination Payment Recipient of the applicable
Termination Payment would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be
excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3)
of the Code or (II) such Termination Payment Recipients outside counsel has
rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by such Termination
Payment Recipient of the applicable Termination Payment should either
constitute Qualifying Income or should be excluded from gross income within
the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, in which case the
Escrow Agent shall release the remainder of the applicable Termination Payment
to the Termination Payment Recipient. Each of the Company and the Buyer
Parties agrees to amend

  Section 6.08(g) and this Section 6.08(h) and the Escrow Agreement at the
reasonable request of the Termination Payment Recipient in order to (x)
maximize the portion of the Termination Payment that may be distributed from
the Escrow Account to the Termination Payment Recipient hereunder
without causing such Termination Payment Recipient to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (y) improve such
Termination Payment Recipients chances of securing a favorable ruling
described in this Section 6.08(h) or (z) assist such Termination Payment
Recipient in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its outside counsel as
described in this Section 6.08(h). Any amount of the Termination Payment that
remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable year shall be paid as soon as
possible during the following taxable year, subject to the foregoing
limitations of this Section 6.08(h).

  

(i)  Parent and the Company acknowledge and agree that in no event
shall the sum of all disbursements from the Escrow Account pursuant to
Section 6.08(g), Section 6.08(h) and the Escrow Agreement (without giving
effect to any interest earned on the amounts deposited with the Escrow
Agreement, which interest shall be paid to the Termination Payment Recipient)
exceed the amount of the applicable Termination Payment.

  

6.09   _Public Announcements_. The parties hereto agree that the initial
press release to be issued with respect to the Merger shall be in the form
heretofore agreed upon by the parties hereto. Subject to Section 5.03, the
Buyer Parties, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall
consult with each other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity

9.04   _Interpretation; Exhibits and Disclosure Letters_. The headings
contained in this Agreement or in any Exhibit hereto or the Company
Disclosure Letter and in the table of contents to this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Any capitalized terms used in any Exhibit or the Company
Disclosure Letter, but not otherwise defined therein, shall have the meaning
as defined in this Agreement. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
an Article, Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section or
Article of, or an Exhibit to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.
Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation". The words "hereof", "hereto", "hereby", "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
The term "or" is not exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the
extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and
such phrase shall not mean

  simply "if". The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to
the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms. Any matter disclosed
pursuant to any Section of the Company Disclosure Letter whose relevance or
applicability to any representation or warranty made elsewhere in this
Agreement is reasonably apparent on its face shall be deemed to be disclosed
with respect to such Sections of such Company Disclosure Letter,
notwithstanding the omission of a reference or cross-reference thereto. Any
agreement or instrument defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or
instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement or instrument as
from time to time amended, modified or supplemented. References to a person
are also to its permitted successors and assigns. References to matters
disclosed in the Filed Company SEC Documents are made without giving effect to
any amendment to any such Filed Company SEC Document that is filed on or
after the date that is three (3) Business Days prior to the date hereof and
exclude any disclosures set forth in any risk factor section, sections
relating to forward looking statements and any other disclosures included in
such Filed Company SEC Documents that constitute predictive, cautionary or
forward-looking statements. For all purposes of this Agreement: (i) any
notice given to Parent shall constitute notice given to each of the Buyer
Parties, (ii) a consent given by Parent shall constitute a consent given by
each of the Buyer Parties and (iii) a delivery to or the making of a document
available to Parent shall constitute delivery to or the making of such
document available to each of the Buyer Parties.

  

9.05   _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is determined to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any
rule or Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that Transactions are fulfilled to the extent
possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties intend that the rights,
limitations and remedies contained in Sections 5.03 and 6.08 and Article 8 be
construed as integral provisions of this Agreement and that such rights,
limitations and remedies shall not be severable in any manner that restricts
a partys remedies or rights under this Agreement.

  

9.06   _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by facsimile or by "PDF" e-mail transmission), all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties hereto and delivered to the other parties hereto.

  

9.07   _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,
taken together with the Exhibits hereto, the Company Disclosure Letter and
the Confidentiality Agreement, (a) constitute the entire agreement, and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties hereto with respect to the Transactions and (b) except for
(i) Section 6.07, (ii) only with respect to holders of record of the Company
Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, and only after the
Effective Time, for the provisions set forth in Article II, and (iii) only
with respect to holders of Company Restricted Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and only at and after the Effective Time, for the provisions
set forth in Section 2.01(c), are not intended to confer upon any person
other than the

  parties hereto any rights or remedies, whether as third-party
beneficiaries or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall
be entitled to pursue damages on behalf of its stockholders as provided in
Section 9.11(b).

  

9.08   _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Maryland, regardless
of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of
conflicts of laws thereof.

  

9.09   _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, and any purported
assignment without such consent shall be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Buyer Parties shall be permitted, without the consent of any other party
hereto, to (a) assign all or any of their rights and obligations under this
Agreement to one or more subsidiaries of the Buyer Parties, and (b) make a
collateral assignment to any of the Financing Sources in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that no such
assignment shall (i) relieve the assigning party of its obligations under
this Agreement, (ii) enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any
other party hereto or due to such assigning party or (iii) be permitted if
such assignment would reasonably be likely to prevent, impair or delay the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.
Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns.

  

9.10   _Consents and Approvals_. For any matter under this Agreement
requiring the consent or approval of any party to be valid and binding on the
parties hereto, such consent or approval must be in writing and executed and
delivered to the other parties hereto by a person duly authorized by such
party to do so.

  

9.11   _Enforcement_.

  

(a)  The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to seek an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
For the avoidance of doubt, the rights of the Company under this Section 9.11
shall include the right to cause the Buyer Parties to consummate the Merger
and the Transactions following satisfaction of all of the conditions in
Sections 7.01 and 7.02 (except those conditions that by their terms cannot be
satisfied until the Closing, provided that such conditions are then capable of
being satisfied).

  

(b)  Notwithstanding Section 9.11(a), it is acknowledged and agreed
that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance of the Buyer
Parties obligations pursuant to the terms of Sections 6.06(a)(iii) and
6.06(a)(iv) of this Agreement with respect to the institutions parties to the
Financing Documents only in the event that each of the following conditions
has been satisfied: (i) all of the conditions in Sections 7.01 and 7.02 shall
have been

  satisfied (except those conditions that by their terms cannot be satisfied
until the Closing, provided that such conditions are then capable of being
satisfied), (ii) in the case of an action for specific performance with
respect to the institutions parties to the Equity Commitment Agreements, the
Debt Financing has been funded, is reasonably expected to be or will be
funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing, and
(iii) the Company has confirmed in a written notice to the Buyer Parties that
if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt
Financing are funded, then the Closing will occur, and that it is willing to
waive any unsatisfied conditions in Section 7.03. For the avoidance of doubt,
(A) in no event shall the Company be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce
specifically the Buyer Parties obligations to cause the Equity Financing to
be funded or to complete the Merger if the Debt Financing has not been funded
(or is not reasonably expected to be or will not be funded at the Closing if
the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing), and (B) in the event that the
Company (or the Buyer Parties) receives a grant of specific performance
pursuant to this Section 9.11 and the Closing occurs, the Company (or the
Buyer Parties) will be deemed to have waived any and all rights to pursue and
recover all or any portion of the Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to Section
6.08(c) (or in the case of the Buyer Parties, the Company Termination Fee
pursuant to Section 6.08(b) and any other remedy as a matter of law, contract,
tort, equity or otherwise (for money damages or otherwise) upon such receipt
of specific performance.

  

(c)  Subject to Section 6.08(e), the Company may pursue any other
remedy available to it at law or in equity, including monetary damages, which
damages the Buyer Parties agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of
expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and shall include the benefit of the bargain
lost by the Companys stockholders (determined by reference to the total
amount that would have been recoverable by the Companys stockholders if all
such stockholders brought an action against the Buyer Parties and were
recognized as third party beneficiaries hereunder); _provided_ that, subject
to Section 9.07, it is agreed that neither this provision nor any other
provision in this Agreement is intended to provide the Companys stockholders
(or any party acting on their behalf other than the Company) the ability to
seek (whether in its capacity as a stockholder or purporting to assert any
right (derivatively or otherwise) on behalf of the Company) the enforcement
of, or directly seek any remedies pursuant to, this Agreement, or otherwise
create any rights in the Companys stockholders under this Agreement or
otherwise, including against the Company or its directors, under any theory
of law or equity, including under the applicable Laws of agency or the Laws
relating to the rights and obligations of third party beneficiaries. For the
avoidance of doubt as to the parties intent, the determination of whether
and how to terminate, amend, make any waiver or consent under, or enforce this
Agreement, and whether and how (if applicable) to distribute any damages
award to its stockholders, shall exclusively belong to the Company (acting
expressly through its Company Board) in its sole discretion.

  

(d)  In addition, each of the parties hereto (i) irrevocably submits
itself to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Maryland
or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction over the matter is vested
in the federal courts, any federal court located in the State of Maryland in
the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any Transaction, (ii)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (iii) agrees that
it will not bring any action relating to this

  Agreement or any Transaction in any court other than a state court in the
State of Maryland or, if a state court in the State of Maryland lacks subject
matter jurisdiction, any federal court sitting in the State of Maryland and
(iv) waives any right to trial by jury with respect to any suit, action or
proceeding directly or indirectly related to or arising out of this Agreement
or any Transaction.

  

9.12   _No Recourse to Financing Sources._ Notwithstanding any provision
of this Agreement, the Company agrees (on its behalf and on behalf of the
Company Subsidiaries and JV Entities and its and their respective affiliates)
that none of the Financing Sources shall have any liability or obligation to
the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the JV Entities or any of their
respective affiliates relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Financing); _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing in this Section 9.12 shall limit the rights of the Company against
Parent or Merger Sub hereunder or limit any liability of any of the parties
to this Agreement for breaches of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
This Section 9.12 is intended to benefit and may be enforced by the Financing
Sources and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the Company.
