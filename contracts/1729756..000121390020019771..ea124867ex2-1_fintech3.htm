the part of any Acquiror Stockholder, each share of Acquiror Common Stock (an
" _Acquiror Common Share_ ") that is issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than any Excluded Shares, which shall not
constitute " _Acquiror Common Shares_ " hereunder), shall thereupon be
converted into, and the holder of such Acquiror Common Share shall be entitled
to receive, the Per Share Merger Consideration for such Acquiror Common
Share. All of the shares of Acquiror Common Stock converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article III_
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate previously
representing any such shares of Acquiror Common Stock shall thereafter cease
to have any rights with respect to such securities, except the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration into which such shares of Acquiror
Common Stock shall have been converted in the Merger.

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Holdings or Merger Sub, each share of common stock, par value

thereupon be converted into and become one share of common stock, par value
$0.0001 per share, of the Surviving Company.

  



  

(c) At the Effective Time, without any action on the part of any holder of
Excluded Shares, each Excluded Share shall be surrendered and cancelled and

exchange therefor.

  



  

3.02 _Delivery of Per Share Merger Consideration_. The holders of such
Acquiror Common Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i)
the Per Share Merger Consideration into which such Acquiror Common Shares have
been converted pursuant to _Section 3.01(a) _ and (ii) any cash in lieu of
fractional shares which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to
_Section 3.04_ plus dividends declared after the Effective Time which are
unpaid, if any. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.02_
, each Acquiror Common Share shall be deemed at any time from and after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Per Share Merger Consideration which the holders of Acquiror Common Shares
were entitled to receive in respect of such shares pursuant to this _Section
3.02_ (and cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 3.04 _ plus
any dividends declared after the Effective Time which are unpaid, if any).

Acquiror Warrant that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, pursuant to and in accordance with Section 4.4 of the Warrant
Agreement, automatically and irrevocably be modified to provide that such
Acquiror Warrant shall no longer entitle the holder thereof to purchase the
amount of share(s) of Acquiror Common Stock set forth therein and in
substitution thereof such Acquiror Warrant shall entitle the holder thereof
to acquire such equal number of Holdings Common Share(s) per
Acquiror Warrant.

  



  

3.04 _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing fractional
Holdings Common Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates of Acquiror Common Stock, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a
stockholder of Holdings. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of Acquiror Common Shares converted pursuant to the
Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of
Holdings Common Share shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash, without interest,
in an amount equal to such fractional part of a Holdings Common Share
multiplied by ten U.S. dollars ($10).

Company Closing Cash Consideration such amounts as are required to be deducted

applicable tax Law. Any sum which is withheld as permitted by this _Section
4.07_ shall be remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority and
Holdings shall provide Seller and Blocker Seller with all appropriate or
required reports showing such withholding. As of the date hereof, Holdings is
not aware of any such withholding obligation. Upon becoming aware of any such
withholding obligation, Holdings shall promptly provide Seller or Blocker
Seller, as applicable, with written notice (which notice shall describe the
basis for such deduction or withholding), and shall provide Seller and Blocker
Seller, as applicable, with a reasonable opportunity to provide such forms,
certificates or other evidence, and reasonably cooperate with Seller and
Blocker Seller, as applicable, to eliminate or reduce any such required
deduction or withholding. Subject to the foregoing, to the extent that

Except with respect to matters set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedules
(it being agreed that any matter disclosed in the Company Disclosure
Schedules with respect to any section of this Agreement shall be deemed to
have been disclosed with respect to any other section to the extent the
applicability thereto is reasonably apparent from the face of such
disclosure), the Company hereby represents and warrants to each Acquiror
Party as of the date of this Agreement:

Company Entity is licensed or qualified to do business, and each Company
Entity is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing

operation of its business as currently conducted makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except such licenses or qualifications the
absence of which would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. _Section 5.01_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules sets forth all of
the Company's Subsidiaries, and the Company directly or indirectly owns 100%
of the outstanding membership and other equity interests of such
Subsidiaries, free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than Permitted

other Person other than the Subsidiaries set forth on _Section 5.01_ of the

Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement to which it is a party and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby and

other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to
authorize the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, any
Ancillary Agreement to which it is a party or to consummate the Transactions.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company, and
(assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by each other party
hereto) this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
except as the enforceability hereof may be limited by any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or
other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally
and as limited by the availability of specific performance and other

proceeding at law or in equity). When each Ancillary Agreement to which the
Company is or will be a party has been duly executed and delivered by the
Company (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by each other
party thereto), such Ancillary Agreement will constitute a legal and
binding obligation of the Company enforceable against it in accordance with
its terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by any
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
conveyance or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors'
rights generally and as limited by the availability of specific performance

in any respect, and no withdrawal, termination, amendment or modification is
contemplated by Acquiror. Each Subscription Agreement is a legal, valid and

aggregate, not less advantageous to the directors and officers of the Company
as the Company's existing policies with respect to claims arising out of or
relating to events which occurred before or at the Effective Time (including
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (the " _D

Acquiror Transaction Expense, _provided_ , that (i) Acquiror shall not be
responsible for an amount in excess of 300% of the annual premium

organizational documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any individual who, at or
prior to the Effective Time, was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who, at the request of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, served as a director, officer, member, trustee or
fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension
or other employee benefit plan or enterprise (collectively, with such
individual's heirs, executors or administrators, the " _Indemnified Persons_
") with respect to all acts and omissions arising out of such individuals'
services as officers, directors, employees or agents of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or as trustees or fiduciaries of any plan for the benefit of
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, including the execution of, and the transactions
contemplated by, this Agreement. Without limitation of the foregoing, in the
event that any such Indemnified Person is or becomes involved, in any
capacity, in any action, proceeding or investigation in connection with any
matter for which indemnification is available pursuant to the foregoing
sentence, including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
Holdings, from and after the Effective Time, shall pay, as incurred, such
Indemnified Person's legal and other expenses (including the cost of any
investigation and preparation) incurred in connection therewith, within
thirty (30) days after any request for advancement (including attorneys' fees
which may be incurred by any Indemnified Person in enforcing this _Section
9.06_ ), subject to receipt of an undertaking from such Indemnified Person to
repay such advancement if such Indemnified Person is ultimately determined to
not be entitled to indemnification hereunder.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, the obligations of the
Company, Holdings and Acquiror contained in this _Section 9.06_ shall be
binding upon the successors and assigns of the Company, Holdings and Acquiror.
In the event the Company, Holdings or Acquiror, or any of their respective
successors or assigns, (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person,
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties or assets to any
Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Company, Holdings or Acquiror, as the case may
be, honor the indemnification and other obligations set forth in this
_Section 9.06_.

  



  

(d) On the Closing Date, Holdings shall enter into customary indemnification
agreements reasonably satisfactory to Seller with the individuals set forth
on _Section 9.06(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules, which
indemnification agreements shall continue to be effective following the
Closing.

  



  

(e) This _Section 9.06_ shall survive the consummation of the Transactions,
is intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by each Indemnified Person
and their respective successors, heirs and representatives, and shall not be
amended in any manner that is adverse to an Indemnified Person without the
prior written consent of Seller.

9.07 _Proxy Statement; Acquiror Stockholders' Meeting_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable, but in no event more than five (5)
Business Days, after the date of this Agreement, Acquiror and Holdings shall,
in consultation with the Company, prepare and file with the SEC the Form S-4,
which shall include the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, for the purposes of (i)
registering under the Securities Act the Holdings Common Shares issuable
hereunder, (ii) providing Acquiror's stockholders with the opportunity to
redeem their Acquiror Class A Common Stock in connection with the Transactions
and (iii) soliciting proxies from Acquiror Stockholders to obtain the
requisite approval of the transactions contemplated hereby and the other
matters to be voted on at a meeting of the holders of Acquiror Common Stock
to be called and held for such purpose (the " _Acquiror Stockholders '
Meeting_"). As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, Acquiror and Holdings shall, in consultation with the Company,
prepare and file any other filings required under, and in accordance
with, the Exchange Act, the Securities Act, the applicable NASDAQ listing
rules or any other Laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby
(collectively, the " _Other Filings_ "). Holdings or Acquiror, as applicable,
shall notify the Company promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the
SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff or any other
Governmental Authority for amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any Other Filing or for additional information.
As promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, Holdings or Acquiror, as
applicable, shall provide the Company and its counsel with copies of all
written correspondence between Holdings, Acquiror or any of their
representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or its staff or other
government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the Form S-4 or the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any Other Filing. Holdings and Acquiror shall
permit the Company and its counsel to review the Form S-4, the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and any exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto and
shall consult with the Company and its advisors, in good faith,
concerning any comments from the SEC with respect thereto, and shall
reasonably consider and take into account the reasonable
suggestions, comments or opinions of the Company and its advisors, and shall
not file the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any exhibits,
amendments or supplements thereto or any response letters to any comments from
the SEC without the prior written consent of the Company, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided, however_ , that
Holdings or Acquiror, as applicable, shall be permitted to make such filing
or response in the absence of such consent if the basis of the Company's
failure to consent is the Company's unwillingness to permit the inclusion in
such filing or response of information that, based on the advice of outside
counsel to Acquiror, is required by the SEC and United States securities Laws
to be included therein. Whenever any event occurs which would reasonably be
expected to result in the Form S-4 or Proxy Statement/Prospectus
containing any untrue statement of a material fact or omitting to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, Holdings, Acquiror
or the Company, as the case may be, shall promptly inform the other parties
of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the SEC or its staff or any
other government officials, and/or mailing to stockholders of Acquiror, an
amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 or Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

  



  

   

67

 



    



  

(b) The Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be sent to the Acquiror Stockholders
as soon as practicable following the SEC Clearance Date (but in any event,
within three (3) Business Days following such date) for the purpose of
soliciting proxies from holders of Acquiror Common Stock to vote at the
Acquiror Stockholders' Meeting in favor of: (i) the adoption of this
Agreement and the approval of the Merger and other transactions contemplated
hereby; (ii) approval of material differences between the Holdings Revised
Charter and the Certificate of Incorporation; (iii) approval of the Holdings
equity compensation plan in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit F_ , which
provides for 8,800,000 Holdings Common Shares to be reserved for issuance
(the " _Holdings Equity Compensation Plan_ "), (iv) approval of any
matters as agreed by Acquiror and the Company and (v) the adjournment of the
_Acquiror_ Stockholders' Meeting (the matters described in clauses (i)
through (v), shall be referred to as the " _Voting Matters_ " and approval of
the Voting Matters by the Acquiror Stockholders at the _Acquiror_
Stockholders' Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof shall be
referred to as the " _Acquiror Stockholder Approval_ "). Acquiror shall keep
the Company reasonably informed regarding all matters relating to the Voting
Matters and the Aquiror Stockholders' Meeting, including by promptly
furnishing any voting or proxy solicitation reports received by Acquiror in
respect of such matters and similar updates regarding any redemptions.

  



  

(c) The Company shall provide _Acquiror_ and Holdings, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, with such information concerning the Company
Entities as may be necessary for the information concerning the Company
Entities in the Form S-4, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Other
Filings to comply with all applicable provisions of and rules under the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the DGCL in connection with the
preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the
solicitation of proxies thereunder, the calling and holding of the Acquiror
Stockholders' Meeting and the preparation and filing of the Other Filings. The
information relating to the Company Entities furnished by or on behalf of the
Company Entities for inclusion in the Form S-4 and the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus will not, as of the date of mailing of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to the holders of Acquiror Common Stock, as of the
Effective Date or at the time of the Acquiror Stockholders' Meeting, contain
any statement which, at such time and in light of the circumstances under
which it is made, is false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein not false or misleading. Without
limiting the foregoing, Acquiror and Holdings shall use their reasonable best
efforts to ensure that the Form S-4 and Proxy Statement/Prospectus do not, as
of the date on which the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is distributed to the
holders of Acquiror Common Stock, as of the Effective Date, and as of the
date of the Acquiror Stockholders' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading ( _provided_ that Acquiror and Holdings shall not be
responsible for the accuracy or completeness of any information relating to
the Company or any other information furnished in writing by any Company
Entity for inclusion in the Form S-4 or Proxy Statement/Prospectus).

(d) With respect to any Acquiror Stockholder outreach in connection with the

Entities shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause their
Affiliates and Representatives, including legal and accounting

shall include, among other things, (i) furnishing Acquiror reasonably

customary for such outreach activities, (ii) causing each of their
Representatives with appropriate seniority and expertise to participate in a
reasonable number of virtual meetings (including customary one-on-one

the preparation of marketing materials and similar documents required in
connection with any such outreach activities, (iv) providing reasonable
assistance to Acquiror in connection with the preparation of pro forma
financial information to be included in any marketing materials to be used in
any outreach activities, and (v) cooperating with requests for due diligence
to the extent customary and reasonable.

  



  

(e) Subject to the fiduciary duties of its board of directors (i) Acquiror
shall include in the Proxy Statement the unanimous recommendation of
its board of directors that the holders of Acquiror Common Stock vote in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger and
the other Voting Matters, and shall otherwise take all lawful action to
solicit and obtain the Acquiror Stockholder Approval and (ii) neither
Acquiror's board of directors nor any committee thereof shall withdraw or
modify, or publicly propose or resolve to withdraw or modify in a manner
adverse to the Company, the recommendation of Acquiror's board of
directors that the Acquiror Stockholders vote in favor of the Voting Matters.

9.11 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_. The parties agree that for
income tax purposes (i) the Company shall make an election under Code
Section 754 (and any corresponding state Tax election) for its first taxable
year and (ii) to the extent permitted by applicable Tax Law, the first
taxable year of the Company shall begin on the day immediately following the
Closing Date, and Holdings and its Affiliates shall not, and shall cause the
Company to not, take any action, or permit any action to be taken, that may
prevent this result. In the event the Company is required to file any Pass-
Through Income Tax Return for a Tax period that includes the Closing Date (a
" _Straddle Return_ "), Holdings shall prepare or cause to be prepared and
timely file or cause to be timely filed such Straddle Return. In preparing
any such Straddle Returns (i) items of taxable income, gain, loss, deduction

the "closing of the books" method (as described in Treasury Regulations
Section 1.706-1(c)) as of the end of the Closing Date, (ii) the Company shall
deduct the Company Transaction Expenses to the maximum extent permitted by
Law and shall allocate any such deductions to the portion of such Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date pursuant to Section 706 of the Code, and
(iii) seventy percent (70%) of any success-based fees shall be deducted in
accordance with Rev. Proc. 2011-29. At least thirty (30) days prior to the due
date for filing such Straddle Returns, Holdings shall deliver drafts to
Seller of any such Straddle Returns for Seller's review and consent. Holdings
shall cause such Straddle Returns to reflect any reasonable comments of
Seller to the extent such comments relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

  



  

(b) Filing and Amendment of Tax Returns. Without the prior written consent of
Seller, Holdings shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to not: (i)
except as set forth in _Section 9.11(a)_ , file or amend any Pass-Through
Income Tax Return of any Company Entity relating to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period, (ii) engage in any voluntary disclosure or similar process or initiate
communications with any Tax authority with respect to Taxes of any Company
Entity attributable to a Pass-Through Income Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, (iii) extend or waive, or cause to be extended or waived, or permit
any Company Entity to extend or waive, any statute of limitations or other
period for the assessment of any Tax or deficiency related to a Pass-Through
Income Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iv) make or change any Tax
election or accounting method relating to any Pass-Through Income Tax Return
that has retroactive effect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or (v) with respect
to any audit or other examination by a Tax Authority of a Pass-Through Income
Tax Return that relates in whole or in part to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, make
an election under Section 6226 of the Code or under Treasury Regulations
Section 301.6227-2(c) (in each case, or any similar or successor provision of
Tax Law in any jurisdiction), or elect under Section 6226(b)(4)(A)(ii)(I) or
Treasury Regulations Section 301.6226-3(e)(3) to furnish statements to Seller
or its direct or indirect members for the "reviewed year" (as defined in
Section 6225(d)(1) of the Code), or make any similar election under any
similar or successor provision of Tax Law in any jurisdiction. Holdings
shall not, and shall cause the Company and any Subsidiary that is a pass-
through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes not to, take any action
outside the ordinary course of business and not contemplated by this Agreement
on the Closing Date after the Closing.

  



  

   

72

 



    



  

(c) _Cooperation. _ Following the Closing, Holdings shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably requested by
the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any audit or
other Legal Proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include
the retention and (upon the other party's request) the provision of records
and information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit or other Legal
Proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. If any Company Entity is required to file a Straddle Return,
Holdings and its Subsidiaries will use reasonable best efforts to (i) complete
such Straddle Returns by February 15 of the following year and (ii) provide
Seller with any information or estimates reasonably required by it or its
Affiliates for tax reporting purposes promptly upon request by Seller.

  



  

(d) _Purchase Price Allocation_. The _Company Closing Cash Consideration_
(plus any assumed liabilities and other items required to be taken into
account for such purpose) shall be allocated among the assets of the Company
(and, as applicable, any Subsidiaries treated as flow-through entities for
income Tax purposes) in accordance with the principles of Sections 743 and 755
of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder pursuant to a written
allocation delivered by Seller to Holdings within 120 days after the
Closing Date (the " _Allocation_ "). Except to the extent otherwise required
by applicable Law, Holdings and the Company Entities shall file or cause to
be filed all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the Allocation and shall
not make any inconsistent statement or adjustment on any Tax Return or during
the course of any Tax-related matter, or otherwise take any Tax position
inconsistent with the Allocation unless otherwise required by Law.

  



  

(e) _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with this
Agreement shall be borne by Holdings. Holdings, Seller and Blocker Seller
shall cooperate in filing, when required by applicable Law, all necessary
documentation and Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes.

  



  

(f) The parties intend that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes: (i) the
Merger shall be treated as a reorganization within the meaning of
Sections 368(a)(1)(A) and 368(a)(2)(E) of the Code, and that this Agreement
constitutes a plan of reorganization within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g), (ii) the Contributions taken
together with the Merger shall be treated as an integrated
transaction described in Section 351(a) of the Code and (iii) the Sale shall
be treated as receipt of taxable "boot" under Section 351(b) by Seller and
Blocker Seller comprised of the Company Closing Cash Consideration, the
Blocker Cash Consideration and payments pursuant to the Tax Receivable
Agreement, as applicable (collectively, the " _Intended Tax Treatment_ "). The
Parties shall not, and shall not cause their Affiliates to, treat or report
the Transactions in a manner inconsistent with the Intended Tax Treatment
unless required by a "determination" as defined in Section 1313(a) of the
Code.

  



  

   

73

 



    



  

9.12 _Resignations; Acquiror DandO Tail Policy_. At or prior to Closing,
Acquiror shall deliver to the Company written resignations, effective as of
the Effective Time, of the officers and directors of Acquiror set forth on
_Section 9.12_ of the Acquiror Disclosure Schedules. Prior to the Closing,
Acquiror shall obtain and pay for a "tail" officers' and directors'
liability insurance policy with a claims period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time with at least the same coverage and amount and
containing terms and conditions that are, in the aggregate, not less
advantageous to the directors and officers of Acquiror as Acquiror's existing
policies with respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which
occurred before or at the Effective Time (including in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (the " _Acquiror D andO Tail
Policy_"). During the term of the Acquiror DandO Tail Policy, Holdings shall
not (and shall cause the Surviving Company not to) take any action following
the Closing to cause the Acquiror DandO Tail Policy to be cancelled or any
provision therein to be amended or waived.

  



  

9.13 _Closing Conditions_. From the date hereof until the Closing and upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each
party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, such actions as are necessary, proper or advisable to satisfy the
conditions to the Closing set forth in _Article X_ hereof and to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the parties shall execute or
deliver any additional instruments as reasonably requested by the other party
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

9.14 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Acquiror and
the Company shall take all such reasonable steps (to the extent permitted
under applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of Acquiror Common Stock or
acquisitions of shares of Holdings Common Stock (including, in each case,
securities deliverable upon exercise, vesting or settlement of any derivative
securities) resulting from the transactions contemplated hereby by each
individual who may become subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  



  

9.15 _Access to, and Information of, Acquiror_. From the date hereof until
the earlier of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms
and the Closing, subject to applicable Law, Acquiror shall: (i) permit the
Company and its advisers and other representatives to have reasonable access
to Acquiror's properties and facilities, books and records, Contracts and
other documents and data related to the Acquiror Parties; and (ii) furnish,
or cause to be furnished, to the Company any financial and operating data
and other information (including Tax information) with respect to the
Acquiror Parties as the Company shall from time to time reasonably request;
provided, however, that any such access or furnishing of information shall be
(x) upon no less than two (2) Business Days prior written notice from the
Company to Acquiror and (y) conducted at the Company's sole cost and expense,
during normal business hours and in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the normal operations of each of Acquiror and its
Subsidiaries. No information provided to or obtained by the Company pursuant

shall be given to the other party by the terminating party and this Agreement
shall terminate.

  



  

11.03 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 11.01_ , all further obligations and liabilities of the parties
under this Agreement will terminate and become void and of no force and
effect, except that the obligations in _Section 9.10(b)_ and _Article XII_
and the Confidentiality Agreement will survive termination of this Agreement.

  



  

11.04 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing Date, the parties may (i)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts
of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto, or (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only
if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such
extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver
of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

  



  

Article XII 
 MISCELLANEOUS

  



  

12.01 _Survival_. The representations, warranties and covenants of the
parties hereto contained herein shall not survive the Closing, except

are to be performed in whole or in part after the Closing. There are no
remedies available to the parties hereto with respect to any breach of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties to this
Agreement after the Closing, except for covenants explicitly to be performed
in whole or in part after the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, no party shall, in any event, be liable to the
other party for any consequential, special or punitive damages.

Disclosure Schedules are hereby incorporated in and made a part of this
Agreement as if set forth in full herein.

privilege or the discharge or any duty hereunder shall fall upon a day that
is not a Business Day, the party having such privilege or duty may exercise

12.05 _Expenses_. Regardless of whether the transactions provided for in this
Agreement are consummated, except as otherwise provided herein, each party
hereto shall pay its own expenses incident to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated herein, including all fees of its legal counsel,
financial advisers and accountants; _provided_ that if the Closing occurs, the

_provided_ , _further_ , that the Sponsors shall bear and pay at or promptly
after Closing, all Reimbursable Transaction Expenses in excess of $1,500,000
in the aggregate.

  



  

12.06 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, the rights and duties of the parties
hereto, and any disputes (whether in contract, tort or statute) arising out
of, under or in connection with this Agreement will be governed by and
construed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware,
without giving effect to its principles or rules of conflict of laws to the
extent such principles or rules would require or permit the application of
the Laws of another jurisdiction. The parties irrevocably and unconditionally
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for
the District of Delaware or, if such court does not have jurisdiction, the
Delaware state courts located in Wilmington, Delaware, in any action arising
out of or relating to this Agreement. The parties irrevocably agree that all
such claims shall be heard and determined in such a Delaware federal or state
court, and that such jurisdiction of such courts with respect thereto will be
exclusive. Each party hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, as a defense
in any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement
that it is not subject to such jurisdiction, or that such action, suit or
proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in such courts or that
the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement may not be
enforced in or by such courts. The parties hereby consent to and grant
any such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over the
subject matter of any such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other
papers in connection with any such action, suit or proceeding in the manner
provided in Section 12.02 or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law,
will be valid and sufficient service thereof.

  



  

   

86

 



    



  

12.07 _Assignment; Successors and Assigns; No Third Party Rights_. Except as
otherwise provided herein, this Agreement may not, without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto, be assigned by operation of Law or
otherwise, and any attempted assignment shall be null and void. Subject to
the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, successors, permitted
assigns and legal representatives, and nothing herein, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement; _provided_ , that the Indemnified Persons who are not otherwise
party to this Agreement shall be third party beneficiaries of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Acquiror Party may assign this Agreement
without the consent of any Person to any lender (or agent therefor) to such
Acquiror Party or their subsidiaries or Affiliates thereof as security for
obligations to such lender (or lenders) in respect of any financing agreements
or arrangements entered into by any Acquiror Party or their subsidiaries and
affiliates with such lenders or to an acquirer of all or substantially all of
the assets or business of the Acquiror Parties in any form of transaction,
which assignment shall not relieve such Acquiror Party of its obligations
hereunder;  _provided further_ , that Seller and/or Blocker Seller may (a)
delegate the performance of its obligations or assign its rights hereunder in
part or in whole to any Affiliate of Seller or Blocker Seller so long as
Seller or Blocker Seller, as applicable, remains fully responsible for the
performance of the delegated obligations (if any), (b) following the Closing,
assign to any acquirer of the equity or all or substantially all of the
assets of Seller, Blocker Seller or any of their respective Affiliates
(whether such sale is structured as a sale of stock, a sale of assets, a
merger or otherwise) and (c) assign its rights, in whole or in part, to
receive the Earnout Shares to any Person or Persons.

  



  

12.08 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts for the convenience of the parties hereto, each of which shall be
deemed an original and all of which together will constitute one and the same
instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this
Agreement by facsimile or portable document format shall be effective as
delivery of a mutually executed counterpart to this Agreement.

  



  

12.09 _Titles and Headings_. The titles, captions and table of contents in
this Agreement are for reference purposes only, and shall not in any way
define, limit, extend or describe the scope of this Agreement or otherwise
affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  



  

12.10 _Entire Agreement_. Except as otherwise contemplated herein, this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements constitute the entire agreement with
respect to the subject matter contained herein and therein, and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, with respect to
such subject matter. In the event of any inconsistency between the statements
in the body of this Agreement and those in the Ancillary Agreements, the
exhibits, annexes, schedules, the Acquiror Disclosure Schedules and the
Company Disclosure Schedules (other than an exception expressly set forth as
such in the Acquiror Disclosure Schedules or the Company Disclosure
Schedules, as applicable), the statements in the body of this Agreement shall
control.

  



  

   

87

 



    



  

12.11 _Severability_. The invalidity of any portion hereof shall not affect
the validity, force or effect of the remaining portions hereof. If it is ever
held that any restriction hereunder is too broad to permit enforcement of such
restriction to its fullest extent, such restriction shall be enforced to the
maximum extent permitted by Law.

  



  

12.12 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with the terms hereof and it is accordingly agreed that the parties will be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any court specified in _Section 12.06_ , in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein on the
basis that (x) any party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity; for the avoidance of doubt, the parties may argue that no breach has
occurred. Each party further agrees that no party shall be required to
obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or
as a condition to obtain any remedy referred to in this _Section 12.12_ , and
each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

  



  

12.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. To the extent not prohibited by applicable law
that cannot be waived, each of the parties hereto irrevocably waives any
right it may have to trial by jury in respect of any litigation based on,
arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements or any course of conduct, course of dealing, verbal or written
statement or action of any party hereto or thereto, in each case, whether now
existing or hereafter arising, and whether in contract, tort, statute,
equity or otherwise. Each party hereby further agrees and consents that any
such litigation shall be decided by court trial without a jury and that the
parties to this Agreement may file a copy of this Agreement with any court as
written evidence of the consent of the parties to the waiver of their right
to trial by jury.

  



  

12.14 _Failure or Indulgence not Waiver_. No failure or delay on the part of
any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder shall impair such
right or be construed to be waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any
representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
any other right. All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement are
cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise
available.

  



  

12.15 _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended, at any time prior to the
Effective Time, by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of Acquiror and
Seller; provided, however, that after the Acquiror Stockholder Approval is
obtained, there shall be no amendment or waiver that, pursuant to applicable
Law, requires further approval of the stockholders of Acquiror, without the
receipt of such further approvals.

  



  

   

88

 



    



  

12.16 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may only be brought
against, the entities that are expressly named as parties hereto and then
only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to
such party. Except to the extent a named party to this Agreement (and then
only to the extent of the specific obligations undertaken by such named party
in this Agreement), (i) no past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent,
attorney, advisor or representative or Affiliate of any named party to this
Agreement and (ii) no past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney,
advisor or representative or Affiliate of any of the foregoing shall have any
liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or more
of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other
obligations or liabilities of any one or more of Seller, Blocker Seller,
Acquiror, Holdings or Merger Sub under this Agreement of or for any claim
based on, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

12.17 _Acknowledgements_.

  



  

(a) Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees (on its own behalf and on
behalf of its respective Affiliates and its and their
respective Representatives) that: (i) it has conducted its own independent
investigation of the financial condition, results of operations, assets,
liabilities, properties and projected operations of the other parties (and
their respective Subsidiaries) and has been afforded satisfactory access to
the books and records, facilities and personnel of the other parties (and
their respective Subsidiaries) for purposes of conducting such investigation;
(ii) the Company Representations constitute the sole and exclusive
representations and warranties of the Company in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) the Seller Representations
constitute the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of Seller
and Blocker Seller in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (iv) the Blocker Representations constitute the sole and exclusive

the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of the Acquiror
Parties; (vi) except for the Company Representations by the Company, the
Seller Representations by Seller and Blocker Seller, the Blocker

Acquiror Parties, none of the parties hereto or any other Person makes, or
has made, any other express or implied representation or warranty with
respect to any party hereto (or any party's Subsidiaries) or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and all other representations and warranties
of any kind or nature expressed or implied (including (x) regarding the
completeness or accuracy of, or any omission to state or to disclose, any
information, including in the estimates, projections or forecasts or any
other information, document or material provided to or made available to any
party hereto or their respective Affiliates or Representatives in certain
"data rooms," management presentations or in any other form in expectation of
the Transactions, including meetings, calls or correspondence with management
of any party hereto (or any party's Subsidiaries), and (y) any relating to
the future or historical business, condition (financial or otherwise), results
of operations, prospects, assets or liabilities of any party hereto (or its
Subsidiaries), or the quality, quantity or condition of any party's or its
Subsidiaries' assets) are specifically disclaimed by all parties hereto and
their respective Subsidiaries and all other Persons (including
the Representatives and Affiliates of any party hereto or its Subsidiaries);
and (vi) each party hereto and its respective Affiliates are not relying on
any representations and warranties in connection with the Transactions except
the Company Representations by the Company, the Seller Representations by
Blocker Seller and Seller, the Blocker Representations by Blocker and the
Acquiror Representations by the Acquiror Parties.

  



  

   

89

 



    



  

(b) Each party hereto shall have the right to enforce this _Section 12.17_ on
behalf of any Person that would be benefitted or protected by this _Section
12.17_ if they were a party hereto. The foregoing agreements,
acknowledgements, disclaimers and waivers are irrevocable. For the avoidance
of doubt, nothing in this _Section 12.17_ shall limit, modify, restrict or
operate as a waiver with respect to, any rights any party hereto may have
under any written agreement entered into in connection with the
transactions that are contemplated by this Agreement, including the Ancillary
Agreements.

  



  

12.18 _Certain Consents_. Certain consents to the Transactions may be
required from Governmental Authorities or parties to Contracts to which any
Company Entity is a party and such consents have not been obtained and may
not be obtained. Neither the Company Entities nor Blocker Seller or Seller
will have any liability whatsoever to any Acquiror Party (and no Acquiror
Party will be entitled to assert any claims, and no condition will be deemed
unsatisfied), arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any consents
that may have been or may be required in connection with the Transactions
(other than pursuant to the HSR Act or as expressly provided herein)
or because of the default, acceleration or termination of or loss of right
under any such contract, or other agreement as a result thereof.

  



  

12.19 _Provision Respecting Legal Representation_.

  



  

(a) It is acknowledged by each of the Parties, on its own behalf and on
behalf of its respective managers, directors, equityholders, members,
partners, officers, employees and Affiliates, that the Company Entities,
Seller and Blocker Seller have retained Kirkland and Ellis LLP (collectively,
the " _Retained Counsel_ ") to act as their counsel in connection with the
Transactions and that the Retained Counsel has not acted as counsel for any
other Party in connection with the Transactions and that none of the
other Parties has the status of a client of the Retained Counsel for conflict
of interest or any other purposes as a result thereof. Each Acquiror Party
hereby agrees, on their own behalf and on behalf of their respective managers,
directors, equityholders, members, partners, officers, employees and
Affiliates, that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing between
any Acquiror Entity, the Company Entities and/or their Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and Seller, Blocker Seller and/or any of their respective
Affiliates, on the other hand, the Retained Counsel may represent Seller,
Blocker Seller and/or their respective Affiliates in such dispute even though
the interests of Seller, Blocker Seller or their respective Affiliates may be
directly adverse to the Acquiror Parties, the Company Entities or their
respective Subsidiaries, and even though the Retained Counsel may have
represented the Company Entities in a matter substantially related to such
dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for the Acquiror Parties, the
Company Entities or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

  



  

   

90

 



    



  

(b) Each Acquiror Party agrees that, after the Closing, neither any Acquiror
Party, nor any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates will have
any right to access or control any of the Retained Counsel's records relating
to or affecting the Transactions with respect to its representation of
Seller, Blocker Seller and the Company Entities, which will be the property of
(and be controlled by) Seller and Blocker Seller. In addition, each Acquiror
Party agrees that it would be impractical to remove all Attorney-Client
Communications from the records (including e-mails and other electronic
files) of the Company Entities. Accordingly, Acquiror will not, and
will cause each of its Subsidiaries and Affiliates (including, after Closing,
the Company Entities) not to, use any Attorney-Client Communication remaining
in the records of the Company Entities after Closing in a manner that may be
adverse to Seller, Blocker Seller or any of their respective Affiliates.
Acquiror agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates (including, after Closing, the Company Entities), that from and
after Closing (i) the attorney-client privilege, all other
evidentiary privileges, and the expectation of client confidence as to all
Attorney-Client Communications belong to Seller and Blocker Seller and will
not pass to or be claimed by Acquiror or its Affiliates or the Company
Entities, and (ii) Seller and Blocker Seller will have the exclusive right to
control, assert, or waive the attorney-client privilege, any other evidentiary
privilege, and the expectation of client confidence with respect to such
Attorney-Client Communications. Accordingly, Acquiror will not, and will cause
each of its Subsidiaries and Affiliates (including, after Closing, the
Company Entities) not to, (x) assert any attorney-client privilege, other
evidentiary privilege, or expectation of client confidence with respect to any
Attorney-Client Communication, except in the event of a post-Closing dispute
with a Person that is not Seller, Blocker Seller or any of their respective
Affiliates; or (y) take any action which could cause any Attorney-Client
Communication to cease being a confidential communication or to
otherwise lose protection under the attorney-client privilege or any other
evidentiary privilege, including waiving such protection in any dispute with
a Person that is not Seller, Blocker Seller or any of their respective
Affiliates.

  



  

12.20 _Release_.

  



  

(a) Effective upon the Closing, each Company Party, for itself and on behalf
of each of their respective successors and assigns, hereby releases and
forever discharges each Acquiror Party and each Acquiror Party's direct or
indirect equityholders, controlling Persons, controlling Affiliates and
representatives (and any representatives of any of the foregoing), in each
case solely in their capacities as such, of and from any and all actions,
causes of action, suits and liabilities relating to or arising out of relating
to any matter, occurrence, action or activity on or prior to the Closing Date
other than (i) any rights, claims or causes of action under this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement or (ii) any employment, severance, bonus or similar
agreement or arrangement between a Company Party and a current officer or
director that continues to remain in effect following the Closing.

  



  



  

(b) Effective upon the Closing, each Acquiror Party, on behalf of itself and
its successors and assigns, hereby releases and forever discharges the
Company Parties and their respective representatives, in each case solely in
their capacities as such, of and from any and all actions, causes of action,
suits and liabilities relating to or arising out of relating to any matter,
occurrence, action or activity on or prior to the Closing Date other than (i)
any rights, claims or causes of action under this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement or (ii) any employment, severance, bonus or similar agreement or
arrangement between an Acquiror Party and a current officer or director that
continues to remain in effect following the Closing.
