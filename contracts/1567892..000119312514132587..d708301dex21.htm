AGREEMENT

ARTICLE I 

THE MERGER

 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or

day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last of the conditions set forth
in _Article VII_ to be satisfied or waived (other than any such conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), unless another date
or place is agreed to in writing by the Company and Parent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the
satisfaction or waiver of the last of the conditions set forth in _Article
VII_ (other than any such conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing), the Closing shall occur on the earlier to occur of (a) a
date during the Marketing Period specified by Parent on no less than three (3)
business days notice to the Company and (b) the third (3rd) business day
after the end of the Marketing Period (subject in each case to the continued
satisfaction or waiver of all the conditions set forth in Article VII as of
the date on which the Closing is to occur as determined pursuant to this
proviso). The date on which the Closing actually takes place is referred to as
the " _Closing Date_ ".

 

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, the Parties shall cause (a)
a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") to be duly executed and filed with the DSOS as provided under the
DGCL and make any other filings, recordings or publications required to be
made by the Company or Merger Sub under the DGCL in connection

 



2  with the Merger and (b) an agreement of merger (the " _CA Merger Agreement_
") and officers certificates to be duly executed and filed with the CSOS as
provided under the CGCL and make any other filings, recordings or
publications required to be made by the Company or Merger Sub under the CGCL

close of business on the Closing Date, with such date and time specified in
the CA Merger Agreement and the Certificate of Merger, or on such other date
and time as shall be agreed to by Parent and the Company and specified in the
CA Merger Agreement and the Certificate of Merger (the date and time the
Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.4  _Governing Documents_. At the Effective Time, the Company
Articles and the Company Bylaws as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the articles of incorporation and bylaws,
respectively, of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

Section 1.5 _Officers and Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. The
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, from and
after the Effective Time, shall be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, or their earlier death, incapacitation, retirement,
resignation or removal. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time, from and after the Effective Time, shall be the initial
officers of the Surviving Corporation, and shall hold office until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death,
incapacitation, retirement, resignation or removal.

 

ARTICLE II

TREATMENT OF SECURITIES

Section 2.1 _Treatment of Capital Stock_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or holders of
any securities of the Company or of Merger Sub, subject to _Section 2.1(d)_
and any applicable withholding Tax, each share of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Company
Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and other than any
Dissenting Shares and Company Employee Restricted Share Awards) shall be
automatically converted into the right to receive the following consideration
(collectively, the " _Merger Consideration_ "), without interest: (i) $30.00
in cash (the " _Cash Consideration_ ") and (ii) 0.897 validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable Parent Shares, including any associated rights that
may be issued pursuant to the Parent Rights Agreement (as defined below) (if
then in effect) (the " _Stock Consideration_ "). From and after the Effective
Time, all such Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each applicable
holder of such Company Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon
the surrender of such Company Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2_,
including the right to receive, pursuant to _Section 2.6_, cash in lieu of
fractional Parent Shares, if any, into which such Company Shares 

 



3  have been converted pursuant to this _Section 2.1(a)_ (the " _Fractional
Share Consideration_ "), together with the amounts, if any, payable pursuant
to  _Section 2.2(f)_.

(b) _Cancellation of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, all Company
Shares owned by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or by any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(c) _Treatment of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, each share
of common stock, $0.01 par value, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into
and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

(d) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock or Parent Shares, as
applicable), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to the
number of shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Shares outstanding after
the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

 

Section 2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall
designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act
as the exchange agent in connection with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_
"). The Exchange Agent shall also act as the agent for the Companys
shareholders for the purpose of receiving and holding their Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares and shall obtain no rights or interests in the shares
represented thereby. At or immediately after the Effective Time, Parent or
Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange
Agent (i) evidence of Parent Shares issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ in
book-entry form equal to the aggregate Parent Shares portion of the Merger
Consideration (excluding any Fractional Share Consideration), and (ii) cash
in immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate
cash portion of the Merger Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration and
any dividends under _Section 2.2(f)_ (such evidence of book-entry Parent
Shares and cash amounts, together with any dividends or other distributions
with respect thereto, the " _Exchange Fund_ "), in each case, for the sole
benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock. In the event the
Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to pay the aggregate cash portion of the
Merger Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration and any dividends under
_Section 2.2(f)_, Parent shall, or shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly
deposit additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount which is equal
to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall make, delivery
of the Merger Consideration, including payment of the Fractional Share
Consideration, and any amounts payable in respect of dividends or other
distributions on Parent Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_ out of the
Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not
be used for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement.
The cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent
as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided, however,_  

 



4  that any investment of such cash shall in all events be limited to direct
short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated P-1
or A-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that
are then publicly available), and that no such investment or loss thereon
shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares pursuant to this _Article II_. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation on the
earlier of (A) one (1) year after the Effective Time or (B) the full payment
of the Exchange Fund.

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause the Exchange Agent
to mail (and make available for collection by hand) to each holder of record
of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding Company Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or non-
certificated Company Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_
") and whose Company Shares were converted pursuant to _Section 2.1_ into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal,
which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and
(ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for
payment of the Merger Consideration into which such Company Shares have been
converted pursuant to _Section 2.1_, including any amount payable in respect
of Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.6_, and any
dividends or other distributions on Parent Shares in accordance with _Section
2.2(f)_. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, together with such letter of transmittal duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _Article
II_, any Fractional Share Consideration that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions of _Section 2.6_, and any amounts that
such holder has the right to receive in respect of dividends or other
distributions on Parent Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_ for each
Company Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, to
be mailed (or made available for collection by hand if so elected by the
surrendering holder) within five (5) business days following the later to
occur of (x) the Effective Time or (y) the Exchange Agents receipt of such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share, and
the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share so
surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares
upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange
Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with
normal exchange practices. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that
(A) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be
otherwise in proper form for transfer and (B) the Person requesting such
payment

 



5  shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of
the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Company that such Tax either has been paid or is
not required to be paid. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to
Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-
Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 2.2_, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article II_ , including any
amount payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with
_Section 2.6_, and any dividends or other distributions on Parent Shares
in accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_, without interest thereon.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company
Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company
Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Agreement.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. At any time following twelve
(12) months after the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the
Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received
with respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund that have not been
disbursed, or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the Exchange
Agents routine administrative procedures, to holders of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to
the Surviving Corporation and Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat
or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger
Consideration, including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share
Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.6_, and any dividends or
other distributions on Parent Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2(f),_
payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and
compliance with the procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or
Book-Entry Share for any Merger Consideration or other amounts delivered to a

similar Law.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the
Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.1_
hereof, including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share

interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such Parent
Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) at
the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions

Section 2.3 _Dissenter s Rights_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Company Shares
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a
holder of record who did not vote in favor of the approval and adoption of
this Agreement (or consent thereto in writing) and is entitled to demand and
properly demands purchase of such Company Shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ")
for fair market value pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with,
Chapter 13 of the CGCL (the " _Dissenting Rights_ ") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to
_Section 2.1_, but instead at the Effective Time shall be converted into the
right to receive payment of the fair market value of such Company Shares in
accordance with the Dissenting Rights (it being understood and acknowledged
that at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other
than the right to receive the fair market value of such Dissenting Shares to
the extent afforded by the Dissenting Rights); _provided, however_ , that if
any such holder (including any holder of Proposed Dissenting Shares) shall
fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
payment of the fair market value of such Dissenting Shares under the
Dissenting Rights, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair market
value of such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting
Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into,
and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, without
interest or duplication, the Merger Consideration. " _Proposed Dissenting
Shares_ " means shares of Company Common Stock whose holders provide demands
for fair market value to the Company prior to the Company Special Meeting and
do not vote in favor of the approval and adoption of this Agreement, in
each case in accordance with the Dissenting Rights.

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by
the Company for fair market value of any Company Shares, of any withdrawals of
such demands and of any other instruments served pursuant to the CGCL and
received by the Company relating to Dissenting Rights, and Parent shall have
the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any
such demand, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 



7 Section 2.4 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Company Stock Options_.

 

(i) As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each option to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under any Company Equity Plan
(each a " _Company Stock Option_ ") to a Company non-employee director (a "
_Company Director Stock Option_ ") that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of each Net Company
Share; _provided_ , _however_ , that any holder who would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fraction of a Parent Share shall receive, in lieu
thereof, cash, without interest, in an amount equal to such fractional part of
a Parent Share multiplied by the VWAP of Parent Shares.

(ii) As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each Company Stock
Option other than any Company Director Stock Option (a " _Company Employee
Stock Option_ ") that is vested, outstanding and unexercised immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in respect of each Net Company Share;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any holder who would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fraction of a Parent Share shall receive, in lieu
thereof, cash, without interest, in an amount equal to such fractional part of
a Parent Share multiplied by the VWAP of Parent Shares.

 

(iii) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holders thereof, each Company Employee Stock Option that
is unvested, outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into an option (a "
_Parent Share Option_ ") to acquire (A) that number of whole Parent Shares
(rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Employee Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (2)
the Exchange Ratio, (B) at an exercise price per Parent Share (rounded up to
the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of such Company Employee
Stock Option by (2) the Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , _however_ , that each
such Company Stock Option (I) which is an "incentive stock option" (as defined
in Section 422 of the Code) shall be adjusted in accordance with the
foregoing in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424 of the
Code and (II) shall be adjusted in a manner which complies with Section 409A
of the Code and that causes the resulting Parent Share Option not to
constitute the grant of a new option or a change in the form of payment of an
option, as provided under Treasury Regulation section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D).
Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.4(a)(iii), each such Parent
Share Option assumed and converted pursuant to this Section 2.4(a)(iii) shall

applied to the corresponding Company Employee Stock Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

 



8 (b) _Company Restricted Share Awards_.

 

(i) As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each outstanding award

employee director (a " _Company Director Restricted Share Award_ ") shall
fully vest and become nonforfeitable, and shall be treated like Company Common
Stock pursuant to _Section 2.1_ hereof.

 

(ii) Subject to _Section 2.4(d)_, as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each
outstanding Company Restricted Share Award other than a Company Director
Restricted Share Award (each such award, a " _Company Employee Restricted
Share Award_ ") shall be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into an
award of restricted stock corresponding to Parent Shares (each, a " _Parent
Restricted Share Award_ ") with respect to a number of Parent Shares (rounded
up or down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (A) the applicable number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Employee Restricted Share Award immediately prior to
the Effective Time by (B) the Exchange Ratio. Except as otherwise provided in
this Section 2.4(b)(ii), each Parent Restricted Share Award assumed and
converted pursuant to this Section 2.4(b)(ii) shall continue to have, and
shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to
the corresponding Company Employee Restricted Share Award immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

(c) _Company RSU Awards_. Subject to _Section 2.4(d)_, as of the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holders thereof, each outstanding award of restricted stock units that
corresponds to a number of shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Company
RSU Award_ ") under any Company Equity Plan that is not then vested shall be
assumed by Parent and shall be converted into a restricted stock unit award
corresponding to Parent Shares (each, a " _Parent RSU Award_ ") with respect
to a number of Parent Shares (rounded up or down to the nearest whole share)
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the applicable number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the Exchange Ratio. Except as otherwise
provided in this _Section 2.4(c)_, each Parent RSU Award assumed and
converted pursuant to this _Section 2.4(c)_ shall continue to have, and
shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the
corresponding Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(d) _Performance-Vesting Company Equity Awards_. Notwithstanding _Section
2.4(b)(ii)_ and  _Section 2.4(c_), as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each Company Restricted Share Award and Company RSU Award that is
subject to performance-based vesting conditions and is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holders thereof, be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Company
Common Stock underlying such Company Restricted Share Award or Company RSU
Award, as applicable.

 



9 (e) _Company ESPP_. As soon as practicable following the date of
this Agreement, the Company shall take all actions with respect to the
Company ESPP that are necessary to provide that: (i) with respect to the
offering period in effect as of the date hereof (the " _Current Offering
Period_ ") and the immediately succeeding offering period in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice (the " _Succeeding Offering

Periods_ "), no participant may increase the percentage amount of his or her
payroll deduction election from that in effect on the date hereof for such
ESPP Offering Period; (ii) subject to the consummation of the Merger, the
Company ESPP shall terminate, effective immediately prior to the Effective

offering period shall be commenced under the Company ESPP prior to the
Effective Time; and (v) the Company shall cause any shares of Company Common
Stock purchased during an ESPP Offering Period to be shares reacquired by the
Company in the open market (rather than unissued shares).

(f) _Company Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
pass resolutions and take such other actions as are necessary to provide for
the treatment of the Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Share Awards
and Company RSU Awards (collectively, the " _Company Equity Awards_ ") as
contemplated by this _Section 2.4_.

(g) _Awards Assumed by Parent_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume all
the obligations of the Company under the Company Equity Plans, each
outstanding Parent Share Option, Parent Restricted Share Award and Parent RSU

kind of shares available for issuance under each Company Equity Plan shall be
adjusted to reflect Parent Shares in accordance with the provisions of the
applicable Company Equity Plan.

 

(h) _Parent Actions_. Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to
reserve for issuance a sufficient number of Parent Shares for delivery upon
exercise or settlement of the Parent Share Options, Parent Restricted Share
Awards and Parent RSU Awards in accordance with this _Section 2.4_. As soon
as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, if and to the extent
necessary to cause a sufficient number of shares of Parent Shares to be
registered and issuable under Parent Share Options, Parent Restricted Share
Awards and Parent RSU Awards, Parent shall file a post-effective amendment to
the Form S-4 or registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other
appropriate form) with respect to the Parent Shares subject to Parent Share
Options, Parent Restricted Share Awards and Parent RSU Awards and shall use
its reasonable commercial efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as
such Parent Share Options, Parent Restricted Share Awards and Parent RSU
Awards remain outstanding.

Section 2.5 _Withholding_. The Company, Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange
Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable to a
holder of Company Common Stock or a

 



10  holder of a Company Equity Award pursuant to this Agreement, any amounts as
are required to be withheld or deducted with respect to such consideration
under the Code, or any applicable provisions of state, local or foreign Tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely remitted to the
appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company
Common Stock or a holder of a Company Equity Award in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

 

Section 2.6 _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing
fractional Parent Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such fractional share interests shall
not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder
of Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder
of shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a Parent Share shall
receive, in lieu thereof, cash, without interest, in an amount equal to such
fractional part of a Parent Share _multiplied by_ the VWAP of Parent Shares.

Transactions and compliance with the provisions hereof will not (i) result in
any violation or breach of, or default or change of control (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of, or
result in, termination, modification, cancellation or acceleration of any
material obligation or to the loss of a material benefit under any Contract,
loan, guarantee of Indebtedness or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage,

filed or furnished all forms, documents and reports required to be filed or
furnished prior to the date hereof by it with the SEC (the " _Company SEC
Documents_ "). As of their respective dates, or, if amended, as of the date of
(and giving effect to) the last such amendment, the Company SEC Documents
complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, and none of the Company SEC
Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

schedules) of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents when filed
complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto in effect at the time of such filing and fairly present in
all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and
its consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for
the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and to any other adjustments
described therein, including the notes thereto) in conformity with United
States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (" _GAAP_ ") (except, in the
case of the unaudited statements, to the extent permitted by the SEC) applied
on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
therein or in the notes thereto).

 

Section 3.5 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. The Company has established
and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the

 



14  Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. The
Companys disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure
that all material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is
accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "). The Companys internal controls
over financial reporting provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of the Companys financial reporting and the preparation of
Company financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
Since January 1, 2012, the Companys principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer have disclosed to the Companys auditors and the
audit committee of the Company Board of Directors (i) all known significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect in any material respect the Companys ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any known fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the Companys internal controls. The Company has made
available to Parent all such disclosures made by management to the Companys
auditors and audit committee from January 1, 2012 to the date hereof.

 

Section 3.6 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except (a) as disclosed, reflected
or reserved against in the Companys consolidated balance sheet (or the notes
thereto) as of December 31, 2013 included in the Company SEC Documents filed
or furnished on or prior to the date hereof, (b) for liabilities incurred in
the ordinary course of business since December 31, 2013, (c) as expressly
permitted or contemplated by this Agreement and (d) for liabilities which have
been discharged or paid in full in the ordinary course of business, as of the
date hereof, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any
liabilities of any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise,
that would be required by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet
of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries (or in the notes thereto),
other than those which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this
_Section 3.6_, the term "liabilities" shall not include obligations of the
Company or any Company Subsidiaries to perform under or comply with any
applicable Law, action, judgment or Contract, but would include such
liabilities and obligations if there has been a default or failure to perform
or comply by the Company or any Company Subsidiaries with any such liability
or obligation if such default or failure would, with the giving of notice or
passage of time or both, reasonably be expected to result in a monetary
obligation.

 

Section 3.7 _Compliance with Laws; Permits_.

 

(a) The Company and each Company Subsidiary are in compliance with and are not
in default under or in violation of any Laws applicable to the Company, such
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, except where
such non-compliance, default or violation would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



15 (b) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries are in possession of all
franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances,
exceptions, consents, certificates, clearances, approvals, registrations and
orders of any Governmental Entity necessary for the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their properties and assets or to
carry on their businesses as they are now being conducted (the " _Company
Permits_ "), except where the failure to have any of the Company Permits would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. All Company Permits are in full force and
effect, except where the failure to be in full force and effect would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section 3.7_,
no representation or warranty shall be deemed to be made in this _Section
3.7_ in respect of the matters referenced in _Section 3.4_, _Section 3.5_ or
_Section 3.13_, or in respect of environmental, Tax, employee benefits or
labor Laws matters.

Section 3.8 _Environmental Laws and Regulations_. Except for such matters
as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect: (a) the Company and its Subsidiaries
are now and have been since January 1, 2011 in compliance with all, and have
not violated any, applicable Environmental Laws; (b) no property currently or

prior to the date hereof by it with the SEC (the " _Parent SEC Documents_ ").
As of their respective dates, or, if amended, as of the date of (and giving
effect to) the last such amendment, the Parent SEC Documents complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, and none of the Parent SEC Documents contained any untrue

requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto in effect at the time of such filing and fairly present in
all material respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its
consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for
the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and to any other adjustments
described therein, including the notes thereto) in conformity with GAAP

Section 4.5 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. Parent has established and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Parents disclosure controls and procedures
are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be
disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or furnishes under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to Parents management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Parents internal controls over financial reporting
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of Parents financial
reporting and the preparation of Parent financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP. Since June 5, 2013, Parents principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed to
Parents auditors and the audit committee of the Parent Board of Directors
(i) all known significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably
likely to adversely affect in any material respect Parents ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any
known fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Parents internal controls. Parent
has made available to the Company all such disclosures made by management to
Parents auditors and audit committee from June 5, 2013 to the date hereof.

the ordinary course of business since December 27, 2013, (d) as expressly
permitted or contemplated by this Agreement and (e) for liabilities which have
been discharged or paid in full in the ordinary course of business, as of the
date hereof, neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has any liabilities of
any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise, that would be
required by GAAP to be reflected on a

 



33  consolidated balance sheet of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries (or
in the notes thereto), other than those which, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. For purposes of this _Section 4.6_, the term "liabilities" shall not
include obligations of Parent or any Parent Subsidiaries to perform under or
comply with any applicable Law, action, judgment or Contract, but would
include such liabilities and obligations if there has been a default or
failure to perform or comply by Parent or any Parent Subsidiaries with any
such liability or obligation if such default or failure would, with the
giving of notice or passage of time or both, reasonably be expected to result
in a monetary obligation.

grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions,

lease and operate their properties and assets or to carry on their businesses
as they are now being conducted (the " _Parent Permits_ "), except where the
failure to have any of the Parent Permits would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. All
Parent Permits are in full force and effect, except where the failure to be in
full force and effect would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section 4.7_, no
representation or warranty shall be deemed to be made in this _Section 4.7_
in respect of the matters referenced in _Section 4.4_, _Section 4.5_ or
_Section 4.13_, or in respect of environmental, Tax, employee benefits or
labor Laws matters.

payment of royalties or other amounts calculated based upon any revenues or
income of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, in each case (x) which payments
after the date hereof would reasonably be expected to be more than $25 million
in the twelve (12) month period following the date hereof and (y) that cannot
be terminated by Parent or such Parent Subsidiary without penalty without more
than sixty (60) days notice without material payment or penalty;

 

(x) any Contract that relates to any swap, forward, futures, or other similar
derivative transaction with a notional value in excess of $5 million;

(xi) any material collective bargaining agreement or other material Contract
with any labor union;

(xii) any Contract involving the settlement of any action or threatened
action (or series of related actions) (A) which will (x) involve payments
after the date hereof of consideration in excess of $5 million or (y) impose
monitoring or reporting obligations to any other Person outside the ordinary
course of business or (B) with respect to which material conditions precedent
to the settlement have not been satisfied; and

 

(xiii) any Contract not otherwise described in any other subsection of this
_Section 4.20(a)_ that would constitute a "material contract" (as such term
is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC) with respect to
Parent.

 

(b) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is in breach of or default under
the terms of any Parent Material Contract where such breach or default would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of Parent, as of the date hereof, no
other party to any Parent Material Contract is in breach of or default under
the terms of any Parent Material Contract where such breach or default would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect,
each Parent Material Contract is a valid and binding obligation of Parent or
the Subsidiary of Parent which is party thereto and, to the knowledge of
Parent, of each other party thereto, and is in full force and effect, except
that (i) such enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
examinership, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws, now or
hereafter in effect, relating to creditors rights generally and (ii)
equitable remedies of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of
equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of
the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.

Section 4.21 _Insurance_. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as of the
date hereof, (a) all current, material insurance policies and Contracts of
Parent and its Subsidiaries are in full force and effect and are valid and
enforceable and (after taking into account self-insurance of Parent and its
Subsidiaries) cover against the risks as are customary in all material
respects for companies of similar size in the same or similar lines of
business and (b) all premiums due 

 



45  thereunder have been paid. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received notice of cancellation or termination with respect to any material
third party insurance policies or Contracts (other than in connection with
normal renewals of any such insurance policies or Contracts) where such
cancellation or termination would reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.22 _Finders and Brokers_. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
has employed any investment banker, broker or finder in connection with the
Transactions, other than as set forth in _Section 4.22_ of the Parent
Disclosure Letter, who might be entitled to any fee or any commission in
connection with or upon consummation of the Merger.

 

Section 4.23 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company a true and complete copy of (i) the
executed Debt Commitment Letter and (ii) the executed Debt Fee Letter
(redacted as to economic and flex terms only). The Debt Commitment Letter has
not been amended or modified in any manner prior to the date of this
Agreement. Neither Parent nor any of its affiliates has entered into any
agreement, side letter or other arrangement relating to the financing of the
Transactions, other than as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and the
Debt Fee Letter which would impose conditions or other contingencies to the
funding of the full amount of the Financing. The commitments contained in the
Debt Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect
prior to the date of this Agreement. The Debt Commitment Letter is in full
force and effect and represents (A) a valid, binding and enforceable
obligation of MIFSA, a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, and (B) to the
knowledge of Parent, a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of each other
party thereto to provide the financing contemplated thereby subject only to
the satisfaction or waiver of the Financing Conditions, in the case of each of
clauses (A) and (B) subject to the qualification that such enforceability may
be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other laws of general
application relating to or affecting rights of creditors and that equitable
remedies, including specific performance, are discretionary and may not be
ordered. Parent has caused MIFSA to fully pay (or cause to be paid) any and
all commitment fees and other amounts that are required to be paid pursuant to
the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter and the Debt Fee Letter on or prior to
the date of this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, no event
has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably constitute a breach or default on the part of MIFSA or, to the
knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto under the Debt Commitment Letter.
There are no conditions precedent related to the funding of the full amount
of the Financing, other than the Financing Conditions. As of the date of this
Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe that any of the Financing
Conditions will not be satisfied, nor does Parent have knowledge, as of the
date of this Agreement, that the Financing will not be made available to
Parent on the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment
Letter.

 

(b) The proceeds of the Financing, if funded, together with available cash of
Parent and Merger Sub, shall constitute sufficient funds to consummate the
Transactions, including the making of all required payments in connection with
the Transactions, including payment of the Merger Consideration and Fractional
Share Consideration and all other amounts to be paid pursuant to this
Agreement and associated costs and expenses of the Transactions on the Closing
Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event
shall

 



46  the receipt or availability of any funds or financing by Parent or any of
its affiliates be a condition to any of Parents or Merger Subs obligations
hereunder.

 

Section 4.24 _FCPA and Anti-Corruption_. Except for those matters which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect:

(a) neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary, nor any director, manager or
employee of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary has in the last five (5) years, in
connection with the business of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, itself or, to
Parents knowledge, any of its agents, representatives, sales intermediaries,
or any other third party, in each case, acting on behalf of Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary, taken any action in violation of the FCPA or other
applicable Bribery Legislation (in each case to the extent applicable);

 

(b) neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary, nor any director, manager or
employee of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, are, or in the past five (5)
years have been, subject to any actual, pending, or threatened civil,
criminal, or administrative actions, suits, demands, claims, hearings, notices
of violation, investigations, proceedings, demand letters, settlements, or
enforcement actions, or made any voluntary disclosures to any Governmental
Entity, involving Parent or any Parent Subsidiary in any way relating to
applicable Bribery Legislation, including the FCPA;

 

(c) Parent and each Parent Subsidiary has made and kept books and records,
accounts and other records, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Parent and
each Parent Subsidiary as required by the FCPA in all material respects;

 

(d) Parent and each Parent Subsidiary has instituted policies and procedures
designed to ensure compliance with the FCPA and other applicable Bribery
Legislation and maintain such policies and procedures in force; and

(e) no officer, director, or employee of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is a
Government Official.

Section 4.25 _Manufacturing_. To the knowledge of Parent, all material Parent
Products are manufactured in compliance with all applicable Laws and in
conformity with Good Manufacturing Practices, including, but not limited to,
the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its applicable implementing
regulations at 21 C.F.R. Parts 210 and 211, and any foreign equivalents,
except as has not and would not reasonably be expected to materially and
adversely affect the ability of Parent to package, promote, distribute,
market, use or sell any material Parent Product. To the knowledge of Parent,
no event has occurred since January 1, 2012, and no event is reasonably
expected to occur, that would materially and adversely affect the ability of
Parent to procure and/or develop any material Parent Product on terms
consistent in all material respects with those in effect prior to the date
hereof and in quantities consistent in all material respects with past
practice and sufficient for the operation of Parents business as currently
conducted and as currently anticipated to be conducted.

Section 4.26 _No Merger Sub Activity_. Since the date of its incorporation,
Merger Sub has not engaged in any activities other than in connection with
this Agreement.

 



47 Section 4.27 _No Other Representations_. Except for the representations and
warranties contained in _Article III_ , Parent acknowledges that neither the
Company nor any Representative of the Company makes, and Parent acknowledges
that it has not relied upon or otherwise been induced by, any other express or
implied representation or warranty with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or with respect to any other information provided or made
available to Parent in connection with the Transactions, including any
information, documents, projections, forecasts or other material made
available to Parent or to Parents Representatives in certain "data rooms" or
management presentations in expectation of the Transactions.

taking of any of the actions referred to in either of clause (x) or (y)
below, in a Company Superior Proposal, then in either event (if the Company
has not materially breached the provisions of this _Section 5.3_ (1) with
respect to such Company Competing Proposal or (2) in a manner that otherwise
related to such Company Competing Proposal) the Company may take the following
actions: (x) furnish nonpublic information to the Person making such Company

54 (c) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later

contrary, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder
Approval, the Company Board of Directors may make a Company Change of
Recommendation (i) in response to a Company Intervening Event, or (ii)
following receipt of a bona fide, unsolicited, written Company Competing
Proposal, which the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith after
consultation with the Companys outside legal and financial advisors is a
Company Superior Proposal, if and only if, (x) in the case of clause (ii),
the Company did not solicit, encourage or facilitate such Company Competing
Proposal as a result of a material breach of the provisions of this _Section
5.3_ and (y) in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), the Company Board
of Directors has determined in good faith after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel that the failure to take such action would
constitute a breach of the duties of the members of the Company Board of
Directors under applicable Law and the Company complies with _Section
5.3(e)_.

(e) Prior to the Company taking any action permitted (i) under _Section
5.3(d)(i)_, the Company shall provide Parent with four (4) business days
prior written notice advising Parent it intends to effect a Company Change of
Recommendation and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor
(including the material facts and circumstances related to the applicable
Company Intervening Event), and during such four (4) business day period, the
Company shall consider in good faith any proposal by Parent to amend the
terms and conditions of this Agreement in a manner that would obviate the need
to effect a Company Change of

 



55  Recommendation or (ii) under _Section 5.3(d)(ii)_, the Company shall
provide Parent with four (4) business days prior written notice (it being
understood and agreed that any material amendment to the amount or form of
consideration payable in connection with the applicable Company Competing
Proposal shall require a new notice and an additional three (3) business day
period) advising Parent that the Company Board of Directors intends to take
such action and specifying the material terms and conditions of the Company
Competing Proposal, and during such four (4) business day period (or
subsequent three (3) business day period), the Company shall consider in good
faith any proposal by Parent to amend the terms and conditions of this
Agreement such that such Company Competing Proposal would no longer constitute
a Company Superior Proposal.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board of Directors from (i) disclosing to the Companys shareholders
a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its shareholders if the Company
Board of Directors has reasonably determined in good faith after consultation
with the Companys outside legal counsel that the failure to do so would
constitute a breach of the duties of the members of the Company Board of
Directors under applicable Law; _provided_ that this  _Section 5.3(f)_ shall
not permit the Company Board of Directors to make a Company Change of
Recommendation except to the extent permitted by _Section 5.3(d)_ or _Section
5.3(e)_.

 

(g) No Company Change of Recommendation shall relieve the Company from its
obligations to submit the approval and adoption of this Agreement to a vote
of its shareholders at the Company Special Meeting.

(h) References in this  _Section 5.3_ to the "Company Board of Directors"
shall mean the Company Board of Directors or, to the extent applicable, a duly
authorized committee thereof.

 

Section 5.4 _Solicitation by Parent_.

 

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated

Parent Subsidiary to), and that it shall cause its directors, officers and
employees not to, and that it shall direct and use its reasonable best efforts
to cause its other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly: (i)
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate (including
by way of furnishing information), or engage in discussions or negotiations

announcement of any inquiry, proposal or offer (including any inquiry,
proposal or offer to its shareholders) which constitutes or would be

shall promptly inform its Representatives of Parents obligations under this
_Section 5.4_. For purposes of this _Section 5.4_, the term "Person" means
any Person or "group," as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, other
than, with respect to Parent, the Company or any Company Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent
and the Parent Subsidiaries and Parents Representatives may in any event (A)
seek to clarify and understand the terms and conditions of any inquiry or
proposal made by any Person solely to determine whether such inquiry or
proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent
Superior Proposal and (B) inform a Person that has made or, to the knowledge
of Parent, is considering making a Parent Competing Proposal of the provisions
of this  _Section 5.4_.

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 5.4(a)_, if Parent
receives, prior to the Parent Shareholder Approval being obtained, a bona
fide, unsolicited, written Parent Competing Proposal, which the Parent Board
of Directors determines in good faith after consultation with Parents outside
legal and financial advisors (i) constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal or
(ii) would reasonably be expected to result, after the taking of any of the
actions referred to in either of clause (x) or (y) below, in a Parent Superior
Proposal, then in either event (if Parent has not materially breached the
provisions of this _Section 5.4_ (1) with respect to such Parent Competing
Proposal or (2) in a manner that otherwise related to such Parent Competing
Proposal) Parent may take the following actions: (x) furnish nonpublic
information to the Person making such Parent Competing Proposal, if, and only
if, prior to so furnishing such information, Parent receives from such Person
an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (y) engage in
discussions or negotiations with such Person with respect to the Parent
Competing Proposal.

Parent Competing Proposal, or any initial inquiry or request for nonpublic
information relating to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary by any Person who has
made or would reasonably be expected to make any Parent Competing Proposal.
Such notice shall be made orally and confirmed in writing, and shall indicate
the identity of the Person making the Parent Competing Proposal, inquiry
or request or with whom Parent is engaging in discussions or negotiations,
and the material terms and conditions of any such proposal or offer and the
nature of the information requested pursuant to such inquiry or request. In
addition, Parent shall promptly (but in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours) after the receipt thereof, provide to the Company copies of any written
documentation material to understanding a Parent Competing Proposal or
potential Parent Competing Proposal which is

 



57  received by Parent from any Person (or from any representatives, advisors or
agents of such Person) making such Parent Competing Proposal or with whom
discussions or negotiations would reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent
Competing Proposal. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed of the
status and material terms (including any amendments or proposed amendments to
such material terms) of any such Parent Competing Proposal or potential
Parent Competing Proposal and keep the Company reasonably informed as to the
nature of any information requested of Parent with respect thereto. Parent
shall promptly (but in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) provide to

Parent Competing Proposal as a result of a material breach of the provisions
of this _Section 5.4_ and (y) in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), the Parent
Board of Directors has determined in good faith after consultation with
Parents outside legal counsel that the failure to take such action would
constitute a breach of the duties of the members of the Parent Board of
Directors under applicable Law and Parent complies with _Section 5.4(e)_.

 

(e) Prior to Parent taking any action permitted (i) under _Section
5.4(d)(i)_, Parent shall provide the Company with four (4) business days
prior written notice advising the Company it intends to effect a Parent Change
of Recommendation and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor
(including the material facts and circumstances related to the applicable
Parent Intervening Event), and during such four (4) business day period,

terms and conditions of the Parent Competing Proposal, and during such four
(4) business day period (or subsequent three (3) business day period), Parent

and conditions of this Agreement such that such Parent Competing Proposal
would no longer constitute a Parent Superior Proposal.

Board of Directors from (i) disclosing to Parents shareholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or
(ii) making any disclosure to its shareholders if the Parent Board of
Directors has reasonably determined in good faith after 

 



58  consultation with Parents outside legal counsel that the failure to do so
would constitute a breach of the duties of the members of the Parent Board of
Directors under applicable Law;  _provided_ that this _Section 5.4(f)_ shall
not permit the Parent Board of Directors to make a Parent Change of
Recommendation except to the extent permitted by _Section 5.4(d)_ or _Section
5.4(e)_.

 

(g) No Parent Change of Recommendation shall relieve Parent from its
obligations to submit the approval of the issuance of Parent Shares in the
Merger to a vote of its shareholders at the Parent Special Meeting.

(h) References in this  _Section 5.4_ to the "Parent Board of Directors"
shall mean the Parent Board of Directors or, to the extent applicable, a duly

Section 5.5 _Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus; Shareholders  Meetings_. 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, (i) the Company and Parent shall jointly prepare and cause to be
filed with the SEC the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus in preliminary form,
and (ii) Parent shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC, the Form S-4
with respect to the Parent Shares issuable in the Merger, which will include
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus with respect to the Company Special
Meeting and Parent Special Meeting. Each of the Company and Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to (A) have the Form S-4 declared effective under
the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, (B) ensure
that the Form S-4 complies in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Exchange Act or Securities Act, and (C) keep the Form
S-4 effective for so long as necessary to complete the Merger. Each of the
Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning itself, its
affiliates and the holders of its shares to the other and provide such other
assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation,
filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.
The Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include all
information reasonably requested by such other Party to be included therein.
Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other upon the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, and shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt
thereof, provide the other with copies of all correspondence between it and
its Representatives, on one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and all
written comments with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Form S-4 received from the SEC and advise the other party or any oral comments
with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 received
from the SEC. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC
with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any
comment from the SEC with respect to the Form S-4. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to filing the Form S-4 (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or mailing the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate and provide the other
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response in
advance (including the proposed final version of such document or response).
Parent shall advise the Company,

 



59  promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time of effectiveness of
the Form S-4, the issuance of any stop order relating thereto or the
suspension of the qualification of the Parent Shares issuable in connection
with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted,
reversed or otherwise terminated. Parent shall also take any other action
required to be taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any
applicable foreign or state securities or "blue sky" Laws and the rules and
regulations thereunder in connection with the issuance of the Parent Shares
in the Merger, and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the
Company and the holders of the Company Common Stock as may be reasonably
requested in connection with any such actions.

 

(b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval
or the Parent Shareholder Approval, any information relating to the Company
or Parent, or any of their respective affiliates, should be discovered by the
Company or Parent which, in the reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent,
should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, any of the Form
S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such documents
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties, and the
Company and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any
necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 and, to the extent required by Law, in
disseminating the information contained in such amendment or supplement to
shareholders of the Company and the shareholders of Parent. Nothing in this
_Section 5.5(b)_ shall limit the obligations of any Party under _Section
5.5(a)_. For purposes of this _Section 5.5_, any information concerning or
related to the Company, its affiliates or the Company Special Meeting will be
deemed to have been provided by the Company, and any information concerning or
related to Parent, its affiliates or the Parent Special Meeting will be deemed
to have been provided by Parent.

 

(c) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Governing
Documents, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold the Company Special Meeting. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the
shareholders of the Company entitled to vote at the Company Special Meeting
and to hold the Company Special Meeting as soon as practicable after the Form
S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. The Company shall, through
the Company Board of Directors, recommend to its shareholders that they give
the Company Shareholder Approval, include such recommendation in the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and solicit and use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Company Shareholder Approval, except in each case to the extent
that the Company Board of Directors shall have made a Company Change of
Recommendation as permitted by _Section 5.3_. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 5.5(c)_, if, on a date for which the Company
Special Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock to obtain
the Company Shareholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, the
Company shall have the right to make one or more successive postponements or
adjournments of the Company Special Meeting; _provided_ that the Company
Special Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than
thirty (30) days after

 



60  the date for which the Company Special Meeting was originally scheduled
(other than any adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law,
including adjournments or postponements to the extent reasonably necessary or
advisable to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus is provided or made available to the Company
shareholders or to permit dissemination of information which is material to
shareholders voting at the Company Special Meeting and to give the Company
shareholders sufficient time to evaluate any such supplement or amendment or
other information). Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to
relieve the Company of its obligations to submit this Agreement to its
shareholders for a vote on the approval and adoption thereof.

 

(d) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent
shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Parent Governing Documents,
establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Parent Special Meeting. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the shareholders of
Parent entitled to vote at the Parent Special Meeting and to hold the Parent
Special Meeting as soon as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective under the Securities Act. Parent shall, through the Parent Board
of Directors, recommend to its shareholders that they give the Parent
Shareholder Approval, include such recommendations in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, and solicit and use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Parent Shareholder Approval, except in each case to the extent
that the Parent Board of Directors shall have made a Parent Change of
Recommendation as permitted by _Section 5.4_. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 5.5(d)_, if, on a date for which the Parent
Special Meeting is scheduled, Parent has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of Parent Shares to obtain the Parent Shareholder Approval,
whether or not a quorum is present, Parent shall have the right to make one
or more successive postponements or adjournments of the Parent Special
Meeting; _provided_ that the Parent Special Meeting is not postponed or
adjourned to a date that is more than thirty (30) days after the date for
which the Parent Special Meeting was originally scheduled (other than any
adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law, including
adjournments or postponements to the extent reasonably necessary or advisable
to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus is provided or made available to the Parent shareholders
or to permit dissemination of information which is material to shareholders
voting at the Parent Special Meeting and to give the Parent shareholders
sufficient time to evaluate any such supplement or amendment or other
information). Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to relieve
Parent of its obligation to submit the issuance of the Parent Shares in the
Merger to its shareholders for a vote on the approval thereof.

(e) The Company and Parent will use their respective reasonable best efforts
to hold the Company Special Meeting and the Parent Special Meeting on the same
date and as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement.

consummating any transaction that (i) is described in clause _(a)_ , _(b)_ ,
_(e)_ , _(g)_ , _(h)_ , _(i)_ or _(j)_ of _Section 5.1(ii)_ and (ii) is not
subject to Parents consent right provided in  _Section 5.1(ii)_ on the
basis that such transaction involves solely the Company and one or more
Company Subsidiaries or solely Company Subsidiaries, or (b) altering any
intercompany arrangements or agreements or the ownership structure among the
Company and its wholly owned Subsidiaries or among the Companys

 



61  wholly owned Subsidiaries, the Company shall consult with Parent reasonably
prior to consummating any such transaction and shall not proceed with any such
action or transaction described in clause (a) or (b) hereof without Parents
consent (not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed) if such
action or transaction would, without taking into account any action or
transaction entered into by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including,
after the Effective Time, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), reasonably
be expected to have adverse Tax consequences that, individually or in the
aggregate, are material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or, after
the Effective Time, to Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries.

Effect, as the case may be, or which would reasonably be expected to prevent
or materially delay or impede the consummation of the Transactions; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section 6.1(c)_ shall not cure any breach of any representation or warranty
requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the date of this Agreement

referenced in _Section 6.2(a)_ to obtain all waiting period expirations or
terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, orders, registrations,
approvals, permits, and authorizations for the Transactions under the HSR Act,
(i) cooperate in all respects and consult with each other in connection with
any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other
inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, including by
allowing the other Party to have a reasonable opportunity to review
in advance and comment on drafts of filings and submissions; (ii) promptly
inform the other Party of any communication received by such Party from, or
given by such Party to, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice
(the " _DOJ_ "), the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") or any other
Governmental Entity, by promptly providing copies to the other Party of any
such written communications, and of any material communication received
or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case
regarding any of the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that materials may
be redacted (A) to remove references concerning the valuation of Parent, the
Company or any of their Subsidiaries, (B) as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements, and (C) as necessary to address reasonable privilege
or confidentiality concerns; and (iii) permit the other Party to review in
advance any communication that it gives to, and consult with each other in
advance of any meeting, substantive telephone call or conference with, the
DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental Entity, or, in connection with any
proceeding by a private party, with any other Person ( _provided_ , _however_
, that materials may be redacted (A) to remove references concerning the
valuation of Parent, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries, (B) as
necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (C) as necessary to
address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns), and to the extent
permitted by the DOJ, the FTC or any other applicable Governmental Entity or
other Person, give the other Party the opportunity to attend and participate
in any in-person meetings with the DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental
Entity or other Person. In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants
of the Parties contained in _Section 6.2(a)_ and this  _Section 6.2(b)_,
each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve objections, if
any, as may be asserted with respect to the Transactions under any Antitrust
Law including agreeing to any terms, conditions or modifications (including
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries having to cease
operating, license, sell or otherwise dispose of any assets or businesses
(including the requirement that any such assets or businesses be held
separate)) with respect to obtaining the expiration or termination of any
waiting period or any consents, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or
orders in connection with the consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall not be required to take such actions under this
_Section 6.2(b)_ that would result in, or would be reasonably likely to
result in, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect
on Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
after giving effect to the Merger. Nothing in this _Section 6.2(b)_ shall
require Parent, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries to take or agree
to take any action with respect to its business or operations unless the
effectiveness of such agreement or action is conditioned upon the Closing.
Parent shall, on behalf of the Parties, control and lead all communications
and strategy relating to the Antitrust Laws (provided that the Company is not
constrained from complying with applicable Law), _provided_ , _further_ , that
the Parties shall consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good
faith the views of one another, regarding the form and content of any
analyses,

 



64  appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of either Party in connection with
proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law prior to their submission.

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain the expiration or termination of all waiting periods and all
consents, waivers, authorizations and approvals of all third parties,
including Governmental Entities, necessary, proper or advisable for the
consummation of the Transactions and to provide any notices to third parties
required to be provided prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that, without
the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not incur any
significant expense or liability, enter into any significant new commitment
or agreement or agree to any significant modification to any contractual
arrangement to obtain such consents or certificates in each case, that would
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 6.3 _Publicity_. So long as this Agreement is in effect, neither the
Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective affiliates, shall issue or
cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement with
respect to the Merger or this Agreement without the prior consent of the other
Party, unless such Party determines, after consultation with outside counsel,
that it is required by applicable Law or by any listing agreement with or the
listing rules of a national securities exchange or trading market to issue or
cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement with
respect to the Merger or this Agreement, in which event such Party shall
endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the circumstances, to provide a
meaningful opportunity to the other Party to review and comment upon such
press release or other announcement in advance and shall give due
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto; _provided, however_ , that the Company shall not be required by this
_Section 6.3_ to provide any such review or comment to Parent in connection
with the receipt and existence of a Company Competing Proposal or a Company
Change of Recommendation and matters related thereto; _provided, further_ ,
that Parent shall not be required by this  _Section 6.3_ to provide any such
review or comment to the Company in connection with the receipt and existence
of a Parent Competing Proposal or a Parent Change of Recommendation and
matters related thereto; _provided, further_ , each Party and their
respective affiliates may make statements that are not inconsistent with
previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by
Parent or the Company in compliance with this _Section 6.3_.

 

Section 6.4 _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification_. For not
less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent agrees to,
and to cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless all
past and present directors, officers and employees of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against
any costs or expenses (including advancing attorneys fees and expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any actual or threatened claim, suit,
proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent
permitted by Law; _provided_ such Indemnified Party agrees in advance to
return any such funds to which a court of competent jurisdiction has
determined in a final, nonappealable judgment such Indemnified Party is not
ultimately entitled), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities
and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened
claim, action, investigation, suit or proceeding in respect of acts or
omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the

 



65  Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring in connection with the
approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger or any of the
other Transactions), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, in connection with such persons serving as an officer,
director, employee or other fiduciary of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or of any Person if such service was at the request or for the
benefit of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law or provided pursuant to the Company Governing
Documents or the organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary or any
indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this
Agreement. The Parties agree that all rights to elimination of liability,
indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring or
alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted
or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, now existing in favor of
the Indemnified Parties as provided in their respective certificate of
incorporation or by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) or in any
agreement shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect. For six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause to be maintained in effect the provisions in (i) the
Company Governing Documents and the organizational documents of any Company
Subsidiary and (ii) any other agreements of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries with any Indemnified Party, in each case, regarding elimination
of liability, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses that are in existence on the date of this Agreement,
and no such provision shall be amended, modified or repealed in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights or protections thereunder of any such
Indemnified Party in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have
occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions
occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger or any of the other Transactions). Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for an aggregate period of not
less than six (6) years from the Effective Time, the Companys current
directors and officers an insurance and indemnification policy that provides
coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO
Insurance_") that is no less favorable than the Companys existing policy or,
if insurance coverage that is no less favorable is unavailable, the best
available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation
shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess
of three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid prior to the
date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company may prior to
the Effective Time substitute therefor a single premium tail coverage with
respect to DandO Insurance with an annual cost not in excess of three hundred
percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Indemnified
Party notifies Parent on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Effective Time of a matter in respect of which such Person may seek
indemnification pursuant to this _Section 6.4_, the provisions of this
_Section 6.4_ shall continue in effect with respect to such matter until the
final disposition of all claims, actions, investigations, suits and
proceedings relating thereto. In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.4_. The rights
and obligations under this _Section 6.4_ shall survive consummation of the
Merger and shall not be terminated or amended in

 



66  a manner that is adverse to any Indemnified Party without the written
consent of such Indemnified Party.

 

Section 6.5 _Takeover Statutes_. The Parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover
Statute is or becomes applicable to the Merger or any of the other
Transactions and (b) if any such Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to
any of the foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the Merger and the
other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the
effect of such Takeover Statute on the Merger and the other Transactions.

 

Section 6.6 _Obligations of Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation_. Parent
shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement and
to consummate the Transactions, including the Merger, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

Section 6.7 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, assume, honor and
fulfill (i) all of the Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms
as in effect immediately prior to the date hereof or as subsequently amended
as permitted pursuant to the terms of such Company Benefit Plans or as
permitted pursuant to _Section 5.1_ hereof, and (ii) all of the Company
Benefit Plans established following the date hereof in accordance with
_Section 5.1_ hereof. Effective as of the Effective Time and for a period of
no less than one (1) year thereafter, Parent shall provide, or shall cause
the Surviving Company to provide, to each employee of the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by the Parent or the Surviving
Company or any Subsidiary thereof (the " _Continuing Employees_ "), (x)
compensation (including cash incentive compensation opportunities, but
excluding any equity-based compensation) that is no less favorable than the
compensation provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (y) equity-based compensation that is no less favorable than
the equity-based compensation provided to similarly situated employees of
Parent and (z) employee benefits that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable
than those provided to the Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time. In addition, effective as of the Effective Time and for a
period of no less than one (1) year thereafter, each Continuing Employee shall
be eligible to participate in any applicable severance plans, programs and/or
arrangements maintained by Parent and in accordance with the terms set forth
on _Section 6.7(a)_ the Company Disclosure Letter. Effective as of the
Effective Time and thereafter, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the
Surviving Company to provide, that periods of employment with the Company
(including any current or former affiliate of the Company or any predecessor
of the Company) shall be taken into account for all purposes under all
employee benefit plans maintained by Parent or an affiliate of Parent for the
benefit of the Continuing Employees, including vacation or other paid-time-off
plans or arrangements, 401(k), pension or other retirement plans and any
severance or health or welfare plans (other than for purposes of determining
any accrued benefit under any defined benefit pension plan or as would result
in a duplication of benefits).

 



67 (b) Effective as of the Effective Time and thereafter, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Company to, (i) ensure that no eligibility waiting
periods, actively-at-work requirements or pre-existing condition limitations
or exclusions shall apply with respect to the Continuing Employees under the
applicable health and welfare benefits plan of Parent or any affiliate of
Parent (except to the extent applicable under Company Benefit Plans
immediately prior to the Effective Time), (ii) waive any and all evidence of
insurability requirements with respect to such Continuing Employees to the
extent such evidence of insurability requirements were not applicable to the
Continuing Employees under the Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (iii) credit each Continuing Employee with all deductible
payments, out-of-pocket or other co-payments paid by such employee under the
Company Benefit Plans prior to the Closing Date during the year in which the
Closing occurs for the purpose of determining the extent to which any such
employee has satisfied his or her deductible and whether he or she has reached
the out-of-pocket maximum under any health benefit plan of Parent or an
affiliate of Parent for such year. The Merger shall not affect any
Continuing Employees accrual of, or right to use, in accordance with Company
policy as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, any personal,
sick, vacation or other paid-time-off accrued but unused by such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any
right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving Company
or any affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the
rights of Parent, the Surviving Company or any affiliate of Parent, which
rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services
of any Continuing Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or
without cause, except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a written
agreement between Parent, the Surviving Company, the Company or any affiliate
of Parent and the Continuing Employee or any severance, benefit or other
applicable plan or program covering such Continuing Employee. Notwithstanding
any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this  _Section
6.7_ shall (i) be deemed or construed to be an amendment or other modification
of any Company Benefit Plan or employee benefit plan of Merger Sub, or (ii)
create any third party rights in any current or former service provider of
the Company or its affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

Section 6.8 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent
shall, as applicable, take all such steps as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable hereto to cause any dispositions of Company equity securities
(including derivative securities) and acquisitions of Parent equity
securities pursuant to the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is a director or officer of the Company subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 6.9 _Security Holder Litigation_. Each Party shall provide the other
Party prompt oral notice of any litigation brought by any shareholder of that
Party against such Party, any of its Subsidiaries and/or any of their
respective directors relating to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the
Transactions. Unless (i) in the case of such litigation with respect to the
Company, the Company Board of Directors has made or is considering making a
Company Change of Recommendation or (ii) in the case of such litigation with
respect to Parent, the Parent Board of Directors has made or is considering
making a Parent Change of Recommendation,

 



68  each Party shall give the other Party the opportunity to participate (at
such other Partys expense) in the defense or settlement of any such
litigation, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without the other
Partys prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, except that the other Party shall not be obligated to
consent to any settlement which does not include a full release of such other
Party and its affiliates or which imposes an injunction or other equitable
relief after the Effective Time upon Parent or any of its affiliates. In the
event of, and to the extent of, any conflict or overlap between the provisions
of this  _Section 6.9_ and _Section 5.1_, _Section 5.2_ or _Section 6.2_,
the provisions of this _Section 6.9_ shall control.

 

Section 6.10 _Delisting_. Each of the Parties agrees to cooperate with the
other Parties in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to
delist the Company Common Stock from the NASDAQ and terminate its registration
under the Exchange Act, _provided_ that such delisting and termination shall
not be effective until after the Effective Time.

 

Section 6.11 _Director Resignations_. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent resignations executed by each
director of the Company in office as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time and effective upon the Effective Time.

 

Section 6.12 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Parent Shares to be issued in the Merger to be approved
for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the
Effective Time.

 

Section 6.13 _The Company s Financing Cooperation_. The Company agrees to,
and to cause its Subsidiaries to, provide such assistance (and to use
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective officers, employees,
consultants and advisors, including legal and accounting advisors, to provide
such assistance) with the Financing as is reasonably requested by Parent,
including: (a) participation in, and assistance with, the marketing efforts
related to the Financing, including assisting Parent with Parents preparation
of customary confidential information memoranda, private placement memoranda,
prospectuses, offering memoranda and the other customary marketing materials
and information reasonably deemed necessary by the Financing Sources to
complete a successful syndication for delivery to potential syndicate
members and participants, including estimates, forecasts, projections and
other forward-looking financial information regarding the future performance
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries; (b) participation by senior
management, representatives and advisors of the Company in, and assistance
with, the preparation of rating agency presentations and meetings with rating
agencies, roadshows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and meetings
with prospective lenders and debt investors (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, direct contact with such rating agencies and prospective lenders and
debt investors); (c) delivery to Parent and its Financing Sources as promptly
as reasonably practicable of the Financing Deliverables (at least four (4)
business days prior to the Closing Date, to the extent requested in writing at
least nine (9) days prior to the Closing Date), the Financing Information
relating to the Company and such other financial information relating to the
Company customary or reasonably necessary for the completion of the Financing
to the extent reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the
preparation of customary offering or information documents to be used for the
Financing (which Financing Information, for the avoidance of doubt, may be
included in any such offering or information documents used for or distributed
in connection with the Financing); (d) use reasonable best efforts to cause
its independent auditors to cooperate with the Financing consistent with
their

 



69  customary practice, including by providing customary "comfort letters"
(including customary "negative assurances") and customary assistance with the
due diligence activities of Parent and the Financing Sources, and customary
consents to the inclusion of audit reports in any relevant marketing
materials, registration statements and related government filings; (e) using
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Financing (including the
syndication and marketing thereof) benefits from the existing lending and
investment banking relationships of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries;
(f) assisting Parent with Parents preparation of pro forma financial
information and pro forma financial statements and other materials for rating
agency presentations, bank information memoranda, financial projections and
similar documents used in connection with the Financing and
providing customary estimates and other forward-looking financial information
regarding the future performance of the business of the Company to the extent
reasonably requested by the Financing Sources, and providing customary
authorization and representation letters in connection therewith, and (g)
executing and delivering definitive financing documents, including pledge and
security documents, and certificates, management representation letters and
other documents, to the extent reasonably requested by Parent, and otherwise
reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral. The Company hereby
consents to the use of all of its and its Subsidiaries logos in connection
with the Financing, provided that such logos are used solely in a manner that
is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary. Notwithstanding any other provision set forth herein or
in any other agreement between the Company and Parent (or its affiliates),
the Company agrees that Parent and its affiliates may share customary
projections with respect to the Company and its business with the Financing
Sources identified in the Debt Commitment Letter, and that Parent, its
affiliates and such Financing Sources may share such information with
potential Financing Sources in connection with any marketing efforts in
connection with the Financing, _provided_ that the recipients of such
information agree to customary confidentiality arrangements. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective directors or officers or other
personnel shall be required by this _Section 6.13_ (i) to take any action or
provide any assistance to the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the
ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries; (ii) to pass
resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the execution of the
Financing or the Debt Financing Documents; or (iii) to execute or deliver any
certificate, document, instrument or agreement that is effective prior to the
Closing or agree to any change or modification of any existing certificate,
document, instrument or agreement that would be effective prior to the
Closing. Parent shall (1) promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with providing the assistance contemplated by this
_Section 6.13_ and (2) indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors, officers, personnel and
advisors from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims,
costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), interest, awards,
judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with
the Financing or any assistance or activities in connection therewith, in each
case other than to the extent any of the foregoing arises from the bad faith,
gross negligence or willful misconduct of, or breach of this Agreement by any
such Person.

Section 6.14  _Parent s Financing Cooperation_. Parent shall cause MIFSA to
take, or use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be taken, all actions and
do, or use its reasonable best

 



70  efforts to cause to be done, all things necessary to obtain the Financing on
or prior to the Closing Date on the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter, including: (a) maintaining in effect and enforcing the
Debt Commitment Letter and complying with its obligations thereunder; (b)
participation by senior management of MIFSA in, and assistance with, the
preparation of rating agency presentations and meetings with rating agencies;
(c) satisfying (or, if deemed advisable by MIFSA, obtaining the waiver of) on
a timely basis all conditions to the Financing (including the Financing
Conditions) that are within Parents control; (d) negotiating, executing and
delivering Debt Financing Documents that reflect the terms contained in the
Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Fee Letter (including any "flex" provisions
related thereto); and (e) drawing a sufficient amount of the Financing to
enable Parent to consummate the Transactions, in the event that the conditions
set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ and the Financing Conditions
have been satisfied or, upon funding would be satisfied. Parent shall cause
MIFSA to give the Company prompt notice of any breach or threatened breach by
any party to the Debt Commitment Letter of which MIFSA becomes aware which
would affect the availability of the Financing on the Closing Date. Without
limiting Parents other obligations under this _Section 6.14_, if a Financing
Failure Event occurs Parent shall cause MIFSA to (i) immediately notify the
Company of such Financing Failure Event and the reasons therefor, (ii) in
consultation with the Company, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
alternative financing from alternative Financing Sources on terms (including
conditionality, structure, covenants and pricing) not materially less
beneficial in the aggregate to the Company and Parent, with lenders reasonably
satisfactory to MIFSA, in an amount sufficient to consummate the Transactions,
as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, and (iii)
to the extent MIFSA obtains a new financing commitment in respect of such
alternative financing, provide a copy of such new commitment to the Company.
Parent shall cause MIFSA to not, without the Companys prior written consent,
agree to any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any provision or
remedy under, or voluntarily replace (it being understood that any alternative
financing obtained pursuant to the preceding sentence shall not be deemed a
voluntary replacement for purposes of this sentence) the Debt Commitment
Letter if such amendment, modification or waiver or voluntary replacement (i)
would reasonably be expected to (x) materially adversely affect the ability of
Parent or Merger Sub to timely consummate the Transactions or (y) make the
timely funding of the Financing or the satisfaction of the conditions to
obtaining the Financing materially less likely to occur, (ii) changes the
conditions to obtaining the Financing, unless such amendment, modification or
waiver results in conditions that are in the aggregate substantially
equivalent (or that are more favorable to the Company and Parent), (iii)
reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing or (iv) materially adversely
affects the ability of MIFSA or its affiliates to enforce their rights against
the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Fee Letter.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent or Merger Sub may cause MIFSA to replace
or amend the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt Fee Letter and any other Debt
Financing Documents (I) to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date hereof, (II) to implement or exercise any
"flex" provisions provided in the Debt Fee Letter as in effect on the date of
this Agreement or (III) to the extent such action would not be prohibited by
the preceding sentence. Parent shall cause MIFSA keep the Company reasonably
informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts to obtain
the Financing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
_Section 6.14_, Parent shall not be 

 



71  required to take any action that could constitute financial assistance in
violation of Law, as determined by Parent in its reasonable discretion.

 

Parent shall have the right to substitute the proceeds of consummated
offerings or other incurrences of debt (including unsecured notes) for all or
any portion of the Financing by reducing commitments under the Debt Commitment
Letter; _provided_ , that to the extent any such debt has a scheduled special
or mandatory redemption right, such right is not exercisable prior to the
earlier of the consummation of the Transactions on the Closing Date, the
termination of this Agreement or the Outside Date (for the avoidance of doubt
as it may be extended pursuant to this Agreement). Further, Parent shall have
the right to substitute commitments in respect of other debt financing for
all or any portion of the Financing from the same and/or alternative bona fide
third-party financing sources (" _Replacement Financing Sources_ ") so long
as (i) all conditions precedent to effectiveness of definitive documentation
for such debt financing have been satisfied and the conditions precedent to
funding of such debt financing are in the aggregate, in respect of certainty
of funding, substantially equivalent to (or more favorable to the Company
than) the Financing Conditions, and (ii) prior to funding of any loans
thereunder, the commitments in respect of such debt financing are subject to
restrictions on assignment which are in the aggregate substantially
equivalent to or more favorable to the Company than the corresponding
restrictions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (any such debt or equity
financing which satisfies the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), the "
_Replacement Financing_ "; the definitive documentation for any such
Replacement Financing, the " _Replacement Financing Documents_ "). The
representations, warranties, covenants and other restrictions of Parent
and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement with respect to the Financing and
the Debt Commitment Letter shall apply equally to any Replacement Financing
and Replacement Financing Documents.

 

Section 6.15 _Parent Board and Committee Representation_.

 

(a) Parent shall take such actions as are necessary to cause Don M. Bailey,
Angus C. Russell and Virgil D. Thompson to become members of the Parent Board
of Directors immediately after the Effective Time. The new members appointed
to the Parent Board of Directors in accordance with this _Section 6.15_ shall
be ratified by the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Parent Board of
Directors pursuant to the director nomination process set forth in Parents
proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on January 24, 2014, to
serve on the Parent Board of Directors, initially, until the next annual
general meeting of Parents shareholders in accordance with the Parent
Governing Documents, and who shall also be nominated by the Parent Board of
Directors for election (or re-election) to the Parent Board of Directors at
the next annual general meeting of Parents shareholders in accordance with
the Parent Governing Documents, to serve until the next subsequent annual
general meeting of the Parents shareholders and until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualify. If any of Don M. Bailey, Angus C.
Russell and Virgil D. Thompson refuse, or are unable, to serve on the Parent
Board of Directors, a mutually agreeable replacement will be selected by the
Company and Parent and ratified by the Nominating and Governance Committee of
the Parent Board of Directors in accordance with the director nomination
process discussed in the immediately preceding sentence.

 



72 (b) The Parent Board of Directors shall take such actions as are necessary
to create as of immediately after the Effective Time a new committee of the
Parent Board of Directors, which shall be composed of three members: the Chief
Executive Officer of the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(who shall be the chair of such committee), the Chief Executive Officer of
Parent as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and the Chair of the
Parent Board of Directors as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

_Section 6.13_, this _Section 8.2_ and _Section 9.3_ through _Section
9.13_ shall survive such termination; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing
herein shall relieve any Party from liability for fraud or a Willful Breach of

may be pursued only by the Company through actions expressly approved by the
Company Board of Directors) shall not be limited to reimbursement of
the Companys expenses or out-ofpocket costs, and may include, to the extent
proven, other damages suffered by the Company, and that the calculation of
damages suffered by the Company may include, to the extent proven, loss
suffered by the Companys shareholders (including, to the extent otherwise

(d) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section 8.2_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that (i) each of
the Company Termination Fee and the fee payable pursuant to _Section
8.2(b)(i)_ is not a penalty, but rather is a reasonable amount that will
compensate Parent and Merger Sub in the circumstances in which the Company
Termination Fee or the fee payable pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)(i)_ is payable
for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on
the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, and (ii) each of the
Parent Termination Fee and the fee payable pursuant to _Section 8.2(c)(i)_ is
not a penalty, but rather is a reasonable amount that will compensate the
Company in the circumstances in which the Parent Termination Fee or the fee
payable pursuant to _Section 8.2(c)(i)_ is payable for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the Transactions, each of which amounts would otherwise be impossible to
calculate with precision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, except in the case of fraud or Willful Breach, (A) upon payment of
the Company Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 8.2_, none of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or
future officers, directors, partners, shareholders, managers, members,
affiliates or agents shall have any further liability or obligation relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions and (B) upon payment
of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this  _Section 8.2_, none of the
Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or
future officers, directors, partners, shareholders, managers, members,
affiliates or agents shall have any further liability or obligation relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement (including _Section
8.2(a)_ and this _Section 8.2(d)_) shall in any way limit the provisions of
_Section 9.14_.

Section 9.7 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement
to Sections, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." As used in this Agreement, the term "affiliates" shall
have the meaning set forth in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. The table of
contents and headings set forth in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference purposes only and shall not affect or be deemed to affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or any term or provision
hereof. When reference is made herein to a Person, such reference shall be
deemed to include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such Person unless
otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires. All references herein
to the Subsidiaries of a Person shall be deemed to include all direct and
indirect Subsidiaries of such Person unless otherwise indicated or the context
otherwise requires. The Parties agree that they have been represented by
counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore,
waive the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule of construction
providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed
against the party drafting such agreement or document.

 

Section 9.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed manually or by
facsimile by the Parties, in any number of counterparts, each of which shall
be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when a
counterpart hereof shall have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered
to the other Parties.

 

Section 9.9 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

 

(a) This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent
Disclosure Letter) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and supersede all other prior

 



95  agreements (except that the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed
amended hereby so that until the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with _Section 8.1_, the Parties shall be permitted to take the actions
contemplated by this Agreement) and understandings, both written and oral,
among the Parties or any of them with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof.

 

(b) Except as provided in _Section 6.4_ and the last sentence of _Section
6.13_, no provision of this Agreement (including _Section 8.2(a)_ and
including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter) or
the Confidentiality Agreement is intended to confer upon any Person other than
the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder; _provided_ that nothing in this
_Section 9.9(b)_ shall limit the right of the Company to seek damages as
contemplated by _Section 8.2(a)_; and _provided further_ that the Financing
Sources shall be express third party beneficiaries of this _Section 9.9(b)_
and _Section 9.1(c)_, _Section 9.11(a)(2)_, _Section 9.11(b)(2)_, _Section
9.12_ and _Section 9.15_, and each of such Sections shall expressly inure to
the benefit of the Financing Sources and the Financing Sources shall be
entitled to rely on and enforce the provisions of such Sections. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties.

Section 9.10 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the Merger is not affected in any manner adverse to any
Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
Merger is fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

Section 9.11 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) (1) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to conflicts of laws
principles that would result in the application of the Law of any other
jurisdiction; _provided_ , _howeve_ r, that (i) the Merger (to the extent
required by the Laws of the State of California to be governed thereby) and
matters relating to the conduct of directors of the Company, shall be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of California,
without giving effect to conflicts of laws principles that would result in
the application of the Law of any other jurisdiction, and (ii) the matters
relating to the conduct of directors of Parent, shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of Ireland, without giving effect to
conflicts of laws principles that would result in the application of the Law
of any other jurisdiction. (2) Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Company (on behalf of itself and each Company Related Party) and
each of the other Parties hereto agrees that any claim, controversy or
dispute of any kind or nature (whether based upon contract, tort or otherwise)
against a Financing Source that is in any way related to this Agreement, the
Merger or any of the other Transactions, including any dispute arising out of
or relating in any way to the Financing shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflict
of law principles (other than Sections 5-1401 and 5-1402 of the New York
General Obligations Law); _provided_ that (i) the interpretation of the
definition of Company Material Adverse Effect and whether or not a Company
Material Adverse Effect has occurred,

 



96  (ii) the determination of the accuracy of any Acquisition Agreement Target
Representations (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter) and whether as a
result of any inaccuracy thereof Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
affiliates have the right to terminate its obligations under this Agreement,
or to decline to consummate the Transactions pursuant to this Agreement and
(iii) the determination of whether the Transactions have been consummated in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, in each case, shall be governed
by, and construed and interpreted solely in accordance with, the laws of the
State of Delaware without giving effect to conflicts of laws principles that
would result in the application of the Law of any other state.

(b) (1) Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court
finds it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Federal court of the
United States of America sitting in Delaware, and appellate courts thereof,
in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the agreements delivered in connection herewith or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any
judgment relating thereto, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding
except in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and only
if) such court finds it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Federal court
of the United States of America sitting in Delaware, and appellate courts
thereof, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such action
or proceeding may be heard and determined in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court finds it lacks subject
matter jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of America sitting
in Delaware, and appellate courts thereof, (iii) waives, to the fullest
extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in such
courts and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense
of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in
such courts. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any
such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.
Each Party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process inside
or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this
_Section 9.11(b)(1)_ in the manner provided for notices in _Section 9.4_.
Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any Party to this Agreement
to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law. (2) Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the Company (on behalf of itself and each
Company Related Party) and each of the other Parties hereto (A) agrees that it
will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or
third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in
any way relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
Transactions, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to
the Financing or the performance thereof or the transactions contemplated
thereby, in any forum other than exclusively in the Supreme Court of the State
of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable Law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York in the County of New York (and appellate
courts thereof), (B) submits for itself and its property with respect to any
such action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, (C) agrees that
service of process, summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed
to it at its address provided in _Section 9.4_ shall be effective service of
process against it for any such action brought in any such court, (D) waives
and hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any
objection which it 

 



97  may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such action in any such court
and (E) agrees that a final judgment in any such action shall be conclusive
and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by Law.

 

Section 9.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
MERGER, THE FINANCING AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY
(INCLUDING ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST ANY FINANCING
SOURCE). EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS
OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.12_.

 

Section 9.13 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of the
Parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other Parties, except that Merger Sub may assign, in its sole
discretion and without the consent of any other party, any or all of its
rights, interests and obligations hereunder to (i) Parent, (ii) Parent and
one or more direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent, or (iii)
one or more direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent; _provided_
, that no such assignment shall be permitted without the prior written
consent of the other Parties if such assignment could delay the Closing,
increase the risk that any of the conditions set forth in Article VII may not
be timely satisfied, result in a breach of any of covenants and agreements
set forth in this Agreement or adversely affect the Company; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any
obligation or liability under this Agreement. Subject to the
preceding sentence, but without relieving any Party of any obligation
hereunder, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 

Section 9.14 _Enforcement; Remedies_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such
Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

 

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable injury will occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or is otherwise breached. It is agreed that prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ , each Party shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or remedy any

 



98  breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by any other Party, to a
decree or order of specific performance specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of this Agreement and to any further equitable relief.

(c) The Parties rights in this _Section 9.14_ are an integral part of
the Transactions and each Party hereby waives any objections to any remedy
referred to in this _Section 9.14_ (including any objection on the basis that
there is an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of such remedy is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity). For the avoidance of
doubt, each Party agrees that there is not an adequate remedy at Law for a
breach of this Agreement by any Party. In the event any Party seeks any remedy
referred to in this  _Section 9.14_, such Party shall not be required to
obtain, furnish, post or provide any bond or other security in connection with
or as a condition to obtaining any such remedy.

 

Section 9.15 _Liability of Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the Company (on behalf of itself and each Company
Related Party (other than Parent and Merger Sub)) agrees that neither it nor
any other Company Related Party (other than Parent and Merger Sub) shall have
any rights or claims against any Financing Source in connection with this
Agreement, the Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby;
_provided_ that, following consummation of the Merger, the foregoing will not
limit the rights of the parties to the Financing under the Debt Financing
Documents. In addition, in no event will any Financing Source be liable for
consequential, special, exemplary, punitive or indirect damages (including any
loss of profits, business or anticipated savings) or damages of a
tortious nature.
