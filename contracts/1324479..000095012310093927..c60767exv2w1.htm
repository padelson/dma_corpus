 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and for other good and valuable 

   ##### 

  

 

consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged
and accepted, and intending to be legally bound, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company hereby agree as follows: 

   

ARTICLE I 

   

THE MERGER 

  

 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL, at the Effective Time Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. At the Effective Time and as a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger. The Company, in its capacity as the surviving corporation of the Merger, is sometimes referred to herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_." 

  

 1.2 _The Effective Time_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause the Merger to be consummated under the DGCL by filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Secretary of State_ ") a certificate of merger relating to the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") in such form as is required by, and executed and acknowledged in accordance with, the applicable provisions of the DGCL (the time of such filing with the Delaware Secretary of State, or such later time as may be agreed in writing by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger, being referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

 1.3 _The Closing_. The consummation of the Merger shall take place at a closing (the " _Closing_ ") to occur at the offices of Latham and Watkins, LLP, 885 Third Avenue, New York, New York, 10022, at 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the third (3rd) Business Day after the later to occur of (x) the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder), of those conditions at such time) and (y) the final day of the Marketing Period or (in the case of this clause (y)) such earlier date as may be specified by Parent by written notice to the Company, or in any case at such other location, date and time as Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall mutually agree upon in writing. The date upon which the Closing shall actually occur pursuant hereto is referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_." 

  

 1.4 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

   ##### 

  

  

 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. 

  

 (a) _Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company (the " _Certificate of Incorporation_ ") shall be amended as of the Effective Time to read in its entirety in the form of the certificate of incorporation attached hereto as _Exhibit B_, and, as so amended, shall become the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL and such certificate of incorporation; _provided_ that any such amendment shall be subject to the provisions of _Section 5.10(a)_. 

   

 (b) _Bylaws_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that the bylaws of the Company in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be amended in their entirety in the form of the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such bylaws;  _provided_ that (i) any such amendment shall be subject to the provisions of _Section 5.10(a)_ and (ii) prior to the Closing, Parent will cause the bylaws of Merger Sub to be amended to the extent necessary to cause them to meet the requirements of _Section 5.10(a)_. 

   

 1.6 _Directors and Officers_. 

  

 (a) _Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) _Officers_. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly appointed or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 1.7 _Effect on Capital Stock_. 

  

 (a) _Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, or the holders of any of the following securities, the following shall occur: 

   

 (i) each share of Company Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be canceled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $33.00 (the " _Per Share Price_ "), without interest thereon; and 

   ##### 

  

  

 (ii) each share of Company Common Stock that is held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent or Merger Sub, or by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub (other than Intermediate Holdco), in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Owned Company Shares_ "), shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor, and each share of Company Common Stock that is held by Intermediate Holdco or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company (if any) shall remain outstanding and shall become that number of shares of the Surviving Corporation that bears the same ratio to the aggregate number of outstanding shares of the Surviving Corporation as the number of shares of Company Common Stock held by such Company Subsidiary bore to the aggregate number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time; and 

  

 (iii) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, and thereupon each certificate representing ownership of such shares of common stock of Merger Sub shall thereafter represent ownership of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b) _Adjustment to Per Share Price_. The Per Share Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock, but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the granting or other issuance of Company RSU Awards and Company Options in accordance with this Agreement), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other like change or transaction with respect to Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, in each case which is effected in accordance with or otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement. 

   

 (c) _Dissenting Shares_. 

   

 (i) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, subject to  _Section 1.7(c)(ii)_, any shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who has properly exercised appraisal rights for such shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and who, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost or failed to perfect such appraisal rights (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive the Per Share Price pursuant to _Section 1.7(a)_, but instead shall be converted into the right to receive only such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares under the DGCL. From and after the Effective Time, a holder of Dissenting Shares shall not be entitled to exercise any of the voting rights or other rights of an equity owner of the Surviving Company or of a stockholder of Parent. 

  

 (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 1.7(c)(i)_, if any holder of shares of Company Common Stock who demands appraisal for such shares in accordance with the DGCL shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to appraisal, then such holders shares shall no longer be Dissenting Shares and shall automatically 

   ##### 

  

 

be converted into and represent only the right to receive the Per Share Price
as set forth in  _Section 1.7(a)_, without any interest thereon. 

   

 (iii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal rights of any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company which relate to any such demand for appraisal rights and (B) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings which take place prior to the Effective Time with respect to demands for appraisal rights under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal rights of Company Common Stock or offer to settle or settle any such demands. 

  

 (d) _Company Stock-based Awards_. 

   

 (i) Except as provided in _Section 1.7(d)(iii)_, at the Effective Time and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each then-outstanding Company RSU Award, whether or not vested and without regard to any performance criteria set forth therein, shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount (less any applicable withholding tax) in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the Per Share Price (such product, the " _RSU Consideration_ "). Parent shall, or shall cause the Company to, pay to holders of Company RSU Awards the RSU Consideration, without interest thereon, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payments, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time. 

  

 (ii) Except as provided in _Section 1.7(d)(iii)_, at the Effective Time and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each then-outstanding Company Option, whether or not vested, shall be cancelled, and (A) in the case of any Company Option having a per share exercise price less than the Per Share Price (an " _In-the-Money Option_ "), be converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation, for each share of Company Common Stock subject to such In-the-Money Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, an amount (less any applicable withholding tax) in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such In-the-Money Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the amount by which the Per Share Price exceeds the per share exercise price of such In-the-Money Option (such product, the " _Option Consideration_ "), or (B) in the case of any Company Option having a per share exercise price equal to or greater than the Per Share Price, no cash shall be paid nor other securities or consideration issued in respect thereof. Parent shall, or shall cause the Company to, pay to each holder of In-the-Money Options the Option Consideration, without interest thereon, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payments, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time. 

  

 (iii) Unless, prior to the Effective Time, Parent elects for _Sections 1.7(d)(i)_ and  _1.7(d)(ii)_ to apply, at the Effective Time and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each Company Option and Company RSU Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and is set forth on _Section 1.7(d)(iii)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (each an " _Assumed Award_ ") shall be assumed or substituted by Parent and converted automatically at the Effective Time into an option or restricted stock unit award, as the 

   ##### 

  

 

case may be, denominated in shares of common stock of Parent (" _Parent Common
Stock_ ") and with other terms and conditions substantially similar to those
of the related Company Option or Company RSU Award, as the case may be,
except that the receipt of Parent Common Stock from such Assumed Award shall
be conditioned on the holder executing and delivering to Parent a
stockholders agreement in the form prepared by Parent and (i) the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such Assumed Award shall be
determined by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock subject to
such Assumed Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share) and (ii) if
applicable, the exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded
upwards to the nearest whole cent) shall equal (x) the per share exercise
price for the shares of Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such
Assumed Award immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (y) the
Exchange Ratio. The "Exchange Ratio" shall be equal to the quotient of (1)
the Per Share Price, divided by (2) the fair market value of a share of
Parent Common Stock immediately following the Effective Time, as determined
by Parent consistent with the price paid by the Affiliates of Parent for
(including contributions by such Affiliates with respect to) a share of
Parent Common Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, unless, prior to the
Effective Time, Parent elects for _Sections 1.7(d)(i)_ and  _1.7(d)(ii)_ to
apply, no Assumed Award shall be entitled to consideration pursuant to 
_Sections 1.7(d)(i)_ or _1.7(d)(ii)_. It is the intention of the parties that
the assumption of the Assumed Awards that are stock options be performed in a
manner that is in compliance with the adjustment requirements of Section 409A
of the Code. Notwithstanding anything in an award agreement or in the
Companys equity incentive plans to the contrary, any holder of an Assumed
Award shall, subject to such holder executing and delivering to Parent a
stockholders agreement in the form prepared by Parent, be entitled to
satisfy his or her income tax withholding obligations with respect to the
exercise or vesting, as the case may be, of an Assumed Award and payment of
the exercise price, if applicable, by the surrender of shares of Common Stock
otherwise purchasable or deliverable upon such exercise or vesting. 

   

 (iv) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions as may be necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this  _Section 1.7(d)_, including by delivering to the holders of Company RSU Awards and the holders of Company Options notices, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, setting forth such holders rights pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 1.8 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment agent for the Merger (the " _Payment Agent_ "). 

   

 (b) _Exchange Fund_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, for payment to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of this _Article I_, an amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to which holders of Company Common Stock become entitled under this _Article I_ (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, payments with respect to Dissenting Shares or payments to which holders of Company RSU Awards and holders of Company Options become entitled, which Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, in accordance with _Section 1.7(d)_). From time to time after the Effective Time, if any Dissenting Shares lose their status as Dissenting 

      ##### 

  

    

Shares, and are converted into the right to receive the Per Share Price in
accordance with  _Section 1.7(c)(ii)_, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with the Payment Agent additional funds equal to the product of
(x) the number of such former Dissenting Shares multiplied by (y) the Per
Share Price (less any applicable withholding Tax). Until disbursed in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such cash shall
be invested by the Payment Agent (such cash being referred to herein as the "
_Exchange Fund_ ") as directed by Parent; _provided_  that such investments
shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America,
in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P1 or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances
of commercial banks with capital exceeding $5 billion (based on the most
recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available), or
in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment category
granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of investment. Any
income from investment of the Exchange Fund, which shall be in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, will be payable to the
Surviving Corporation. To the extent that there are any losses with respect
to any such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below
the level required for the Payment Agent to make prompt cash payment under
_Section 1.7(a)_, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that
the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the
Payment Agent to make such payments under _Section 1.7(a)_. 

   

 (c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Closing Date (but in no event more than three (3) Business Days thereafter), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Uncertificated Shares_ ") (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent), and/or (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this  _Article I_. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash, payable by check or wire transfer of immediately available Funds to an account designated by such holder, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate, by (y) the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding taxes payable in respect thereof), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Upon receipt of an "agents message" by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the holders of such Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash, payable by check or wire transfer of immediately available Funds to an account designated by such holder, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holders transferred Uncertificated Shares, by (y) the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding taxes payable in respect thereof), and the transferred Uncertificated 

      ##### 

  

    

Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. The Payment Agent shall
accept such Certificates and transferred Uncertificated Shares upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may
impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares on the Per Share Price
payable upon the surrender of such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares
pursuant to this _Section 1.8_. Until so surrendered, outstanding
Certificates and Uncertificated Shares shall be deemed from and after the
Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the Per Share Price,
without interest thereon, payable in respect thereof pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article I_. 

   

 (d) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, or if the Per Share Price is to be paid in a name other than that in which the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares surrendered in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, the Per Share Price may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated Shares so surrendered is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer (and after compliance with any other procedures reasonably required by the Payment Agent or the Surviving Corporation to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence payment of any applicable Taxes) and the Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) or the Surviving Corporation any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Price to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer or other Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable. 

   

 (e) _Required Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of the Payment Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Company RSU Awards and Company Options such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under U.S. federal or state, local or non-U.S. Tax laws. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. 

   

 (f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

   

 (g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to the Surviving Corporation_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have not theretofore surrendered their Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of 

      ##### 

  

    

Company Common Stock for exchange pursuant to the provisions of this _Section
1.8_ shall thereafter look for payment of the Per Share Price payable in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws), as general
creditors thereof, for any claim to the applicable Per Share Price to which
such holders may be entitled pursuant to the provisions of this _Article
I_. 

   

 1.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. Except as provided in  _Section 1.7(a)(ii)_, from and after the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist, and each holder of Uncertificated Shares or a Certificate theretofore representing any shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per Share Price payable therefor in accordance with the provisions of  _Section 1.7_ (or otherwise, in respect of Dissenting Shares, the right to receive consideration in accordance with _Section 1.7(c)_). The Per Share Price paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article I_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of the Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article I_. Without limiting the foregoing, no dividends or distributions with respect to the capital stock of the Company with a record date on or after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holders of any outstanding Certificates or Uncertificated Shares. 

  

 1.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 1.7_; _provided, however,_ that Parent may, in its sole discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share Price, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such reasonable sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

  

 1.11 _Necessary Further Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cause their respective directors and officers to take all such lawful and necessary action, so long as such action is not inconsistent with this Agreement.

The Company and its Subsidiaries have paid all premiums that are due as of the date of this Agreement for the current policy periods of such insurance policies. From December 31, 2009 through the date of this Agreement, no notice of cancellation has been received, and there is no existing default or event which, with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default, by any insured thereunder, except for such defaults that would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, there is no material claim pending under any of such policies as to which coverage is being questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters of such policies and there has been no threatened termination of any such policies. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in material compliance with all material insurance coverage requirements with respect to the operation of the Vessels. 

  

 2.26 _Related Party Transactions_.

The Special Committee has received the written opinion of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and subject to the assumptions and limitations set forth therein, the Per Share Price to be received by Company Stockholders in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders (other than Parent and its Affiliates, the parties to the Voting Agreement and the holders of Assumed Awards). 

  

 2.28 _Anti-Takeover Statutes Not Applicable_. Assuming that the representations of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in _Section 3.8_ are true and correct, the Company Board has 

   ##### 

  

 

taken all necessary actions such that the restrictions on business
combinations set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL and any other similar
applicable "anti-takeover" law will not be applicable to the Merger. The

respective partners, members, stockholders, directors, officers or other
Affiliates, in each case, which should be set forth in an amendment or

Filing, as the case may be, would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such

Event, the failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided,
however_ , that the Company shall not effect a Company Board Recommendation
Change unless: 

   

 (i) with respect to a Company Board Recommendation Change pursuant to  _Section 5.5(a)(x)_, the Company has complied with all of its obligations under  _Section 4.3_; 

  

 (ii) at least three (3) Business Days prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change the Company notifies Parent in writing that it intends to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change, which notice includes a reasonable description of the basis for such Company Board Recommendation Change and, in the case of a Superior Proposal, the identity of the party who made such Superior Proposal and all of the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and attaches to such notice the most current version of any agreement and/or other written proposal, if any, which embodies such Superior Proposal; 

  

 (iii) after providing such notice and prior to making such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) during such three (3) Business Day period with respect to any revisions to the terms of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent that, if made by Parent, would permit the Company not to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change; and 

  

 (iv) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any changes to this Agreement, the Equity Financing Letter, the Debt Commitment Letter and the Guarantee offered in writing by Parent and shall have determined (after consultation with its legal and financial advisors, and, in the case of an Acquisition Proposal, taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of such Acquisition Proposal and the offer from Parent) (A) in the case of a Company Board Recommendation Change that does not result from a Superior Proposal, that no change has been made by Parent that would obviate the need for such Company Board Recommendation Change and (B) in the case of a Company Board Recommendation Change in the case of an Acquisition Proposal, that such Acquisition Proposal would still constitute a Superior Proposal if such changes were to be given effect; _provided, further_ that in the event that the Acquisition Proposal is thereafter modified in any material respect ( _provided_ that any change in price will be considered material) by the party making such Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall again provide written notice of such modified terms and shall again comply with this _Section 5.5_, including providing a new period after such notice during which the Company will negotiate in good faith with Parent regarding any further proposed changes to the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 (b) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board or any authorized committee thereof from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Section 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the stockholders of the Company) in which the Company indicates that it has not changed the Company Board

Recommendation; _provided, however_ , that this _Section 5.5(b)_ shall not be
deemed to permit the Company Board to make a Company Board Recommendation
Change except to the extent permitted by this _Section 5.5(b)_. 

   

 (c) For purposes of _Section 4.3_, _Section 5.3_ and this _Section 5.5_, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company Board may act through the Special Committee, if the Special Committee is still in existence. 

   

 5.6 _Financing_. 

  

 (a) _Equity Financing_. 

   

 (i) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable terms and conditions of the Equity Financing Letter, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all actions, and do (or cause to be done) all things, necessary, proper or advisable to (A) obtain the Equity Financing contemplated by the Equity Financing Letter, (B) maintain in effect the Equity Financing Letter, (C) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub set forth in the Equity Financing Letter that are within its or its Affiliates reasonable control, and (D) consummate the Equity Financing contemplated by the Equity Financing Letter at or prior to the Closing. 

   

 (ii) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall amend, alter, or waive, or agree to amend, alter or waive (in any case whether by action or inaction), any term of the Equity Financing Letter without the prior written consent of the Company. Parent shall promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day) notify the Company of (A) the termination (or attempted or purported termination, whether or not valid) of the Equity Financing Letter, or (B) any refusal by the Guarantor to provide or any stated intent by the Guarantor to refuse to provide the full financing contemplated by the Equity Financing Letter when such Financing is required thereunder to be provided. 

   

 (b) _Debt Financing_. 

   

 (i) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, after giving effect to the "market flex" terms in the fee letter referred to therein, should such "market flex" terms be required (or on terms which would not be reasonably expected to delay or prevent the Closing (taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period), or make the funding of the Debt Financing less likely to occur), and use its respective reasonable best efforts to (A) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter and negotiate definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (or on terms which would not be reasonably expected to delay or prevent the Closing or make the funding of the Debt Financing less likely to occur), (B) satisfy on a timely basis (taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period) all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub set forth in such definitive agreements that are within their reasonable control, and (C) consummate the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter 

   ##### 

  

 

(or such lesser amount as may be required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) at or prior to the Closing. In the event that
all conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter (other than the availability of
funding of any of the Equity Financing) have been satisfied or upon funding
will be satisfied, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause such lenders and the other Persons providing such Debt
Financing to fund on the Closing Date the Debt Financing required to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise
enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be
required to obtain the Debt Financing prior to the first (1st) Business Day
after the final day of the Marketing Period. 

   

 (ii) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall amend, alter, or waive, or agree to amend, alter or waive (in any case, whether by action or inaction), any term of the Debt Commitment Letter or any provision of the fee letter referenced in the Debt Commitment Letter (to the extent any such amendment, alteration, or waiver would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the Closing or make the funding of the Debt Financing less likely to occur) without the prior written consent of the Company if such amendment, alteration or waiver reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (unless the Equity Financing is increased by a corresponding amount) or amends the conditions precedent to the Debt Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the Closing or make the funding of the Debt Financing less likely to occur; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent and Merger Sub may replace and/or amend the Debt Commitment Letter so long as (A) the terms would not be reasonably expected to delay or prevent the Closing or make the funding of the Debt Financing less likely to occur and (B) the conditions to the Debt Financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof would not be expanded in a manner that would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the Closing; and in any such event, Parent shall disclose to the Company its intention to obtain such alternative financing, shall keep the Company informed of the terms thereof and shall deliver to the Company final drafts of the commitment letter (the " _New Debt Commitment Letter_ ") providing for such alternative financing. The term " _Debt Financing_ " as used herein shall be deemed to mean the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter to the extent not so superseded at the time in question and the New Debt Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect. Parent shall promptly (and in any event within one (1) business day) notify the Company of the termination of the Debt Commitment Letter and the New Debt Commitment Letter (if applicable). 

  

 (iii) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (and the Company shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) provide, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives, including legal and accounting Representatives, to provide, in each case, at Parents sole expense (in accordance with the reimbursement provisions below), all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with arranging and obtaining the Financing (or, in each case in this _Section 5.6(b)(iii)_, any permitted replacement, amended, modified or alternative financing, including (A) furnishing Parent and Merger Sub and their Financing sources such financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company as may be reasonably requested by Parent, (B) causing its senior executives to participate in a reasonable number of meetings (including customary one-on-one meetings with the parties acting as lead arrangers or agents for, and prospective lenders and purchasers of, the Financing), presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies in 

   ##### 

  

 

connection with the Financing, (C) assisting Parent and its Financing sources
in the preparation of (1) offering documents for any portion of the Debt
Financing and (2) materials for rating agency presentations, (D) cooperating
with the marketing efforts of Parent and its Financing sources for all or any
portion of the Debt Financing, (E) providing and executing documents as
may be reasonably requested by Parent, including a certificate of the chief
financial officer of the Company with respect to solvency matters, (F)
executing and delivering customary pledge and security documents and
otherwise facilitate the pledging of collateral, (G) using reasonable
best efforts to obtain accountants comfort letters and legal opinions
reasonably requested by Parent and customary for financings similar to the
Financing, and (H) cooperating with Parents efforts to obtain landlord
consents, waivers and estoppels, surveys and title insurance as
reasonably requested by Parent and customary for financings similar to the
Financing; _provided_ , that (I) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment fee or other fee or
payment to obtain consent or to incur any liability (other than liability (x)
that is contingent upon the Closing occurring or (y) for reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses subject to reimbursement by Parent in accordance with this
_Section 5.6(b)(iii)_) with respect to the Debt Financing prior to the
Effective Time and (II) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement (including this _Section 5.6_) (a) nothing in this
Agreement (including this _Section 5.6_) shall require any such cooperation
to the extent that it would require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Representatives, as applicable, to waive or amend any terms of this
Agreement, (b) no action, liability or obligation of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives under any
certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or instrument relating to the
Debt Financing shall be effective until the Effective Time and (c) the bank
information memoranda or other offering documents required in relation to the
Debt Financing will state that the Debt Financing will not be an obligation of
the Company and/or its Subsidiaries unless and until the Merger occurs.
Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for
all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries contemplated by this _Section 5.6_ and shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives
from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses
suffered or incurred by any of them of any type in connection with the
arrangement of any Financing and any information used in connection therewith
except with respect to any information prepared or provided by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives or to the
extent such losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses result from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective Representatives, and the foregoing obligations shall survive
termination of this Agreement. All material non-public information provided
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives
pursuant to this _Section 5.6(b)(iii)_ shall be kept confidential
in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except that Parent and
Merger Sub shall be permitted to disclose such information to the financing
sources and other potential sources of capital, rating agencies and
prospective lenders and investors during syndication of the Financing or
any permitted replacement, amended, modified or alternative financing subject
to the potential sources of capital, ratings agencies and prospective lenders
and investors entering into customary confidentiality undertakings with
respect to such information (including through a notice and undertaking in a
form customarily used in confidential information memoranda for senior
credit facilities). The Company hereby consents to the use of 

      ##### 

  

    

its and its Subsidiaries names, marks and logos in the offering materials for
the Debt Financing; _provided_ that such names, marks and logos are used
solely in a manner that is not intended or not reasonably likely to harm or
disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or
goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective intellectual property rights or imply that the Company or its
Subsidiaries have prepared, endorsed or approved any such materials. 

   

 (c) _Acknowledgement_. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the Financing is not a condition to Closing. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing contained in this _Section 5.6_ shall require, and in no event shall the reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to require, either Parent or Merger Sub to (i) bring any enforcement action against any source of the Financing to enforce its respective rights under the Equity Financing Letter or Debt Commitment Letter, except that Parent shall seek enforcement of the Equity Financing Letter solely if the Company seeks and is granted a decree of specific performance after all conditions to the granting therefor set forth in _Section 8.8(b)_ have been satisfied, (ii) seek the Equity Financing from any source other than the Guarantor or in any amount in excess of that contemplated by the Equity Financing Letter or (iii) pay any fees to any source of Debt Financing in excess of those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (whether to secure waiver of any conditions contained therein or otherwise). 

   

 5.7 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. In the event that any state anti-takeover or other similar law is or becomes applicable to any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to ensure that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such law on this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 5.8 _Access_. Until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VII_ and the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to (i) afford Parent and its financial advisors, business consultants, legal counsel, accountants and other agents and representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable prior notice provided to one of the Companys senior executive officers, to the properties, books and records and personnel of the Company as Parent may reasonably request and (ii) furnish promptly to Parent such information concerning the business, properties, assets, liabilities, personnel or other aspect of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent or Merger Sub or their Representatives may reasonably request; _provided, however,_ that the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to the extent that (a) any applicable Law or regulation requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information; (b) access to such documents or information would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege applicable to such documents or information; (c) access to a Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound would violate or cause a default under, or give a third party the right to terminate or accelerate the rights under, such Contract (it being agreed, in the case of clause (b) or (c), that the Company and Parent shall attempt in good faith to design and implement alternative procedures to enable Parent to evaluate any such 

   ##### 

  

 

documents, information or Contracts without, as applicable, waiving such
privilege or causing a violation or causing a default thereunder or giving
any third party a right to terminate or accelerate the rights thereunder); or
(d) such disclosure relates to individual performance or personnel evaluation
records, medical histories or other personnel information that, in each
case, in the Companys good faith opinion would reasonably be expected to
subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to liability; and _provided
further,_ that nothing in this _Section 5.8_ shall be construed to require
the Company or its Representatives to prepare any reports,
analyses, appraisals, opinions or other information and nothing in this
_Section 5.8_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to require
the Company to allow Parent, its Affiliates or any of their respective
employees, consultants, agents or representatives to conduct environmental
testing (including any Phase 1 or similar assessment) or sampling of any kind
at any real property without the prior written consent of the Company. Any
investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section
5.8_ shall be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with
the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or create a
risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries. Any access to the Companys properties shall be subject
to the Companys reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and
shall not include the right to perform invasive testing. The terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information
obtained by Parent or any of its financial advisors, business consultants,
legal counsel, accountants and other agents and representatives in connection
with any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this
_Section 5.8_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
no such access or investigation, or any information obtained in connection
therewith, shall affect or be deemed to modify or qualify any representation
or warranty made by the Company in this Agreement. 

   

 5.9 _Section 16(b) Exemption_. The Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a director or executive officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

  

 5.10 _Directors  and Officers Exculpation, Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and, from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any and all indemnification agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or former directors and officers and any person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (the " _Indemnified Persons_ "). In addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as 

      ##### 

  

    

of the date hereof, and during such six-year period such provisions shall not
be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights of the Indemnified Persons thereunder except as required by
applicable Law. 

   

 (b) Without limiting the generality of the provisions of _Section 5.10(a)_, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to), subject to any restrictions under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person from and against, and advance expenses to each Indemnified Person in respect of, any costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry arises directly or indirectly out of or pertains directly or indirectly to any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnified Persons capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates at or prior to the Effective Time, including in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided, however,_ that if, at any time prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent or the Surviving Corporation a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification under this _Section 5.10(b)_, then the foregoing obligations of the Parent and the Surviving Corporation to indemnify, hold harmless and advance expenses to Indemnified Persons in respect of the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. 

   

 (c) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each person covered by the DandO Insurance, on terms with respect to the coverage and amounts that are equivalent to those of the DandO Insurance; _provided, however,_ that in satisfying its obligations under this _Section 5.10(c)_, the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such three hundred percent (300%) amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_ ") (which premiums the Company represents and warrants to be as set forth in _Section 5.10(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule); _provided, however,_ that that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy for such year with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at the Companys request, as of the Effective Time Parent shall purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on the DandO Insurance at a cost per year covered for such tail policy not to exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, which policy shall be subject to the prior approval of the Company (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In the event that Parent purchases such a "tail" policy prior to the Effective Time, the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 5.10(c)_ shall be deemed satisfied, provided that the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) use reasonable 

      ##### 

  

    

best efforts to maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and
continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder. 

   

 (d) If the Surviving Corporation (or Parent) or any of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations of the Surviving Corporation (or Parent) set forth in this _Section 5.10_. 

   

 (e) The obligations set forth in this _Section 5.10_ shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in  _Section 5.10(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 5.10(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives). Each of the Indemnified Persons or other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 5.10(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.10_, with full rights of enforcement against the Surviving Corporation (and Parent) as if a party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 5.10(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) under this _Section 5.10_ shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have under the certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements of or entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at law or in equity). 

   

 (f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section 5.10_ is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies. 

   

 5.11 _Employee Matters_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor the Employee Plans set forth on _Schedule 5.11_ (the " _Continuing Plans_ ") in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ that nothing in this sentence shall prohibit the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating any such Employee Plans, arrangements or agreements in accordance with their terms or if otherwise required by applicable Law. 

   

 (b) The Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to) continue employment immediately following the Effective Time by the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries of all employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time, 

      ##### 

  

    

subject to _Section 5.11(e)_ hereof. From the Effective Time until December
31, 2011, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) either, at the option of the Surviving Corporation,
(i) maintain for the benefit of each Continuing Employee the Continuing Plans
(but excluding equity based benefits, pensions and retiree medical, life
and disability) at benefit levels that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those in effect at the Company or its Subsidiaries on the date
of this Agreement (other than equity based benefits, pensions and retiree
medical, life and disability) and provide to each Continuing
Employee compensation substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
compensation provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time; or (ii) provide compensation, and benefits (other than equity
based benefits, pensions and retiree medical, life and disability) to each
Continuing Employee that, taken as a whole, are substantially comparable in
the aggregate to the compensation and benefits (other than equity based
benefits, pensions and retiree medical, life and disability) provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Comparable
Plans_ "); or (iii) provide some combination of (i) and (ii) above such
that each Continuing Employee receives compensation and benefits (other than
equity based benefits, pensions and retiree medical, life and disability)
that, taken as a whole, are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
compensation and benefits (other than equity based benefits, pensions and
retiree medical, life and disability) provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (c) To the extent that a Continuing Plan or Comparable Plan is made available to any Continuing Employee on or following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) cause to be granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and, solely for purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay, benefit entitlement; _provided, however,_ that such service need not be credited under any equity-based or non-qualified deferred compensation plan or arrangement or to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (other than the Continuing Plans or Comparable Plans) (such plans, collectively, the " _New Plans_ ") to the extent coverage under any such New Plan replaces coverage in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs under a Continuing Plan in which such Continuing Employee participates immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, the Surviving Corporation shall cause all waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent waived or satisfied under the corresponding Old Plan as of the Effective Time, and the Surviving Corporation shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs to be given full credit under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-pay, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had 

      ##### 

  

    

been paid in accordance with such New Plan. Any vacation or paid time off
accrued but unused by a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be credited to such Continuing Employee following the
Effective Time to the extent reflected as a working capital liability on the
Companys balance sheet. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) provide compensation and benefits to applicable Continuing Employees under the terms set forth in any Collective Bargaining Agreements to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and to which, under the terms of such agreements, the Surviving Corporation or its applicable Subsidiaries shall be bound. 

   

 (e) No provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to terminate, any Continuing Employee at any time and for any or no reason, subject to the terms of: (x) any employment agreements between Continuing Employees and the Company that govern termination of such employees following a change in control, and (y) any Collective Bargaining Agreements to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and to which, under the terms of such agreements, the Surviving Corporation shall be bound; or (ii) subject to the limitations and requirements specifically set forth in this _Section 5.11_, require Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any Continuing Plan or Comparable Plan or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time; or (iii) create any third-party beneficiary rights or obligations in any Person (including any Continuing Employee or any dependent or beneficiary thereof) other than the parties to this Agreement. 

   

 5.12 _Obligations of Parent in respect of Merger Sub and Surviving Corporation_. Parent shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. In furtherance of and without limiting the foregoing, promptly following execution of this Agreement, Parent shall cause Intermediate Holdco, acting in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, to adopt this Agreement. 

  

 5.13 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

stockholders, directors, officers or other Affiliates, in each case, that

therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other, and the Company

implement alternative procedures to enable Parent to evaluate any such
documents or information without waiving such privilege. The Company shall
give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of

 (i) In the circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee is paid in accordance with  _Section 7.3(b)_, Parents receipt of the Company Termination Fee from the Company pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)_ shall (A) subject to _Section 7.3(f)_, be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for the termination giving rise to payment of such Company Termination Fee, and (B) subject to _Section 7.3(f)_ and _Section 8.8_, be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company, its Subsidiaries and each of their respective former, current and future directors, officers, employees, agents, general and limited partners, managers, members, shareholders, Affiliates and assignees and each former, current or future director, officer, employee, agent, shareholder, general or limited partner, manager, member, shareholder, Affiliate or assignee of any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Company Parties_ ") for any loss or damage suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder, and no Company Party shall have any other liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall the Companys liability for the Companys willful material beach or failure to perform any of its covenants or agreements in this Agreement be limited (it being understood and agreed that the failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in the event that all of the conditions to Closing 

   ##### 

  

 

have been satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement shall be
deemed a willful material breach of this Agreement). 

   

 (ii) The Companys receipt of the Parent Termination Fee from Parent pursuant to  _Section 7.3(c)_, and the guarantee thereof pursuant to the Guarantee, shall, subject to  _Section 7.3(f)_, be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its Affiliates against Parent, its Subsidiaries, Guarantor and each of their respective former, current and future directors, officers, employees, agents, general and limited partners, managers, members, shareholders, Affiliates and assignees and each former, current or future director, officer, employee, agent, shareholder, general or limited partner, manager, member, shareholder, Affiliate or assignee of any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Parent Parties_ ") for any loss or damage suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder, and no Parent Party shall have any other liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 (iii) For the avoidance of doubt, (A) under no circumstances will the Company be entitled to monetary damages in excess of the amount of the Parent Termination Fee (together with any amounts payable pursuant to _Section 7.3(f)_), (B) subject to _Section 8.8_, under no circumstances (other than willful material breach by the Company of any of its covenants or agreements in this Agreement) will Parent be entitled to monetary damages in excess of the amount of the Company Termination Fee (together with any amounts payable pursuant to _Section 7.3(f)_ ), and (C) while Parent may pursue both a grant of specific performance and the payment of the Company Termination Fee, under no circumstance shall Parent be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance that results in the Merger occurring and all or any portion of the Company Termination Fee ( _provided_ that Parent shall in any event be entitled to receive any and all amounts payable pursuant to _Section 7.3(f)_). 

  

 (f) _Costs of Recovery_. The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this  _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)_ or Parent fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to _Section 7.3(c)_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in _Section 7.3(b)_ or a judgment against Parent for the amount set forth in _Section 7.3(c)_, the Company shall pay to Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or Parent shall pay to the Company, on the other hand, (i) its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit and (ii) interest on the amount payable pursuant to such judgment at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date of payment, with such interest being payable in respect of the period from the date that payment was originally required to be made pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)_ or  _Section 7.3(c)_ of this Agreement, as applicable, through the date of payment.

 8.4 _Confidentiality_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby acknowledge that an Affiliate of Parent and the Company have previously executed a Confidentiality Agreement, dated May 28, 2010 (as amended, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. 

  

 8.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Guarantee, constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof; _provided, however,_  the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be superseded, shall survive any termination of this Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect until the earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time and (b) the date on which the Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance with its terms or is validly terminated by the parties thereto. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARENT AND MERGER SUB, ON THE ONE HAND, NOR THE COMPANY, ON THE OTHER HAND, MAKES ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES TO THE OTHER, AND EACH PARTY HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY OTHER INFORMATION, MADE (OR MADE AVAILABLE BY) BY ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR THE OTHERS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING. 

  

 8.6 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to, and shall not, confer upon any Person that is not a party hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, except (a) as set forth in or contemplated by the terms and provisions of _Section 5.10_, (b) with respect to the reimbursement and indemnification obligations of Parent under _Section 5.6(b)(iii)_, (c) from and after the Effective Time, the rights of holders of shares of the Company Common Stock to receive the merger consideration set forth in _Article I_ and (d) the Parent Parties and the Company Parties (other than the parties to this Agreement themselves) shall be intended third party beneficiaries of, and permitted to enforce, the limitations on liability set forth in or contemplated by _Section 7.3(e)_.

   ##### 

  

 

application of such provision to other persons or circumstances will be
interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The
parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this
Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the
extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void
or unenforceable provision. 

   

 8.8 _Remedies_. 

  

 (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy; _provided_ that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall not be entitled to specific performance of, or injunctive relief with respect to, the covenants or agreements of Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement. 

   

 (b) The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any covenant or agreement of the Company in this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages. Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _Article VII_, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Company of any of its covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the Company under this Agreement. 

   

 (c) The Company agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the Company under this Agreement. The Company further agrees that by seeking the remedies provided for in _Section 8.8(a)_, Parent and Merger Sub shall not in any respect waive their right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement (including monetary damages) in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in _Section 8.8_ are not available or otherwise are not granted, nor shall the commencement of any Legal Proceeding pursuant to _Section 8.8(a)_ or anything set forth in this _Section 8.8_ restrict or limit Parents or Merger Subs right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article VII_ or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter. In connection with seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement or to enforce by specific performance the terms and provisions of this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction. 

    ##### 

  

  

 8.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving regard to any principles of conflicts of law thereof to the extent they would result in the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. 

  

 8.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto (a) irrevocably consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process in any action or proceeding relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Equity Financing Letter and the Guarantee, for and on behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance with this  _Section 8.10_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable Law, and nothing in this _Section 8.10_ shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law; (b) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its properties and assets in any action or proceeding to the exclusive general jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the " _Chancery Court_ ") and any state appellate court therefrom located within the State of Delaware (or, only if the Chancery Court declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) in the event any dispute or controversy arises out of this Agreement, the Equity Financing Letter, the Guarantee or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, the Equity Financing Letter, the Guarantee, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof; (c) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court; (d) agrees that any actions or proceedings arising in connection with this Agreement, the Equity Financing Letter, the Guarantee or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be brought, tried and determined only in the Chancery Court and any state appellate court therefrom located within the State of Delaware (or, only if the Chancery Court declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware); (e) waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court or that such action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (f) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement, the Equity Financing Letter, the Guarantee or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that a final judgment in any action or proceeding in such courts as provided above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law. 

  

 8.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF PARENT, THE COMPANY AND MERGER SUB HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE EQUITY FINANCING LETTER, THE GUARANTEE OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, COMPANY OR MERGER SUB IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF OR THEREOF. 

  

 8.12 _Company Disclosure Schedule References_. The parties hereto agree that the disclosure set forth in any particular section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (a) the representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set forth in the corresponding section or subsection of this Agreement, and (b) any other representations and 

   ##### 

  

 

warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set forth in
this Agreement, but in the case of this clause (b) only if the relevance of
that disclosure as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such
other representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure. The parties hereto
further agree that the mere inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure
Schedule as an exception to the representations and warranties (or covenants
as applicable) of the Company shall not be deemed an admission that such item
represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstances or
that such has had or, individually or in the aggregate, would have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 8.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. 

  

 8.14 _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Law and subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any time, whether before or after receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company; _provided, however,_ that in the event that the Company has received the Requisite Stockholder Approval, no amendment shall be made to this Agreement that requires the approval of such Company Stockholders under the DGCL without such approval. 

  

 8.15 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time and from time to time prior to the Effective Time, any party or parties hereto may, to the extent legally allowed and except as otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party or parties hereto, as applicable, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party or parties hereto contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party or parties hereto contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party or parties hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party or parties, as applicable. Any delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right.

 (g) Any payment to the Stockholders under _Section 7(e)_ hereof shall be made in the same form as the consideration received by Parent from the applicable Acquisition Transaction (and, if the consideration so received was in more than one form, then in the same proportion as the forms of consideration so received).

 (h) If (i) the Stock Purchase occurs, and (ii) in connection with a Superior Proposal, the Company terminates the Merger Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(h) of the Merger Agreement and pays the Company Termination Fee to Parent in accordance with the Merger Agreement, then (x) Parent will vote the Acquired Shares in favor of such Superior Proposal and/or tender such Acquired Shares in connection with the Acquisition Transaction contemplated such Superior Proposal and (y) Parent will enter into an agreement with the party making such Superior Proposal providing that the per share consideration to be paid to Parent with respect to the Acquired Shares in connection with the Acquisition Transaction contemplated by such Superior Proposal shall be $1.75 less (the " _Consideration Differential_ ") than the per share consideration paid to other stockholders generally in such Acquisition Transaction so long as the purchase of such Acquired Shares in such Acquisition Transaction occurs on or before December 31, 2010.

 (i) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, except in each case for Merger Sub, which is an intended third party beneficiary of, and shall be entitled to enforce, this Agreement, and the Company, which is an intended third party beneficiary of, and shall be entitled to enforce, the Company Beneficiary Provisions. 

  

 (j) _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving regard to any principles of 

   ##### 

  

 

conflicts of law thereof to the extent they would result in the application of
the laws of another jurisdiction. 

   

 (k) _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto (a) irrevocably consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process in any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement for and on behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance with this _Section 9(k)_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable law, and nothing in this _Section 9(k)_ shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable law; (b) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its properties and assets in any action or proceeding to the exclusive general jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the " _Chancery Court_ ") and any state appellate court therefrom located within the State of Delaware (or, only if the Chancery Court declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) in the event any dispute or controversy arises out of this Agreement, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof; (c) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court; (d) agrees that any actions or proceedings arising in connection with this Agreement shall be brought, tried and determined only in the Chancery Court and any state appellate court therefrom located within the State of Delaware (or, only if the Chancery Court declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware); (e) waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court or that such action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (f) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any action or proceeding in such courts as provided above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable law. 

  

 (l) _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF A STOCKHOLDER, PARENT, THE COMPANY OR MERGER SUB IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF OR THEREOF. 

  

 (m) _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that each of the parties hereto shall be entitled, without posting any bond or other undertaking, to specific performance and injunctive and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. 

  

 (n) _Interpretation_. The descriptive headings used herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The words "include," "includes" and "including" shall be deemed to be followed by "without limitation" whether or not they are in fact followed by such

words or words of like import. The parties hereto have participated jointly in

"hereto," "hereby," "herein," "hereunder" and words of similar import, when
used in this Agreement, shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not

All rights, ownership and economic benefits of and relating to the Covered Shares shall remain vested in and belong to the Stockholders, and Parent shall have no authority to manage, direct, superintend, restrict, regulate, govern or administer any of the policies or operations of the Company or exercise any power or authority to direct Stockholder in the voting of any of the Covered Shares, except as otherwise provided herein.

 The undersigned stockholder (" _Stockholder_ ") of American Commercial Lines Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), hereby (i) irrevocably grants to, and appoints, Finn Holding Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), and any Person designated in writing by Parent, and each of them individually, Stockholders proxy and attorney-in-fact (with full power of substitution and re-substitution), for and in the name, place and stead of Stockholder, to vote all of the Covered Shares or grant a written consent or approval in respect of the Covered Shares, in accordance with the terms of this Proxy and (ii) revokes any and all proxies heretofore given in respect of the Covered Shares. 

  

 This Proxy is granted pursuant to that certain Voting Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, by and among Parent, the Company, Stockholder and certain other stockholders of the Company (the " _Voting Agreement_ "). For the purposes of this Proxy, " _Covered Shares_ " means (i) all shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") and any other equity securities of the Company which are beneficially owned by Stockholder as of the date hereof and (ii) all shares of Company Common Stock and any other equity securities of the Company which are beneficially owned by Stockholder and are acquired after the date hereof and prior to the termination of the Voting Agreement. The Covered Shares as of the date hereof are set forth on the signature page hereof. 

  

 Stockholder hereby affirms that the irrevocable proxy set forth in this Proxy is given in connection with the execution of that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), dated as of the date hereof, by and among Parent, Finn Merger Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Merger Sub_ "), and the Company, providing, among other things, for the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, and that such irrevocable proxy is given to secure the performance of the duties of Stockholder under the Voting Agreement. Stockholder hereby further affirms that the irrevocable proxy set forth in this Proxy is coupled with an interest and may under no circumstances be revoked during the Term of the Voting Agreement, it being acknowledged however that this Proxy, by its terms, shall automatically and without any further action by any Person terminate and be of no further force and effect upon and after the termination of the Voting Agreement. Stockholder hereby ratifies and confirms all that such irrevocable proxy may lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this Proxy is executed and intended to be irrevocable in accordance with the provisions of Section 212(e) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. 

  

 The attorneys-in-fact and proxies named above are hereby authorized and empowered by the undersigned at any time after the date hereof and prior to the termination of the Voting Agreement with respect to the undersigned to act as the undersigneds attorney-in-fact and proxy to vote the Covered Shares, and to exercise all voting, consent and similar rights of the undersigned with respect to the Covered Shares (including, without limitation, the power to execute and deliver written consents), at every annual, special, adjourned or postponed meeting of the stockholders of the Company and in every action by written consent in lieu of such a meeting: 

   ##### 

  

  

     (A)  |   | in favor of adopting the Merger Agreement (for the
purposes of this Proxy, as it may be modified or amended from time to time,
unless such modification or amendment would constitute an Adverse Amendment),
including the agreement of merger contained therein, the execution and
delivery by the Company of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the terms
thereof and each of the other actions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     (B)  |   | in favor of any adjournment or postponement recommended
by the Company with respect to any stockholder meeting with respect to the
Merger Agreement and the Merger;

     (C)  |   | against any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the
Merger Agreement) or any proposal relating to an Acquisition Proposal;  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     (D)  |   | against any merger agreement or merger, acquisition,
consolidation, combination, sale of substantial assets, reorganization,
recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or winding up of or by the
Company, or any other extraordinary transaction involving the Company, in
each case other than the Merger Agreement and the Merger; and  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     (E)  |   | against any other proposal, action or agreement, in
each case that would (1) prevent, impair, delay or otherwise adversely affect
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the consummation of
the Merger, or (2) result in a breach in any material respect of any
covenant, representation, warranty or any other obligation or agreement of
the Company under the Merger Agreement.  
---|---|--- 
   

  

 Any obligation of the undersigned hereunder shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of the undersigned. This Proxy shall automatically and without any further action by any Person terminate and be of no further force and effect upon and after the termination of the Voting Agreement.

 _SIXTH_ : In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by statute, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized: 

   

 (a) to adopt, repeal, rescind, alter or amend in any respect the Bylaws, and to confer in the Bylaws powers and authorities upon the directors of the Corporation in addition to the powers and authorities expressly conferred upon them by statute; 

   

 (b) from time to time to set apart out of any funds or assets of the Corporation available for dividends an amount or amounts to be reserved as working capital or for any other lawful purpose and to abolish any reserve so created and to determine whether any, and, if any, what part, of the surplus of the Corporation or its net profits applicable to dividends shall be declared in dividends and paid to its stockholders, and all rights of the holders of stock of the Corporation in respect of dividends shall be subject to the power of the Board of Directors so to do; 

   

 (c) subject to the laws of the State of Delaware, from time to time to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of any part or parts of the properties of the 

   ##### 

  

   

 Corporation and to cease to conduct the business connected therewith or again to resume the same, as it may deem best; and 

   

 (d) in addition to the powers and authorities hereinbefore and by the laws of the State of Delaware conferred upon the Board of Directors, to execute all such powers and to do all acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation; subject, nevertheless, to the express provisions of said laws, of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation and its Bylaws.

person.
