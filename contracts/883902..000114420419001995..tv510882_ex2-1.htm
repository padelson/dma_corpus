the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective

(A) satisfaction or (to the extent permitted under applicable Law) waiver by
the Party entitled to the benefit of the same, of each of the conditions set
forth in _ARTICLE VIII_  (other than those conditions that are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to their satisfaction or waiver at the
Closing) and (B) the First Outside Date, or (iii) on such other date as the
Seller Representative and Buyer mutually agree (the "Closing Date") and will

all documents to be executed and delivered by all Parties at the Closing will
be deemed to have been taken and executed simultaneously and no proceedings
will be deemed to have been taken nor documents executed or delivered until
all have been taken, executed and delivered.

  



  

2.3 _Estimated Closing Consideration_. At least five (5) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, the Seller Representative shall furnish to
Buyer a certificate (the "Closing Schedule") setting forth (a) a good faith
estimate of Closing Cash (the "Estimated Cash"), (b) a good faith estimate of
Working Capital (the "Estimated Working Capital"), (c) a good faith estimate
of the aggregate amount of Company Debt outstanding on the Closing Date
immediately prior to the Closing (the "Estimated Company Debt"), (d) a good
faith estimate of the aggregate amount of Selling Expenses unpaid as of the
Closing, (e) the Estimated Purchase Price and the Unitholder Closing
Consideration calculated by taking into account the foregoing clauses (a)
through (d), (f) the Pro Rata Percentage of each Seller, and the amount of the
Unitholder Closing Consideration that each Seller is entitled to receive
pursuant to the terms of the LLC Agreement and this Agreement, based on the
Unitholder Closing Consideration and (g) a reasonably detailed schedule,
including amounts, payees and such other information as may be reasonably
requested by or on behalf of Buyer, of the Closing Consideration to be paid or
delivered by Buyer, as determined in accordance with _Section 2.4_. The
Seller Representative (i) shall provide Buyer with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Closing Schedule, including the

 | 2| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iii) Buyer shall pay to the Escrow Agent (i) the Adjustment Escrow
Amount and (ii) the Earn-out Escrow Amount, in each case, in accordance with
the Escrow Agreement; and

  



  

(iv) Buyer shall pay (on behalf of the Sellers) to the Seller
Representative, or to its designated agent or representative, an aggregate
cash amount equal to the Unitholder Closing Consideration, in accordance with
the payment instructions delivered by the Seller Representative to Buyer at
least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(b) By execution hereof, each Seller hereby (i) expressly
acknowledges and agrees (A) that he, she or it understands and consents to
the purchase price mechanics set forth herein (including the manner in which
his, her or its portion of the Purchase Price will be calculated by the
Seller Representative) and (B) to the deductions from the Estimated Purchase
Price for the items referenced herein, as applicable to such Seller,
including the establishment of the Adjustment Escrow Account, the retention of
the Adjustment Escrow Amount for such account and the distribution and use of
the Adjustment Escrow Amount pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement and (ii) releases and discharges forever, irrevocably and
unconditionally, Buyer and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Company and its Subsidiaries) and their respective Representatives from any
rights, claims and causes of action relating to or arising from Buyer's
payment of amounts hereunder in accordance with the instructions provided by
or on behalf of the Seller Representative, including payments pursuant to
this _Section 2.4_ and _Section 2.5(d)_.

  



  

2.5 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

  



  

(a) _Closing Statement_. Within ninety (90) days after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver, or cause to be prepared and
delivered, to the Seller Representative a statement (the "Closing Statement")
setting forth Buyer's calculation of (i) Working Capital, (ii) Closing Cash,
(iii) Closing Company Debt, (iv) Selling Expenses as of the Closing and (v)
the Purchase Price calculated by taking into account the foregoing clauses (i)
through (iv).

  



    

 | 3| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Closing Statement Dispute_.

  



  

(i) Within forty-five (45) days following receipt by the Seller
Representative of the Closing Statement, the Seller Representative shall
deliver written notice to Buyer of any dispute it has with respect to the
content of the Closing Statement (a "Dispute Notice"), which Dispute Notice
shall set forth in reasonable detail the nature and amount of such dispute. If
the Seller Representative does not deliver a Dispute Notice with respect to
the Closing Statement within such 45-day period, such Closing Statement will
be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. In the event the Seller
Representative timely delivers a Dispute Notice to Buyer, Buyer and the
Seller Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such disputed
items. If Buyer and the Seller Representative, notwithstanding such good
faith effort, fail to resolve such disputed items within fifteen (15) days
after the Seller Representative delivers the Dispute Notice, then Buyer and
the Seller Representative jointly shall engage the Arbitration Firm to resolve
only such disputed item(s) still in dispute. In the event Buyer and the
Seller Representative engage the Arbitration Firm, as promptly as
practicable, and no later than fifteen (15) days thereafter, Buyer and the
Seller Representative shall each prepare and submit a written presentation to
the Arbitration Firm. As soon as practicable thereafter, Buyer and the Seller
Representative shall instruct the Arbitration Firm to render a decision based
solely upon the written presentation by Buyer and the Seller Representative
as soon as reasonably possible (which the Parties agree should not be later
than forty-five (45) days following the day on which the dispute is referred
to the Arbitration Firm). In addition, Buyer and the Seller Representative
shall instruct the Arbitration Firm to make all determinations in accordance
with the Accounting Practices, notwithstanding the availability of other
accounting methods, policies, practices or procedures under GAAP or
otherwise. In resolving any disputed item, the Arbitration Firm (1) shall be
limited to picking from or between the values assigned to each item by Buyer
and the Seller Representative in the written presentation submitted by each
of Buyer and the Seller Representative to the Arbitration Firm, (2) may not
assign a value to any item outside of the range of values claimed for such
item by either Buyer or the Seller Representative, (3) may not conduct an
independent investigation, and (4) shall be required to make its
determination in accordance with this Agreement (including the definitions of
the defined terms used in this _Section 2.5_ ).

  



  

(ii) All fees and expenses relating to appointment of the Arbitration
Firm and the work, if any, to be performed by the Arbitration Firm will be
borne in relative proportion to the amount by which Buyer's computation of
Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Company Debt and Selling Expenses set
forth on the Closing Statement, on the one hand, and the Seller
Representative's computation of Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing
Company Debt and Selling Expenses set forth on the Dispute Notice, on the
other hand, differs from Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Company Debt
and Selling Expenses as determined by the Arbitration Firm. Such allocation
of responsibility for such fees and expenses shall be performed by the
Arbitration Firm. For example, if the closing accounts receivable component
of Working Capital is the only disputed item, and Buyer claims that closing
accounts receivable is $1,000, and the Seller Representative contests that
such amount is actually $1,500 (thus contesting only $500 of the amount
claimed by Buyer), and if the Arbitration Firm ultimately resolves the
dispute by determining closing accounts receivable is actually $1,300 (thus
awarding the Seller Representative $300 of the $500 contested), then the costs
and expenses of the Arbitration Firm will be allocated 60% (i.e., 300 ÷ 500)
to Buyer and 40% (i.e., 200 ÷ 500) to the Seller Representative.

  



  

(iii) All determinations made by the Arbitration Firm will be final,
conclusive and binding on the Parties. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the dispute resolution mechanism contained in this _Section 2.5(b)_
shall be the exclusive mechanism for resolving disputes regarding the Closing
Statement, if any.

  



    

 | 4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) _Access_. For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in
this _Section 2.5_, Buyer and the Company, on the one hand, and the Sellers
and the Seller Representative, on the other hand, shall and shall cause their
respective Representatives to reasonably cooperate with each other and their
respective Representatives, and shall make available to each other and their
respective Representatives all information, records, data and working papers,
and shall permit access to its facilities and personnel, as may be
reasonably requested in connection with the preparation and analysis of the
Closing Statement and the resolution of any disputes under _Section 2.5(b)_.
If Buyer and the Company, on the one hand, or the Seller Representative, on
the other hand, breach their respective obligations under this _Section
2.5(c)_, the dispute periods set forth in _Section 2.5(b)_
shall automatically be extended until such breach is cured by the breaching
Party, unless the non-breaching Party agrees otherwise.

  



  

(d) _Payment_. Within five (5) Business Days after Working Capital,
Closing Cash, Closing Company Debt and Selling Expenses unpaid as of the
Closing are finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)_ or _Section
2.5(b)_ (the "Final Closing Consideration"), if, (i) Working Capital _plus_
Closing Cash _minus_ Closing Company Debt and Selling Expenses, as so finally
determined,  _minus_ (ii) Estimated Working Capital _plus_ Estimated Cash
_minus_ Estimated Company Debt and Selling Expenses as set forth on the
Closing Schedule (such difference, the "Adjustment Amount") is (A) positive,
then Buyer shall pay to the Seller Representative, on behalf of the Sellers,
an aggregate cash amount equal to the Adjustment Amount by bank wire transfer
of immediately available funds in accordance with payment instructions
delivered by the Seller Representative to Buyer no later than three (3)
Business Days after the Final Closing Consideration is determined, which
aggregate amount shall then be allocated and paid to the Sellers by the
Seller Representative based upon the Sellers' respective Pro Rata
Percentages, or (B) negative, then (1) Buyer and the Seller Representative
shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent authorizing the
distribution of funds from the Adjustment Escrow Account to Buyer in an
aggregate amount equal to the Adjustment Amount (or, if the Adjustment Amount
is greater than the Remaining Adjustment Escrow Amount, the full Remaining
Adjustment Escrow Amount) and (2) the Seller Representative, on behalf of the
Sellers, shall pay to Buyer an aggregate cash amount equal to the Excess
Adjustment Amount, if any, by bank wire transfer of immediately available
funds in accordance with payment instructions delivered by Buyer to the
Seller Representative no later than three (3) Business Days after the Final
Closing Consideration is determined, and any such payment pursuant to this
_Section 2.5(d)(B)(2)_ shall be borne ratably by the Sellers based upon the
Sellers' respective Pro Rata Percentages.

property owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Owned Real
Property"). True and complete copies of the title policies or commitments
obtained by the Company or its Subsidiaries pertaining to the Owned Real
Property have been delivered to Buyer or have been made available to Buyer for
its review. The Company and its Subsidiaries have good, valid, marketable and
insurable fee simple title to the Owned Real Property, free and clear of all
Liens except for Permitted Liens. There are no leases, licenses or other
agreements, to which the Company or its Subsidiaries is a party, granting to
any other party the right to use or occupy all or any portion of the Owned
Real Property or improvements thereon, and to the Sellers' Knowledge, there
are no such leases, licenses or other agreements, or other legal or
contractual restrictions on the use of the Owned Real Property by the Company
or its Subsidiaries for the purposes for which it is currently being used.

  



  

(b) _Schedule 4.7(b)_ contains a complete and accurate description
of all of the Real Property leased by the Company or its Subsidiaries (the
"Leased Real Property"). Together with the Owned Real Property, the Leased
Real Property listed on _Schedule 4.7(b)_ comprises all Real Property used in
the conduct of the business and operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as now conducted. The Company or one of its Subsidiaries holds a
valid and existing leasehold interest in each Leased Real Property. All
Leased Real Property is held under leases or subleases (collectively, together
with any amendments, supplements, waivers and other modifications thereto,
the "Real Property Leases") that are, in all material respects, valid
instruments, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms except as
limited by the General Enforceability Exceptions. True and complete copies of
the Real Property Leases have been delivered to Buyer or have been made
available to Buyer for its review. There is no material default or breach by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Sellers' Knowledge, any
other party, in the timely performance of any obligation to be performed or
paid under any such Real Property Lease or any other material
provision thereof. As of the date of this Agreement, the Company has not,
since January 1, 2016, received any notice alleging any default or breach,
and, to the Sellers' Knowledge, no event has occurred or circumstance exists
which, with the delivery of notice, the passage of time or both, would
constitute such a default or breach, or permit the termination, modification
or acceleration of rent under any Real Property Lease. None of the facilities
included in the Leased Real Property are subject to any ground lease, master
lease, mortgage, deed of trust or other Lien (except for Permitted Liens) that
would entitle the holder thereof to interfere with or disturb the use or
enjoyment of the facilities or the exercise by Company or its Subsidiaries of
its rights under any Real Property Lease so long as the Company or its
Subsidiaries are not in material breach of such Real Property Lease. The
Leased Real Property, including the buildings, structures, fixtures and
improvements located thereon, are (i) free of material structural defects and
other material defects except for routine maintenance and repair, and (ii) in
operating condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted and taking into account
the age thereof, with no material maintenance or repair having been deferred

or undertaking with any Governmental Authority, nor, to the Sellers'
Knowledge, is the Company or any of its Subsidiaries being investigated by
any Governmental Authority for any breach, violation or other noncompliance

officers, directors, employees, distributors and other agents acting for or
on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the
"Relevant Persons"), have not directly or indirectly violated, or taken any
act in furtherance of violating, any provision of the United States Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (as amended) or any other anti-corruption or
anti-bribery laws or regulations applicable to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(c) The Relevant Persons have not, directly or indirectly, taken any
act in furtherance of any payment, gift, bribe, rebate, loan,
payoff, kickback, or any other transfer of value - or offer, promise, or
authorization thereof - to any individual or entity, including any Government

government, country, or other individual or entity that is the target of U.S.
economic sanctions administered by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of
Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"), including any transactions with specially

prohibited by any Law administered by OFAC, or by any other applicable
economic or trade sanctions law.

  



  

(e) The Relevant Persons have not in the course of their actions
for, or on behalf of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries directly or
indirectly violated or taken any act in furtherance of violating any provision
of any applicable Laws relating to money laundering.

  



  

(f) The Relevant Persons have not: (i) circumvented the internal

any current employees, directors, or officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (i) that are sponsored or maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries, (ii) with respect to which the Company or its Subsidiaries make,
have made or are required to make payments, transfers or contributions, or
(iii) with respect to which the Company may have any liability, whether
direct or indirect (including any such plan or other arrangement previously
maintained by the Company or any Controlled Group member) (all of the above
being hereinafter referred to as "Employee Plans"). Employee Plans shall not,
however, include any plan, contract, program, fund or arrangement that has
been terminated and wound up and with respect to which the Company and its
Subsidiaries have no unsatisfied liability.

  



  

(b) With respect to the Employee Plans, true, correct and complete
copies of the following materials have been made available to Buyer, to the
extent applicable: (i) the current plan documents, related trust agreements
and amendments thereto, or, with respect to unwritten arrangements, a

determination, advisory or opinion letters from the Internal Revenue Service
("IRS") with respect to any of the Employee Plans intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code, (iii) the current summary plan description

annual reports on Form 5500.

  



  

(c) Each Employee Plan has been established, maintained, operated,
and administered in material compliance with its terms and in
material compliance with all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code,
except as reflected on _Schedule 4.10_. To the Sellers' Knowledge, there have
been no prohibited transactions or breaches of any of the duties imposed on
"fiduciaries" (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA) by ERISA with
respect to the Employee Plans that could reasonably be expected to result in
any material liability or excise tax under ERISA or the Code being imposed on
the Company. All payments or contributions due pursuant to an Employee Plan
that are required by applicable Laws or by the terms of such Employee Plan
have been timely made and accrued, in each case except for any failures to do
so that, individually or in the aggregate, are not material.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) Each Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code is either (i) the recipient of a favorable determination letter
from the IRS, or (ii) a volume submitter or master and prototype plan as to
which the adopter is entitled to rely on the advisory or opinion letter
issued by the IRS with respect to the qualified status of such plan under
Section 401 of the Code to the extent provided in Revenue Procedure 2011-49,
and no amendment has been made nor has any event occurred that could
reasonably be expected to adversely affect such qualification. Additionally,
each trust created under any such Employee Plan is exempt from taxation under
Section 501(a) of the Code, and, to the Sellers' Knowledge, nothing has
occurred that has or could reasonably be expected to adversely affect such
exemption.

(a) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents to be executed and delivered by Buyer, nor
the performance by Buyer of its obligations hereunder or thereunder, nor the
consummation by Buyer of the transactions contemplated herein or therein, nor
compliance by Buyer with any of the provisions hereof, do or will (with or

breach of any provisions of the Organizational Documents of Buyer, (ii)
require the consent, notice or other action by or of any Person under,

materially delay or materially impair the ability of Buyer to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents
or, or (iii) violate any Order or Law applicable to Buyer or any of its

hereunder, (c) the satisfaction of the closing conditions set forth in

and its Subsidiaries made available to Buyer prior to the date hereof have

of its assets will not be less than the sum of its liabilities and that the
present saleable value of its assets will not be less than the amount
required to pay its probable liabilities as they become absolute and matured),
immediately after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Buyer (i) will be solvent (in that both the fair value of its
assets will not be less than the sum of its liabilities and that the present

consenting to any divestiture or other structural or conduct relief in order
to obtain clearance from any Governmental Authority (any such step, a
"Remedial Action"); _provided_ that, (i) notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Buyer or its
Affiliates be obligated to take or agree to take any such action that would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material

foregoing, Buyer will not, and will not permit any of its Affiliates to,
acquire or agree to acquire (by merging or consolidating with, or by
purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any
other manner), any Person or portion thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree
to acquire any assets, if the entering into a definitive agreement
relating to, or the consummation of, such acquisition, merger or

obtaining of, or increase the risk of not obtaining, any orders or other
approvals of any Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period, (ii) increase the risk of any Governmental
Authority entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, (iii) increase the risk of not being able to remove any

consultation with and written approval of the Seller Representative, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

liability, and Buyer shall (or shall cause the Company to) promptly satisfy

Subsidiary of the Company to provide each employee of the Company and each
Subsidiary of the Company who remains employed immediately after the Closing
("Company Continuing Employee") with: (i) base salary or hourly wages which
are no less than the base salary or hourly wages provided by the Company or
applicable Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Closing; (ii)
target annual cash bonus opportunities (excluding equity-based, retention,
transaction-related or other non-recurring compensation), if any, which are no
less than the target annual cash bonus opportunities (excluding equity-based,
retention, transaction-related or other non-recurring compensation) provided
by Buyer to its similarly-situated employees; (iii) retirement and welfare
benefits (other than benefits under any defined benefit pension or retiree
health or welfare plan) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those
provided by Buyer to its similarly-situated employees (other than benefits
under any defined benefit pension or retiree health or welfare plan);
and (iv) severance benefits that are no less favorable than the practice,
plan or policy of Buyer in effect for its similarly-situated employees (with
service to be credited as provided in _Section 7.9(b)_); _provided_ that, as
to the Employee Plans covered by clauses (ii) and (iii) of this _Section
7.9(a)_, Buyer may, in its discretion, cause the Company Continuing Employees
to continue to participate in such Employee Plans as in effect as of
immediately prior to the Closing from the Closing Date through the Relevant
Date. The "Relevant Date" shall be: (x) with respect to clauses (i) and (iv)
of this _Section 7.9(a)_, the date which is twelve (12) months from the
Closing; and (y) with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii) of this _Section
7.9(a)_, December 31, 2019.

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Buyer or
its Subsidiaries (collectively, "Buyer Benefit Plans") in which any Company
Continuing Employees participate after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall
cause the Company to, recognize all service of the Company Continuing
Employees with the Company as if such service were with Buyer, for vesting,
eligibility and benefit accrual ( _provided_ , _however_ , that such service
will not be recognized for any retiree health or welfare plan or for benefit
accrual under any defined benefit plan) purposes under any Buyer Benefit Plan
in which such Company Continuing Employees participate after the Closing
Date, including for purposes of determining entitlement to severance pay and
termination benefits, and paid time off; _provided_ , _however_ , such
service shall not be recognized to the extent that (i) such recognition would
result in a duplication of benefits, (ii) such service was not recognized
under the corresponding Employee Plan, or (iii) such service is with respect
to a Buyer Benefit Plan that has, prior to the date hereof, been frozen or
terminated.

  



  

(c) If requested in writing by Buyer or its Representatives no fewer
than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the sponsor of the
Company's 401(k) plan (the "Company 401(k) Plan") shall adopt resolutions of
its board of directors or equivalent body and take other actions necessary or
advisable to terminate the Company 401(k) Plan, with such termination
effective as of the Business Day preceding the Closing Date (contingent upon
the occurrence of the Closing). If Buyer so requests the Company 401(k) Plan
to be terminated, then Buyer shall permit all Company Continuing Employees who
are eligible to participate in the Company 401(k) Plan, to participate, as
soon as practicable following the Closing Date and in accordance with the
terms thereof, in a 401(k) plan maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates (the
"Buyer 401(k) Plan"), and to the extent permitted by its terms, shall cause
the Buyer 401(k) Plan to accept rollovers of distributions made to such
Company Continuing Employees from the Company 401(k) Plan.

  



  

(d) This  _Section 7.9_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to
the benefit of each of the Parties, and nothing in this _Section 7.9_ ,
express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 7.9_. Nothing
contained herein, express or implied, shall be construed to establish,
amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement
maintained or sponsored by any Person. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
the terms set forth in this _Section 7.9_ are not intended to, and shall not,
create any right in any employee or any other Person to any continued
employment or continued service with the Company, Buyer or any of their
respective Affiliates or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind
whatsoever.

7.10 _Taxes_.

  



  

(a) _Tax Treatment of Transaction_. For U.S. federal Income Tax
purposes (and for the purposes of any applicable state or local Income Tax
that follows the U.S. federal Income Tax treatment), the Parties agree to
treat the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as a disposition of the
Company Units by the Sellers and an acquisition of the Company's assets by
Buyer (as described in Situation 2 of Revenue Ruling 99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 432).
The Parties agree that they will treat the Company as having "terminated" as
a partnership under Section 708 of the Code, and its taxable year as having
ended, as of the end of the Closing Date for U.S. federal Income Tax purposes
(and for purposes of any state or local Income Taxes that follow the U.S.
federal Income Tax treatment). The Parties will prepare and file all U.S.
federal Income Tax Returns (together with Income Tax returns with respect to
any state or local Income Taxes that follow the U.S. federal Income tax
treatments specified in this _Section 7.10(a)_) consistent with the
foregoing and will not take any inconsistent position on any such Income Tax
Return, or during the course of any audit, litigation or other proceeding
with respect to such Income Taxes, except as otherwise required by applicable
Law following a Final Determination.

  



  

(b) _Tax Returns_.

  



  

(i) _Pre-Closing Information Returns_. The Seller Representative
will cause to be prepared the final U.S. federal Income Tax Return of the
Company (and any Income Tax Return of the Company due in a state or local
jurisdiction that follows the U.S. federal income tax treatments specified in
_Section 7.10(a)_ and in which the Company is treated as a pass-through
entity) for the Tax period ending on the Closing Date (each, a "Pre-Closing
Information Return"). The Seller Representative will cause each such Pre-
Closing Information Return to be filed timely with the appropriate
Governmental Authority, shall pay all Income Taxes owed with respect to such
Pre-Closing Information Return, and will provide a copy to Buyer.

  



  

(ii) _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_. The Seller Representative will cause
to be prepared each Tax Return of the Company for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period (other than a Pre-Closing Information Return) due on or before the
Closing Date (each, a "Pre-Closing Tax Return"). Such Pre-Closing Tax Returns
shall be prepared in accordance with past practice to the extent permitted by
Law. Within thirty (30) days before the due date for filing such Pre-Closing
Tax Return (including extensions), the Seller Representative will deliver a
copy of such Pre-Closing Tax Return to Buyer for Buyer's review and comment
and Seller shall consider in good faith any comments reasonably made by
Buyer.

  



    

 | 37| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iii) _Post-Closing Tax Returns_. Buyer will prepare or cause to be
prepared each Tax Return of the Company for (A) a Pre-Closing Tax Period
(other than a Pre-Closing Information Return) due after the Closing Date or
(B) a Straddle Period (each, a "Post-Closing Tax Return"). Not later than
thirty (30) days prior to the due date (including extensions) for filing such
Post-Closing Tax Return (other than monthly or quarterly Tax Returns for
sales tax, use tax, payroll tax or social security, or any other
standalone taxes imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and not on
the Sellers), Buyer will deliver a copy of such Post-Closing Tax Return,
together with all supporting documentation and workpapers, to the Seller
Representative for the Seller Representative's review and comment. Buyer will
cause such Post-Closing Tax Return (as revised to incorporate the Seller
Representative's reasonable comments) to be filed timely with the appropriate
Governmental Authority and will provide a copy to the Seller Representative.

  



  

(c) _Tax Contests_. Buyer and the Company shall have the exclusive
authority to control any examination, investigation, audit, or
other proceeding in respect of any Tax Return or Taxes of the Company (a "Tax
Contest"), _provided_ that Buyer, the Seller Representative and the Company,
in each case separately bearing the costs and expenses such entity has
incurred, shall jointly control any such Tax Contest to the extent it relates
to Income Taxes or Income Tax Returns (including Pre-Closing
Information Returns) of the Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, and for
which Sellers are liable by statute (a "Joint Control Tax Contest"), Buyer
and the Company, on the one hand, and Seller Representative, on the other
hand, shall not settle or otherwise resolve any Joint Control Tax Contest or
issues raised in such Joint Control Tax Contest without the prior written
consent of Buyer and the Company or Seller Representative, as the case may be
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned).
Seller Representative shall designate a Person as the "partnership
representative" of the Company, in accordance with Section 6223 of the Code
and any similar provision under any state or local tax Laws (the
"Partnership Representative") with respect to taxable periods beginning on or
after January 1, 2018 and ending on or before the Closing Date. Seller
Representative shall cause the Partnership Representative to make the election
provided for in Section 6226 of the Code or any similar provision of any
state or local tax Laws with respect to any imputed underpayment determined in
connection with any Tax Contest in respect of the Company for taxable periods
of the Company beginning after December 31, 2017 and ending on or before the
Closing Date. No election shall be made to have the provisions of the
Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 apply to any taxable period of the Company
beginning before January 1, 2018.

  



  

(d) _Cooperation_. Buyer, the Company and the Seller Representative
shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to) use reasonable
efforts to (i) assist in the preparation and timely filing of any Income Tax
Return of the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period; (ii)
assist in any audit or other proceedings with respect to Income Taxes or
Income Tax Returns of the Company (whether or not a Tax Contest) for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period; (iii) make available any information,
records, or other documents relating to any Income Taxes or Income Tax
Returns of the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle
Period; (iv) provide any information required to allow Buyer, the Company or
the Seller Representative to comply with any information reporting or
withholding requirements contained in the Code or other applicable Laws; and
(v) provide certificates or forms, and timely execute any Tax Returns, that
are necessary or appropriate to establish an exemption from (or reduction in)
any Transfer Tax.

  



    

 | 38| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The Purchase Price and any
assumed liabilities and other consideration required to be taken into
account under applicable Law will be allocated among the Company's assets in
accordance with Sections 751(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder with respect to the Sellers and Section 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder with respect to Buyer. Buyer shall provide to
the Seller Representative a draft allocation of the Purchase Price, assumed
liabilities and any other consideration required to be taken into account
under applicable Law among the Company's assets (the "Draft Asset
Allocation") on or prior to the date that is 120 days after the Closing Date.
If Seller Representative does not object to the Draft Asset Allocation within
thirty (30) days after its receipt by Seller Representative, the Draft Asset
Allocation shall be deemed to have been accepted and agreed upon, and final
and conclusive, for all purposes of this Agreement (subject to subsequent
adjustment in connection with a subsequent adjustment to the Purchase Price,
as provided below). If Seller Representative objects to any portion of the
Draft Asset Allocation in writing within thirty (30) days after receipt of the
Draft Asset Allocation, Buyer and Seller Representative shall act in good
faith to resolve any such dispute in the thirty (30) days following
Buyer's receipt of Seller Representative's written objection. If Buyer and
Seller Representative do not reach agreement within such 30-day period with
respect to all items objected to by Seller Representative with respect to the
Draft Asset Allocation, Buyer and Seller Representative will jointly select a
nationally recognized accounting firm to determine any items upon which
agreement has not been so reached (the "Referee"). The Referee shall
determine all items upon which agreement has not been so reached with respect
to the Draft Asset Allocation within thirty (30) days after the submission of
such items to the Referee. The cost of the Referee shall be borne jointly by
Buyer and Seller Representative. The Parties will file timely any forms and
statements required under U.S. federal, state and local income Tax laws
consistent with the Draft Asset Allocation as agreed to or as
finally determined by the Referee, as the case may be (the "Asset
Allocation"). The Asset Allocation will be revised to take into account any
subsequent adjustments to the Purchase Price and any changes to the assumed
liabilities or other consideration required to be taken into account under
applicable Law, in the manner provided by Sections 751(a) and 1060 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. The Parties will not file any Tax
Return or otherwise take any position with respect to Taxes which is
inconsistent with such Asset Allocation, except as required by applicable Law
following a Final Determination.

  



  

7.11 _Transfer Taxes_. Buyer will pay, and will indemnify and hold
each Seller harmless against, any transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges
and other similar fees and charges (including any penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement imposed on the Company or any Seller as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, "Transfer
Taxes"). Any Tax Return or other document required to be filed with respect
to Transfer Taxes shall be prepared and timely filed by the party required by
applicable Law to do so at such party's expense. The Parties shall cooperate
in the filing of any such returns, including promptly supplying any
information in their possession that is reasonably necessary to complete such
returns.

7.12 _Independent Investigation; No Reliance_. Buyer agrees and
acknowledges that Buyer and/or its Representatives have inspected and
conducted such reasonable independent review, investigation and analysis
(financial and otherwise) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as desired by
Buyer. The acquisition of the Company Units and consummation of the other
transactions contemplated hereby by Buyer are not done in reliance upon any
representation or warranty or omission by, or information from, the Sellers,
the Company or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives, whether
oral or written, express or implied, including any implied warranty of
merchantability or of fitness for a particular purpose, except for the
representations and warranties specifically and expressly set forth in
_ARTICLE IV_ and _ARTICLE V_ (in each case, as modified by the Schedules) and
in any certificate delivered by any Seller or the Company pursuant to this
Agreement, and Buyer acknowledges that the Sellers expressly disclaim
any other representations and warranties. Such acquisition and consummation
are instead done entirely on the basis of Buyer's own investigation,
analysis, judgment and assessment of the present and potential value and
earning power of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as well as those
representations and warranties by the Sellers specifically and expressly set
forth in _ARTICLE IV_ and _ARTICLE V_ (in each case, as modified by the
Schedules) and in any certificate delivered by any Seller or the Company
pursuant to this Agreement, and Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyer is
sophisticated in both financial matters and with respect to the industry in
which the Company and its Subsidiaries each operate. In connection with
Buyer's and its Affiliates' investigation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, Buyer and its Affiliates have received from or on behalf of the
Company and its Subsidiaries certain projections, including projected
statements of operating revenues and income from operations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries and certain business plan information of the Company and
its Subsidiaries. Buyer acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to make such estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans,
that Buyer and its Affiliates are familiar with such uncertainties, that
Buyer and its Affiliates are taking full responsibility for making their own
evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections and
other forecasts and plans so furnished to it (including the reasonableness of
the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts), and
that Buyer and its Affiliates shall have no claim against the Sellers, the
Company or its Subsidiaries, any of their Affiliates or any of their
Representatives of any of the foregoing with respect thereto. Buyer further
acknowledges that none of the Sellers, the Company, nor any other Person has
made any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or
completeness of any information regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries,
their business or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not
specifically and expressly set forth in the representations and warranties
set forth in _ARTICLE IV_ and _ARTICLE V_ (in each case, as modified by the
Schedules) or in any certificate delivered by any Seller or the Company
pursuant to this Agreement, and none of the Sellers, the Company or any other
Person will have or be subject to any liability to Buyer or any other Person
resulting from the distribution to Buyer or its Representatives or Buyer's
use of any such information, including any management
presentation distributed on behalf of the Company relating to its business
and that of its Subsidiaries or other publications or data room
(including any electronic or "virtual" data room) information provided or
made available to Buyer or its Representatives, or any other document or
information in any form provided or made available to Buyer or its
Representatives, including management presentations, in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that,
except to the extent specifically set forth in _ARTICLE IV_ and _ARTICLE V_
(in each case, as modified by the Schedules) or in any certificate delivered
by any Seller or the Company pursuant to this Agreement, Buyer is acquiring
the Company on an 'as is, where is' basis.

7.13 _Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a) The Company shall take such action as may be necessary to cause
the Confidentiality Agreement to be terminated concurrently with the Closing.

  



  

(b) From and after the Closing (and, with respect to the obligations

Party hereto or any of its Affiliates or Representatives shall disclose to
any third party the existence of this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents, the subject matter or terms hereof or thereof or any information
relating to the negotiation hereof or thereof and (ii) the
Seller Representative and each Seller shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates and Representatives to, maintain in confidence any information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries obtained by virtue of a
Seller's ownership of the Company prior to the Closing, in each case, without
the prior written consent of Buyer, in the case of disclosure by a Seller, or
the Seller Representative, in the case of disclosure by Buyer; _provided_
that the parties hereto shall be permitted to disclose such information (w)
solely with respect to clause (i) above, to their Representatives or investors
who reasonably require such information, (x) in connection with enforcing
their rights under this Agreement or any other agreement entered into in
connection with this Agreement, (y) as required by Law or this Agreement and
(z) that becomes publicly available without breach of this _Section 7.13_ (
_e.g._ , by a mutually agreeable press release).

  



  

7.14 _Limitation and Disclaimer of Implied Representations or
Warranties._

  



  

(a) EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN _ARTICLE IV_ AND ANY
CERTIFICATE DELIVERED BY THE COMPANY PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT,
BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT NONE OF THE COMPANY NOR ANY OF ITS
AFFILIATES (OTHER THAN THE SELLERS) OR REPRESENTATIVES MAKES, HAS MADE OR
SHALL BE DEEMED TO MAKE OR HAVE MADE ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS
OR IMPLIED, AT LAW OR IN EQUITY (INCLUDING, FOR THIS PURPOSE, ANY
INFORMATION, DOCUMENTS OR MATERIAL MADE AVAILABLE TO BUYER IN ANY DATA ROOM,
MANAGEMENT PRESENTATION OR THE LIKE), AND ANY SUCH OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES ARE HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED. NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES
ARE MADE WITH RESPECT TO ANY ESTIMATES, PROJECTIONS OR OTHER FORECASTS AND
PLANS (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE REASONABLENESS OF THE ASSUMPTIONS
UNDERLYING SUCH ESTIMATES, PROJECTIONS AND FORECASTS), AND, TO THE EXTENT ANY
SUCH REPRESENTATION IS OR HAS BEEN MADE, SUCH REPRESENTATIONS ARE HEREBY
DISCLAIMED.

(b) EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN _ARTICLE VI_ , SELLERS
ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT NONE OF BUYER NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES OR
REPRESENTATIVES MAKES, HAS MADE OR SHALL BE DEEMED TO MAKE OR HAVE MADE ANY
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, AND ANY
SUCH OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ARE HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED.

  



  

7.15 _Affiliate Agreements_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 7.15_ ,
the Sellers shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to,
effective upon the Closing, terminate all Affiliate Agreements without any
further right, obligation or liability of any Person thereunder.

  



  

7.16 _Non-Solicitation_. From and after the date hereof for a period
of two (2) years following the Closing, each Seller agrees that neither it nor
its Affiliates will, without Buyer's prior written consent, directly or
indirectly (including through any Seller's or its Affiliates'
Representatives), solicit for employment (whether as an employee, consultant
or temporary employee, but excluding any solicitations made by job
opportunity advertisements and headhunter searches, in each case, directed to
the general public and not targeting any employees of the Company) or hire
any member of management (including any national sales account manager, plant
manager or regional manager) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except
that this paragraph shall not preclude any Seller or any other Person from
entering into discussions with, soliciting or hiring any such Person whose
employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries terminated (whether such
termination was initiated by such Person or by the Company and its
Subsidiaries) at least six (6) months prior to commencement of discussions
with such Seller or other Person.

7.17 _Debt Financing_.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates (including, for the avoidance of doubt, its Subsidiaries) to, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective
Representatives (including legal and accounting representatives) to,
cooperate in any manner that is reasonably requested by Buyer in connection
with Buyer's efforts to obtain debt financing (the "Debt Financing"), the
proceeds of which may be applied in whole or in part to finance the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement ( _provided_ that such requested
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries), including: (i) assisting Buyer with the
preparation of materials for (A) customary lender presentations, syndication
memoranda, bank information memoranda and similar documents required in
connection with the Debt Financing and (B) rating agency presentations; (ii)
(A) furnishing Buyer and the financing sources for the Debt Financing
(the "Debt Financing Sources"), as promptly as practicable, with (x) the

receivables and inventory of the Company; (v) if EKSandH LLLP shall have
withdrawn its audit opinion with respect to any of the audited financial

(A)(1) any of the financial statements included in clause (ii) above shall

Business Days prior to the Closing Date in connection with such debt financing
under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including, without limitation, the PATRIOT Act and the CDD Rule;
_provided_  that neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates shall be
required to pay any commitment or other similar fee in connection with the
Debt Financing that is not subject to the expense reimbursement provision
contained in clause (c) below; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
effectiveness of any documentation executed by the Company with respect to the

Company, or its reputation or goodwill.

  



  

(c) Buyer shall (i) promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse
the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, costs and
expenses (including, to the extent incurred at the request or with the consent

indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Affiliates and
Representatives from and against any and all losses suffered or incurred
by them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and any

of the foregoing arise from (x) the bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct of, or material breach of this Agreement by, the Company or any of
its Affiliates or Representatives, or (y) information provided by or on behalf
of the Company or any of its Affiliates or Representatives.

  



  

7.18 _Allocation and Payment of Potential Settlement Proceeds_. With
respect to that certain legal proceeding commonly referred to as AGLIC v.
Environmental Materials, Inc. v. Moody Ins. Agency, Inc., United States
District Court for the District of Colorado, Case No. 16-CV-02478-MSK-CBS
(the "Insurance Dispute"), the Parties agree that any cash proceeds that are
received by the Company or any of its Affiliates from the settlement, final
judgment or other resolution of the Insurance Dispute after the Closing Date,
net of any liability for Taxes incurred by the Company or its owners or
Affiliates as a result of the receipt of such proceeds, shall be paid (A)
first, to the Company in an amount equal to the total amount of all claims
discharged, and third-party costs and expenses incurred and paid or accrued

the Insurance Dispute without the consent of Buyer, as long as such
settlement or disposition does not impose any material obligation on,
or otherwise restrict the operations of, the Company or any of its Affiliates
following the Closing. If the Insurance Dispute is not settled or otherwise
disposed of prior to the Closing, following the Closing, the Buyer shall
promptly notify the Seller Representative of any material developments

Escrow Amount exists, Buyer and the Seller Representative shall deliver joint

(b) Within five (5) Business Days after the later of (a) the
consummation of all payments required pursuant to _Section

Payment in the definition of Company Debt shall in no way limit or reduce the
release of any Remaining Earn-out Escrow Amount to the Seller Representative,
on behalf of the Sellers, in accordance with this _Section 7.20(b)_.

ARTICLE X 
 MISCELLANEOUS AND GENERAL

10.9 _No Survival; Certain Waivers; Limited Liability_.

  



  

(a) Except in the case of Fraud by any Party with respect to making
of the representations and warranties in _ARTICLE IV_ , _ARTICLE V_ or
_ARTICLE VI_ (and then only with respect to the Party committing such Fraud),
the representations and warranties and covenants and agreements (to the
extent contemplating or requiring performance at or prior to the Closing) of
Buyer, the Company, the Sellers and the Seller Representative set forth in
this Agreement or in any certificate delivered in connection with this
Agreement will not survive the Closing, and there will be no liability in
respect thereto. The covenants and agreements of the Parties set forth in
this Agreement to the extent contemplating or requiring performance after the
Closing will survive until the last date for performance of such covenant or
agreement as provided herein.

  



  

(b) Buyer, on behalf of itself and on behalf of its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries), intends
to and acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Closing, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, including by contractually
shortening the applicable statute of limitations, any rights, claims and
causes of action it may have against the Seller Representative, the Sellers
and any other former direct or indirect equity holders of the Company or their
Affiliates, and any predecessors, successors and assigns of Seller
Representative, or any such equity holders or Affiliates and each of their
respective Representatives, at, or prior to, the Closing, relating to the
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries or their businesses, whether
arising under, or based upon, any Law (including any right, whether arising at
law or in equity, to seek indemnification, breach of contract, contribution,
cost recovery, damages or any other recourse or remedy, including as may arise
under common law) are hereby irrevocably waived, except in the case of Fraud
by a Party with respect to making of the representations and warranties in
_ARTICLE IV_ or _ARTICLE V_ (and then only with respect to the Party
committing such Fraud). Furthermore, without limiting the generality of this
_Section 10.9(b)_ and except in the case of Fraud by a Party with respect
to making of the representations and warranties in _ARTICLE IV_ or _ARTICLE
V_ (and then only with respect to the Party committing such Fraud), no claim
will be brought or maintained by, or on behalf of, Buyer or its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) against
Seller Representative, the Sellers and any other former direct and indirect
equity holders of the Company, their Affiliates and any predecessors,
successors and assigns of Seller Representative or any such equity holders or
Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives, and no recourse will
be sought or granted against any of them, by virtue of, or based upon, the
business or the ownership, operation, management, use or control of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or any of their assets.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 10.9(b)_
, no Seller is released from (i) any claims or causes of action arising under
the Transaction Documents with respect solely to covenants and agreements
required by the terms thereof to be performed by such Seller, (ii) with
respect solely to those individual Sellers set forth on _Schedule
10.9(b)(ii)_ , any claim or cause of action related to service by such
Seller to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or under any employment
agreement, restrictive covenants found in the LLC Agreement, or employee
benefit plan with or benefiting such Seller, (iii) with respect solely to
those individual Sellers set forth on _Schedule 10.9(b)(iii)_, any claim or
cause of action related to service by such Seller to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or under any employment agreement, restrictive covenants found
in the LLC Agreement (other than the non-competition and other obligations set
forth in Sections 12.06(a) and 12.06(b) of the LLC Agreement, and provided
that the Parties agree that, with respect solely to those individual Sellers,
(x) the determination of which products the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
can provide or service they can supply for purposes of Section 12.06(c) of
the LLC Agreement shall be made as of the Closing and not as of any future
time, (y) the qualifier found at the end of Section 12.06(c)(A) of the LLC
Agreement, which reads "…to purchase any product or provide any service which
could be supplied by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the ordinary
course of its or their business as conducted at that time", shall apply to
all Persons described in Section 12.06(c)(A), and (z) the restrictions of
Section 12.06(c)(A) of the LLC Agreement shall apply only to the extent that
such Seller uses Company Information (as defined in the LLC Agreement) to
engage in such solicitation or attempted solicitation), or employee benefit
plan with or benefiting such Seller or (iv) any Fraud, unlawful activity or
violation of Law by such Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, the Sellers
listed on _Schedule 10.9(b)(iii)_  are hereby fully and forever released from
the non-competition and other obligations set forth in Sections 12.06(a) and
12.06(b) of the LLC Agreement.

(c) Each Seller, on behalf of itself and on behalf of its
Affiliates, successors and assigns, as applicable, intends to and
acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Closing, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, including by contractually
shortening the applicable statute of limitations, any rights, claims and
causes of action it may have against the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, their respective Affiliates and any predecessors, successors
and assigns of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective Affiliates (the "Buyer Released Parties"), at, or prior to, the
Closing, relating to the operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries or
its businesses, whether arising under, or based upon, any Law (including any
right, whether arising at law or in equity, to seek indemnification, breach
of contract, contribution, cost recovery, damages or any other recourse or
remedy, including as may arise under common law) are hereby irrevocably
waived; _provided_ that no Buyer Released Party shall be released from (i)
any claim or cause of action related to or arising out of service to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or under any employment agreement,
restrictive covenants or employee benefit plan, (ii) any claims or causes of
action arising under the Transaction Documents with respect solely to
covenants and agreements required by the terms thereof to be performed by such
Buyer Released Party, (iii) any claims for indemnification and/or advancement
of expenses in connection with one's status as a current or former employee,
officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
Affiliates, or (iv) any Fraud, unlawful activity or violation of Law by such
Buyer Released Party. Furthermore, without limiting the generality of this
_Section 10.9(c)_ , and except as set forth in this _Section 10.9(c)_ , no
claim will be brought or maintained by, or on behalf of, any Seller or any of
its Affiliates, successors or assigns against any Buyer Released Party, and no
recourse will be sought or granted against any of them, by virtue of, or
based upon, the business or the ownership, operation, management, use or
control of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or any of their
assets, or any actions or omissions at, or prior to, the Closing.

  



  

(d) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that it will be solely
responsible for its own representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements and will not be liable or otherwise responsible for the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of any other
Party, whether before, at or after the Closing.

  



    

 | 53| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) Each Party acknowledges that the covenants and agreements set
forth in this _Section 10.9_ are an essential element to this Agreement and
that, but for these covenants, none of the other Parties would have entered
into this Agreement or otherwise agreed to consummate the transactions
contemplated in the Transaction Documents.

  



  

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall or shall be interpreted or
deemed to affect any rights that Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) may have
under the RandW Policy.

  



  

10.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement is to be governed by, and
construed and enforced in accordance with, the internal Laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or
rule and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract or in tort, in
law or in equity) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement (including any representation or warranty made in or in connection
with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement) shall
be determined and adjudicated under the Laws of the State of Delaware.

  



  

10.11 _Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process_. Except for the
matters to be decided by the Arbitration Firm, the Parties hereby irrevocably
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery or, if
jurisdiction is unavailable in the Delaware Court of Chancery, the courts of
the United States located in the State of Delaware or, if jurisdiction is
unavailable in the courts of the United States located in the State of
Delaware, the Delaware Superior Court, in each case, in respect of the
interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents and any dispute or controversy related to the
negotiation, execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and hereby waive, and agree not to assert,
as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or
enforcement of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents or any
dispute or controversy related to the negotiation, execution, delivery or
performance of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, that
they are not subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not
be brought or is not maintainable in such courts or that this Agreement may
not be enforced in or by such courts or that their property is exempt or
immune from execution, that the suit, action or proceeding is brought in an
inconvenient forum, or that the venue of the suit, action or proceeding is
improper. Service of process with respect thereto may be made upon Buyer
or Seller Representative by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified
mail, postage prepaid, to such Party at its address as provided in _Section
10.5_.

not performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties will be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without a bond or other
security being required, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled hereunder, at law or in equity, and in furtherance of the
foregoing, the Parties hereby agree not to raise any objections to the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement, and

10.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
KNOWINGLY, INTENTIONALLY, VOLUNTARILY, IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL
ACTION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR

10.14 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to that

remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or
enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any
other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be
unenforceable, the provision will be interpreted to be only so broad as is
enforceable.

  



  

10.15 _Construction_. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. If any ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of
the provisions of this Agreement. The table of contents contained in this
Agreement is for reference purposes only and will not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the context may
require, any pronoun includes the corresponding masculine, feminine and
neuter forms. Unless the context otherwise requires, any references to any
agreement or other instrument or statute or regulation are to it as amended
and supplemented from time to time (and, in the case of a statute or
regulation, to any successor provisions). Any reference to a "day" or number
of "days" (without the explicit qualification of "business") will be
interpreted as a reference to a calendar day or number of calendar days. If
any action or notice is to be taken or given on or by a particular calendar
day, and such calendar day is not a business day, then such action or notice
will be deferred until, or may be taken or given on, the next business day.
The words "include," "includes" or "including" (or any other tense or
variation of the word "include") in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
followed by the words "without limitation." When reference is made in this
Agreement to an Article, Section, Annex, Exhibit or Schedule, such reference
shall be to an Article, Section, Annex, Exhibit or Schedule of this Agreement,
unless otherwise indicated. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and
words of similar import, when used in this Agreement, shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as
well as to the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as the
feminine and neuter genders of such terms. All references to cash or dollar
amounts in this Agreement shall be references to United States Dollars.

10.16 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts (including counterparts transmitted via facsimile or in .pdf or
similar format), each of which will be deemed an original but all of which
will constitute but one instrument. If any signature is delivered by
electronic mail delivery of a .pdf or similar format data file, such signature
shall create a valid and binding obligation of the party executing (or on
whose behalf such signature is executed) with the same force and effect as if
such .pdf or similar format signature page were an original thereof.

  



  

10.17 _Representation of Sellers and Their Affiliates_. It is
acknowledged by the Parties that the Sellers and the Company have retained
Davis Graham and Stubbs LLP (the "Firm") to act as their counsel in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer hereby agrees that, in the
event that a dispute arises after the Closing between Buyer and the Company on
the one hand, and any Seller on the other hand, in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution or delivery of this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents, or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, the Firm, or its successor, may represent the
Sellers in such dispute even though the interests of the Sellers may be
directly adverse to the Company, and even though the Firm may have
represented the Company in a matter substantially related to such dispute, or
may be handling ongoing matters for the Company. Buyer further agrees that,
as to all pre-Closing communications among the Firm or its successor, the
Sellers and/or the Company and their respective Affiliates or Representatives
that relate to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and closing under, or any
dispute or proceeding arising under or in connection with, this Agreement)
which, immediately prior to the Closing, would be protected by the attorney-
client communication and/or work product doctrine ("Privileged
Communications"), shall continue after the Closing to be protected by the
attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine and shall belong to
and be controlled solely by the Sellers and may be waived by the Sellers;
_provided_ that the foregoing shall not extend to (i) any communication to the
extent not involving this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or (ii) any
dispute that arises between Buyer, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates, on the one hand, and a third party other than the Sellers, on the
other hand. The Privileged Communications shall not lose their status as
protected by the attorney-client communication and/or work product doctrine
and belonging to and controlled by the Sellers solely by reason of Buyer and
the Company and their respective successors and assigns having access to such
documents and communications after Closing if such documents and
communications were in the Company's possession immediately prior to Closing.
After Closing, none of Buyer, the Company or any Person acting or purporting
to act on behalf of or through Buyer or the Company shall intentionally
access, or request from the Firm or the Sellers, the Privileged
Communications; _provided_ that none of Buyer, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates shall be required to return, destroy or delete any such
communications or other files or materials that have been saved in accordance
with ordinary document retention or data back-up policies. Following the
Closing, the Sellers shall be permitted to use the Privileged Communications
with respect to any claim in connection with the defense of any claim by
Buyer, subject to applicable Law and rules of evidence. Other than as
explicitly set forth in this _Section 10.17_ , the Parties acknowledge that
any attorney-client privilege or work product or other privilege attaching as
a result of legal counsel representing the Company prior to the Closing shall
survive the Closing and continue to be a privilege of the Company, and not the
Sellers, after the Closing.

Representative hereunder, as his, her or its lawful attorney-in-fact with
full power of substitution, with the exclusive authority to act as
such hereunder as further provided in this _Section 10.18_. This power of
attorney, and all authority hereby conferred, is irrevocable and will not be
terminated by any act of any Seller or by operation of Law, whether by the
death or incapacity of any Seller or by the occurrence of any other event.
The Parties shall be entitled to rely conclusively on the instructions
and decisions of the Seller Representative as to any actions permitted to be
taken by the Seller Representative hereunder.

  



  

(b) Except as specifically set forth in this _Section 10.18_ to the
contrary, the Seller Representative will have full power and authority to act
on each Seller's behalf with respect to all matters under or in connection
with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and in general to do all things
and to perform all acts (including executing any and all documents) on each
Seller's behalf as may be contemplated by this Agreement or which may be
necessary, convenient or appropriate to facilitate the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and the exercise of all rights and the
performance of all obligations hereunder, including: (i) receiving and making
payments under or pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and
disbursements thereof to the Sellers, as contemplated by this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement; (ii) receiving and forwarding of notices and
communications pursuant to this Agreement and accepting service of process;
(iii) giving or agreeing to, on behalf of all Sellers or any Seller, any and
all consents and waivers deemed by the Seller Representative, in its
reasonable and good faith discretion, to be necessary or appropriate under
this Agreement and the execution or delivery of any documents that may be
necessary or appropriate in connection therewith; and (iv) with respect to
all other matters arising under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, (A)
disputing or refraining from disputing, on behalf of each Seller with respect
to any amounts to be received by the Sellers under this Agreement or any
agreements contemplated hereby, including the Escrow Agreement, (B)

respect to such dispute or remedy.

  



    

 | 57| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) Prior to any payment of any amount to the Sellers under this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, the Seller Representative may set
aside therefrom (based upon the Sellers' respective Pro Rata Percentage), and
direct the payor thereof to pay to an account or accounts designated by the
Seller Representative, an amount that the Seller Representative reasonably
deems advisable to satisfy any existing or future obligations that may be
owed by the Sellers under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement or otherwise
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or to
satisfy any existing or future costs, expenses, liabilities, Taxes or other
amounts that the Seller Representative may incur in connection with acting in
such capacity under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 10.18_
, the Seller Representative shall have no authority to act as attorney-in-
fact or otherwise for any Seller in connection with any breach of or default
under this Agreement for which such Seller, and only such Seller, is liable.

  



  

(e) The Seller Representative is acting solely in an agency capacity
and will have no personal liability to any Party hereto or any other Person
of any type for any action taken, or inaction, in the capacity of the Seller
Representative. The Seller Representative shall have no duties except those
which are expressly set forth herein. In connection with the exercise of its
duties, the Seller Representative will be entitled to consult with and rely
upon legal counsel and other professional advisors, with the costs thereof
(and all other out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Seller Representative
incident to discharging its duties under this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement) to be allocated among the Sellers (the amount of which may
be withheld from any payment due to such Sellers hereunder). Each Seller
shall indemnify, defend and hold the Seller Representative harmless from and
against his, her or its Pro Rata Percentage of any and all losses, which the
Seller Representative may suffer or sustain as a result of any action taken,
or not taken, in good faith hereunder.

  



  

10.19 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claim, action, suit or other legal proceeding based upon or arising out
of this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement, may only be brought against the Persons that are party to this
Agreement and then only with respect to the specific terms of this Agreement
with respect to such Person. Except to the extent a party to this Agreement,
and then only to the extent of the specific terms of this Agreement undertaken
by such Person, (a) no past, present or future director, manager, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, shareholder, agent, attorney,
advisor, representative or Affiliate of any Person that has signed this
Agreement and (b) no past, present or future director, manager, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, shareholder, agent, attorney,
advisor, representative or Affiliate of any of the foregoing, will have any
liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or more
of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other
obligations or liabilities of any one or more of the Persons that have
executed and delivered this Agreement (whether for indemnification or
otherwise) of or for any claim based on, arising out of or related to this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement or otherwise, in no event shall this Section or any other provision
of this Agreement be deemed to limit the right of any Party to bring a claim
with respect to Fraud (but only against the Party committing such Fraud).

10.20 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, and for the avoidance of doubt, (a) each payment made pursuant to
this Agreement shall be made net of any Taxes required by applicable Law to
be deducted or withheld from such payment and (b) any amounts deducted or
withheld from any such payment shall be remitted to the applicable taxing
authority and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid.

For the avoidance of doubt, clause (a) shall take precedence over clause (b),
and clause (b) will take precedence over clause (c).

  



  

 _ _Specific Policies__

  



       | 1.  | Working Capital shall be drawn up as of the Effective
Time and shall be based on facts and circumstances as they exist as of the
Effective Time (and solely based on information available to the parties to
this Agreement as of the date on which the Closing Statement is delivered by
the Buyer to the Seller Representative). 
---|---|--- 
  



       | 2.  | Working Capital shall be prepared on the basis that the
Company is a going concern and shall exclude the effect of purchase accounting
adjustments that result from transactions contemplated by the Agreement,
change of control or ownership of the Company and will not take into account
the effects of any post-Closing reorganizations or the post-Closing intentions
or obligations of the Buyer. 
---|---|--- 
  



       | 3.  | The provisions of this Exhibit C shall be interpreted to
avoid double counting (whether positive or negative) of any item to be
included in Working Capital. 
---|---|--- 
  



       | 4.  | All intercompany accounts shall be reconciled and
eliminated in the preparation of Working Capital. 
---|---|--- 
  



       | 5.  | Assets and liabilities related to commercial insurance
shall be included in Working Capital consistent with the sample calculation in
Part B below. At the onset of each policy year, the annual premiums are paid
in advance and recorded as a prepaid current asset, with the associated
obligation split between a current payable (installments) or financed with a
third-party and recorded as current debt. 
---|---|--- 
  



       | a.  | The prepaid premiums shall be recorded as a current
asset and amortized during policy year. 
---|---|--- 
  



       | b.  | The financed premiums shall be recorded as a current
liability. 
---|---|--- 
  



    



 



    



       | 6.  | General liability and workers compensation reserves shall
be included in Working Capital as current liabilities. 
---|---|--- 
  



       | 7.  | General liability and workers compensation reserves will

any contemplation of incurred but not reported claims, and based on
management's best estimates and other factors including but not limited to: 
---|---|--- 
  



       | a.  | reserves provided by the Company's insurance carriers
(if applicable); 
---|---|--- 
  



       | b.  | evaluations of the implied damage by outside counsel and
third-party experts (if applicable); 
---|---|--- 
  



       | c.  | historical settlements; and 
---|---|--- 
  



       | d.  | for general liability claims only, the Company's current
repair cost estimates. 
---|---|--- 
  



       | 8.  | As consistent with the sample calculation in Part B
below, in calculating the Working Capital, there should be no change in the
classification to a current asset of any particular asset that has not
previously been characterized as a current asset, or the classification to a
long-term liability of any particular liability that has not previously been
characterized as a long-term liability (in each case, other than any such
changes resulting solely from the passage of time between the date hereof and
the Effective Time) or which is of a type that has not previously been
characterized as current or long-term, as the case may be. 
---|---|--- 
  



       | 9.  | The calculation of the bonus accruals included in Working
Capital should consider actual results relative to the plan on which the bonus
obligations are based through the Closing Date with the obligation recorded
reflecting the pro rata portion of the full-year bonus and profit sharing
payment. 
---|---|--- 
  



       | 10.  | Working Capital will be prepared as if the Closing Date
occurs at the end of an accounting and Tax period.
