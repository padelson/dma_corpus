# ARTICLE II 
EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

   

 Section 2.1 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of ParentCo, MergerCo or the Company or the holder of any capital stock of MergerCo or the Company: 

    

 (a) _Cancellation of Certain Common Equity_. Each share of Common Equity that is owned by MergerCo, ParentCo, the Company (as treasury stock or otherwise) or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries (other than, in each case, Shares held on behalf of third parties) will automatically be cancelled and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in  exchange therefor. 

    

 (b) _Conversion of Common Equity_. Each share of Common Equity (each, a " _Share_ " and collectively, the "Shares") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(a) and (ii) Dissenting Shares, if any (each, an " _Excluded Share_ " and collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ")) will be converted into the right to receive $50.75 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). 

      (c) _Cancellation of Shares_. At the Effective Time, (i) all Shares will no longer be outstanding and all Shares will be cancelled and will cease to exist, and, in the case of book-entry shares (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), the names of the former registered holders shall be removed from the registry of holders of such shares, and (ii) subject to Section 2.3, each holder of a certificate formerly representing any such Shares (each, a "Certificate") and each holder of a Book-Entry Share will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, in accordance with Section 2.2. 

    

 (d) _Conversion of MergerCo Capital Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of MergerCo issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into one share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

    

 Section 2.2 _Surrender of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares_. (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of Shares (other than Excluded Shares), ParentCo will (i) designate, or cause to be designated, a bank or trust company that is reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") and (ii) enter into a paying agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, with such Paying Agent to act as agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of Certificates upon surrender of such Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this Article II from time to time after the Effective Time. At or prior to the Effective Time, ParentCo will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash in amounts necessary for the payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(b) upon surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (such cash being herein referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available). Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments shall be property of and payable to the Surviving Corporation. 

    

 (b) _Payment Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of  record of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) a letter of transmittal in  customary form as reasonably agreed by the parties specifying that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates and Book-Entry Shares will pass, only upon proper delivery of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, as the case may be, to the Paying Agent and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon the proper surrender of a  Certificate (or effective affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share to the Paying Agent, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash in the amount (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings) that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Article II, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share may be paid to such a transferee if the Certificate or Book-Entry Share formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. 

      (c) _Withholding Taxes_. The Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares or holder of Stock Options, Restricted Stock, Company RSUs, Company SARs, Performance Shares, Company PUs or Company DEUs any amounts required to be deducted and withheld with respect to such payments under the Code and the rules and Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, or any  provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. Any amounts so deducted and  withheld will be timely paid to the applicable Tax authority and will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares or holders of Stock Options, Restricted Stock, Company RSUs, Company  SARs, Performance Shares, Company PUs or Company DEUs in respect of which such  deduction and withholding was made. 

    

 (d) _No Further Transfers_. After the Effective Time, there will be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle transfers of Shares that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Paying Agent, they will be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article II. 

    

 (e) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares nine months after the Effective Time will be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, on demand, and any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share who has not theretofore complied with this Article II will thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of his or her claims for Merger Consideration.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of ParentCo, MergerCo, the Company, the  Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other Person will be liable to  any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public  official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. 

    

 (f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if  required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in  customary amount and upon such terms as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably determine are necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement. 

    

 Section 2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary and to the extent available under the IBCA, any Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by a shareholder (a " _Dissenting Shareholder_ ") who has neither voted in favor of the approval of this Agreement nor consented thereto in writing and who has demanded properly in writing appraisal for such Shares and otherwise properly perfected and not withdrawn or lost his or her rights (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") in accordance with the provisions of Section 490.1302 of the IBCA will not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration. Such Dissenting Shareholders will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of Dissenting Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of such Section 490.1302, except that all Dissenting Shares held by shareholders who have failed to perfect or who effectively have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 490.1323 will thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration in the manner provided in Article II and will no longer be Excluded Shares. The Company will give MergerCo prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law received by the Company relating to shareholders rights of appraisal. The Company will give MergerCo the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal. The Company will not, except with the prior written consent of MergerCo, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisals of Dissenting Shares, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal or other treatment of any such demands. 

     Section 2.4 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, changes the number of Shares, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares, issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration will be equitably adjusted to provide the holders of Shares and Company Equity Awards with the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ that nothing in this Section 2.4 shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. 

    

 Section 2.5 _Treatment of Stock Options and Other Equity Based Awards_. (a) Each option to purchase Shares (collectively, the " _Stock Options_ ") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the Common Equity Award Plans, whether or not then exercisable or vested, will at the Effective Time be cancelled and the holder of such Stock Option will, in full settlement of such Stock Option, receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount (subject to any applicable withholding tax) in cash equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration or, with respect to Stock Options granted under the 2004 Stock Grant Plan, the "Change of Control Price" as defined therein if greater than the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share of such Stock Option multiplied by (y) the number of Shares subject to such Stock Option (with the aggregate amount of such payment rounded up to the nearest whole cent). The holders of Stock Options will have no further rights in respect of any Stock Options from and after the Effective Time. 

    

 (b) Each Company SAR outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the Common Equity Award Plans, whether or not then exercisable or vested, will at the Effective Time be cancelled and the holder of such Company SAR will, in  full settlement of such Company SAR, receive from the Surviving Corporation an  amount (subject to any applicable withholding tax) in cash equal to the product  of (x) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration or, with respect to  Company SARs granted under the 2004 Stock Grant Plan, the "Change of  Control Price" as defined therein if greater than the Merger Consideration  over the exercise price per Share of such Company SAR multiplied by (y) the  number of Shares subject to such Company SAR (with the aggregate amount of such  payment rounded up to the nearest whole cent). The holders of Company SARs will  have no further rights in respect of any Company SARs from and after the  Effective Time. 

    

 (c) As of the Effective Time, each share of Restricted Stock that is outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested, will be  cancelled and extinguished, and the holder thereof will be entitled to receive  from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash equal to the Merger  Consideration or, with respect to Restricted Stock granted under the 2004 Stock  Grant Plan, the "Change of Control Price" as defined therein if  greater than the Merger Consideration, without interest, in respect of each  cancelled share of Restricted Stock. 

    

 (d) As of the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior  to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested, will be cancelled and  extinguished, and the holder thereof will be entitled to receive from the  Surviving Corporation an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration or,  with respect to Company RSUs granted under the 2004 Stock Grant Plan, the  "Change of Control Price" as defined therein if greater than the  Merger Consideration, without interest, in respect of each cancelled Company  RSU. 

     (e) As of the Effective Time, each Performance Share that is outstanding immediately  prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested, will be cancelled and  extinguished, and the holder thereof will be entitled to receive from the  Surviving Corporation an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the Merger  Consideration or, with respect to Performance Shares granted under the 2004  Stock Grant Plan, the "Change of Control Price" as defined therein if  greater than the Merger Consideration, without interest, in respect of each  cancelled Performance Share, multiplied by (ii) a fraction the numerator of  which is the number of whole months that have elapsed from the beginning of the  performance period to which the Performance Share is subject to the date of the  Effective Time and the dominator of which is the number of whole months in such  performance period. 

    

 (f) As of the Effective Time, each Company PU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested, will be cancelled and  extinguished, and the holder thereof will be entitled to receive from the  Surviving Corporation an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the Merger  Consideration or, with respect to Company PUs granted under the 2004 Stock Grant Plan, the "Change of Control Price" as defined therein if greater than the Merger Consideration, without interest, in respect of each cancelled Company PU, multiplied by (ii) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of whole months that have elapsed from the beginning of the performance period to which the Company PU is subject to the date of the Effective Time and the dominator of which is the number of whole months in such performance period. 

    

 (g) Each Company DEU outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the Common Equity Award Plans, whether or not then exercisable or vested, will, at the Effective Time, be fully vested and paid. The holders of Company DEUs will have no further rights in respect of any Company DEU from and after the  Effective Time. 

    

 (h) Promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall pay to each holder of a Company Equity Award that consents or is subject to the treatment that this Section 2.5 contemplates in respect of all of such holders Common Equity Awards the cash payments specified in this Section 2.5. 

    

 (i) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will use its best efforts to obtain all  necessary waivers, consents or releases, in form and substance reasonably  satisfactory to ParentCo, from holders of Company Equity Awards under the Common Equity Award Plans and take all such other action, without incurring any  Liabilities in connection therewith, as may be necessary to give effect to the  transactions contemplated by this Section 2.5 (the " _Equity Award  Waivers_ "). Except as otherwise agreed to by the parties, (i) the Common Equity Award Plans shall terminate as of the Effective Time and the provisions in any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time and (ii) the Company shall assure that following the Effective Time participants holding  Common Equity Awards representing rights to acquire at least 65% of Shares  subject to such Common Equity Awards granted pursuant to the Bandag,  Incorporated 1999 Stock Award Plan, as amended March 12, 2002, shall have  executed Equity Award Waivers and shall have no right under the Common Equity  Award Plans or other plans, programs or arrangements to acquire any equity  securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof.

Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary nor, to the Companys Knowledge, any Company Joint Venture, is in violation of its organizational or governing documents, except for such violations that would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

There are no bonds, debentures,  notes or other instruments of indebtedness of the Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries that have the right to vote, or that are convertible or  exchangeable into or exercisable for securities or other rights having the right to vote, on any matters on which shareholders of the Company may vote. 

    

 Section 3.8 _Financial Reports and SEC Documents_. (a) The Company has filed or furnished all forms, statements, reports and documents required to be filed or furnished by it with the SEC since December 31, 2003 (the forms, statements, reports and documents filed or furnished with the SEC since December 31, 2003, including any amendments thereto, the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). Each of the Company SEC Documents, at the time of its filing (except as and to the extent such Company SEC Document has been modified or superseded in any subsequent Company SEC Document filed or furnished and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement), complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of each of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Securities Act_ "). As of their respective dates, except as and to the extent modified or superseded in any subsequent Company SEC Document filed or furnished and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company SEC Documents did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading.

     (c) The management of the Company has (x) implemented disclosure controls and  procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) that are  reasonably designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, by others within those entities, and (y) disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation, to the Companys outside auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (A) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and (B) any fraud known to the Company, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting. Since December 31, 2003, any material change in internal control over financial reporting or failure or inadequacy of disclosure controls required to be disclosed in any Company SEC Document has been so disclosed. 

    

 (d) To the Companys Knowledge, from December 31, 2003 through the date of this  Agreement, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any director,  officer, or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has obtained  Knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether  written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,  methodologies or methods of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their  respective internal accounting controls relating to periods after December 31,  2003 (except for any of the foregoing that have been resolved without any  material impact on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and  except for any of the foregoing which have no reasonable basis), except, in the  case of any of such matters above, as would not, reasonably be expected to have  a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

    

 Section 3.9 _Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except (i) as and to the extent disclosed or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of the Company dated as of September 30, 2006 (including the notes thereto) included in the Company SEC Documents or (ii) as incurred since the date thereof in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any Company Joint Venture has any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether known or unknown, absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due, that would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

    

 Section 3.10 _Absence of Certain Changes_. (a) Since September 30, 2006, there has not been any Company Material Adverse Effect or any change, event or development that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

    

 (b) Since September 30, 2006 and through the date of this Agreement, the Company and each of its Material Subsidiaries have conducted their business in the ordinary  course of business consistent with past practice in all material respects, and  there has not been any (i) action or event that, if taken on or after the date  of this Agreement without MergerCos consent, would violate the provisions  of any of Sections 5.1(a), (b), (c)(i)  (ii), (c)(iv)  (v), (d)(i)   (iii) or (d)(v)), (e) (except with respect to mergers or consolidations  between entities that were wholly owned by the Company at the time of merger or  consolidation), (f) (except with respect to dispositions of assets or securities having an aggregate value not in excess of $2,000,000 for all such dispositions for fair market value and except for sales of receivables pursuant to the Companys receivables facility and collection and other sales and  dispositions of assets in the ordinary course of business consistent with past  practice), (g), (h), (j), (k), (l), (m), (n), (o) (except with respect to the  Companys Subsidiaries or former Subsidiaries), (q) and (r) or (ii)  agreement or commitment to do any of the foregoing. 

     Section 3.11 _Litigation_. There are no claims, actions, suits, judicial, administrative or regulatory proceedings, or investigations before any Governmental Entity (each, a " _Legal Action_ ") pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any executive officer or director of Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with his or her status as a director or executive officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which (i) is reasonably expected as of the date of this Agreement to involve an amount in controversy in excess of $1,000,000, (ii) would reasonably be expected to have the effect of preventing, making illegal, or otherwise interfering with, any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii) would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. There is no outstanding Order against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any property, asset or operation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound or affected that would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of the Company, as of the date of this Agreement, neither the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, nor any executive officer or director of the Company or any such Subsidiary is under investigation by any Governmental Entity related to the conduct of the Companys or any such Subsidiarys business which would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

    

 Section 3.12 _Contracts_. (a) As of the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by: (i) any Contract which is a "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act) to be performed in full or in part after the date of this Agreement that has not been filed or incorporated by reference in the Company SEC Documents; (ii) any Contract which is a Company Joint Venture Agreement; (iii) any Contract which constitutes a contract or commitment relating to indebtedness for borrowed money or the deferred purchase price of property (in either case, whether incurred, assumed, guaranteed or secured by any asset) in excess of $1,000,000; (iv) any Contract which contains any non-competition, exclusivity or similar provision that would restrict or limit, in any material respect, the conduct of the business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or (v) any Other Contract. Each contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding of the type described in this Section 3.12(a), whether or not set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter or in the Company SEC Documents, together with the Customer Contracts, is referred to herein as a " _Material Contract_ " (for purposes of clarification, each "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act) to be performed after the date of this Agreement, whether or not filed with the SEC, is a Material Contract). 

    

 (b) (i) Each Material Contract is valid and binding on the Company and any of its  Subsidiaries that is a party thereto, as applicable, and in full force and  effect, other than any such Material Contract that expires or is terminated  after the date hereof in accordance with its terms or amended by agreement with  the counterparty thereto ( _provided_ that if any such Material Contract is  so amended in accordance with its terms after the date hereof (provided such  amendment is not prohibited by the terms of this Agreement), then to the extent  the representation and warranty contained in this sentence is made or deemed  made as of any date that is after the date of such amendment, the reference to  "Material Contract" in the first clause of this sentence shall be  deemed to be a reference to such contract as so amended), except where the  failure to be valid, binding and in full force and effect would not reasonably  be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (ii) the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has in all material respects performed all obligations  required to be performed by it to date under each Material Contract, except  where such noncompliance would not reasonably be expected to have a Company  Material Adverse Effect, and (iii) neither the Company nor any of its  Subsidiaries knows of, or has received notice of, the existence of any event or  condition which constitutes, or, after notice or lapse of time or both, will  constitute, a material default on the part of the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries under any such Material Contract, except where such default would  not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

      Section 3.13 _Benefit Plans_. (a) Section 3.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a correct and complete list of each material Company Benefit Plan, other than a Foreign Benefit Plan. Each Company Benefit Plan, other than a Foreign Benefit Plan, that is a "multiemployer plan" (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ") or a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control (within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA) (a " _Multiple Employer Plan_ ") is denoted as such on Section 3.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter. No entity is a member of the Companys "controlled group" (within the meaning of Section 414 of the Code) other than the Company and its Material Subsidiaries. The Company has no liability with respect to any plan, arrangement or practice of the type described in the definition of Company Benefit Plan other than the Company Benefit Plans. 

    

 (b) With respect to each material Company Benefit Plan, other than a Multiemployer Plan or a Foreign Benefit Plan, if applicable, the Company has provided to MergerCo correct and complete copies of (i) all plan texts and agreements and related trust agreements (or other funding vehicles); (ii) the most recent summary plan descriptions and material employee communications concerning the extent of the benefits provided under a Company Benefit Plan, other than a Multiemployer Plan; (iii) the two most recent annual reports (including all schedules); (iv) the two most recent annual audited financial statements and opinions; (v) if the plan is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code, the most recent determination letter received from the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ "); (vi) all material communications with any domestic Governmental Entity given or received since December 31, 2003; and (vii) any other documents, forms or other instruments relating to any Company Benefit Plan reasonably requested by ParentCo. There is no present intention that any Company Benefit Plan, other than a Multiemployer Plan, be materially amended, suspended or terminated, or otherwise modified to change benefits (or the level thereof) under any Company Benefit Plan, other than a Multiemployer Plan, at any time within the twelve months immediately following the date of this Agreement. 

    

 (c) Since December 31, 2005, there has not been any amendment or change in interpretation relating to any Company Benefit Plan, other than a Multiemployer Plan, which would, in the case of any Company Benefit Plan, other than a Multiemployer Plan, materially increase the cost of such Company Benefit Plan. 

    

 (d) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code: (i) there does not exist any  accumulated funding deficiency within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or  Section 302 of ERISA, whether or not waived; (ii) the fair market value of the  assets of such plan equals or exceeds the accumulated benefit obligation of such plan (whether or not vested) determined in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard No. 87; (iii) no reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which the 30-day notice requirement has not been waived has occurred, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this agreement will not result in the occurrence of any such reportable event; (iv) no liability (other than for premiums to the PBGC) under Title IV of ERISA has been or is reasonably expected to be incurred by the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries; and (v) the PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate any  such plan or made any inquiry which would reasonably be expected to lead to  termination of any such plan, and, to the Companys Knowledge, no condition exists that is reasonably likely to cause such proceedings to be instituted or to constitute grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or the appointment of a trustee to administer, any such plan. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has, at any time during the last six years, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries would be reasonably expected to be liable for any material liability to a Multiemployer Plan as a result of a complete or partial withdrawal from such Multiemployer Plan (as those terms are defined in Part I of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA) (a " _Withdrawal Liability_ ") that has not been satisfied in full. With respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is a Multiemployer Plan, to the Companys Knowledge, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notification that any such plan is in reorganization, has been terminated, is insolvent, or may reasonably be expected to be in reorganization, to be insolvent, or to be terminated. 

      (e) Each Company Benefit Plan, other than a Multiemployer Plan, that requires  registration with a Governmental Entity has been properly registered, except  where any failure to register, would not reasonably be expected to have a  Company Material Adverse Effect. Each Company Benefit Plan, other than a  Multiemployer Plan, which is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the  Code is so qualified and has been issued a favorable determination letter by the IRS with respect to such qualification, its related trust has been determined to be exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code and no event has occurred since the date of such qualification or exemption that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect such qualification or exemption. Each Company Benefit Plan, other than a Multiemployer Plan, has been established and administered in material compliance with its terms and with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws. No event has occurred and no condition exists that would subject the Company by reason of its affiliation with any current or former member of its "controlled  group" (within the meaning of Section 414 of the Code) to any material (i)  Tax, penalty, fine, (ii) Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) or (iii) other  liability imposed by ERISA, the Code or other applicable Laws. 

    

 (f) There are no (i) Company Benefit Plans under which welfare benefits are provided to past or present employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries beyond their  retirement or other termination of service, other than coverage mandated by  Section 4980B of the Code and Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or any  similar state group health plan continuation Laws, the cost of which is fully  paid by such employees or their dependents; or (ii) unfunded Company Benefit  Plan obligations with respect to any past or present employees of the Company  and its Subsidiaries that are not fairly reflected by reserves shown on the most recent financial statements contained in the Company SEC Documents, except as would not have or reasonably by expected to have a Company Material Adverse  Effect. 

    

 (g) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the  transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in combination with  another event) (i) result in any payment becoming due, or increase the amount of any compensation or benefits due, to any current or former employee of the  Company and its Subsidiaries or with respect to any Company Benefit Plan; (ii)  increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Company Benefit Plan; (iii)  result in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such  compensation or benefits; (iv) result in a non-exempt "prohibited  transaction" within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of  the Code; (v) limit or restrict the right of the Company to merge, amend or  terminate any of the Company Benefit Plans; or (vi) result in the payment of any amount or the provision of any benefit that would, individually or in  combination with any other such payment, reasonably be expected to constitute an "excess parachute payment," as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code. 

    

 (h) There have been no prohibited transactions or breaches of any of the duties imposed on "fiduciaries" (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA) by ERISA with respect to the Company Benefit Plans that could result in any material liability or excise tax under ERISA or the Code being imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. With respect to any Company Benefit Plan, other than a Multiemployer Plan, (i) no Legal Actions (including any  administrative investigation, audit or other proceeding by the Department of  Labor or the Internal Revenue Service but other than routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course) are pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, and (ii) to the Knowledge of the Company, no events or conditions have occurred or exist that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any such Legal Actions, except in each case that would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

     (i) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, all Company Benefit Plans subject to the Laws of any jurisdiction outside of the United States (i) have been maintained and funded in accordance with all applicable requirements, (ii) if they are intended to qualify for special tax treatment, meet all requirements for such treatment, and (iii) if they are intended to be funded and/or book-reserved, are fully funded and/or book reserved, as appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions.

None of ParentCo, MergerCo nor the Company shall  consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period  or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of the transactions contemplated  by this Agreement at the behest of any Governmental Entity without the consent  of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or  delayed).

The  parties agree not to participate, or to permit their Affiliates to participate,  in any substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental Entity in  connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless it so  consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by  such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and  participate. Each party will advise the other party promptly of any  understandings, undertakings or agreements (oral or written) which the first  party proposes to make or enter into with the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each  party will use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any objections that may be asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any antitrust, competition, premerger notification, trade regulation, or merger control Law, including (subject to first having used reasonable best efforts to negotiate a resolution to any such objections) contesting and resisting any action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to have such statute, rule, regulation, decree, judgment,  injunction or other Order repealed, rescinded or made inapplicable so as to  permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company will, upon the request of ParentCo, become subject to, or consent or agree to or otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or Order to sell, to hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict,  operate, invest or otherwise change the assets or business of the Company or any of its Affiliates, so long as such requirement, condition, understanding,  agreement or Order is binding on the Company only in the event that the Closing  occurs. 

    

 (e) Subject to applicable Law, prior to the Closing, the Company will use its best efforts to cooperate with ParentCo in order to maintain the business of the Company and the goodwill of its customers, dealers, franchisees and distributors on commercially reasonable terms, including in connection with renewals,  renegotiations, extensions, amendments or terminations of contracts with such  parties, and to minimize disruption to such parties and the Company as a result  of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to applicable Law,  nothing set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed or construed  to restrict or prohibit communications between ParentCo and such parties. 

    

 Section 5.10 _Public Announcements_. Subject to applicable Law, ParentCo, MergerCo and the Company will consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements about this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. None of ParentCo, MergerCo nor the Company will issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except to the extent that the disclosing party determines in good faith it is required to do so by applicable Laws or NYSE requirements, in which case that party will use all reasonable efforts to consult with the other party before issuing any such release or making any such public statement.

No representation, warranty, inducement, promise, understanding or condition not set forth in this Agreement has been made or relied upon by any of the parties to this Agreement with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. 

    

 Section 8.9 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section 5.8 (which is intended to be for the benefit of the persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such persons), this Agreement is not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the parties to this Agreement. 

    

 Section 8.10 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement are severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision will not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application of that provision to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision will be substituted for that provision in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of the invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of that provision to other Persons or circumstances will not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor will such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of that provision, or the application of that provision, in any other jurisdiction.

The parties to this Agreement have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and waive the application of any Laws or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in any agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or other document. 

    

 Section 8.12 _Assignment_. This Agreement may not be assigned by operation of Law or otherwise. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under this Section 8.12 will be null and void. 

      Section 8.13 _Remedies Cumulative; Waiver_. The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are cumulative and not alternative. Except as provided in the final sentence of Section 7.6(c), neither any failure nor any delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement or any of the documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (i) no waiver that may be given by a party will be applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given; and (ii) no notice to or demand on one party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of that party or of the right of the party giving such notice or demand to take further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement. 

    

 Section 8.14 _Specific Performance_. The parties to this Agreement agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by the Company, ParentCo or MergerCo in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VII, any aggrieved party will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
