Spreadsheet multiplied by (ii) the greater of (x) 105% or (y) 100% plus 5
times the "Federal mid-term rate" as defined in Section 1274(d)(1) of the
Code (expressed as a percentage) in effect at the time the escrow is funded;
and

 

(vi) the Securityholder Representative Retention Amount shall be deposited by
Parent at the Closing with the Securityholder Representative to be held by
the

 



4  Securityholder Representative pursuant to _Section 10.15_. Parent shall
fund cash to the Securityholder Representative at the Closing via wire
transfer of immediately available funds. The Securityholder Representative
Retention Amount shall be held and distributed in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement.

 

(c) Working Capital Adjustments.

 

(i) Closing Estimates. As part of the Closing Statement delivered pursuant
to  _Section 1.7(a)_, the Company shall deliver, or cause to be delivered,
to Parent a good faith estimate (the " _Estimated Working Capital Statement_
") of (i) the Net Working Capital as of the close of business on the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date and prepared in accordance with the
principles set forth on _Schedule 1.7(c)_ (such estimate, the " _Estimated
Working Capital_ "). As contemplated by  _Section 1.6(b)_, if the Estimated
Working Capital is less than the Target Working Capital, the Initial Merger
Consideration will be reduced by the amount of such shortfall (the "
_Estimated Working Capital Underage_ "). As contemplated by _Section
1.6(b)_, if the Estimated Working Capital is greater than the Target Working
Capital, the Initial Merger Consideration will be increased by the amount of
such excess (the " _Estimated Working Capital Overage_ "). If the Estimated
Working Capital is equal to the Target Working Capital, the Initial Merger
Consideration will not be adjusted pursuant to this _Section 1.7(c)(i)_.

 

(ii) Working Capital Adjustment.

 

(1) _ _Net Working Capital Closing Statement__. Within ninety (90)
days after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause to be prepared and delivered
to the Securityholder Representative a statement (the " _Net Working Capital
Closing Statement_ ") setting forth the Net Working Capital as of the close
of business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the " _Final
Working Capital_ "), consistent with and prepared in accordance with the
principles set forth on _Schedule 1.7(c)_ , it being agreed and understood
that sales and use taxes exposure estimates, based on the laws of each state
in which the Company has nexus, shall be accrued (to the extent required by
GAAP) or paid, including estimated legal and accounting fees related to the
submission of voluntary disclosure agreements. If accrued in accordance with
GAAP and not paid, such accrued sales and use taxes exposure shall be included
as current liabilities for purposes of calculating net working capital (" _Net
Working Capital_ "). If Parent does not deliver a Net Working Capital Closing
Statement to the Securityholder Representative within such ninety (90) day
period, the Estimated Working Capital set forth in the Estimated Working
Capital Statement will be the Final Working Capital and will be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties.

 

(2) _ _Net Working Capital Closing Statement Notice__. Within forty-
five (45) days following receipt by the Securityholder Representative of the
Net Working Capital Closing Statement, the Securityholder Representative shall
deliver written notice to Parent of any dispute it has with respect to the
preparation or content of the Net Working Capital Closing Statement ("
_Closing Statement Dispute Notice_ "). If the Securityholder Representative
does not deliver a Closing Statement Dispute Notice to Parent 

 



5  within such forty-five (45)-day period, the Final Working Capital set forth
in the Net Working Capital Closing Statement will be final, conclusive and
binding on the parties.

 

(3) _ _Net Working Capital Closing Statement Dispute__. If
Securityholder Representative timely delivers a Closing Statement Dispute
Notice to Parent, Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall negotiate
in good faith to resolve such dispute. If Parent and the Securityholder
Representative, notwithstanding such good faith effort, fail to resolve such
dispute within thirty (30) days after Parents receipt of the Closing
Statement Dispute Notice, then Parent and the Securityholder Representative
shall jointly engage Ernst and Young (or any other mutually acceptable
accounting firm) (the " _Arbitration Firm_ ") to arbitrate such dispute. As
promptly as practicable thereafter, Parent and the Securityholder
Representative shall each prepare and submit a presentation to the
Arbitration Firm. As soon as practicable thereafter, Parent and the
Securityholder Representative will cause the Arbitration Firm to determine
Final Working Capital based solely upon the presentations by Parent and the
Securityholder Representative. The Arbitration Firm shall determine the
proportion of its fees and expenses to be paid by each of Parent and the
Securityholder Representative (for the account of the Effective Time Holders)
based on the degree (as determined in good faith by the Arbitration Firm) to
which the Arbitration Firm has accepted the positions of Parent and the
Securityholder Representative. Absent manifest error, the determinations made
by the Arbitration Firm will be final, conclusive and binding on all parties
to this Agreement.

(4) _ _Working Capital Adjustment Payment__.

 

(a) In the event Final Working Capital (as finally determined pursuant to
_Section 1.7(c)(ii)(2)_ or  _(3)_ ) is less than the Estimated Working
Capital, then the Initial Merger Consideration will be adjusted downward by an
amount equal to such shortfall (" _Final Working Capital Shortfall_ "), and
the Securityholder Representative, within five (5) Business Days from the
date on which Final Working Capital is finally determined pursuant to _Section
1.7(c)(ii)(2)_ or _(3)_ (" _Final Determination Date_ "), shall cause the
Escrow Agent to release to Parent from the Escrow Funds, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent to
the Securityholder Representative and the Escrow Agent, an amount equal to
such shortfall. In the event that the Final Working Capital Shortfall exceeds
the remaining Escrow Funds, no further payment shall be required.

 

(b) In the event Final Working Capital (as finally determined pursuant to
_Section 1.7(c)(ii)(2)_ or  _(3)_ ) is greater than the Estimated Working
Capital, then, the Initial Merger Consideration will be adjusted upward by an
amount equal to such excess (" _Final Working Capital Excess_ "), and within
five (5) Business Days from the Final Determination Date, Parent shall pay,
or cause to be paid, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
Effective Time Holders through the Payments Administrator in an amount equal
to his, her or its Pro Rata Share of the Final Working Capital Excess as set
forth on the Payout Spreadsheet.

(c) In the event Final Working Capital (as finally determined pursuant to
_Section 1.7(c)(ii)(2)_ or _(3)_ ) is equal to the Estimated Working Capital,
there will be no adjustment to Merger Consideration pursuant to this
_Section 1.7(c)(ii)(4)_.

 



6 (iii) Access. For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in this
_Section 1.7(c)_, Parent and the Surviving Company, on the one hand, and the
Securityholder Representative, on the other hand, shall, and the Surviving
Company shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cooperate with and make available to
each other and their respective representatives all information, and records,
and shall permit access to its financial personnel, as may be reasonably
required in connection with the preparation and analysis of the
Closing Statement and the Closing Statement Dispute Notice and the resolution
of any disputes thereunder. If the Parent and the Surviving Company, on the
one hand, or the Securityholder Representative, on the other hand, breach
their respective obligations under this _Section 1.7(c)_, the dispute
periods set forth in _Section 1.7(c)(ii)_ shall automatically be extended
until such breach is cured by the breaching party.

and without any action on the part of the holders thereof:

 

(a) Conversion of Merger Sub Membership Interests. Each common unit of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one validly issued common unit of the
Surviving Company. From and after the Effective Time all certificates, if any,
representing the common units of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes
to represent the number of common units of the Surviving Company into which
they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

 

(b) Cancellation of Company Units held by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company.
Each Company Unit owned by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any direct or

thereto.

(c) Conversion of Series A Preferred Units. Each Company Series A

this _Section 1.8(c)_ is referred to herein as the " _Series A Preferred Unit
Merger Consideration_."

(i) Each Series 1 Common Unit issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to the Series 1 Per Unit Closing Consideration plus the Per Unit
Additional Merger Consideration, if any (together, the " _Series 1 Per Unit
Merger Consideration_ "). The aggregate consideration to which holders of
Series 1 Common Units become entitled pursuant to this _Section 1.8(d)(i)_ is
referred to herein as the " _Series 1 Unit Merger Consideration_."

 



7 (ii) Each Series 2 Common Unit issued and outstanding immediately prior to

is referred to herein as the " _Series 3 Unit Merger Consideration_."

(e) Adjustments. In the event that the Company, at any time or from time
to time between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, declares or
pays any dividend on Company Units payable in Company Units or in any right to
acquire Company Units, or effects a subdivision of the outstanding Company
Units into a greater number of Company Units, or in the event the outstanding
Company Units shall be combined or consolidated, by reclassification or
otherwise, into a lesser number of Company Units, then the amounts payable in
respect of Company Units pursuant to _Section 1.8_ shall be appropriately
adjusted.

1.9 Effect on Company Options.

Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the
part of the Company or of any Effective Time Holder, each Company Option that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then
vested, shall be cancelled and terminated. In connection with such
cancellation and termination, (x) each Company In-the-Money Vested Option
shall be converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Company (A) an
amount (subject to any applicable withholding tax) in cash equal to the
product of (i) the number of Company Common Units subject to such Company In-
the-Money Vested Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Exercise Number_ ") __multiplied by__ (ii) the excess of the amount by which

that is not a Company In-The-Money Vested Option shall be cancelled and
terminated for no consideration. The aggregate amount paid or payable in

Company Unvested Option and each Series 3 Restricted Common Unit that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and convert such Series 3
Restricted Common Units into the right to receive from the Surviving Company,
an amount in cash pursuant to _Section 1.8(d)(iii)_.

fees and expenses of the Payments Administrator shall be paid by Parent.

(b) After the Closing, promptly following surrender to the Payments
Administrator of a certificate representing Company Units (if any) (each, a "
_Company Unit Certificate_ "), or if any issued Company Unit Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the holder thereof, together with a duly completed and executed letter
of transmittal (which shall include a release of claims), substantially in the
form of _Exhibit G_ attached hereto (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), the
Payments Administrator will pay (or cause to be paid), to the holder of such
Company Unit the amount payable with respect to such Company Units as provided
herein, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
designated in the applicable Letter of Transmittal. At the Effective Time, the
unit transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and thereafter there shall
be no further registration of transfers of Company Units theretofore
outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Company Units outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable Legal Requirements. On
or after the Effective Time, any Company Units presented to the Surviving
Company or Parent for any reason shall be promptly forwarded to the Payments
Administrator and converted into the consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant hereto without any interest thereon. None of Parent, the Surviving
Company nor their Affiliates shall be liable to any Effective Time Holder for
any amount paid to any public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat, or similar laws. Any amount remaining in the Surviving
Companys possession that is unclaimed by Effective Time Holders three (3)
years after the Closing Date (or such earlier date, immediately prior to such
time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Body) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirement, the property of the Surviving Company free and clear of any
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

1.11 No Contractual Appraisal Rights. There shall be no contractual or
other appraisal rights in connection with the Merger.

 

1.12 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement

 



9  or to vest the Surviving Company or Parent with full right, title and
possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company,
the officers and directors of the Surviving Company and Parent shall be fully
authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and
otherwise) to take such action.

 

1.13 FIRPTA Certificate. At the Closing, the Company shall deliver to
Parent a certificate of the Company in substantially the form of _Exhibit H_
(" _FIRPTA Certificate_ ") prescribed under Treasury Regulations promulgated
under Code Sections 897 and 1445, stating that either (i) fifty percent (50%)
or more of the value of the gross assets of the Company does not consist of
U.S. real property interests within the meaning of Section 897 of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations thereunder (" _USRPIs_ "), or (2) ninety percent
(90%) or more of the value of the gross assets of the Company does not consist
of USRPIs plus cash or cash equivalents.

 

1.14 Withholding Rights. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Effective
Time Holder an amount not in excess of the amount it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the payment of such consideration under the Code or
any Legal Requirement. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by or on
behalf of Parent and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Body or
other Person, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Effective Time Holders in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made. Parent and the Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts and shall cooperate in good faith to
determine and minimize any withholding Taxes.

 

1.15 Transfer Taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, all transfer, documentary, sales, use, excise or other Taxes ("
_Transfer Taxes_ ") assessed upon or incurred in connection with the
Transactions will be borne and paid equally by Effective Time Holders and
Parent and Parent shall, at such shared expense, prepare and file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
Transfer Taxes.

 

1.16 Purchase Price Allocation. Within ninety (90) days following the
Closing, the Securityholder Representative shall deliver to Parent a
statement setting forth the Securityholder Representatives good faith
determination of the manner in which the Merger Consideration (increased by
any liabilities that are required to be treated as part of the purchase price
for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is to be allocated among the Companys
assets (the " _Allocation_ "). The Surviving Company shall reasonably
cooperate with the Securityholder Representative to the extent requested,
including by providing copies of any relevant documents needed for such
preparation. The Allocation shall be prepared in accordance with Section 1060
of the Code. If within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Allocation,
Parent notifies the Securityholder Representative in writing that Parent
objects to one or more items reflected on the Allocation, then Parent and the
Securityholder Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such
dispute. If Parent and the Securityholder Representative fail to resolve any
such dispute within ten (10) days after the Securityholder Representatives
receipt of Parents notice, then the parties shall submit any 

 



10  item of disagreement to a mutually acceptable accounting firm (the "
_Accounting Firm_ "), whose resolution shall be made within ten (10) days
after its selection and be final and binding on both parties. The fees and
expenses of such Accounting Firm shall be shared equally by the parties. The
Allocation as finally determined either by the mutual agreement of the parties
or by the Accounting Firm (the " _Final Allocation_ ") shall be final and
binding as among Parent, the Effective Time Holders and their respective
Affiliates and none of Parent, the Effective Time Holders or any Affiliate
thereof shall take any position inconsistent with the Final Allocation for
Tax (as defined herein) reporting purposes, unless required by applicable
Legal Requirement. Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall promptly
notify the other party in writing upon receipt of notice of any pending or
threatened Tax audit or assessment challenging the Final Allocation.

1.17 Parents Obligations. So long as Parent shall have deposited with the
Payments Administrator, the Company and the Surviving Company, as applicable,
the amounts set forth in _Sections 1.7(b)(iii)_ and _1.7(b)(iv)_ ,
the parties understand and agree that neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the
Surviving Company shall have any liability to any Person for any errors or
omissions in the allocation or disbursement of such portion of the Initial
Merger Consideration by the Company (prior to the Effective Time), the
Surviving Company (to the extent such allocation or disbursement is made in
accordance with directions from the Securityholder Representative), or the
Payments Administrator (to the extent such allocation or disbursement is made
in accordance with directions from the Securityholder Representative).

terms of the Confidentiality Agreement dated October 1, 2015 by and between
Parent and William Blair and Company, L.L.C., as agent for the Company ("
_Existing NDA_ "), to be applied as if the Company were a direct party thereto

Company and any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or
other similar fee in connection with the financing contemplated by the debt

other Transactions (including any proceedings initiated by a private party),
and each such party shall use its reasonable best efforts to make (or cause to
be made) as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, and only after
reasonable consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in
compliance with such request. Each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate
and coordinate with each other in connection with the preparation and filing
of any and all material filings, forms and submissions that are required to

Agreement, the Merger or any other Transactions (including any proceedings
initiated by a private party). Each of Parent and the Company (i) shall

reasonable time in advance of any and all such meetings and consider in good

 



34  faith the views of such other party regarding the matters to be presented
and discussed at any and all such meetings, and (iv) to the extent permitted
by the applicable Governmental Body, shall allow the other party to
participate in such meetings or portions thereof. Each of Parent and the
Company shall consult and cooperate with one another, provide one another with
a reasonable advance opportunity to review and comment upon, and consider in
good faith the views of one another, in connection with any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions, proposals
or other written communications explaining or defending the Merger and
other Transactions made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in
connection with proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or any other
Antitrust Laws.

 

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to

do (or cause to be done) all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable
to obtain all clearances, consents and approvals necessary to satisfy the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(a)_ and otherwise consummate the Merger
in compliance with applicable Antitrust Laws. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, Parent shall take any and all action necessary, including but
not limited to (i) selling or otherwise disposing of, or holding separate and
agreeing to sell or otherwise dispose of, assets, categories of assets or
businesses of the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries; (ii)
terminating existing relationships, contractual rights or obligations of the
Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries; (iii) terminating any
venture or other arrangement; (iv) creating any relationship, contractual

appropriate applications with any in connection with Governmental Body any of
the foregoing and in the case of actions by or with respect to the Company or
its Subsidiaries or its or their businesses or assets; by consenting to such
action by the Company and provided, that any such action may, at the
discretion of the Company, be conditioned upon consummation of the Merger and
other Transactions) (each a " _Divestiture Action_ ") to ensure that no
Governmental Body enters any order, decision, judgment, decree, ruling,
injunction (preliminary or permanent), or establishes any law, rule,
regulation or other action preliminarily or permanently restraining, enjoining
or prohibiting the consummation of the Merger and other Transactions, or to
ensure that no with the authority to clear, authorize or otherwise approve
the consummation of the Merger and other Transactions, fails to do so by the
Termination Date. In the event that any action is threatened or instituted
challenging the Merger and other Transactions as violative of Legal
Requirement, Parent shall take all action necessary, including but not limited
to any Divestiture Action to avoid or resolve such action. In the event that
any permanent or preliminary injunction or other order is entered or becomes
reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that would make
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would restrain, enjoin or otherwise
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement,

 



35  Parent shall take promptly any and all steps necessary to vacate, modify or
suspend such injunction or order so as to permit such consummation prior to
the Termination Date. The Company shall cooperate with Parent and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to assist Parent in resisting and reducing any
Divestiture Action.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that Parent
has proposed a Divestiture Action pursuant to paragraph (c) above and the
investigating staff of the relevant Governmental Body has recommended to its
superiors that the proposed Divestiture Action be accepted, but these
superiors have not yet acted on such recommendation, either party may, in its
sole discretion, extend the Termination Date by an additional period not to
exceed 90 days.

 

(e) Neither Parent nor the Company shall, nor shall it permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, enter into or publicly announce the formation of a joint
venture or the acquisition of any assets, business or company or ownership
stakes if any such actions, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably
be expected to cause any of the conditions set forth in  _Section 7.1(a)_ to
fail to be satisfied.

4.11 Financial Statements Cooperation. To the extent reasonably requested
by Parent, the Company and its Affiliates shall reasonably cooperate with
Parents efforts to prepare financial statements of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as are required by Parent to satisfy any public filing
requirements which will be applicable to the Company and its Subsidiaries
after the Closing Date (including, if the Closing occurs after April 25, 2016,
a balance sheet as of March 31, 2016); _ provided_, _ however_, that, (a)
the cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be provided during
regular business hours and shall not unreasonably interfere with the business

36 SECTION 5. ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

5.1 Updates to the Disclosure Schedule. The Company shall have the right to
supplement the Disclosure Schedule prior to the Closing to reflect any and
all events, circumstances or changes which arise or become known to the
Company after the date hereof by delivery to the Parent prior to the Closing
Date of one or more supplements (each, a " _Disclosure Supplement_ "). Each
Disclosure Supplement shall be in writing and shall be delivered in accordance
with the procedure set forth for notice in _Section 10.3_. Unless the
existence of any matter set forth in any such Disclosure Supplement which was
not disclosed at the time of signing of this Agreement (a " _New Matter_ ")
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and would give
rise to a right of termination in favor of Parent under _Section 8.1(a)_ in
respect of the condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_, the Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed amended and supplemented by all information set forth
in each Disclosure Supplement, and each of the representations and warranties
of the Company made in the Transaction Documents shall be deemed amended and
supplemented by all such information set forth in each Disclosure Supplement
as if amended on the date of the parties execution of this Agreement. In
such event, all references to the Disclosure Schedule in the Transaction
Documents shall be deemed to include all such Disclosure Supplements. To the
extent the existence of any New Matter would have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company or gives rise to a right of termination in favor of Parent
under _Section 8.1(a)_, Parent shall have the right under said _Section
8.1(a)_ to (a) terminate this Agreement by written notice to the Company
within five (5) Business Days after receipt of the Disclosure Supplement which
includes the New Matter but prior to the Closing Date or (b) consummate the
Transactions. To the extent that the Parent elects to so consummate
the Transactions, the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed amended and
supplemented by all information set forth in each Disclosure Supplement, and
each of the representations and warranties of the Company made in the
Transaction Documents shall be deemed amended and supplemented by all such
information set forth in each Disclosure Supplement as if amended on the date
of the parties execution of this Agreement. In such event, all references to
the Disclosure Schedule in the Transaction Documents shall be deemed to

implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the
Company Group or the Business, which has been communicated, furnished or made
available to Parent or Merger Sub or their respective Representatives, except
as expressly set forth in this Agreement, including the Disclosure Schedule.
Neither the Company nor any other Person shall have or be subject to any
Liability to any other Person resulting from the distribution to Parent or its
Representatives, or any of the Parents or its Representatives use of, any
such information, documents or material made available to any of them in
Records stored on computer disks, in online or physical "data rooms," provided
during management presentations or in any other forms in expectation of the
Transactions except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, including the
Disclosure Schedule. Without limiting the foregoing, in making its
determination to proceed with the Transactions, Parent acknowledges and
agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that it is

 



37  relying solely on (a) the results of its own independent investigation and
(b) the representations and warranties of the Company expressly set forth in
this Agreement, including the Disclosure Schedule. In connection with its
investigation, Parent and its Representatives may have received from or on
behalf of the Company Group certain estimates, budgets, forecasts, plans and
financial projections that are not covered by the express representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement (" _Forward-Looking
Statements_ "), and Parent, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates,
acknowledges that (i) there are uncertainties inherent in making Forward-
Looking Statements and (ii) it is familiar with such uncertainties and is
taking full responsibility for making its own evaluations of the adequacy and
accuracy of all Forward-Looking Statements so furnished to it and
its Representatives (including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying Forward-Looking Statements where such assumptions are explicitly
disclosed).

 

5.3 Limited Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. The
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties
contained in this Agreement or in any agreement delivered pursuant to this
Agreement shall survive beyond the Effective Time only as set forth in

Company Employee Plans, and the advancement of expenses incurred contained in
the Organizational Documents or separate agreements, as applicable,

employees of the Company, the Surviving Company and each such Subsidiary, and
trustees or administrators of Company Employee Plans, to the same extent as

following the Closing, the Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to

Group (provided, that the Surviving Company may substitute therefor policies
of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions
which are no less advantageous in any material respect to the insured parties
thereunder) with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred
at or before the Closing (including consummation of the Transactions) or (b) a

Company and the Companys Subsidiaries. From and following the Closing Date,
the Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to abide by and honor each of the
Surviving Companys and its Subsidiaries contractual obligations, if any, to
provide directors and officers liability insurance to any other person, to
the extent of such contractual obligation.

between (a) the Company and Cooley LLP prior to Closing and (b) the Effective
Time Holders (and any subset of them) and Cooley LLP following Closing. Each
of the parties hereto agrees that (i) it will not seek to disqualify Cooley
LLP from acting and continuing to act as counsel to any of the Effective Time
Holders either in the event of a dispute hereunder or in the course of the
defense or prosecution of any claim relating to the transactions contemplated
herein, and (ii) the Effective Time Holders have a reasonable expectation of

6.6 Employees; Employee Benefit Plans.

 

(a) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the date
which is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide each employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who remains employed immediately after
the Closing (each a " _Company Continuing Employee_ ") with: (i) base salary
or hourly wages (such payment method to be determined at the Parents
discretion) which are no less than the base salary or hourly wages provided by
the Company or the applicable Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to

 



39  the Closing; (ii) target bonus opportunities (excluding equity-based
compensation), if any, which are no less than the target bonus opportunities
(excluding equity-based compensation) provided by the Company or the
applicable Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Closing; (iii)
retirement and welfare benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate
than those provided by the Company or the applicable Subsidiary of the
Company immediately prior to the Closing; and (iv) severance benefits that are

Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing. After the Closing,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to honor all
rights to paid time off, including vacation, personal and sick days, accrued
by Company Continuing Employees prior to the Closing under any Company
Employee Plan. 

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or its
Affiliates (collectively, " _Buyer Benefit Plans_ "), in which any Company
Continuing Employees will be eligible to participate effective as of the
Closing, Parent shall, or shall cause its applicable Affiliate to (subject
to  _Section 6.6(a)(iii)_ above), (i) waive all pre-existing conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to such Company Continuing Employee under any such
Buyer Benefit Plan in which such Company Continuing Employee may be eligible
to participate on or after the Closing, except to the extent such pre-existing
conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the analogous
Company Employee Plan; (ii) if commercially practicable, provide each such
Company Continuing Employee with credit for any payments made under any cost-
sharing provisions prior to the Closing or in the year in which such Company
Continuing Employee commences participation in such Buyer Benefit Plan (to
the same extent such credit was given under the analogous Company Employee
Plan prior to the Closing) in satisfying any applicable cost-sharing
provisions in any Buyer Benefit Plan in which such Company Continuing
Employee may be eligible to participate on or after the Closing; (iii)
recognize all service of the Company Continuing Employees with the Company or
the applicable Subsidiary of the Company (or its applicable predecessor
entity) as if such service were with Parent or its Affiliate for vesting and
eligibility purposes in any Buyer Benefit Plan in which such Company
Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate on or after the Closing;
provided, however, such service shall not be recognized to the extent that
(x) such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or (y) such
service was not recognized under the corresponding Company Employee Plan.

 

(c) Parent agrees that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be solely
responsible for satisfying the continuation coverage requirements of Section
4980B of the Code for all individuals who are "MandA qualified beneficiaries" as
such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9.

 

6.7 Tax Matters.

 

(a) Tax Returns.

 

(i) The Securityholder Representative will prepare, or cause to be prepared,
all income Tax Returns (including an Internal Revenue Service Form 1065 and
any

 



40  similar state and local income Tax Returns) for the Company and its
Subsidiaries for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date that are
filed on or after the Closing Date (each such Tax Return, a " _Pre-Closing
Income Tax Return_ "), which Tax Returns will be prepared (i) in accordance
with applicable Legal Requirements and (ii) consistent with past practice of
the Company except as otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirements.
The Securityholder Representative shall deliver such Pre-Closing Income Tax
Returns to Parent for its review and comment not later than ninety (90) days
before the due date for filing (including extensions) such Tax Returns. If
Parent objects to any item on any such Pre-Closing Income Tax Return, it
shall, within twenty (20) days after delivery of such Tax Return notify
Securityholder Representative in writing that it so objects, specifying
with particularity any such item and stating the specific factual or legal
basis for any such objection. If a notice of objection shall be duly
delivered, Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall negotiate in
good faith and use their reasonable efforts to resolve such items. If Parent
and the Securityholder Representative are unable to reach such agreement
within ten (10) days after receipt by Securityholder Representative of such
notice, the disputed items shall be resolved by the Arbitration Firm and any
determination by the Arbitration Firm shall be final. If the Arbitration Firm
is unable to resolve any disputed items at least forty five (45) days before
the due date for filing such Tax Return (including any extensions thereof),
the Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by Parent and then amended to
reflect the Arbitration Firms resolution. The costs, fees and expenses of the
Arbitration Firm shall be borne equally by Parent and the
Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the Effective Time Holders).

(ii) Parent shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, any Tax Return required to be filed by the Company and its Subsidiaries
after the Closing Date for any Pre-Closing Tax Period including any Tax Return
for a Straddle Period (a " _Straddle Period Tax Return_ ") but excluding any
Pre-Closing Income Tax Return (each such Tax Return, a " _Pre-Closing Tax
Return_ "). Parent shall deliver such Tax Returns to the Securityholder
Representative for its review and comment (i) in the case of income Tax
Returns (including Tax Returns based on net income or similar measure), not
later than thirty-five (35) days before the due date for filing (including
extensions) such Tax Returns, and (ii) in the case of other Tax Returns, not
later than twenty (20) days before the due date for filing (including
extensions) such Tax Returns. If the Securityholder Representative objects to
any item on any such Tax Return that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (or
any Tax for which the Buyer Indemnitees may be entitled to reimbursement
pursuant to _Section 9.2_), it shall, within twenty (20) days after delivery
of such Tax Return (in the case of income Tax Returns) or within ten (10)
days after the delivery of any other Tax Returns, notify Parent in writing
that it so objects, specifying with particularity any such item and stating
the specific factual or legal basis for any such objection. If a notice of
objection shall be duly delivered, Parent and the Securityholder
Representative shall negotiate in good faith and use their reasonable efforts
to resolve such items. If Parent and the Securityholder Representative are
unable to reach such agreement within ten (10) days after receipt by Parent
of such notice, the disputed items shall be resolved by the Arbitration Firm
and any determination by the Arbitration Firm shall be final. If the
Arbitration Firm is unable to resolve any disputed items before the due date
for such Tax Return (including any extensions thereof), the Tax Return

 



41  shall be filed as prepared by Parent and then amended to reflect the
Arbitration Firms resolution. The costs, fees and expenses of the Arbitration
Firm shall be borne equally by Parent and the Securityholder Representative
(on behalf of the Effective Time Holders). Subject to the Basket, Parent shall
be entitled to deduct from the Escrow Funds any Pre-Closing Taxes due with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Return or Straddle Period Tax Return no
earlier than five (5) days before the due date for such Tax Return (including
any extensions thereof to the extent the filing date for such Tax Return has
been extended). The portion of any Tax that is allocable to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period will be: (i) in the case of Property Taxes, deemed to be the
amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of calendar days of such Straddle Period
in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of all other
Taxes, determined as though the taxable year of the Company terminated at the
close of business on the Closing Date. The parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that the Tax deductions associated with the payment of the Transaction
Expenses, the repayment of Company Debt and the payment of Option
Consideration shall be reported on the Companys income Tax Return for its
taxable year that ends on the Closing Date to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements.

 

(iii) Except as required under applicable Legal Requirements, Parent shall not
amend any Tax Return of the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or make
any Tax election, or take any action or enter into any transaction, in each
case that has retroactive effect in any Pre-Closing Tax Period or that would
increase the liability of the Effective Time Holders under this Agreement or
pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements, without the prior written consent
of the Securityholder Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(b) Cooperation. Parent and the Securityholder Representative agree to
furnish or cause to be furnished to the other, upon request, as promptly as
practicable, such information and assistance relating to Taxes, including,
without limitation, access to books and records and personnel, as is
reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns, the making of any
election relating to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any taxing
authority and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding
relating to any Tax. Each of the Securityholder Representative, the
Company and Parent shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers,
records and other documents in its possession relating to Tax matters of the
Company for any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the
expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable periods to which such
Tax Returns and other documents relate, without regard to extensions except to
the extent notified by any of the other parties in writing of such extensions
for the respective Tax periods. Prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records and other
documents in its possession relating to Tax matters of the Company for any
taxable period beginning before the Closing Date, the
Securityholder Representative, the Company or Parent (as the case may be)
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the other parties with
written notice and offer the other parties the opportunity to take custody of
such materials. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent will (and will cause
the Surviving Company to) cooperate with the Securityholder Representative to
enable the Securityholder

 



42  Representative to utilize at the cost and expense of the Effective Time
Holders the Surviving Companys existing tax return preparation firm(s) (the "
_Tax Preparation Firm_ "). Such cooperation may include providing access to
books and records and accounting staff, and delegating authority to the
Securityholder Representative under the Tax Preparation Firms engagement
agreement sufficient for the Tax Preparation Firm to take direction from the
Securityholder Representative, or otherwise ensuring that the Securityholder
Representative will have access to (and the ability to direct, even if
indirectly through the Surviving Company) the Tax Preparation Firm.

(c) Tax Contests.

 

(i) Parent and the Company, on the one hand, and Effective Time Holders and
Securityholder Representative, on the other hand, shall promptly notify each
other upon receipt by such party of written notice of any inquiries, claims,
assessments, audits or similar events with respect to Taxes relating to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period (or any Tax for which the Buyer Indemnitees may be
entitled to reimbursement pursuant to _Section 9.2_) (any such inquiry,
claim, assessment, audit or similar event, a " _Tax Matter_ "). Any failure to
so notify the other party of any Tax Matter shall not relieve such other
party of any liability with respect to such Tax Matters except to the extent
such party was actually prejudiced as a result thereof.

 

(ii) With respect to any Tax Matter that relates solely to a Pre-Closing
Income Tax Return (a " _Securityholder Tax Matter_ "), the Securityholder
Representative shall have the right at the cost and expense of the Effective
Time Holders to control such Tax Matter, including the defense and settlement
thereof; _provided, however_ , that, the Securityholder Representative shall
keep Parent reasonably informed of the progress of any such Tax Matter and
shall not effect any such settlement or compromise without obtaining Parents
prior written consent thereto, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. Parent will have the right to participate in the defense of any such
Tax Matter and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the
counsel employed by the Securityholder Representative. 

(iii) Parent shall have the right to control of the conduct of all Tax
Matters, other than Securityholder Tax Matters, including any settlement or
compromise thereof, and including, for avoidance of doubt, any voluntary
disclosure reporting and sales and use tax compliance procedures, including
discussions, negotiations and meetings with the relevant state sales and use
tax authorities _; provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall keep
Securityholder Representative reasonably informed of the progress of any such
Tax Matter and shall not effect any such settlement or compromise with
respect to which the Effective Time Holders may be liable under this
Agreement or under applicable Legal Requirements without obtaining
Securityholder Representatives prior written consent thereto, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Securityholder Representative will
have the right to participate in the defense of any such Tax Matter and to
employ counsel, at the expense of the Effective Time Holders, separate from
the counsel employed by Parent.

 



43 6.8 Key Employee Arrangements.

 

(a) Bonus Arrangement. No later than the Effective Time, Parent shall (or
shall cause its applicable Subsidiary to) adopt for the benefit of the Key
Employees, the compensation and bonus arrangements as described on _Schedule
6.8(a)_ hereto.

 

(b) ResMed Restricted Stock Units. On the Closing Date, ResMed Inc. shall
grant to each Key Employee restricted stock units with respect to ResMed Inc.
common stock (the " _Inc. RSUs_ "). The Inc. RSUs shall be subject to the
terms and conditions of and shall be issued under the ResMed Inc. 2009
Incentive Award Plan, which terms have been communicated to individual Key
Employees pursuant to separate offer letters delivered to such individuals. As
of Effective Time, all shares of ResMed Inc. common stock issuable upon
settlement of such Inc. RSUs under this Section will be registered under an
effective registration statement on Form S-8 filed with the SEC, to the extent
eligible for such registration under applicable law.

respective terms; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in the case of any such
covenant or agreement made by the Company, no claim for indemnification on
account thereof may be made following the earlier of (i) the twelve (12) month
anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) the expiration of such covenant or
agreement in accordance with its terms. For the avoidance of doubt, all
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement (including the Schedules
and exhibits attached to this Agreement and the certificates delivered
pursuant to this Agreement) that contemplate performance thereof prior to or
at the Closing will expire at, and no claim for indemnification on account
thereof may be made following, the Closing.

 

(b) Representations. The representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement (including the Schedules attached to this Agreement and the
certificates delivered pursuant to this Agreement) will survive the Closing
Date until the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date.

 

(c) Extensions. Any claim for indemnification brought by Parent after the
expiration of the applicable Survival Period will be void and invalid. Any
pending claims validly brought prior to expiration of the applicable Survival
Period will survive such expiration until resolved in accordance with this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. 

 



47 9.2 Indemnification by the Effective Time Holders. Subject to the
limitations set forth in this _Section 9_, from and after the Closing,
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company, their respective successors and
permitted assigns, and their respective officers, employees, directors and
stockholders (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnitees_ ") will be entitled to
reimbursement solely and exclusively from the Escrow Funds for any Losses
incurred by any of the Buyer Indemnitees following the Closing arising out of
or as a result of:

(a) any breach of or inaccuracy in the representations and warranties
regarding the Company contained in _Section 2_ (including the Schedules and
supplements related thereto);

 

(b) Pre-Closing Taxes; and

 

(c) any inaccuracy in the Payout Spreadsheet.

 

9.3 Limitations on Indemnification Payments to Buyer Indemnitees.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the rights of the
Buyer Indemnitees are limited as follows:

 

(a) Basket. The Buyer Indemnitees will not be entitled to assert any claims
for Losses arising with respect to the matters described in _Section 9.2(a)_
or _Section 9.2(b) _unless and until the aggregate amount of all such Losses
suffered by the Buyer Indemnitees with respect to such matters exceeds
$5,000,000 (the " _Basket_ "), and then only to the extent of the Losses in
excess of the Basket.

(b) Source of Payment; Escrow as Exclusive Recovery Against the Effective
Time Holders. In pursuing the collection of any indemnification claims
under this _Section 9_, the Buyer Indemnitees may provide a Buyer Claim
Notice to the Securityholder Representative and the Escrow Agent and may
proceed against the Escrow Funds for the amount of such Losses in excess of
the Basket in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. From and
after the Closing, the sole and exclusive Liability of the Effective Time
Holders (and the sole exclusive remedy of the Buyer Indemnitees) in respect of
all claims for indemnification of the Buyer Indemnitees, or any of them, under
this _Section 9_ shall be to seek recovery with respect thereto from the
Escrow Funds (and the aggregate cumulative amount of any such indemnification
claims shall in no event exceed the Escrow Funds then remaining in the Escrow
Account).

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, for purposes of
this _Section 9_, and solely with respect to the calculation of Losses (and
not for purposes of determining whether a breach or inaccuracy has occurred)
each representation and warranty in this Agreement and the schedules hereto
shall be read without regard and without giving effect to the term "material"
or "Material Adverse Effect" or similar phrases contained in such
representation or warranty.

 

9.4 Third Party Claims. In the event Buyer Indemnitees (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") become aware of a third-party claim for which such
Indemnified Party intends to seek

 



48  indemnification hereunder (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") from the Members (the
" _Indemnifying Party_ "), the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify
the Securityholder Representative of such Third-Party Claim and of its claims
for indemnification with respect thereto. No delay or failure in providing
such notice shall affect an Indemnified Partys rights hereunder, unless (and
then only to the extent that) the other party is materially prejudiced
thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense of
the Third-Party Claim with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnified Party by written notice to the Indemnified Party within
thirty (30) calendar days after the Indemnifying Party has received notice of
the Third-Party Claim pursuant to this _Section 9.4_; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Indemnifying Party must conduct the defense of the Third-Party
Claim actively and diligently thereafter in order to preserve its rights in
this regard; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Indemnified Party may retain
separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in the
defense of the Third-Party Claim (under the direction of the Indemnifying
Party). The Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment
or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third-Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent
will not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed). Regardless of
which party may be defending the Third Party Claim, in the event the
Indemnifying Party may bear a portion of any judgment or settlement (by way
of recovery from the Escrow Funds), then the Indemnified Party will not
consent to the entry of any such judgment or enter into any settlement with
respect to the Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (which consent, in the event the Indemnifying Party is not
defending such Third Party Claim, will not be unreasonably conditioned,
withheld or delayed by the Indemnifying Party). Without limiting the
Indemnified Partys right to participate in the defense of any Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party will, at the Indemnified Partys expense, to the
extent permitted by applicable law and any contractual obligations and, except
as would not in the good faith judgment of Indemnifying Party result in a
waiver of any applicable legal privilege, (i) upon the request of the
Indemnified Party, promptly make available to the Indemnified Party any
material documents obtained by the Indemnifying Party from the third party
claimant in connection with such Third-Party Claim which are requested by the
Indemnified Party, (ii) upon the request of the Indemnified Party, promptly
provide to the Indemnified Party any material documents and information filed
with or submitted to any Governmental Body or arbitrator in connection with
such Third-Party Claim which are requested by the Indemnified Party, (iii)
upon the request of the Indemnified Party, make a representative of
Indemnifying Party available for a reasonable time to consult with the
Indemnified Party as to any material developments related to such Third-Party
Claim. In the event of a conflict between this _Section 9.4_ and  _Section
6.7(c)_ of this Agreement, the provisions of _Section 6.7(c)_ shall prevail.

9.5 No Duplication of Recovery. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, (a) to the extent that any Losses resulting from
any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of
the Company is taken into account as a current liability in the calculation
of Final Working Capital or otherwise taken into account in the calculation of
the Merger Consideration, (i) Parent may not recover such Losses through an
indemnification claim pursuant to this _Section 9_ or otherwise and (ii)
such Losses shall not

 



49  be included in the determination of whether all Losses, in the aggregate,
exceed the Basket and (b) Parent may not recover duplicative Losses in respect
of a single set of facts or circumstances under more than one representation
or warranty in this Agreement regardless of whether such facts or
circumstances would give rise to a breach of more than one representation or
warranty in this Agreement.

 

9.6 Tax Effect of Payments. To the extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements, all indemnity payments made to Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to
this Agreement shall be treated for all Tax purposes as adjustments to the
aggregate Merger Consideration.

 

9.7 Exclusive Remedy. From and after the Closing Date, the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Buyer Indemnitees in respect of any and all claims
arising out of or relating to any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other claims arising out of this Agreement and/or the transactions
contemplated hereby (a " _Covered Matter_ ") (irrespective of the cause of
action, whether in contract, tort or otherwise) will be to make an
indemnification claim pursuant to this _Section 9_ and the Escrow Agreement.
If Merger has been consummated, no Covered Matter will give rise to any right
of any party hereto to rescind this Agreement or the Merger. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent Parent from bringing a
common law action for actual fraud with intent to deceive against any Person
whose own such fraud with respect to the representations and warranties of the
Company contained in _Section 2_ of this Agreement has caused Parent to incur
Losses, provided that no Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover more
than once for the same Losses.

SECTION 10. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

 

10.1 Amendments and Waivers.

 

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, but only if:
(i) at any time prior to the consummation of the Closing, such amendment or
waiver is in writing and is signed by Parent and the Company ( _provided,
however_ , that, after obtaining the approval of this Agreement by the
Companys members and prior to the Closing, there shall not be made any
amendment or waiver that by any Legal Requirement requires the further
approval of the Companys members without the further approval of such
members); and (ii) if the Closing occurs, at any time after the consummation
of the Closing, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed by Parent
and the Securityholder Representative (it being acknowledged and agreed that,
after the Closing, the Securityholder Representative may amend this
Agreement and waive matters on behalf of the Effective Time Holders, all as
contemplated by _Section 10.15_).

 

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

 

(c) No failure on the part of any party to exercise any power, right,
privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any
party in exercising any power,

 



50  right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver
of such power, right, privilege or remedy; and no single or partial exercise
of any such power, right, privilege or remedy shall preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or of any other power, right, privilege or remedy.

 

10.2 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this
Agreement, each party to this Agreement shall bear and pay all fees, costs
and expenses (including legal fees and accounting fees) that have been
incurred or that are incurred by such party in connection with the
Transactions, including all fees, costs and expenses incurred by such party
in connection with or by virtue of: (a) the investigation and review conducted
by Parent and its Representatives with respect to the Companys business (and
the furnishing of information to Parent and its Representatives in connection
with such investigation and review), (b) the negotiation, preparation and
review of this Agreement (including the Disclosure Schedule) and all
agreements, certificates, opinions and other instruments and
documents delivered or to be delivered in connection with the Transactions,
(c) the preparation and submission of any filing or notice required to be made
or given in connection with any of the Transactions, and the obtaining of any
consent required to be obtained in connection with any of such transactions,
and (d) the consummation of the Merger. In the case of the Company, all
Company Transaction Expenses shall be deducted from the amount otherwise
payable as the Merger Consideration under this Agreement.

10.3 Notices. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to
be delivered to any party under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall
be deemed properly delivered, given and received when delivered (by hand, by
registered mail, by courier or express delivery service or by facsimile) to

10.4 Time of the Essence. Time is of the essence of this Agreement.

10.5 No Assignment. No party may transfer any of its rights or obligations
hereunder, without the prior written consent of the other parties. Any
transfer in violation of this _Section 10.5_ shall be null and void. Subject
to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to
the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

 

10.6 Headings. The bold-faced headings contained in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only, shall not be deemed to be a part of this
Agreement and shall not be referred to in connection with the construction or
interpretation of this Agreement.

 

10.7 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts,
each of which shall constitute an original and all of which, when taken
together, shall constitute one agreement.

 

10.8 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with,
and governed in all respects by, the internal laws of the State of Delaware
(without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws).

 



52 10.9 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon: the
Company and its successors and assigns (if any); Parent and its successors and
assigns (if any); and Merger Sub and its successors and assigns (if any). This
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the parties, and the respective
successors and assigns (if any) of the foregoing.

10.10 Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance. The rights and remedies
of the parties hereto shall be cumulative (and not alternative). The parties
to this Agreement agree that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach
by any party to this Agreement of any covenant, obligation or other provision
set forth in this Agreement for the benefit of any other party to this
Agreement, such other party shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy
that may be available to it) to: (a) a decree or order of specific
performance or mandamus to enforce the observance and performance of such
covenant, obligation or other provision, and (b) an injunction restraining
such breach or threatened breach. Without limiting any other rights
or remedies of the Company under this Agreement (all of which rights and
remedies shall be cumulative), Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree
that, in the event of any breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub,
the Company may pursue claims for damages (including claims for damages on
behalf of its security holders based on loss of the economic benefits of the
Merger to its security holders) and other relief (including equitable relief)
for any such breach, whether or not this Agreement has been validly
terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_.

 

10.11 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In
the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior
sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such invalid or unenforceable term.

 

10.12 Parties in Interest. Except for payment of the Merger Consideration
to the Effective Time Holders pursuant to the provisions of _Sections 1.6_ ,
_1.7_ , _1.8_ , _1.9_ and _1.10_ and _Sections 6.3_ , _6.4_ , _6.5_ , _6.6_

and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but
rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."

 

(d) Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to "
_Sections_ " and " _Exhibits_ " are intended to refer to Sections of this
Agreement and Exhibits to this Agreement.

 

10.14 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other agreements referred to
herein set forth the entire understanding of the parties hereto relating to
the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings among or between any of the parties relating to the subject
matter hereof and thereof;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the _Existing NDA_
shall not be superseded by this Agreement and shall remain in effect in
accordance with its terms until the earlier of: (a) the Effective Time, or (b)
the date on which such Existing NDA is terminated in accordance with its
terms.

10.15 Securityholder Representative. 

(a) Appointment. By virtue of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval
of the principal terms of the Merger, and the consummation of the Merger or
participating in the Merger and receiving the benefits thereof, including the
right to receive the consideration payable in connection with the Merger, each
Effective Time Holder shall be deemed to have hereby irrevocably nominated,
constituted and appointed the Securityholder Representative as the
representative, agent and true and lawful attorney-in-fact of the Effective
Time Holders, with full power of substitution, to act in the name, place and
stead of the Effective Time Holders for purposes of executing any documents
and taking any actions that the Securityholder Representative may, in its sole
discretion, determine to be necessary, desirable or appropriate in connection
with this Agreement, including without limitation in connection with any
claim for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under _Section 9_ or
under the Escrow Agreement.

 

(b) Authority. The Effective Time Holders grant to the Securityholder
Representative full authority to execute, deliver, acknowledge, certify and
file on behalf of the Effective Time Holders (in the name of any or all of the
Effective Time Holders or otherwise) any and all documents that the
Securityholder Representative may, in its sole discretion, determine to be
necessary, desirable or appropriate, in such forms and containing such
provisions as the Securityholder Representative may, in its sole discretion,
determine to be appropriate, in performing its duties as contemplated by 
_Section 10.15(a)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement or in any other agreement executed in

 



54  connection with the Transactions: (i) each Buyer Indemnitee shall be
entitled to deal exclusively with the Securityholder Representative on all
matters relating to any claim for indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement under _Section 9_ or under the Escrow Agreement; and (ii) each
Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to rely conclusively (without further
evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any document executed or purported to be
executed on behalf of any Effective Time Holder by the Securityholder
Representative, and on any other action taken or purported to be taken on
behalf of any Effective Time Holder by the Securityholder Representative, as
fully binding upon such Effective Time Holder.

(c) Power of Attorney. The Effective Time Holders recognize and intend that
the power of attorney granted in _Section 10.15(a)_: (i) is coupled with an
interest and is irrevocable; (ii) may be delegated by the Securityholder
Representative; and (iii) shall survive the death or incapacity of any
Effective Time Holder.

(d) Replacement. If the Securityholder Representative shall resign or
otherwise be unable to fulfill its responsibilities hereunder, the Effective
Time Holders shall (by consent of those Persons entitled to at least a
majority of the Merger Consideration), within 30 days after such inability,
appoint a successor to the Securityholder Representative (who shall be
reasonably satisfactory to Parent) and immediately thereafter notify Parent of
the identity of such successor. Any such successor shall succeed
the Securityholder Representative as the "Securityholder Representative"
hereunder. If for any reason there is no Securityholder Representative at any
time, all references herein to the Securityholder Representative shall be
deemed to refer to the Effective Time Holders.

(e) Securityholder Representative Retention Account. Upon the Closing,
the Parent will wire to an account (the " _Securityholder Representative
Retention Account_ ") designated by the Securityholder Representative an
amount of $350,000 (the " _Securityholder Representative Retention Amount_
"), which will be used for the purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing the
Securityholder Representative for, any third party expenses pursuant to this
Agreement and the agreements contemplated hereby. The Effective Time Holders
will not receive any interest or earnings on the Securityholder Representative
Retention Amount and irrevocably transfer and assign to the Securityholder
Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise have had in any
such interest or earnings. The Securityholder Representative will not be
liable for any loss of principal of the Securityholder Representative
Retention Amount other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Securityholder Representative will hold these funds separate
from its corporate funds, will not use these funds for its operating expenses
or any other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds
available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. As soon as practicable
following the completion of the Securityholder Representatives
responsibilities, the Securityholder Representative will deliver the remaining
balance of the Securityholder Representative Retention Amount to the Payments
Administrator for further distribution to the Effective Time Holders in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares. For Tax purposes, the
Securityholder Representative Retention Amount will be treated as having been
received and voluntarily set aside by the Effective Time Holders at the time
of Closing.

 



55 (f) Exculpation. The Securityholder Representative shall not be liable to any
Effective Time Holder for any act done or omitted hereunder as Securityholder
Representative while acting in good faith and without gross negligence or
willful misconduct, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of
counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The Effective Time
Holders shall jointly and severally indemnify the Securityholder
Representative and hold it harmless against any and all losses, liabilities,
damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and
expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their
staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment)
(collectively, " _Representative Losses_ ") arising out of or in connection
with the Securityholder Representatives execution and performance of this
Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such
Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; provided, that in the event that
any such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly
caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Securityholder
Representative, the Securityholder Representative will reimburse the Effective
Time Holders the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss to the extent
attributable to such gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid
directly to the Securityholder Representative by the Effective Time Holders,
any such Representative Losses may be recovered by the Securityholder
Representative from (i) the Securityholder Representative Retention Amount and
(ii) the Escrow Funds at such time as remaining amounts would otherwise be
distributable to the Effective Time Holders; provided, that while this
section allows the Securityholder Representative to be paid from the
Securityholder Representative Retention Amount and the Escrow Funds, this does
not relieve the Effective Time Holders from their obligation to promptly pay
such Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it
prevent the Securityholder Representative from seeking any remedies available
to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the Securityholder Representative
be required to advance its own funds on behalf of the Effective Time Holders
or otherwise. The Effective Time Holders acknowledge and agree that the
foregoing indemnities will survive the resignation or removal of the
Securityholder Representative or the termination of this Agreement.

10.16 ResMed Inc. Guarantee. ResMed Inc. hereby absolutely,
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Company and the Effective
Time Holders, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, the due, punctual
and complete discharge of all payment and performance obligations of Parent
and Merger Sub under this Agreement, and all reasonable costs and expenses
incurred by the Company and the Effective Time Holders in connection with
their enforcement, if applicable, of the payment obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub under this Agreement (collectively, the " _Guaranteed Obligations_
"). To the fullest extent permitted by law, ResMed Inc. hereby expressly and
unconditionally waives (a) any and all rights to require the Company or the
Effective Time Holders, as a condition of payment or performance of ResMed
Inc. to proceed against the Parent or pursue any other remedies whatsoever and
(b) to the fullest extent permitted by law, any defenses or benefits that may
be derived from or afforded by law that limit the liability of or exonerate
guarantors or sureties, except to the extent that any such defense is
available to the Parent. In furtherance of the foregoing, ResMed Inc.
acknowledges that the Company may, in its sole discretion, bring and
prosecute an action against ResMed Inc. for the full amount of the Guaranteed
Obligations,

 



56  regardless of whether any action is brought against Parent or Merger Sub or
whether Parent or Merger Sub is joined in any such action or actions. This
_Section 10.16_ shall continue in effect until the date on which Parent
and/or Merger Sub have fulfilled all of their respective obligations pursuant
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

entered into as of February 19, 2016 by and between ResMed Corp., a Minnesota
corporation (" _Parent_ "), and [ ] (" _Equity Holder_ "), an
equity holder of Brightree LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("
_Target_ ").

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
February 19, 2016, by and among Parent, Eagle Acquisition LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (" _Merger Sub_ ") and wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent, Target, ResMed Inc., a Delaware corporation, solely for purposes of
Sections 6.8(b) and 10.16 thereof, and Shareholder Representative Services
LLC, a Colorado limited liability company, solely in its capacity as the
Securityholder Representative (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), pursuant to which
Merger Sub will be merged with and into Target (the " _Merger_ ") on the
terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. Capitalized terms used
but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the
Merger Agreement.

 

WHEREAS, Equity Holder holds a substantial equity interest in Target, has
detailed knowledge of Targets intellectual property and other confidential
and proprietary information of Target and has gained substantial knowledge and
expertise in connection with Targets business and organization.

 

WHEREAS, Parent and Equity Holder recognize that this Agreement is necessary
to protect the goodwill acquired by Parent in connection with the Merger and
acknowledge and agree that Parents failure to receive the entire goodwill
contemplated by the Merger would have the effect of reducing the value of the
Merger.

 

WHEREAS, Parent and Equity Holder also acknowledge and agree that it would be
detrimental to Parent if Equity Holder were to compete with Parent in any
part of the Business (as defined below) in the Business Territory (as defined
below) following the Closing Date during the Non-Solicitation Restricted
Period or the Non-Competition Restricted Period as those terms are defined
below herein.

WHEREAS, this Agreement is a material inducement to Parent to enter into the
Merger Agreement, and Equity Holder is agreeable to entering into this
Agreement with Parent on the terms herein set forth. AGREEMENT

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are acknowledged by each signatory hereto, it is agreed as follows:

1\. During the Non-Solicitation Restricted Period (as defined below), other

employees of Target); or

(ii) solicit or encourage any customer or potential customer of Parent, Target
or one of their Affiliates to reduce, alter or terminate its relationship
with or divert any customer or potential customer of Parent, Target, or any of
their Affiliates away from Parent, Target or such Affiliate.

 

The term " _Non-Solicitation Restricted Period_ " shall mean the twenty four
(24) month period commencing on the Closing Date of the Merger; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that general advertisements for employment which are not
specifically targeted at any of the foregoing will not constitute a violation
of this Section 1\.

 

2\. During the Non-Competition Restricted Period (as defined below), other
than as an employee of Parent, Target or one of their Affiliates (if he or
she serves as such an employee) in the execution of Equity Holders employment
duties, Equity Holder shall not, as an employee, agent, consultant, principal,
representative, equity holder, manager, member, advisor, independent
contractor, general partner, officer, director, stockholder, investor, lender
or guarantor of any corporation, partnership or other entity, or in any other
capacity, directly or indirectly:

other entity that competes with, or has been formed to pursue a business that
would compete with, the Business (as defined below) within the Business
Territory (as defined below);

 

(ii) promote or assist, financially or otherwise, any person, firm,
association, corporation or other entity engaged in the Business anywhere in

the Merger, including without limitation sales of software or services to the
following sectors of the post-acute care market: HME, DME, home health,
hospice, orthotics and prosthetics, sleep lab, infusion, sleep apnea diagnostic,
monitoring and therapy relating to sleep apnea, and respiratory medical device
marketplaces. The Term " _Business Territory_ " shall mean worldwide.

The term " _Non-Competition Restricted Period_ " shall mean the twenty-four
(24) month period commencing on the Closing Date of the Merger.

3\. During the Non-Competition Restricted Period, Equity Holder shall not
criticize or disparage Parent, Target or any of their Affiliates, or make any
statements to, or take any actions with respect to, any Person who is, or to
Equity Holders knowledge is reasonably likely to become, a customer,
supplier, contractor or client of Parent, Target or any of their Affiliates,
which are intended to, or reasonably likely to, damage the relationship with
such Persons with Parent, Target or any of their Affiliates.

 

4\. Section 2 notwithstanding, Equity Holder may:

class of "publicly-traded securities," in which "publicly-traded securities"

to be effective and valid, but if any provision or term of this Agreement is
held to be prohibited by law or invalid then such provision or term will be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity without
invalidating or affecting in any manner whatsoever the remainder of such
provision or term or the remaining provisions or terms of this Agreement.

 



3 6\. During the Non-Competition Restricted Period, Equity Holder shall disclose
the existence and terms of this Agreement to any prospective employer,
partner or co-venturer prior to entering into an employment, partnership or
other business relationship with such person or entity.

 

7\. Equity Holder acknowledges that the goodwill associated with the
acquisition of Target is an integral component of the value that is being
acquired by Parent and is reflected in the consideration payable to Equity
Holder in connection with the Merger. Equity Holder acknowledges that the
promises and the restrictions that Equity Holder is providing in this
Agreement are reasonable and necessary to protect Parents business and
Parents legitimate interest in its acquisition of Target pursuant to the
Merger Agreement. Equity Holder acknowledges that, in connection with Parents
acquisition of Target, Equity Holder is receiving a substantial benefit for
the consummation of the Merger and that such covenants are agreed to in
connection with the Merger. Equity Holder also acknowledges that the
limitations of time, geography and scope of activity agreed to in this
Agreement are reasonable because, among other things: (A) Parent and Target
are engaged in a highly competitive industry; (B) Equity Holder has had unique
access to the trade secrets and know-how of Target; (C) if applicable, Equity
Holder is accepting employment with Parent in connection with the Merger; and
(D) this Agreement provides no more protection than is necessary to protect
Parents interests in acquisition of Target, goodwill, trade secrets and
confidential information.

8\. If Equity Holder is accepting employment with Parent, Equity
Holders obligations under this Agreement shall not be extinguished or
diminished in any way by the termination of Equity Holders employment with
Parent, Target or any Affiliate of Parent, as the case may be, for any reason,
or no reason, including as a result of Equity Holders resignation.

9\. Each of the parties acknowledge that breach of any provision of
this Agreement will result in irreparable harm and damage to Parent, Target
or any of their Affiliates which cannot be adequately compensated by a
monetary award. Accordingly, it is expressly agreed that in addition to all
other remedies available at law or in equity (including, without limitation,
money damages from Equity Holder), Parent, Target and their Affiliates shall
be entitled to seek the remedy of a temporary restraining order, preliminary
injunction or such other form of injunctive or equitable relief as may be
used by any court of competent jurisdiction to restrain or enjoin any of the
parties hereto from breaching any such covenant or provision or to
specifically enforce the provisions hereof.

shall be deemed duly delivered: (i) upon receipt if delivered personally;

11\. This Agreement and any dispute arising under or related to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated herein shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of Georgia applicable to parties residing in
Georgia, without regard to applicable principles of conflicts of law.

 



5 12\. This Agreement is the valid and legally binding obligation of the
parties hereto, enforceable against each party in accordance with its terms,
and shall inure to the benefit of such parties and their respective successors
and assigns.

 

13\. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and any
party hereto may execute any such counterpart, each of which when executed
and delivered shall be deemed to be an original and all of which counterparts
taken together shall constitute but one and the same instrument. This
Agreement shall become binding when one or more counterparts taken
together shall have been executed and delivered by the parties by facsimile
or electronic transmission or otherwise and provided the Merger is
consummated.

 

14\. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior
written and oral agreements and understandings between Parent and Equity
Holder with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement
may not be amended except by a written agreement executed by all parties. 

15\. The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are cumulative
and not alternative. Neither the failure nor any delay by any party in
exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement will operate as
a waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise
of any such right, power or privilege will preclude any other or further
exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right,
power or privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) no
claim or right arising out of this Agreement can be discharged by one party,
in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless
in writing signed by the other party, (b) no waiver that may be given by a
party will be applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given
and (c) no notice to or demand on one party will be deemed to be a waiver of
any obligation of such party or of the right of the party giving such notice
or demand to take further action without notice or demand as provided in this
Agreement.

 

16\. In the event a final determination is made by a duly appointed arbitrator
or a court of competent jurisdiction that any provision of this Agreement
constitutes an unreasonable or otherwise unenforceable restriction against the
Equity Holder, the provisions of this Agreement shall be considered amended to
apply to such extent as the arbitrator or court may determine to be
enforceable. Alternatively, if such an arbitrator or court finds that any
restriction contained in this Agreement is unenforceable, and that restriction
cannot be amended so as to make it enforceable, such finding shall not affect
the enforceability of any other restriction contained in this Agreement.

17\. Each party hereto acknowledges that it has either been represented by
independent legal counsel or that it has waived its right to obtain advice of
legal counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

method of accounting selected by the Sole Member.

8.5 _Loans to Company_. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Sole
Member from making secured or unsecured loans to the Company.

 

ARTICLE IX

_DISSOLUTION AND TERMINATION_

9.1 _Dissolution_.

 

(a) The Company shall be dissolved upon the occurrence of any of the following
events:

accountant of the accounts of the Company and of the Companys assets,
liabilities and operations, from the date of the last previous accounting

wind up the affairs of the Company.

 

(b) If the Company is dissolved and its affairs are to be wound up, the Sole
Member shall:

 

(i) Sell or otherwise liquidate all of the Companys assets as promptly as
practicable (except to the extent the Sole Member may determine to distribute
any assets in kind);

(ii) Allocate any profit or loss resulting from such sales to the Sole
Members Capital Account in accordance with Article VII hereof;

(iii) Discharge all liabilities of the Company, including liabilities to the
Sole Member as a creditor, to the extent otherwise permitted by law, other
than liabilities to the Sole Member for distributions, and establish such

of the Company; and

 

(iv) Distribute the remaining assets to the Sole Member.

 

(c) The Sole Member shall have no obligation to make any Capital Contribution
to restore a negative balance in the Sole Members Capital Account.

(d) Upon completion of the winding up, liquidation and distribution of the
assets, the Company shall be deemed terminated.

(e) The Sole Member shall comply with any applicable requirements of
applicable law pertaining to the winding up of the affairs of the Company and
the final distribution of its assets.

(f) The winding up of the affairs of the Company and the distribution of its
assets shall be conducted exclusively by the Sole Member, who is hereby
authorized to take all actions necessary to accomplish such distribution,
including without limitation, selling any Company assets the Sole Member
deems necessary or appropriate to sell.

9.4 _Certificate of Cancellation_. When all debts, liabilities
and obligations have been paid and discharged or adequate provisions have
been made therefor and all of the remaining property and assets have been
distributed to the Sole Member, a certificate of cancellation shall be filed
as required by the Act.

 

9.5 _Filing of Certificate of Cancellation_.

 



5 (a) The original certificate of cancellation shall be filed with the Delaware
Secretary of State.

(b) Upon the filing of the certificate of cancellation, the existence of the
Company shall cease, except for the purpose of suits, other proceedings and
appropriate action as provided in the Act. The Sole Member shall have
authority to distribute any Company property discovered after dissolution,
convey real estate and take such other action as may be necessary on
behalf of and in the name of the Company.

 _INDEMNIFICATION_

to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any person who was or is a
party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative, investigative or otherwise, and whether by or in
the right of the Company, its members, a third party or otherwise (a "
_Proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact that he/she is or was an officer,
director or employee of the Company, or trustee or administrator of the
Companys employee plans (each a " _Covered Person_ "), against all expense
(including, but not limited to, attorneys fees), liability, loss, judgments,
fines, excise taxes, penalties and amounts paid in settlement actually and
reasonably incurred by him/her in connection with such Proceeding, including
expenses incurred in seeking such indemnification. However, such
indemnification shall exclude (i) indemnification with respect to any
improper personal benefit which the Covered Person is determined to have
received and of the expenses of defending against an improper personal benefit
claim unless the Covered Person is successful on the merits in said defense,
and (ii) indemnification of a Covered Person with respect to their activities
prior to said transaction, unless specifically authorized by the managers or
Sole Member of this Company. Such indemnification shall include prompt payment
of expenses incurred by a Covered Person in defending a Proceeding in advance
of the final disposition of such Proceeding, upon receipt of an undertaking by
or on behalf of the Covered Person to repay such amounts if it shall
ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the
Company under this Article XI, which undertaking shall be an unsecured general
obligation of the Covered Person and may be accepted without regard to his
ability to make repayment.

 

 _11.2 Nature of Indemnification Rights._ The indemnification rights
provided in this Article XI shall be a contract right and shall not be deemed
exclusive of (nor shall they limit or reduce) any other rights to which any

administrators of such a person. Each person who is or becomes an officer,
director or employee of the Company, or trustee or administrator of the
Companys employee plans, shall be deemed to have served or to have continued
to serve in such capacity in reliance upon the indemnity provided for in this
Article XI.

provided outside of the Optional Wire Instructions within the Letter of
Transmittal or within this Agreement, the Paying Agent is authorized to seek

ARTICLE V

 

Section 5.1. Confidential Data. The Paying Agent and Parent acknowledge
that during the course of this Agreement, the parties hereto may make
confidential data available to each other or may otherwise obtain proprietary
or confidential information regarding the Company, its unitholders or other
rights owners, or the Paying Agent (collectively, hereinafter " _Confidential
Data_ "). Confidential Data includes all information not generally known or
used by others and which gives, or may give the possessor of such information
an advantage over its competitors or which could cause Parent or the Paying
Agent injury, loss of reputation or loss of goodwill if disclosed. Such
information includes, but is not necessarily limited to, data or information
which identifies past, current or potential customers, shareholders, business
practices, financial results, research, development, systems and plans; and/or
certain information and material identified by the Company, Parent or the
Paying Agent as " _Proprietary_ " or " _Confidential_ "; and/or data the
Paying Agent furnishes to Parent from the Paying Agents database; and/or data
received from the Company or Parent and enhanced by the Paying Agent.
Confidential Data may be written, oral, recorded, or maintained on other
forms of electronic media. Because of the sensitive nature of the information
that Parent or the Paying Agent and its employees or agents may obtain as a
result of this Agreement, the intent of the parties is that these provisions
be interpreted as broadly as possible to protect Confidential Data.

Section 5.2. Relief. The Paying Agent acknowledges that all Confidential
Data furnished by the Company or Parent is considered proprietary and strictly
confidential. The Paying Agent also acknowledges that the unauthorized use
or disclosure of any Confidential Data may cause irreparable harm to the
Company or Parent. Accordingly, the Paying Agent agrees that the Company or
Parent shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief, in
addition to all other remedies available at law for any threatened or actual
breach of this agreement or any threatened or actual unauthorized use or
disclosure of Confidential Data. Parent agrees that the provisions and
remedies of this section shall also apply to Confidential Data received by
the Company or Parent relating to the Paying Agent.

 



11 Section 5.3. Security Measures. The Paying Agent will employ the same
security measures to protect Confidential Data received from the Company or
Parent that it would employ for its own comparable confidential information
(but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care in handling
Confidential Data). Without limiting the foregoing, the Paying Agent further
agrees, subject to applicable law and regulations, that: (i) Confidential Data
shall not be distributed, disclosed, or conveyed to any third party except by
prior written approval of Parent; (ii) no copies or reproductions shall be
made of any Confidential Data, except as needed to provide the services
described in this Agreement; and (iii) the Paying Agent shall not use any
Confidential Data for its own benefit or for the benefit of any third party.

Section 5.4. Subpoena, Summons or Legal Process. Except as prohibited by
applicable law or regulation, the Paying Agent shall promptly notify Parent in
writing of any subpoena, summons or other legal process served on the Paying
Agent for the purpose of obtaining Confidential Data (i) consisting of a
unitholder list, such as an identified class of unitholders, or (ii) relating
to significant regulatory action or litigation that would have a material
effect on the performance of the Paying Agent or corporate status of the
Surviving Company. In such cases, Parent shall have a reasonable opportunity
to seek appropriate protective measures; provided, however, that this
subsection shall not require the Paying Agent to notify Parent of its receipt
of any subpoena, summons or other legal process seeking Confidential Data for
a single unitholder or group of related unitholders in connection with routine
tax levies or other routine third party litigation involving a unitholder or
if the Paying Agent is prohibited by law or regulation from making such
disclosure. Parent will indemnify the Paying Agent for all reasonable expenses
incurred by the Paying Agent in connection with determining the lawful release
of the Confidential Data.

 

Section 5.5. Exceptions. The obligations set forth in Sections 5.1 through
5.4 above shall not apply to: 



     | (a) |

any disclosure specifically authorized in writing by Parent or the Paying
Agent; 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) |

if this transaction is publically announced, the Paying Agent may disclose
that it acted in capacity as Paying Agent or Escrow Agent on the transaction.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, terms or conditions of the transaction and such
appointment will remain confidential in nature. 

---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

any disclosure required by applicable law or regulation, including pursuant to
a court order; or 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) |

Confidential Data which: 

---|---|--- 



     | (i) |

has become public without violation of this Agreement; or 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) |

was disclosed to the receiving party by a third party not under an obligation
of confidentiality to any party; or 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) |

was independently developed by the disclosing party not otherwise in violation
or breach of this Agreement or any other obligation of the parties to each
other; or 

---|---|--- 
 



12 was rightfully known to the receiving party prior to entering into this
Agreement. 

---|---|--- 
 

Section 5.6. Obligations Beyond Termination or Assignment. The obligations
of each party set forth in Sections 5.5(a), (b) and (c) above shall survive
termination or assignment of this Agreement.

Section 5.7. Compliance: The Paying Agents appointment and acceptance of its
duties under this Agreement is contingent upon verification of all regulatory
requirements applicable to Parent and the Surviving Company, including
successful completion of a final background check. These conditions include,
without limitation, requirements under the USA Patriot Act Customer
Identification Program (CIP), the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), and the U.S.
Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), each as
may be amended from time to time. If these conditions are not met, the Paying
Agent may at its option promptly terminate this Agreement in whole or in part,
and without the Paying Agent having any liability or incurring any additional
costs.

 



13 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent and the Paying Agent have caused their names to be
signed hereto by their duly authorized officers, all as of the date first
written above.

actions taken or purported to be taken on behalf of the undersigned by, the
Securityholder Representative in respect of such matters and the other
matters referred to in the Merger Agreement.

By signing the Letter of Transmittal, the undersigned hereby agrees that
payment of any amounts to the account designated by the undersigned in this
Letter of Transmittal and in accordance with the wire transfer instructions
provided by the undersigned herein (" _Wire Transfer Instructions_ ")

received by, the undersigned. Upon payment to the account designated in this
Letter of Transmittal and the Wire Transfer Instructions of all amounts due
and owing to the undersigned in exchange for the Company Units, the
undersigned shall thereby waive and release any and all claims, solely to the

Paying Agent or the Buyer Indemnitees. " _Buyer Indemnitees_ " means Parent,
the Company, their respective successors and permitted assigns, and their
respective officers, employees, directors and stockholders.

The undersigned hereby acknowledges and agrees that, as a result of the
Merger, the undersigned shall cease to have any rights with respect to or
arising from the Company Units, except the right to receive payments under the
Merger Agreement upon delivery of a properly executed and duly executed
Letter of Transmittal.

payment of any applicable Taxes imposed on the undersigned attributable to the
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to the Merger
Agreement. The undersigned acknowledges and agrees that each of Parent, the
Company, the Paying Agent and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable to the
undersigned pursuant to the Merger Agreement such amounts as Parent, the
Company, the Paying Agent and the Escrow Agent are required to deduct or
withhold therefrom under the Code or under any other Legal Requirement or as
they shall determine are necessary to satisfy any other Tax withholding
obligations with respect to the undersigned. To the extent such amounts are
so deducted or withheld, such amounts will be treated for all purposes under
the Merger Agreement as having been paid to the undersigned.

 

This Letter of Transmittal shall be construed in accordance with, and governed
in all respects by, the internal laws of the State of Delaware (without
giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws that are not mandatorily
applicable by law and would permit or require the application of the law of
another jurisdiction). All authority conferred or agreed to be
conferred pursuant to this Letter of Transmittal shall be binding upon the
successors, assigns, heirs, executors, administrators and legal
representatives of the undersigned and shall not be affected by, and shall
survive, the dissolution, death or incapacity of the undersigned.

IRS Form W-9 or IRS Form W-8: Under United States federal income tax law,
"U.S. persons" (as defined below) who are receiving any consideration in
connection with the Merger are required to provide his, her or its current
taxpayer identification number ("TIN"). If such holder is an individual, the
TIN is his or her social security number. If the holder does not provide the
correct TIN or an adequate basis for an exemption, the holder may be subject
to a $50 penalty imposed by the IRS, and any consideration such holder
receives in the Merger may be subject to backup withholding at the applicable
rate (currently 28%). If withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a
refund from the IRS may be obtained if the appropriate information is provided
in a timely manner to the IRS. If the person receiving payment for the shares
and/or Company warrants is a U.S. person, to prevent backup withholding
complete and sign the enclosed IRS Form W-9 to certify the payees TIN. Please
provide the social security or employer identification number of the person or
entity receiving payment for the above described shares and/or Company
warrants and sign and date the form. If the person receiving payment for the
shares and/or Company warrants is not a "U.S. person," to prevent backup
withholding (i) complete and sign an applicable IRS Form W-8 certifying under
penalties of perjury to such holders foreign status or (ii) otherwise
establish an exemption from withholding. IRS Forms W-8 may be obtained at
www.irs.gov or by calling 1-800-829-3676.  

---|---|--- 

See the enclosed instructions to IRS Form W-9 for additional information and
instructions.

 

Failure to provide a properly completed and signed IRS Form W-9 or a properly
completed and signed applicable IRS Form W-8 may result in backup withholding
under U.S. tax laws on any Merger Consideration payments and may result in a
penalty imposed by the IRS. Any tax advice that may be contained herein does not constitute an opinion
that meets the requirements of the regulations. Any such tax advice contained
herein cannot be used, and was not intended or written to be used by any
taxpayer, for the purpose of avoiding any federal tax penalties that may be
imposed under the Internal Revenue Code.

Definition of "U.S. Person": For federal tax purposes, you are considered a
U.S. person if you are (1) An individual who is a U.S. citizen or U.S.
resident alien, (2) A partnership, corporation, company or association created
or organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States, (3)
An estate (other than a foreign estate), or (4) A domestic trust (as defined

sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties and the Escrow Agent
agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE 1

ESCROW DEPOSIT

Section 1.1. _Receipt of Escrow Deposit Amount_. Upon execution hereof, the
Parent shall deposit the sum of five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) (the "
_Escrow Deposit Amount_ ") into an account (the " _Escrow Account_ ")
established with Escrow Agent.

 

Section 1.2. _Investments_.

 

(a) The Escrow Agent shall invest the Escrow Deposit Amount, including any and
all interest and investment income, in accordance with the written
instructions provided to the Escrow Agent and signed by the Parent and the
Securityholder Representative. In the absence of written investment
instructions from the Parent and the Securityholder Representative, the
Escrow Agent shall invest the Escrow Deposit Amount, including any and all
interest and investment income, in the MandT Bank Corporate Deposit Account
which is further described in Exhibit C. The Escrow Deposit Amount, together
with all interest and income shall constitute the " _Escrow Funds_ " and
shall be disbursed in accordance with the terms hereof.

 

(b) The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized and directed to sell or redeem any
such investments as it deems necessary to make any payments or distributions
required under this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall have no
responsibility or liability for any loss which may result from any investment
or sale of investment made in accordance with this Escrow Agreement.
The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized, in making or disposing of any
investment permitted by this Escrow Agreement, to deal with itself (in its
individual capacity) or with any one or more of its affiliates, whether it or
any such affiliate is acting as agent of the Escrow Agent or for any third
person or dealing as principal for its own account. The Parties acknowledge
that the Escrow Agent is not providing investment supervision, recommendations
or advice.

 

Section 1.3. _Procedures with Respect to Net Working Capital Shortfall_.

 

(a) _Release of Final Working Capital Shortfall_. Upon the final determination
that the Final Working Capital is less than the Estimated Working Capital
(such deficiency, the " _Final Working Capital Shortfall_ ") pursuant to
Section 1.7(c)(ii)(2) or (3) of the Merger Agreement, the Parent and the
Securityholder Representative shall jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow
Agent, within five (5) Business Days after such final determination, a written
notice instructing the Escrow Agent to make immediate payment to Parent by
wire transfer of immediately available funds in an amount equal to the lesser
of (i) the Final  Working Capital Shortfall or (ii) the Escrow Funds from the Escrow Account
and the remainder of the Escrow Funds (if any) will be distributed in
accordance with Sections 1.4 and 1.5. If there is no Final Working Capital
Shortfall Amount, the entire Escrow Funds will be disbursed in accordance with
Sections 1.4 and 1.5.

 

Section 1.4. _Procedures with Respect to Indemnification Claims_.

 

(a) _Claim_. If, at any time and from time to time from the date hereof until
the Expiration Date, the Parent desires to make a claim against the Escrow
Funds pursuant to its rights under Section 9 of the Merger Agreement (each, a
" _Claim_ "), the Parent, on its own behalf or on behalf of the Buyer
Indemnitees (such claiming party, the " _Claimant_ "), shall deliver a
written notice of the Claim (a " _Claims Notice_ ") to the Escrow Agent, with
a copy to the Securityholder Representative, substantially in the form
attached hereto as Annex I, specifying the nature of the Claim and the basis,
in reasonable detail, for Claimants belief that it is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Section 9 of the Merger Agreement, the estimated
amount of Losses to which the Claimant believes it is or may be entitled to
under the Merger Agreement (the " _Claimed Amount_ ").

(b)  _Response by the Securityholder Representative_. No later than 5:00PM
Eastern Time on the thirtieth (30th) calendar day following but not including
the date of receipt by the Securityholder Representative of a copy of any
Claims Notice (" _Response Period_ "), the Securityholder Representative
shall, with respect to such Claims Notice, by written notice to the Escrow
Agent, with a copy to the Parent (a " _Response Notice_ "), substantially in
the form attached hereto as Annex II, either (a) concede liability for the
Claimed Amount in whole, or (b) deny liability for the Claimed Amount in whole
or in part (it being understood that any portion of the Claimed Amount for
which the Securityholder Representative has not denied liability shall be
deemed to have been conceded). If the Securityholders Representative denies
liability in whole or in part, such Response Notice shall be accompanied by a
reasonably detailed description of the basis for such denial. The portion of
the Claimed Amount for which the Securityholder Representative has conceded
liability is referred to herein as the " _Conceded Amount_." If the
Securityholder Representative has conceded liability for any portion of the
Claimed Amount, the Escrow Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Claimant
the Conceded Amount; provided, however, that if the Securityholder
Representative fails to deliver a Response Notice within the Response Period,
the Securityholder Representative shall be deemed to have conceded the Claimed
Amount in full (and the Claimed Amount shall constitute the Conceded Amount)
and the Escrow Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Claimant the full
Claimed Amount.

(c) _Resolutions of Disputes_.

 

(i) If the Securityholder Representative has denied liability for, or
otherwise disputes, the Claimed Amount, in whole or in part, the
Securityholder Representative and the Parent, on behalf of the applicable
Claimant, shall attempt to resolve such dispute as promptly as possible. If
the Parent and the Securityholder  Representative resolve such dispute, they shall deliver to the Escrow Agent
a jointly executed notice (the " _Conceded Amount Notice_ ") signed by each of
them. Such Conceded Amount Notice shall instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to
the applicable Claimant the amount, if any, agreed to by both the Parent and
the Securityholder Representative in settlement of such dispute.

 

(ii) If the Parent and the Securityholder Representative fail to resolve such
dispute within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt by Parent of a copy of
the Response Notice corresponding to such dispute, (1) the issue of liability
for any such dispute with respect to Claims made pursuant to Section 9 of the
Merger Agreement may be submitted by any party to a state or federal court
located and sitting in the State of Delaware that has appropriate subject
matter jurisdiction chosen by either the Parent or the Securityholder
Representative (as applicable) (such court, the " _Chosen Court_ ") for the
purposes of obtaining a final, non-appealable order of such Chosen Court (an "
_Order_ ") or (2) the issue of liability for any such dispute with respect to
Claims made pursuant to Section 9 of the Merger Agreement may be submitted to
arbitration, jointly by the Parent and the Securityholder Representative for
the purposes of obtaining a final, conclusive and binding decision (the "
_Final Decision_ "). Such Order or Final Decision, as the case may be, shall
contain the amount, if any, of the Effective Time Holders liability for the
Claimed Amount as finally determined by such Chosen Court or arbitration, as
the case may be (the " _Ordered Amount_ "); provided that the Ordered Amount
shall be subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9 of the Merger
Agreement.

 

(d) _Payment of Claims_. The Escrow Agent promptly shall pay, no later than
the fifth (5th) Business Day following the determination of a Payment Event
(as such term is defined below), to the applicable Claimant from the Escrow
Funds: (i) following any concession (or deemed concession) of liability by
the Securityholder Representative, in whole or in part, the Conceded Amount as
set forth in the Conceded Amount Notice; (ii) following expiration of the
Response Period (pursuant to receipt by the Escrow Agent of any Claims
Notice) in which the Escrow Agent did not receive a Response Notice from the
Securityholder Representative, the Claimed Amount (without duplication of any
Conceded Amount); or (iii) following receipt by the Escrow Agent of any Order
or Final Decision, the Ordered Amount (collectively, clauses (i), (ii) and
(iii), the " _Payment Events_ ").

 

Section 1.5. _Disbursements_.

 

(a) If the aggregate amount remaining in the Escrow Account on the Expiration
Date (the " _Aggregate Escrow Balance_ ") exceeds the aggregate dollar amount
of any then-outstanding disputes associated with all Claims validly made prior
to the Expiration Date that have not been fully and finally resolved and paid
prior to the Expiration Date (the " _Aggregate Pending Claim Amount_ "), then
on the first Business Day after the Expiration Date, the Escrow Agent shall
release to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the Effective Time Holders an
amount equal to the Aggregate Escrow Balance _minus_ the Aggregate Pending
Claim Amount. Following the Expiration Date, if an unresolved Claim is finally
resolved, the Parent and the  Securityholder Representative shall jointly execute and deliver to the
Escrow Agent, within three (3) Business Days after final resolution of such
unresolved Claim, a written notice (the " _Final Release Instruction_ ")
instructing the Escrow Agent to make payment, if any, within three (3)
Business Days from the Escrow Funds consistent with such resolution to the
Paying Agent for the benefit of the Effective Time Holders of the amount (if
any) by which the aggregate amount remaining of the Escrow Funds as of the
date of resolution of such Claim that is the subject of the Final Release
Instruction exceeds the aggregate amount of the disputed amounts associated
with all other remaining unresolved Claims.

(b) Upon receipt of a Conceded Amount Notice with respect to a particular
outstanding Claim, the Escrow Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable
Claimant, as the case may be, the Conceded Amount.

 

(c) Upon receipt of an Order or a Final Decision with respect to a particular
outstanding Claim, the Escrow Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable
Claimant, as the case may be, the Ordered Amount, if any.

(d) In the event that the Parties jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to
disburse the Escrow Funds to any party, the Escrow Agent shall comply with
such instructions, any provision herein to the contrary notwithstanding.

 

(e) The Parties agree that the residual interest, if the final release of the
Escrow Funds is mid-month, shall be wired as jointly directed by the Parent
and the Securityholder Representative.

Section 1.6. _Income Tax Allocation and Reporting_. 

(a) The Parties agree that, for tax reporting purposes, all interest and other
income from investment of the Escrow Deposit Amount shall, as of the end of
each calendar year and to the extent required by the IRS, be reported as
having been earned by the Parent, whether or not such income was disbursed
during such calendar year. The Parent shall be responsible for paying taxes
(including any penalties and interest thereon) on all interest earned on the
Escrow Deposit Amount and for filing all necessary tax returns with respect to
such income. The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that for federal
and applicable state and local income tax purposes, any disbursements from
the Escrow Funds to Members shall be treated as payments pursuant to an
"installment sale" within the meaning of Code section 453(a). To the extent
any Escrow Funds are distributed to or for the benefit of the Effective Time
Holders, interest shall be imputed on such amount as required by Section 1274
of the Code upon written direction from Parent. Parent will provide a
breakdown of the dollar amount of principal and the dollar amount to be
characterized as interest prior to the payment by the Escrow Agent to any
party under this Agreement. Parent will confirm that in no event shall the
aggregate payments from the Escrow Funds to a holder of a Company Unit in
respect of such holders Company Unit exceed an amount equal to the holders
initial Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Deposit Amount in respect of the holders
Company Units as set forth in the   Payout Spreadsheet multiplied by (ii) the greater of (x) 105% or (y) 100%
plus 5 times the "Federal mid-term rate" as defined in Section 1274(d)(1) of
the Code (expressed as a percentage) in effect at the time the escrow is
funded.

(b) Prior to the date hereof, Parent shall provide the Escrow Agent with a
properly executed IRS Form W-9 and such other forms and documents that the
Escrow Agent may reasonably request. The Parties understand that if such tax
reporting documentation is not provided and certified to the Escrow Agent,
the Escrow Agent may be required by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, to withhold a portion of
any interest or other income earned on the investment of the Escrow Deposit
Amount. 

(c) To the extent that the Escrow Agent becomes liable for the payment of any
taxes in respect of income derived from the investment of the Escrow Deposit
Amount, the Escrow Agent shall satisfy such liability to the extent possible
from the Escrow Funds. Parent and the Securityholder Representative (solely on
behalf of the Members and in its capacity as the Securityholder
Representative, not in its individual capacity), jointly and severally, shall
indemnify, defend and hold the Escrow Agent harmless from and against any tax,
late payment, interest, penalty or other cost or expense that may be
assessed against the Escrow Agent on or with respect to the Escrow Funds and
the investment thereof unless such tax, late payment, interest, penalty or
other expense was directly caused by the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Escrow Agent. Solely as between Parent and the
Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the Effective Time Holders), such
taxes shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by Parent and fifty percent (50%) by
the Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the Effective Time Holders).
The indemnification provided by this Section 1.6(d) is in addition to the
indemnification provided in Section 3.1 and shall survive the resignation or
removal of the Escrow Agent and the termination of this Escrow Agreement.

Section 1.7. _Termination_. This Escrow Agreement shall terminate upon the
disbursement of all of the Escrow Funds, including any investment earnings
thereon when credited, and this Escrow Agreement shall be of no further force
and effect except that the provisions of Sections 1.6(d), 3.1 and 3.2 hereof
shall survive termination.

authority. Concurrent with the execution of this Escrow Agreement, the Parties
shall deliver to the Escrow Agent authorized signers forms in the form of
Exhibit A-1 and Exhibit A-2 to this Escrow Agreement.

 

Section 2.4. _Right Not Duty Undertaken_. The permissive rights of the
Escrow Agent to do things enumerated in this Escrow Agreement shall not be
construed as duties.

Section 2.5. _No Financial Obligation_. No provision of this Escrow
Agreement shall require the Escrow Agent to risk or advance its own funds or
otherwise incur any financial liability or potential financial liability in
the performance of its duties or the exercise of its rights under this Escrow
Agreement.

PROVISIONS CONCERNING THE ESCROW AGENT

 

Section 3.1. _Indemnification_. Parent and the Securityholder
Representative (solely on behalf of the Effective Time Holders and in its
capacity as the Securityholder Representative, not in its individual capacity)
hereby agree, jointly and  severally, to indemnify Escrow Agent, its directors, officers, employees and
agents (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), and hold the Indemnified
Parties harmless from any and against all liabilities, losses, actions, suits
or proceedings at law or in equity, and any other expenses, fees or charges of
any character or nature, including, without limitation, attorneys fees and
expenses (collectively, " _Escrow Agent Losses_ "), which an Indemnified
Party may incur or with which it may be threatened by reason of acting as or
on behalf of Escrow Agent under this Escrow Agreement or arising out of the
existence of the Escrow Account, except to the extent the same shall be
caused by Escrow Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct. Solely as
between Parent and the Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the
Effective Time Holders), such Escrow Agent Losses shall be paid fifty percent
(50%) by Parent and fifty percent (50%) by the Securityholder Representative
(on behalf of the Effective Time Holders). Escrow Agent shall have a first
lien against the Escrow Account to secure the obligations of the parties
hereunder. The terms of this paragraph shall survive the resignation or
removal of the Escrow Agent and the termination of this Escrow Agreement.

 

Section 3.2. _Limitation of Liability_. THE ESCROW AGENT SHALL NOT BE
LIABLE, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FOR ANY (I) DAMAGES, LOSSES OR EXPENSES
ARISING OUT OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED HEREUNDER, OTHER THAN DAMAGES, LOSSES OR
EXPENSES WHICH HAVE BEEN FINALLY ADJUDICATED TO HAVE DIRECTLY RESULTED FROM
THE ESCROW AGENTS GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, OR (II) SPECIAL,
INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING
WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), EVEN IF THE ESCROW AGENT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF
ACTION.

Section 3.3. _Resignation or Removal_. The Escrow Agent may resign by
furnishing written notice of its resignation to the Parties, and the Parties
may remove the Escrow Agent by furnishing to the Escrow Agent a joint written
notice of its removal along with payment of all fees and expenses to which it
is entitled through the date of termination. Such resignation or removal, as
the case may be, shall be effective sixty (60) days after the delivery of such
notice or upon the earlier appointment of a successor, and the Escrow Agents
sole responsibility thereafter shall be to safely keep the Escrow Funds and
to deliver the same to a successor escrow agent as shall be appointed by the
Parties, as evidenced by a joint written notice filed with the Escrow Agent or
in accordance with a court order. If the Parties have failed to appoint a
successor escrow agent prior to the expiration of sixty (60) days following
the delivery of such notice of resignation or removal, the Escrow Agent may
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a
successor escrow agent or for other appropriate relief, and any such resulting
appointment shall be binding upon the Parties.

 

Section 3.4. _Compensation_. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
compensation for its services as stated in the fee schedule attached hereto
as Exhibit B, which compensation shall be paid by Parent. The fee agreed upon
for the services rendered  hereunder is intended as full compensation for the Escrow Agents services
as contemplated by this Escrow Agreement; provided, however, that in the event
that the conditions for the disbursement of funds under this Escrow Agreement
are not fulfilled, or the Escrow Agent renders any service not contemplated in
this Escrow Agreement, or there is any assignment of interest in the subject
matter of this Escrow Agreement, or any material modification hereof, or if
any material controversy arises hereunder, or the Escrow Agent is made a party
to any litigation pertaining to this Escrow Agreement or the subject matter
hereof, then the Escrow Agent shall be compensated for such extraordinary
services and reimbursed for all costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses, occasioned by any such delay, controversy,
litigation or event. The Escrow Agent shall have, and is hereby granted,
a prior lien upon the Escrow Account with respect to its unpaid fees, non-
reimbursed expenses and unsatisfied indemnification rights, superior to the
interests of any other persons or entities and is hereby granted the right to
set off and deduct any unpaid fees, non-reimbursed expenses and unsatisfied
indemnification rights from the Escrow Account that remain unpaid for a period
of thirty (30) days after providing the Parties with an invoice for such
amounts.

 

Section 3.5. _Disagreements_. If any conflict, disagreement or dispute
arises between, among, or involving any of the parties hereto concerning the
meaning or validity of any provision hereunder or concerning any other matter
relating to this Escrow Agreement, or the Escrow Agent is in doubt as to the
action to be taken hereunder, the Escrow Agent is authorized to retain the
Escrow Funds until the Escrow Agent (i) receives a final non-appealable order
of a court of competent jurisdiction, a final non-appealable arbitration
decision directing delivery of the Escrow Funds, or receives a written
agreement executed by each of the parties involved in such disagreement or
dispute directing delivery of the Escrow Funds, in which event the Escrow
Agent shall be authorized to disburse the Escrow Funds in accordance with
such final court order, arbitration decision, or agreement, or (ii) files an
interpleader action in any court of competent jurisdiction, and upon the
filing thereof, the Escrow Agent shall be relieved of all liability as to the
Escrow Funds and shall be entitled to recover attorneys fees, expenses and
other costs incurred in commencing and maintaining any such interpleader
action. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act on any such agreement, court
order, or arbitration decision without further question, inquiry or consent.

Section 3.6. _Merger or Consolidation_. Any corporation or association
into which the Escrow Agent may be converted or merged, or with which it may
be consolidated, or to which it may sell or transfer all or substantially all
of its corporate trust business and assets as a whole or substantially as a
whole, or any corporation or association resulting from any such conversion,
sale, merger, consolidation or transfer to which the Escrow Agent is a party,
shall be and become the successor escrow agent under this Escrow
Agreement and shall have and succeed to the rights, powers, duties,
immunities and privileges as its predecessor, without the execution or filing
of any instrument or paper or the performance of any further act. Section 3.7. _Attachment of Escrow Funds; Compliance with Legal Orders._
In the event that any Escrow Funds shall be attached, garnished or levied upon
by any court order, or the delivery thereof shall be stayed or enjoined by an
order of a court, or any order, judgment or decree shall be made or entered
by any court order affecting the Escrow Funds, the Escrow Agent is hereby
expressly authorized, in its sole discretion, to respond as it deems
appropriate or to comply with all writs, orders or decrees so entered
or issued, or which it is advised by legal counsel of its own choosing is
binding upon it, whether with or without jurisdiction. In the event that the
Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such writ, order or decree it shall
not be liable to any of the Parties or to any other person, firm or
corporation, should, by reason of such compliance notwithstanding, such writ,
order or decree be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or
vacated.

 

Section 3.8. _Force Majeure_. The Escrow Agent shall not be responsible or
liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligation under
this Escrow Agreement arising out of or caused, directly or indirectly, by
circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including, without limitation,
acts of God; earthquakes; fire; flood; wars; acts of terrorism; civil or
military disturbances; sabotage; epidemic; riots; interruptions, loss or
malfunctions of utilities, computer (hardware or software) or communications
services; accidents; labor disputes; acts of civil or military authority
or governmental action; it being understood that the Escrow Agent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts which are consistent with accepted practices
in the banking industry to resume performance as soon as reasonably
practicable under the circumstances.
