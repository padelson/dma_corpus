receipt by the Purchaser of the Notice of Disagreement, the Parties shall
attempt to resolve any differences which they may have with respect to any
matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. If at the end of the

(the "Disputed Matters") shall be submitted to and reviewed by the Zurich
office of Ernst and Young LLP (such Person, subject to change as provided in

Capital as per the Closing Date as the case may be, in accordance with this
Agreement and its decision with respect to the Net Financial Debt or the Net
Working Capital shall be final and binding upon the Parties. With the

however, be based on the Purchasers computation (for all elements of the
Purchasers computation not mentioned in the Notice of Disagreement) or on
written settlements reached by the Parties (for all Disputed Matters on which
the Parties before the examination by the Accounting Expert have agreed upon
in writing). The fees and expenses of the Accounting Expert in connection with
the determination of any Disputed Matter shall be borne one half by the Seller
and one half by the Purchaser.

the Parties shall use their best endeavors to meet such requirements to the
extent they do not materially change the transactions contemplated herein.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
in no event shall the Purchaser or any of its Associated Companies be required

    5.15 | _Environmental Matters_. To the Sellers best knowledge, the
Companies have obtained all permits, licenses and approvals under the
Environmental Laws required to carry on their business as presently
conducted, are in compliance with the terms and conditions of all such

applicable Environmental Laws.  
---|--- 

Except as is Fairly Disclosed in Writing in the Due Diligence Material to the
Sellers best knowledge: 



     | i. | There are no contaminated sites ( _Altlasten_ ) at any
property of the Companies that could, under any Environmental Laws as in force
and effective as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date and applicable
to the Companies and their assets, give rise to any Liability or clean-up
costs being imposed on the Companies; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | ii. | There are no investigations, inquiries or proceedings
outstanding or threatened in writing against the Companies or related to the
Business which could result in any suspension, cancellation, refusal or
revocation of any permit, license, authorization or consent required under any

and as of the Closing Date; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | iii. | There are no events, conditions, activities or incidents
(including the production, use, treatment, storage, transport, deposit,
disposal or management of Hazardous Substances), which have occurred or will
occur until the Closing Date and which would give rise to any Liability of the
Companies under any applicable Environmental Laws as in force and effective as
of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date.  
---|---|--- 
 



27 A true, correct and complete copy of all environmental site assessments,
investigations and reports related to any of the real property used in the
operation of the Business that are in the Sellers possession or control was

reports so submitted being the "Environmental Reports").

To the Sellers best knowledge, no real property owned or occupied by any
of the Companies that is used for a purpose other than the manufacturing or

any Hazardous Substance has occurred at any Non-Production Facility in the
operation of the Business.

marketed or sold by or for the Companies or the Business contained at the time
of sale any asbestos and no litigation relating to asbestos is pending or has
been threatened against the Companies or, with respect to the Business, the
Seller or its Associated Companies (other than the Companies).

 

Except in the case of fraud or willful misconduct by the Seller, the Seller
shall, however, not be liable for clean-up costs that arise at a location
with respect to which an Environmental Report was submitted in the Due
Diligence Material because (i) the Purchaser has terminated the present
industrial activities at a certain site, (ii) the Purchaser has actively
investigated potential contamination without being obliged by Applicable Law
to do so or (iii) the Purchaser has notified the competent authorities of a
contamination without being obliged by Applicable Law to do so.

 



   5.16 | _Product Liability_. The Seller warrants that third parties
have no claims against the Companies or primarily relating to the Business in
connection with any products delivered or services rendered by the Companies
or the Business before the Closing Date, as far as such claims exceed CHF
250,000 (Swiss Francs two hundred and fifty thousand) in each case except as
are listed in _Schedule 5.8_.  
---|--- 



   5.17 | _Real Estate_. The Companies have rightful title to the real

pending or threatened in writing regarding condemnation or other eminent
domain matter affecting real property listed in _Schedule 5.17_ or any real
property leased by any of the Companies or any sale or other disposition of
any real property listed in _Schedule 5.17_ or any real property leased by
any of the Companies in lieu of condemnation. A true, correct and complete
copy of all land title surveys and all title insurance commitments and
policies issued to any of the Companies that cover any real estate used in the
operation of the Business or for non-US real estate copies of the excerpts of
the relevant land registers governing such real estate were submitted in the
Due Diligence Material. 
---|---

each asset used by it, located on any of its premises, shown on the balance
sheet included in the Interim Financial Statement or acquired by it after the
date of such balance sheet, free and clear of any Encumbrance, except for any
asset disposed of in the ordinary course of Business consistent with prior
practice since the date of such balance sheet. The applicable Selling
Subsidiary has good and marketable title to, or a valid leasehold interest in
or a valid license for, each Asset, free and clear of any Encumbrance. Each
asset of the Companies and each Asset is in good operating condition and
repair (except normal wear and tear) and is suitable and sufficient for the
purposes for which it is being used immediately prior to Closing taking
into account its age and useful life. Except for the assets and services to
be made available to the Purchaser pursuant to art. 9.2, the trademarks listed
in _Schedule 5.11(b)_, the insurance policies to be terminated as described
in art. 9.4, the software licenses listed in _Schedule 9.5_ and the names and
marks described in art. 9.1 the assets of the Companies and the Assets
(including in both cases any leased assets) constitute all assets used in the
ordinary course of Business consistent with prior practice. Each tangible
asset used in the Business is located at a premises owned or leased by one of
the Companies, except for cars and equipment in the possession of customers in
the ordinary course of Business consistent with prior practice. 
---|--- 



   5.19 | _Intercompany Loans_. Each Intercompany Loan is included in the
calculation of Net Financial Debt. The Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries
have filed all Debt Declarations related to such Intercompany Loans as
required by Applicable Laws. 
---|--- 



   5.20 | _No Brokers_. Neither the Seller nor any of the Companies has
any Liability to any broker, finder or similar intermediary that would cause
the Purchaser or any of the Companies to become liable for payment of any fee
or expense with respect thereto. 
---|--- 



   5.21 | _Customers_. _Schedule 5.21_ lists the 10 largest customers by
revenue (listing the revenues in CHF for each) of products and services of
the Business for the calendar year 2010. Neither the Seller nor any of its
Associated Companies has received any written communication indicating that,
any such customer is terminating or materially reducing or making any
materially adverse change in, or desires or intends to terminate or
materially reduce or make any materially adverse change in, any aspect of its
or any of its affiliates relationship with the Business. Material for the
purpose of this provision means a reduction of 50% or more of the revenues
derived from such customer. 
---|--- 



   5.22 | _No further Warranties_. Except as expressly provided in these
articles 5.1 to 5.21 the Seller makes no representation or warranty with
respect to the Shares or the Assets or the Companies. 
---|--- 
 



29 ARTICLE 6

REMEDIES



   6.1 | _Term of Representations and Warranties_. Except as stated
otherwise in this art. 6.1, the representations and warranties set forth in
art. 5.1 to 5.21 of this Agreement shall continue in effect until eighteen
(18) months after the Closing Date. The representations and warranties set
forth in art. 5.9 ( _Taxes_ ) of this Agreement shall continue in effect until
three (3) months after the statute of limitation on the tax claims concerned
has expired. The representations and warranties contained in art. 5.15 (
_Environmental Matters_ ) of this Agreement shall continue in effect until
five (5) years after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for
each claim for indemnity hereunder regarding a representation or warranty that
is made before expiration of such representation or warranty, such claim and
associated right to indemnity will not terminate before final determination
and satisfaction of such claim. 
---|--- 

The Purchaser is not bound by the statutory examination or notice
requirements. However the Purchaser has to notify the Seller within 30
Business Days after the Purchaser has detected a breach of representations and
warranties, describing in reasonable detail such breach and its
financial consequences. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchasers
failure to notify the Seller within the period specified in this paragraph
shall not relieve the Seller of any Liability under this Agreement, except to
the extent (if any) the Seller demonstrates that it was prejudiced by such
failure.



   6.2 | _Indemnity_. In case of a breach of a representation or warranty
by the Seller, the Seller shall within the limitations set forth in article
6.3 of this Agreement either remedy such breach within sixty (60) days after
having been notified of the breach (in case of a breach of the warranties set
forth in article 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4 and 5.18) or pay to the Purchaser the
amount which is necessary to establish the state of the Companies or the
Business described in such representation or warranty and to compensate any
damage directly caused by such breach. Any rescissions of the Agreement for
breach of representations or warranties as well as any consequential damages
for breaches of representations or warranties in this Agreement are excluded. 
---|--- 



   6.3 | _Limitations_ 
---|--- 



   6.3.1 | _De Minimis_. The Seller shall have no obligation to pay any
amounts for any breach of representations and warranties unless the aggregate
amount of all claims raised by the Purchaser for breaches of representations
and warranties equals or surpasses CHF 2,000,000 (Swiss Francs two million),
such amount to be deducted from the Purchasers total indemnity claim under
art. 6 of this Agreement. 
---|--- 



   6.3.2 | _Maximum Amount_. Any payments of the Seller for breaches of
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement shall be limited to
a total of CHF 92,500,000 (Swiss Francs ninety two million five hundred
thousand). 
---|--- 



   6.3.3 | _Exempt Representations and Warranties_. None of the
limitations described in this article 6 shall apply to (i) the representations
and warranties set forth in articles 5.1 ( _Organization and Qualification_
), 5.2 ( _Capital Structure_ ) 5.3 ( _Ownership; Authority and Authorization_
) and the first two sentences of 5.18 ( _Warranties as to the Assets_ ) of
this Agreement or (ii) representations and warranties that are made
fraudulently. The limitation in art. 6.3.1 shall not apply to the
representations and warranties set forth in art. 5.9 ( _Taxes_ ). 
---|--- 
 



30 in respect to a claim of the Purchaser for breach of representations and
warranties:  
---|--- 



     | i. | If and to the extent that any specific provision, reserve,
accrual, or expense for the matter giving rise to the claim was taken into
account in the Interim Financial Statement for the matter; 
---|---|--- 



     | ii. | If and to the extent that the matter giving rise to a claim
is Fairly Disclosed in Writing in the Due Diligence Material; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | iii. | If and to the extent that the Purchaser or the Companies
are entitled to claim compensation of any loss or damages suffered by them
under the terms of any insurance policy or from any other third party. Such
defense may, however, be raised only if the Purchaser or the Companies are
actually compensated by the insurance company or the third party concerned
within 60 days after the claim has been notified to such insurance company or
third party. After the expiry of such 60 day deadline the Seller may not raise
such defense if the claim against the insurance company or the third party may
be validly assigned to the Seller and is so assigned to the Seller. In case
of such an assignment, the Purchaser shall grant to the Seller unrestricted
access at reasonable times to all documents, information and employees of the
Companies that are relevant for the enforcement of such claim. If such claims
cannot be validly assigned to the Seller, Purchaser shall pursue such claim
as directed by Seller in accordance with article 6.4 (third paragraph) of this
Agreement at the expense of the Seller; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | iv. | If and to the extent that any Tax for which the Purchaser or
the Companies are liable is reduced as a result of any matter giving rise to a
claim of the Purchaser under the above representations and warranties, which
amount shall be net of any costs and expenses incurred by the Purchaser in
procuring such reduction; 
---|---|--- 



     | v. | If and to the extent that any damage or loss was caused by
any act or omission of the Purchaser or by the fact that the Purchaser has
failed to take reasonable steps to mitigate the damage caused by a breach of
a representation or warranty. 
---|---|--- 



   6.4 | _Procedure with Third Parties and Authorities_. If a breach of
representations and warranties exists because any authorities or other third
parties raise claims against the Companies or if the Companies or, as the
case may be, the Purchasing Subsidiaries in connection with such a breach have
to enforce any rights or claims against authorities or other third parties,
the Seller shall have the option to negotiate and defend such claim or
proceeding at the expense of the Seller, except if (i) the aggregate amount of
the potential obligations of the Purchaser or its Associated Companies
regarding such claim or proceeding exceeds the maximum obligations of the
Seller hereunder regarding such 
---|--- 
 



31  claim or proceeding or (ii) it is reasonably likely in the case that the
claim or proceeding is lost, that the claim or proceeding will have a material
adverse effect on the Purchaser, any of the Purchasing Subsidiaries or any
Associated Company of the Purchaser, other than as a result of money damages.
To exercise the option to negotiate and defend such claim or proceeding, the
Seller must give written notice of such exercise to the Purchaser within 30
days (or within the shorter period, if any, during which a defense must be
commenced for the preservation of rights) after the Purchaser gives the notice
of such claim or proceeding to the Purchaser (otherwise, such right
to negotiate and defend such claim or proceeding shall be deemed waived). If
the Seller validly makes such election, it will nonetheless lose such right to
negotiate and defend such claim or proceeding if it fails to continue to
actively and diligently conduct such negotiation or defense.

If the Seller negotiates or defends a claim or proceeding pursuant to this
art. 6.4, then (i) the Purchaser may participate, at its own expense, in such
negotiation or defense and will have the right to receive copies of all
notices, pleadings or other similar submissions regarding such negotiation or
defense, (ii) each Party will keep the other Party reasonably informed of all
matters material to such claim or proceeding and the negotiation or defense
thereof, (iii) neither the Purchaser nor any of its Associated Companies will
admit Liability with respect to, or compromise or settle, such claim or
proceeding without the Sellers prior written consent (which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld), and (iv) there will be no compromise or settlement
of such claim or proceeding without the consent of the Purchaser (which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld).

If the Seller does not have the option to conduct the negotiation or defense
of a claim or proceeding pursuant to this art. 6.4 or does not validly
exercise or preserve such option, the Seller has the same rights as the
Purchaser has in the case described in the immediately preceding paragraph. 



   6.5 | _Materiality Qualifiers_. In determining the amount which is
necessary to establish the state of the Companies or the Business described in
any representation or warranty that is breached or to compensate any damage
directly caused by such breach, all qualifications to the representations or
warranties using the word "material" or a word derived therefrom shall be
ignored and each such representation and warranty shall be read and
interpreted without regard to any such qualification. 
---|--- 



   6.6 | _Specific Indemnities_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein or anything Fairly Disclosed in Writing in the Due Diligence Material,
the Seller shall indemnify the Purchaser and its Affiliated Companies
(including, after the Closing, the Companies) from any loss or Liability
arising from or relating to: 
---|--- 
 



     | i. | any Transaction Expenses; 
---|---|--- 



     | ii. | any guarantee of (or similar obligation to satisfy) any
Liability of any other Person (other than any of the other Companies) made or
assumed by any of the Companies;  
---|---|--- 



     | iii. | the Encumbrances described in article 8.22 of this
Agreement; 
---|---|--- 



     | iv. | the payment of Taxes for Persons other than the Companies. 
---|---|--- 
 



32 ARTICLE 7

RESIGNATIONS OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS

At the Closing Date the Seller shall remit to the Purchaser the resignation
letters of the directors and officers (or individuals occupying similar
positions) and auditors of the Companies listed in _Schedule 7_. Such
resignation letters shall contain a clause in which such directors
and officers (or individuals occupying similar positions) and auditors
confirm that they have no claims against the Companies and shall be in a form
reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser.

Immediately after the Closing Date the Purchaser shall cause each of the
Companies to hold an extraordinary shareholders meeting and to elect new
directors and auditors for the Companies at such meeting. The Purchaser
agrees and procures that complete discharge to the present directors is
granted at such meetings, except in case of willful misconduct or gross
negligence. The consent of the Purchaser to the Companies
financial statements and the discharge of the directors does not operate as a
waiver of the Purchasers claims under this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE 8

reasonable respects to allow PwC to conclude such audit as soon as possible.

Generally Accepted Auditing Standards or the requirements of the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission or the requirements of any stock exchange.

of its Associated Companies; (ii) developed by the Seller or its Associated
Companies (which, for the avoidance of doubt, does not include the Companies)

is necessary or proper to carry out any purpose of this Agreement, then each
Party shall take such further action (including the execution and delivery of

prepared and timely filed) all tax returns with respect to any of the
Companies that the Seller is not obligated to file (or cause to be filed)
pursuant to this art. 8.12. If any such tax return prepared (or caused to be

Seller is required to pay the Taxes pursuant to this art. 8.12 or if any such
tax return prepared (or caused to be prepared) by the Seller relates to any
period that is not a Pre-Closing Tax Period, then such tax return shall be
prepared in accordance with the prior practice of the Companies (except to the
extent otherwise required by Applicable Law) and in reasonable cooperation
with the Seller. Except as provided in art. 11.1, the Seller shall satisfy
(or cause to be satisfied) in full when due all income taxes with respect to
any of the Companies with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (all of such
income taxes being the "Pre-Closing Taxes") unless such Pre-Closing Taxes
have been paid by the Companies or Seller before the Closing Date. Except as
provided in art. 11.1, the Purchaser shall satisfy (or cause to be satisfied)
in full when due all Liabilities for Taxes with respect to any period that is
not a Pre-Closing Tax Period. If the Purchaser is required under this art.
8.12 to file a tax return that involves Pre-Closing Taxes, then no later than
10 Business Days before the pertinent tax payment is due, the Seller shall
pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to the amount of income taxes shown due
on such tax return for which the Seller is obligated with respect to such tax
return. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller shall only be liable to the
Purchaser for any such income taxes described in this art. 8.12 to the extent
that such income taxes exceed the amount, if any, of estimated income taxes
paid for such income taxes on or before the Closing Date.

other proceeding and to otherwise satisfy any tax requirement. 
---|---|--- 



     | iii. | In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of any
income taxes with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period will be determined based
on an interim closing of the books as of the Closing Date (and for such
purpose, the taxable year of any pass-through entity will be deemed to

the Seller a written schedule setting forth the manner in which the Parties
will allocate the Purchase Price among the Shares and the Assets (which
schedule shall be consistent with the provisions of section 1060 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations thereunder). The schedule finally determined by
the Purchaser pursuant to this paragraph is the "Allocation Schedule". After
Closing, the Purchaser and the Seller shall, and shall cause their Associated
Companies to, make consistent use of the Allocation Schedule, as adjusted to
reflect any adjustments needed to remain consistent with the resulting

Purchaser will have no obligation to purchase or cause to be purchased any
Company organized under the laws of France from the Seller or any Selling
Subsidiary as long as the consultation of the respective workers councils is
not completed. In addition, for the consultation of the workers councils to
entail all of the effects provided for by Applicable Law, the Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that the Seller will not be considered as having made
the final decision to sell or cause to be sold any Company organized under
the laws of France as long as the Seller

Closing the same as employment with such sponsor from and after the Closing
Date for purposes of eligibility and vesting and the respective Assumed

and the Closing Date, upon request of the Purchaser, the Seller shall, and
shall cause its subsidiaries to, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause

with regard to the Financing. The Financing is the sole responsibility of the
Purchaser. The Sellers and the Companies obligations, under this article

terms thereof). Prior to obtaining the applicable third party consent to an
Asset Transfer

45 the Seller or its applicable Associated Company. The Seller and its applicable
Associated Companies shall use reasonable best efforts to avoid taking any
action or suffering any omission which would limit or restrict or terminate in
any material respect the benefits to the Purchaser of such retained Asset
Transfer Contracts. With respect to any such retained Asset
Transfer Contracts as to which the necessary consent for the assignment to
the Purchaser is obtained following the Closing, the Seller or its applicable
Associated Company shall promptly transfer such retained Asset Transfer
Contracts to the Purchaser by an instrument of conveyance reasonably
satisfactory to the Purchaser.

ARTICLE 9

 

TRANSITION



   9.1 | _Names and Trademarks_. The Purchaser shall ensure that the
Companies which use the word "Forbo" in their name or trademarks change such
name or trademarks within 90 days after the Closing Date so that the word
"Forbo" does no longer appear in their name or trademarks (or the Companies
shall cease to use any such trademarks). The Companies may continue to use
product packaging, signage, stationary, sales literature and similar
documents that exist at the Closing Date and contain the name "Forbo" or any
reference to Sellers group for a period of four months after the Closing
Date. After the expiry of such period the Purchaser shall cause the Companies
to no longer use any such documents. 
---|--- 

For a period of 18 months after the Closing Date, the Purchaser and its
Associated Companies (including the Companies) may continue to use the
trademark "Eurocol" in Spain, France and Switzerland. After the Closing Date,
the Purchaser and its Associated Companies (including the Companies) may use
the trademark "Forbo" for a period of five (5) years after the Closing Date
for the "do it yourself" line of adhesives developed, manufactured, marketed
or sold by or for the Purchaser or its Associated Companies (including the
Companies) in Switzerland (the "DIY Business"). The Seller may terminate such
license earlier if the Purchaser does not comply with the Sellers branding
manual set forth in _Schedule 9.1_ (with the exception that Purchaser may co-
brand the products) and does not remedy such deficiencies within two (2)
months after having been notified by the Seller. The Purchaser may sell the
DIY Business to a third party with such license to use the trademark "Forbo"
only with the prior approval of the Seller such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld.

After the expiry of the applicable license periods, the Purchaser and its
Associated Companies (including the Companies) may no longer use the
trademarks "Eurocol" and "Forbo". 

For the avoidance of doubt, the rights to use the names and trademarks
provided in this art. 9.1 are fully paid and royalty free. At the Closing
Date, the Seller shall cease to use the trademarks set forth in _Schedule
5.11(b)_ and shall ensure that the Associated Companies of Seller cease to use
these trademarks at the Closing Date.

 



46 Associated Companies for a maximum period of twelve (12) months after the
Closing Date the services set forth in _Schedule 9.2_ at the cost and on the
terms as defined therein (the "Transition Services"). 
---|--- 

The Purchaser may terminate its obligation to pay for, and the Sellers
obligation to cause to be provided, the Transition Services before the expiry
of such twelve (12) month period by providing two (2) months prior written
notice, such notice to expire at the end of a calendar month. No compensation
is due in case of such termination or in case of the expiry of the transitory
service period after twelve (12) months. 

The Seller shall cause the Transition Services to be provided in a diligent
and prompt manner by personnel of the Seller or its Associated Companies with
appropriate knowledge to perform the applicable Transition Service in a
commercially reasonable manner. To the extent the Transition Services are
similar to services that the Seller or its Associated Companies performed for
the Business prior to the date hereof, the Seller shall cause such Transition
Services to be performed in a manner that causes the quality, speed, diligence
and proficiency thereof to be consistent with the same or similar services
provided to the Business as of the date hereof. The Seller shall comply with
any service level requirements set forth in _Schedule 9.2_. The Seller shall
(i) cause all Transition Services to be performed in compliance with
Applicable Law and (ii) maintain insurance with insurers of similar claim-
paying ability and similar coverage throughout the period during which the
Transition Services are to be performed as are in effect on the date hereof.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be considered or interpreted as constituting
a partnership or joint venture among the Parties or their Associated
Companies.



   9.3 | _Transfer of certain employees_. The Purchaser and the Seller
shall ensure that those Transferred Employees shall be transferred by
operation of Applicable Law to the applicable Purchasing Subsidiaries on the
Closing Date. As far as such automatic transfer is not possible or does not
occur automatically under Applicable Law, the Purchaser shall cause the
applicable Purchasing Subsidiaries to offer to such Transferred Employees
employment agreements or arrangements with identical notice periods to the
existing employment agreements that initially (i) pay a base wage rate or
salary identical to or greater than such Transferred Employees base wage
rate or salary in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii)
provide a cash incentive compensation opportunity identical to or greater than
such Transferred Employees cash incentive compensation opportunity in
effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, substituting performance goals
and criteria, if any, as the Purchaser may reasonably determine given the
Selling Subsidiaries cessation of ownership of the Companies and the
Business.  
---|--- 

Except for the Non-U.S. Employees, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed
to interfere with ability of the Purchaser or the Purchasing Subsidiaries to
classify any of the Transferred Employees as "at will", if such classification
is possible under Applicable Law.

 



47 The Seller shall be liable for all the claims and Liabilities arising out of
or in respect of the employment or the termination of the Transferred
Employees on or before the Closing Date and the Seller shall hold the
Purchaser harmless for any such claims and Liabilities. The Purchaser shall be
liable for all claims and Liabilities arising out of or in respect of the
employment and/or the termination of the Transferred Employees after the
Closing Date and the Purchaser shall hold the Seller harmless from any such
claims and Liabilities, save to the extent that such claims and Liabilities
are caused by the actions or omissions of the Seller or its Associated
Companies or to the extent the Purchaser is entitled to indemnification
hereunder.



   9.4 | _Insurance_. The Purchaser is aware of the fact that the
insurance policies listed in _Schedule 9.4_ will automatically be terminated
on the Closing Date. Purchaser shall ensure that the Purchasing Subsidiaries
take out insurance coverage to cover these risks after the Closing Date on a
claims-made basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller or an Associated
Company of the Seller shall, with respect to any incident from which a
Liability of any of the Companies arises, or that relates to any damage to or
impairment of any Asset or asset of any of the Companies, that is potentially
covered by an insurance policy maintained by the Seller or any of its
Associated Companies (other than any of the Companies) on or prior to the
Closing Date, (i) report such incident to the appropriate insurer as promptly
as practicable and in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the applicable policy after the Seller receives notice or becomes aware of
such incident, (ii) provide the Purchaser copies of all material
correspondence and other documents relating to such incident and (iii)
instruct the appropriate insurer to pay any proceeds with respect to such
claim directly to the injured party in settlement of any claims relating to
such incident. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such proceeds are
received by the Seller or any of its Associated Companies, the Seller shall,
or shall cause its applicable Associated Company to, pay such proceeds to the
Purchaser or an Associated Company of the Purchaser designated by the
Purchaser. The Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Associated Companies
to, reasonably cooperate in the investigation and pursuit of any claim
pursuant to this art. 9.4, and the Purchaser may, at its own expense,
participate in the investigation or pursuit of any such claim. The Seller
shall, and shall cause its Associated Companies, not to compromise or settle
any claim pursuant to this art. 9.4 without the Purchasers prior written
consent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld). The Purchaser shall
promptly pay all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Seller or
its Associated Companies in connection with the investigation, pursuit or
settlement of any claim pursuant to this art. 9.4.

   9.5 | _Software._ The Purchaser is aware that the software licenses
listed in _Schedule 9.5_ expire at the Closing Date. The Purchaser at its
own expense and at its own discretion will contract for such new software
licenses.

   9.6 | _Special sales bonuses._ The Purchaser is aware of the fact that
the Seller has granted to certain managers of the Companies special bonuses in
connection with the sale of the Business as described in _Schedule 9.6_. The
Seller shall pay such bonuses directly to the pertinent managers. If required
by Applicable Law the Purchaser and the Purchasing Companies shall pay any
social insurance contributions or payroll taxes levied on such payments. The
Seller shall promptly (and in no event later than five (5) Business Days after
the Purchasers request therefore) reimburse to the Purchaser any social
insurance contribution or payroll taxes the Purchaser or the Purchasing
Subsidiaries have paid with respect to such bonus payments and shall hold the
Purchaser harmless from any claims of the managers with regard to such bonus
payments.

in any forum other than the federal and New York State courts located in the
City of New York, Borough of Manhattan (and appellate courts thereof), United

brought against the Seller by the Purchaser or by a Financing Source.

law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise and Seller (on behalf of
itself, its subsidiaries and any of their respective stockholders, partners,
members, affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives) agrees not to commence any action or proceeding against any
Debt Financing Source in connection with this Agreement or the

relating to any Financing, the Financing Commitments or other financings in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby) and agrees to cause any
such action or proceeding asserted by the Seller (on behalf of itself, its
subsidiaries and any of their respective stockholders, partners, members,
affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives) in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder
(including any action or proceeding relating to the Financing, the Financing
Commitments or other financings in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby) to be dismissed or otherwise terminated. In furtherance
and not in limitation of the foregoing waiver, it is acknowledged and agreed
that no Debt Financing Source shall have any liability for any 
---|--- 
 



52 expenses, fines or penalties of the Seller or its subsidiaries (or any
liabilities, damages, costs, expenses, fines or penalties to the Seller or
its subsidiaries) in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. Nothing in this art. 12.4 shall in any way expand or be
deemed or construed to expand the circumstances in which the Purchaser may be
liable under this Agreement (including as a result of the Financing or other
financings in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby).
