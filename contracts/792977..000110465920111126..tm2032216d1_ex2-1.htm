commercially sensitive economic terms and &ldquo;market flex&rdquo; provisions, none of which (x) impose or permit the
imposition of any different or additional conditions, or expand or modify or permit the expansion or modification of any of
the existing conditions, to the consummation of the Debt Financing or (y) would or would reasonably be expected to reduce the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing available to Parent, Merger Sub or the Debt Financing Borrower at the Offer Closing or
the Closing below the amount necessary to fund the Required Amount (after taking into account the Equity Financing and any

Debt Financing at the Offer Closing and the Closing necessary to fund the Required Amount (after taking into account the
Equity Financing), may have been redacted to the extent required by the Debt Commitment Letter. Assuming (i) the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions expressly set forth herein to Parent&rsquo;s and Merger Sub&rsquo;s obligations to consummate the
Offer and the Merger and (ii) that the Financing is funded or invested at the Offer Closing and the Closing in accordance
with the Debt Commitment Letter and the Equity Commitment Letter, as applicable, Parent will have, and will cause Merger Sub
to have, at the Offer Closing and the Closing (as applicable), the funds necessary (both before and after giving effect to
any exercise of &ldquo;market flex&rdquo;) to (x) consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions, including
payment in cash of the aggregate Offer Price at the Offer Closing and the aggregate Merger Consideration at the Closing, (y)
make the payments pursuant to <U>Section 3.7</U> and (z) pay all related fees, discounts and expenses (collectively, the
&ldquo;<B>Required Amount</B>&rdquo;). The only conditions precedent related to the obligations of the Guarantors to fund the
full amount of the Equity Financing and the Debt Financing Sources to fund the full amount of the Debt Financing are those
expressly set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter, respectively. The Commitment Letters are
(x) legal, valid and binding obligations of the Debt Financing Borrower and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each of the other
parties thereto, (y) enforceable in accordance with their respective terms against the Debt Financing Borrower and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto, in each case except as such enforceability (i) may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws affecting or relating to the
enforcement of creditors&rsquo; rights generally and (ii) is subject to general principles of equity, and (z) as of the date
of this Agreement, in full force and effect (except that such enforceability (i) may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws of general application affecting or relating to the
enforcement of creditors&rsquo; rights generally and (ii) is subject to general principles of equity). As of the date hereof,
the commitments and agreements contemplated by each Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn, terminated, repudiated,
rescinded, supplemented or otherwise amended or modified in any respect, no terms thereunder have been waived, and no such
withdrawal, termination, repudiation, rescission, supplement, amendment, modification or waiver is contemplated (other than
to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or other similar entities who had not executed the Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date hereof). As of the date hereof, neither Parent, the Debt Financing Borrower nor, to the
Knowledge of Parent, any Debt Financing Source named therein, is in breach of any of the terms or conditions set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing Fee Letter, and no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach under the Debt Commitment Letter on the
part of Parent, the Debt Financing Borrower or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any Debt Financing Source named therein. The
Commitment Letters and the Debt Financing Fee Letter constitute the entire and complete agreement among the parties thereto
with respect to the transactions contemplated thereby and the financing for the Transactions, and, except as expressly set
forth in each Commitment Letter, (i) there are no conditions precedent to the obligation of the Financing Sources to fund the
Financing in an amount necessary to fund the Required Amount, and (ii) there are no side letters or contracts to which
Parent, the Debt Financing Borrower or Merger Sub is a party relating to the Transactions that would permit the Financing
Sources to reduce the total amount of the Financing below the amount necessary to fund the Required Amount or impose any
different or additional conditions, or expand or modify any of the existing conditions, to the availability of all or any
portion of the Financing necessary to fund the Required Amount. Parent and the Debt Financing Borrower have fully paid any
and all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid in connection with the Financing on or prior to the date hereof. As
of the date hereof, assuming the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Parent&rsquo;s and Merger Sub&rsquo;s
obligations to consummate the Offer and the Merger, Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to
the Financing will not be satisfied or that the full amount of the Financing necessary to fund the Required Amount (after
taking into account available cash of Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries) will not be made available to
Parent at the Offer Closing and the Closing (as applicable) in order to consummate the Transactions.</P>

Parent, Merger Sub and the Debt Financing Borrower shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the Financing on the
terms and subject only to the conditions set forth in the Commitment Letters, including using reasonable best efforts to (i)
maintain in full force and effect the Commitment Letters, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis and in any event no later than the
Closing Date all conditions applicable to Parent, Merger Sub and the Debt Financing Borrower under the Debt Commitment
Letter, (iii) comply at all times with its obligations under the Commitment Letters to the extent constituting a condition to
the availability of funds thereunder, (iv) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing
on the terms and subject only to the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (or on other terms that, with respect
to conditionality, are no less favorable to Parent, Merger or the Debt Financing Borrower than the terms contained in the
Debt Commitment Letter), (v) enforce its rights under the Commitment Letters and (vi) consummate the Debt Financing at or
prior to the Closing Date. Upon the reasonable written request of the Company (or its counsel), Parent shall promptly (and in
any event within two (2) Business Days following such written request) inform the Company and its counsel in reasonable
detail of the current status of the Debt Financing and the status of Parent&rsquo;s efforts to obtain the Debt Financing.
Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day following becoming aware
thereof) notify the Company in writing if at any time prior to the Closing Date Parent becomes aware of (A) any breach or
default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be
expected to give rise to any breach or default) by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter of which Parent becomes aware that
would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in Debt Financing in the amount necessary to fund the Required Amount
(after taking into account the Equity Financing) not being available at Closing, (B) the receipt, on or prior to the Closing
Date, of any written notice or other written communication from any Debt Financing Source with respect to any actual breach,
default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter that would, or would reasonably be expected
to, result in Debt Financing in the amount necessary to fund the Required Amount (after taking into account the Equity
Financing) not being available at Closing or (C) if for any reason Parent believes in good faith that Parent or the Debt
Financing Borrower will not be able to obtain on or prior to the Closing Date all or any portion of the Debt Financing in the
amount necessary to fund the Required Amount (after taking into account the Equity Financing and any available cash of
Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries). Upon the reasonable written request of the Company, Parent shall
promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days following such written request) provide any information reasonably
requested by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to in clauses (A), (B) or (C) of the immediately preceding
sentence. Parent, Merger Sub and the Debt Financing Borrower shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company,
agree to or permit any termination of or amendment, restatement, amendment and restatement, supplement or modification to be
made to the Commitment Letters (other than to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or other similar
entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof)- if such termination, amendment, restatement,
amendment and restatement, supplement, modification or waiver would (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing such
that the aggregate amount of the Financing would be below the amount required to pay the Required Amount (after taking into
account available cash of Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries), (B) impose new or additional conditions
precedent to the availability of the Financing or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions precedent to the
Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the funding of the Financing (or
satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing) at the Offer Closing and at the Closing or (C) adversely impact the ability
of Parent, Merger Sub and the Debt Financing Borrower to enforce its rights against other parties to the Commitment Letters.
Parent shall promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days following receipt) deliver to the Company copies of any
amendment, restatement, amendment and restatement, replacement, supplement or other modification to, or waiver of any
provision under, the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing Fee Letter. In the event that the Debt Financing necessary
to fund the Required Amount (after taking into account the Equity Financing and any available cash of Parent, the Company and
their respective Subsidiaries) will not be available to Parent and the Debt Financing Borrower in accordance with the terms
of the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent shall promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day following the occurrence
thereof) notify the Company in writing and, prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with <U>Article 8</U>
hereto, use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to arrange, obtain and consummate as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of any
such financing failure event, alternative debt financing (the &ldquo;<B>Alternative Financing</B>&rdquo;), including from
alternative sources in an amount sufficient to fund the Required Amount (after taking into account the Equity Financing and
any available cash of Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries) as promptly as possible following the occurrence
of such event, which Alternate Financing will not include terms and conditions that are less favorable to Parent or the Debt
Financing Borrower than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and Debt Financing Fee Letter (determined after giving
effect to all amendments and other modifications permitted pursuant to the &ldquo;market flex&rdquo; provisions of the Debt
Financing Fee Letter as if such amendments and other modifications had been implemented to the maximum extent permitted
thereunder). It is understood and agreed that (i) if Parent is required to proceed with any Alternative Financing, Parent
shall be subject to the same obligations with respect to such Alternative Financing as set forth in this Agreement with
respect to the Debt Financing and (ii) such Alternative Financing shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Company, (A) be less than the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing necessary to fund the Required Amount (after taking into
account the Equity Financing and any available cash of Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries) (determined
after giving effect to all amendments and other modifications permitted pursuant to the &ldquo;market flex&rdquo; provisions
of the Debt Financing Fee Letter as if such amendments and other modifications had been implemented to the maximum extent
permitted thereunder), (B) impose new or additional conditions to the consummation of the Debt Financing other than those
expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter delivered on the date hereof or otherwise expand any of the conditions to
the consummation of the Debt Financing set forth therein or (C) otherwise expand, amend or modify any provision applicable
under the Debt Commitment Letter in a manner that would not be permitted pursuant to Section 6.14(a). In the event that
Alternative Financing is obtained, Parent shall promptly provide the Company with a copy of the new financing commitment that
provides for such Alternative Financing (the &ldquo;<B>Alternative Financing Commitment Letter</B>&rdquo;). If applicable,
any reference in this Agreement to &ldquo;Debt Financing&rdquo; shall include &ldquo;Alternative Financing&rdquo;, any
reference to &ldquo;Debt Commitment Letter&rdquo; shall include the &ldquo;Alternative Financing Commitment Letter&rdquo; and
any references to &ldquo;Debt Financing Documents&rdquo; shall include the definitive documentation relating to any such
Alternative Financing.</P>

in connection with this Agreement or otherwise, of the Parent Related Parties collectively (including monetary damages for
breach, whether willful, intentional, unintentional or otherwise) (i) under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document,
(ii) in connection with the failure of the Offer, Merger or the other Transactions to be consummated, or (iii) in respect of
any representation or warranty made or alleged to have been made in connection with this Agreement or any other Transaction
Documents, will not exceed under any circumstances an amount equal to (x) the Parent Termination Fee , plus (y) the amounts,
if any, due and owing under <U>Section 6.12(d)</U>, <U>Section 6.15(c) </U>and <U>Section 8.3(d)</U>, plus (z) the
reimbursement of any other expenses explicitly required pursuant to this Agreement (collectively, the &ldquo;<B>Maximum
Liability Amount</B>&rdquo;), and in no event will the Company, its Affiliates or any of the Company Representatives seek,
directly or indirectly, to recover against the Parent Related Parties, or compel payment by the Parent Related Parties of,
any damages or other payments whatsoever (including multiple, consequential, indirect, special, statutory, exemplary or
punitive damages) in excess of the Maximum Liability Amount set forth in this <U>Section 8.3(c)</U>. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this <U>Section 8.3(c)</U> limits the Company&rsquo;s right to pursue specific performance as provided in
(but subject to the limitations of) <U>Section 9.12</U>.</P>
