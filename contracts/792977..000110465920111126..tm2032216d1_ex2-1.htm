19

 



    



  

(b)  To the extent required by the applicable requirements of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, (i) each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect, and (ii) the Company shall
take all steps necessary to promptly cause the Schedule 14D-9, as
supplemented or amended to correct such information, to be filed with the SEC
and, subject to the final sentence of this _Section 2.3(b)_ , to be
disseminated to holders of Company Common Stock. Parent and Merger Sub shall
promptly furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent or Merger
Sub that may be reasonably requested by the Company in connection with any
action contemplated by this _Section 2.3(b)_. To the extent requested by the
Company, Parent shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 and any supplement or
amendment thereto to be mailed or otherwise disseminated to the holders of
Company Common Stock together with the Offer Documents disseminated to the
holders of Company Common Stock.

  



  

(c)  Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall,
except as permitted by _Section 2.3(d)_ or _Section 6.2_ : (i) withdraw,
modify, amend or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent and Merger Sub, the
Company Board Recommendation; (ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable
any Acquisition Proposal; (iii) publicly propose or announce any intention to
take any of the foregoing actions (any action described in clause (i), (ii)
or clause (iii) being referred to as a "Change in Recommendation"); or (iv)
cause the Company to enter into any contract (other than a confidentiality
agreement entered into in compliance with _Section 6.2(a)_ ) contemplating an
Acquisition Proposal (any such contract, an "Alternative Acquisition
Agreement").

  



  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board may:

  



  

(i)  make a Change in Recommendation in response to an
Acquisition Proposal and/or cause the Company to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement concerning an Acquisition Proposal if: (A) such
Acquisition Proposal did not result from a material breach of _Section
6.2(a)_ ; (B) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good
faith (1) after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel and
financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal would constitute a
Superior Proposal and (2) after consultation with the Company's outside legal
counsel, that in light of such Acquisition Proposal, a failure to make a
Change in Recommendation and/or to cause the Company to enter into such
Alternative Acquisition Agreement would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary obligations to the Company's
stockholders under applicable Law; (C) the Company delivers to Parent a
written notice (the "Superior Proposal Notice") stating that the Company
Board intends to take such action and (in the event the Company Board
contemplates causing the Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement) including a summary of the material terms and conditions of such
Alternative Acquisition Agreement; (D) during the three (3) Business Day
period commencing on the date of Parent's receipt of such Superior Proposal
Notice, the Company shall have negotiated in good faith and have made its
representatives reasonably available for the purpose of engaging in
negotiations with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) regarding
a possible amendment of this Agreement or the Offer or a possible alternative
transaction so that the Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of
the Superior Proposal Notice ceases to be a Superior Proposal; (E) after the
expiration of the negotiation period described in clause (D) above, the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) shall have determined in good faith,
after taking into account any amendments to this Agreement and the Offer that
Parent and Merger Sub have irrevocably agreed in writing to make as a result
of the negotiations contemplated by clause (D) above, that (1) after
consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel and financial
advisor, such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, and (2)
after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel, the failure to
make a Change in Recommendation and/or enter into such Alternative Acquisition
Agreement would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company
Board's fiduciary obligations to the Company's stockholders under applicable
Law; and (F) if the Company enters into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
concerning such Superior Proposal, the Company terminates this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 8.1(f)_ ; _provided, however_ , that, in the event of
any material amendment to the terms of any Superior Proposal, the Company
shall deliver an additional Superior Proposal Notice and comply again
with clauses (C) through (E) of this _Section 2.3(d)(i)_ ; or

  



  

   

20

 



    



  

(ii)  make a Change in Recommendation not related to an
Acquisition Proposal if: (A) any material change in circumstances arises
affecting the Company that does not relate to any Acquisition Proposal and was
not known or reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board prior to the date
hereof (or if known or reasonably foreseeable, the material consequences of
which were not known) (any such change in circumstances unrelated to an
Acquisition Proposal being referred to as a "Change in Circumstances"); (B)
the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Change in
Circumstances, a failure to effect a Change in Recommendation would be
inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties to the Company's
stockholders under applicable Law; (C) such Change in Recommendation is not
effected prior to the fourth (4th) Business Day after Parent receives written
notice (the "Change in Circumstances Notice") from the Company confirming
that the Company Board intends to effect such Change in Recommendation and
specifying in reasonable detail the reasons therefor; (D) during such four
(4) Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the Company engages in good
faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement or the Offer or enter
into an alternative transaction; and (E) at the end of such four (4) Business
Day period, the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and after taking
into account any amendments to this Agreement and the Offer that Parent and
Merger Sub have irrevocably agreed in writing to make as a result of the
negotiations contemplated by clause (D) above, that, in light of such Change
in Circumstances, a failure to effect a Change in Recommendation would be
inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties to the Company's
stockholders under applicable Law; _provided, however,_ that after compliance
with clauses (C) through (E) of this _Section 2.3(d)(ii)_ with respect to
any Change in Circumstances, the Company shall have no further obligations
under clauses (C) through (E) of this _Section 2.3(d)(ii)_.

(e)  In connection with the Offer, the Company shall instruct
its transfer agent to furnish to Merger Sub a list, as of a recent date, of
the record holders of Company Common Stock and their addresses, as well as
mailing labels containing such names and addresses (the date of the list used
to determine the Persons to whom the Offer Documents and Schedule 14D-9 are
first disseminated, the "Stockholder List Date"). The Company will furnish
Merger Sub with such additional information (including any security position
listings in the Company's possession) and assistance as Merger Sub may
reasonably request for purposes of communicating the Offer to the holders of
Company Common Stock. All information furnished in accordance with this
_Section 2.3(e)_ shall be held in confidence by Parent and Merger Sub (and
their agents) in accordance with the requirements of the
Confidentiality Agreement, and shall be used by Parent and Merger Sub (and
their agents) only in connection with the communication of the Offer to the
holders of Company Common Stock. If this Agreement is terminated, Parent and
Merger Sub shall deliver, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause their agents to deliver, to the Company (or destroy, at the Company's
election) all copies and any extracts or summaries from such information
furnished in accordance with this _Section 2.3(e)_ then in their possession
or control.

(a)  Subject to _Section 3.8_ , at the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or any holder of Company Common Stock:

  



  

(i)  Each share of Company Common Stock (other than shares of
Company Common Stock (a) held in the treasury of the Company, (b) that at the
commencement of the Offer were owned by Parent or Merger Sub, or (c)
irrevocably accepted for payment in the Offer (collectively, the "Excluded

cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a "Company Stock
Certificate") formerly representing any of such shares (other than Excluded
Shares) and each non-certificated share represented by book entry (a "Book

23

loss in lieu of the Company Stock Certificate pursuant to _Section 3.6(d)_ ),
together with a properly executed letter of transmittal, the holder of such
Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share (or, under the circumstances
described in _Section 3.6(d)_ , the transferee of the Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share)
shall promptly receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each
share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Company Stock
Certificate or Book Entry Share pursuant to _Section 3.5_. Exchange of any
Book Entry Shares shall be effected in accordance with the Paying Agent's
customary procedures with respect to securities represented by book entry.

lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate the cash amount
payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

(e)  In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common
Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment
may be made with respect to such Company Common Stock to a transferee of such
Company Common Stock if the Company Stock Certificate (if applicable)
previously representing such Company Common Stock is presented to the Paying
Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent
to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes relating to such transfer have been paid.

respective Affiliates, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause the
Paying Agent to deduct and withhold) from the Merger Consideration payable to
any holder of shares of Company Common Stock, such amounts in respect of
Taxes as it is required by applicable Law to deduct and withhold. To the
extent that any such amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of Company Common
Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, each Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the

automatically converted into the right to receive for each share of Company
Common Stock underlying such Company PRSU that would vest at the higher of
(i) 100% target performance level, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which shall be the number of calendar days from the first day of the
Company PRSU's performance measurement period to the Expiration Date and the
denominator of which shall be the number of days in the Company PRSU's
performance measurement period, or (ii) the actual level of achievement of
performance goals, calculated from the first day of the Company PRSU's
performance measurement period through the end of the calendar month
immediately preceding the Expiration Date, without interest and subject to

26

 



    



  

(d)   _General_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take any and all such actions as are necessary (under the Company Equity

(a)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, any shares of Company Common Stock that constitute Appraisal
Shares shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled only to
receive such consideration as is determined to be due with respect to such
Appraisal Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. From and after the
Effective Time, a holder of Appraisal Shares shall not have and shall not be
entitled to exercise any of the voting rights or other rights of a
stockholder of the Surviving Corporation. If any holder of Appraisal Shares

holder to be paid such consideration as is determined to be due pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease, and (ii) such Appraisal Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into and have become
exchangeable only for the right to receive (upon the surrender of the Company

the amount of any withholding that is required under applicable Tax Law, in
accordance with _Section 3.5_.

Debt Financing available to Parent, Merger Sub or the Debt Financing Borrower
at the Offer Closing or the Closing below the amount necessary to fund the
Required Amount (after taking into account the Equity Financing and
any available cash of Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries)
or affect the availability of the full amount of the Debt Financing at the
Offer Closing and the Closing necessary to fund the Required Amount (after
taking into account the Equity Financing), may have been redacted to the
extent required by the Debt Commitment Letter. Assuming (i) the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions expressly set forth herein to
Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations to consummate the Offer and the Merger
and (ii) that the Financing is funded or invested at the Offer Closing and the
Closing in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter and the Equity
Commitment Letter, as applicable, Parent will have, and will cause Merger
Sub to have, at the Offer Closing and the Closing (as applicable), the funds
necessary (both before and after giving effect to any exercise of "market
flex") to (x) consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions,
including payment in cash of the aggregate Offer Price at the Offer Closing
and the aggregate Merger Consideration at the Closing, (y) make the payments
pursuant to _Section 3.7_ and (z) pay all related fees, discounts and expenses
(collectively, the "Required Amount"). The only conditions precedent related
to the obligations of the Guarantors to fund the full amount of the Equity
Financing and the Debt Financing Sources to fund the full amount of the Debt
Financing are those expressly set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter and
the Debt Commitment Letter, respectively. The Commitment Letters are (x)
legal, valid and binding obligations of the Debt Financing Borrower and, to
the Knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto, (y) enforceable
in accordance with their respective terms against the Debt Financing Borrower
and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto, in each
case except as such enforceability (i) may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar
Laws affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors' rights generally
and (ii) is subject to general principles of equity, and (z) as of the
date of this Agreement, in full force and effect (except that such
enforceability (i) may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws of general
application affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors' rights
generally and (ii) is subject to general principles of equity). As of the date
hereof, the commitments and agreements contemplated by each Commitment Letter
have not been withdrawn, terminated, repudiated, rescinded, supplemented or
otherwise amended or modified in any respect, no terms thereunder have been
waived, and no such withdrawal, termination, repudiation, rescission,
supplement, amendment, modification or waiver is contemplated (other than to
add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or other similar
entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date
hereof). As of the date hereof, neither Parent, the Debt Financing Borrower
nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, any Debt Financing Source named therein, is
in breach of any of the terms or conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter or the Debt Financing Fee Letter, and no event has occurred that, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be
expected to constitute a default or breach under the Debt Commitment Letter on
the part of Parent, the Debt Financing Borrower or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, any Debt Financing Source named therein. The Commitment Letters and
the Debt Financing Fee Letter constitute the entire and complete agreement
among the parties thereto with respect to the transactions contemplated
thereby and the financing for the Transactions, and, except as expressly
set forth in each Commitment Letter, (i) there are no conditions precedent to
the obligation of the Financing Sources to fund the Financing in an amount
necessary to fund the Required Amount, and (ii) there are no side letters or
contracts to which Parent, the Debt Financing Borrower or Merger Sub is a
party relating to the Transactions that would permit the Financing Sources to
reduce the total amount of the Financing below the amount necessary to fund
the Required Amount or impose any different or additional conditions, or
expand or modify any of the existing conditions, to the availability of all or
any portion of the Financing necessary to fund the Required Amount. Parent
and the Debt Financing Borrower have fully paid any and all commitment fees
or other fees required to be paid in connection with the Financing on or prior
to the date hereof. As of the date hereof, assuming the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions to Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations to
consummate the Offer and the Merger, Parent does not have any reason to
believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied or
that the full amount of the Financing necessary to fund the Required Amount
(after taking into account available cash of Parent, the Company and their
respective Subsidiaries) will not be made available to Parent at the Offer
Closing and the Closing (as applicable) in order to consummate the
Transactions.

  



  

   

47

 



    



  

(b)  Without limiting _Section 9.10_ , in no event shall the
receipt or availability of any funds or financing by or to Parent, Merger Sub
or any of their respective Affiliates or any other financing transaction be a
condition to any of the obligations of Parent or Merger Sub hereunder.

  



  

Section 5.7.   _Offer Documents_. The Offer Documents will comply as
to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act.
On the date filed with the SEC, on the date first published, sent or given to
the Company's stockholders and at all other times at or prior to the
Acceptance Time, the Offer Documents will not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that no
representation is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to any
information supplied in writing by the Company specifically for inclusion in
the Offer Documents.

  



  

Section 5.8.   _Information in Schedule 14D-9_. None of the
information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of Parent for
inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9 will, at the time the Schedule 14D-9 is filed
with the SEC, at the time the Schedule 14D-9 is mailed to the stockholders of
the Company, or at any other time at or prior to the Acceptance Time, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading.

  



  

Section 5.9.   _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker is
entitled to any brokerage, finder's or other fee or commission in connection
with this Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for which the
Acquired Companies could be liable.

  



  

Section 5.10.   _Merger Sub_. As of the date hereof, the authorized
capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, all of which shares are validly issued and outstanding.
All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the
Effective Time will be, owned by Parent. Merger Sub was formed solely for the
purpose of engaging in the Transactions, and, prior to the Effective Time,
Merger Sub will have engaged in no business and have no liabilities or
obligations other than in connection with the Transactions. There are no
actions pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, including Merger Sub, that would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

  



  

Section 5.11.   _Stockholder, Labor and Employee Matters_. As of the date
hereof, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has, directly or indirectly: (a)
entered into any employment agreement, or made or entered into any formal or
informal arrangements or other understandings (whether or not binding), with
any of the Company's stockholders, directors, officers or employees (in their
capacity as such), or any other Contract with such Persons relating to this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Transactions; (b)
offered employment to any of the Company's stockholders, directors, officers
or employees; (c) had discussions with any of the Company's stockholders,
directors, officers or employees regarding the future terms of their
employment after the Closing; or (d) sold, or offered to sell, any direct or
indirect equity interest in the Company, Parent or any of its Affiliates to
any of the Company's stockholders, directors, officers or employees.

  



  

   

48

 



    



  

Section 5.12.   _Competing Businesses_. None of Parent or any of its
Affiliates owns any interest in any Person that (a) derives a portion of its
revenues from products or (b) is developing products, technologies,
intellectual property or other know-how in the same product markets in which
the Acquired Companies operate (including the development of products,
medicines, therapies, devices, and scientific technologies to treat, remedy,
modify, correct, or otherwise address the health of patients in the areas of
hematology and maternal and women's health), that would reasonably be expected
to have an adverse effect on the ability of Parent to consummate the
Transactions in a timely manner in accordance with the terms hereof.

  



  

Section 5.13.   _Limited Guarantee; Solvency_. Concurrently with the
execution of this Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company the duly
executed limited guarantee of the Guarantors, dated as of the date of this
Agreement, in favor of the Company in respect of Parent's obligation to pay
the Parent Termination Fee and the other obligations specified therein, up to
the aggregate amount set forth therein (the "Limited Guarantee"). The Limited
Guarantee is (a) a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Guarantors, (b)
enforceable against the Guarantors in accordance with its terms, except as
such enforcement may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights, and by general
equitable principles, and (c) in full force and effect. No event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would
reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of the
Guarantors under the Limited Guarantee. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is
entering into this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud
either their present or future creditors. Assuming satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions to Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations to consummate the
Offer and the Merger, the accuracy in all material respects of the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in _Article 4_ , then
the Debt Financing Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis,
will be Solvent as of the Offer Closing and the Closing and immediately after
giving effect to all of the Transactions, including the payment of the
Required Amount.

this _Section 6.2_ , if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel and financial
advisor, that (i) such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior
Proposal or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and
(ii) the failure to take the actions set forth in clauses (x), (y) and/or (z)
below with respect to such Acquisition Proposal would be inconsistent with
the Company Board's fiduciary obligations to the Company's stockholders, then
(x) the Company and its representatives may engage in discussions or
negotiations with the Third Party that has made such Acquisition Proposal
(and such Third Party's representatives), (y) if such Third Party executes or
has executed an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, the Company may provide
such Person (and such Person's representatives) with information concerning
the Company and its Subsidiaries and/or (z) the Company may decline to

public information to any such Third Party, the Company shall make such
material non-public information available to Parent (to the extent such
material non-public information has not been previously made available by the
Company to Parent or Parent's representatives).

  



  

(c) The Company shall, and shall direct and use reasonable
efforts to cause all Company Representatives to, immediately cease and cause
to be terminated any existing solicitation of, or discussions or negotiations
with, any Third Party relating to any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition

Acquisition Inquiry (unless such disclosure is prohibited by the terms of
a confidentiality agreement with such Third Party in effect on September 10,
2020), and (ii) the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry (including copies of any material documents
relating thereto (or reasonable summaries thereof if providing copies thereof
is prohibited by the terms of a confidentiality agreement with such Third
Party in effect on September 10, 2020), and shall thereafter keep Parent
reasonably informed of any material change to the terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry.

  



  

(e)  Nothing contained in this _Section 6.2_ or elsewhere in
this Agreement shall prohibit the Company, the Company Board (or any
committee thereof) or their representatives from: (i) taking and disclosing to

promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange
Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure
of its position thereunder (or any substantially similar communication);
_provided_ that any such disclosure does not contain an express Change in
Recommendation; (ii) disclosing to the Company's stockholders any factual
information regarding the business, financial condition or results of
operations of the Company or the fact that an Acquisition Proposal has been
made, the identity of the party making such Acquisition Proposal or the
material terms of such Acquisition Proposal (and no such disclosure shall,
taken by itself, be deemed to be a Change in Recommendation); or (iii)
communicating with any Person (or the representatives of such Person) that
makes any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry to the extent necessary
to direct such Person to the provisions of this _Section 6.2_ and/or to
clarify and understand the terms and conditions of an Acquisition Proposal
made by such Person; _provided, however_ , that the Company Board shall not
make any Change in Recommendation except in accordance with _Section 2.3(d)_.

  



  

Section 6.3.   _Filings; Other Action_.

  



  

(a) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall: (i)
promptly (and, with respect to any filings under the HSR Act, in no
event later than the date that is five (5) Business Days after the date
hereof) use reasonable best efforts to make and effect all registrations,
filings and submissions required to be made or effected by it or otherwise
advisable pursuant to the HSR Act, any other applicable Antitrust Laws, the
Exchange Act and other applicable Law with respect to the Offer and the
Merger; (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all other consents
and approvals required from Third Parties in connection with the
Transactions; and (iii) use reasonable best efforts to cause to be taken, on a
timely basis, all other actions necessary or appropriate for the purpose of
consummating and effectuating the Transactions; _provided, however_ , that in
no event shall the Company be required to pay, prior to the Effective Time,
any fee, penalty or other consideration to any Person for any consent or
approval required for the consummation of any of the Transactions. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub (A)
shall promptly use its best efforts to provide all information requested by
any Governmental Entity in connection with the Offer, the Merger or any of
the other Transactions and (B) shall use its reasonable best efforts to
promptly take, and to cause its Affiliates to take, all actions and steps
necessary to obtain and secure the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act or any other applicable
Antitrust Laws and obtain any clearance or approval required to be obtained
from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, or
any other Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions as soon as
possible, but in any event no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the
End Date.

  



  

   

54

 



    



  



   



  

(b)  Without limiting the generality of anything contained in
_Section 6.3(a)_ , subject to applicable Law, each party hereto shall: (i)
give the other parties prompt written notice of the making or commencement of
any request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding by or before
any Governmental Entity with respect to the Offer or the Merger or any of the
other Transactions; (ii) keep the other parties informed as to the status of
any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding; and
(iii) promptly inform the other parties of any communication to or from the
U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice or any other
Governmental Entity regarding the Offer or the Merger. Each party hereto will
consult and cooperate with the other parties and will consider in good faith
the views of the other parties in connection with any analysis, appearance,
presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or
submitted in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action
or Legal Proceeding. In addition, except as may be prohibited by any
Governmental Entity or by any Law, in connection with any such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, each party hereto will
permit authorized representatives of the other parties to be present at each
meeting or conference relating to such request, inquiry, investigation, action
or Legal Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with
any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental
Entity in connection with such request, inquiry, investigation, action or
Legal Proceeding.

  



  

(c)  Subject to the timing deadlines referenced above in
_Section 6.3(a)_ , in the event that any litigation or other administrative
or judicial action or Legal Proceeding is commenced challenging the Offer or
the Merger or any of the other Transactions and such litigation, action or
Legal Proceeding seeks, or would reasonably be expected to seek, to prevent
the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or the other Transactions, Parent
and Merger Sub shall take any and all reasonable actions to resolve any such
litigation, action or Legal Proceeding and each of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub shall cooperate with each other and use its respective reasonable
best efforts to contest any such litigation, action or Legal Proceeding and to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction
or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is
in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Offer
or the Merger or the other Transactions.

  



  

(d) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall, nor shall they permit
their Subsidiaries or direct or indirect related parent companies to, acquire
or agree to acquire any rights, interests, assets, business, Person or
division thereof (through acquisition, license, joint venture, collaboration
or otherwise), if such acquisition would reasonably be expected to increase
the risk of not obtaining any applicable clearance, consent, approval or
waiver under Antitrust Laws with respect to the Offer or the Merger or the
other Transactions or otherwise not complying with the requirements of this
Section.

Section 6.4.   _Access_. Upon reasonable advance written notice, the
Company shall afford Parent's representatives reasonable access, during
normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to
the Acquired Companies' books and records and, during such period, the
Company shall, and shall instruct any Company Representatives to, furnish
promptly to Parent all readily available information concerning its business
as Parent may reasonably request; _provided, however_ , that the Acquired
Companies shall not be required to permit any inspection or other access, or
to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of the Company
could: (a) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of Third Parties; (b)
violate any obligation of the Acquired Companies with respect to
confidentiality, non-disclosure or privacy; (c) jeopardize protections
afforded to any of the Acquired Companies under the attorney-client privilege
or the attorney work product doctrine; (d) violate any Law; or (e) materially
interfere with the conduct of the Acquired Companies' business; and _provided
further_ that any such access shall be afforded and any such information
shall be furnished at Parent's expense. No investigation pursuant to this 
_Section 6.4_ shall affect any representation or warranty in this Agreement of
any party hereto or any condition to the obligations of the parties hereto.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent and Merger Sub shall
not, and shall cause their respective representatives not to, contact any
partner, licensor, licensee, customer or supplier of the Company in connection
with the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions without the
Company's prior written consent, and Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and
agree that any such contact shall be arranged by and with a representative of
the Company participating. All information obtained by Parent and its
representatives pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ shall be treated as
confidential information of the Acquired Companies for purposes of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

Section 6.5.   _Interim Operations of Merger Sub_. During the period
from the date hereof through the earlier of the Effective Time or the date of
termination of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall not engage in any activities
of any nature except as provided in or contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

Section 6.6. _Publicity_. The initial press release relating to this
Agreement shall be a joint press release issued by the Company and Parent,
and thereafter the Company and Parent shall consult with each other before
issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with
respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement without the prior consent of the other parties hereto,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ that
(i) a party hereto may, without the prior consent of the other parties
hereto, issue such press release or make such public statement as may be
required by Law or Order or the applicable rules of NASDAQ if it has used its
commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other parties hereto and
to obtain such party's consent but has been unable to do so prior to the time
such press release or public statement is so required to be issued or made,
(ii) the Company will not be obligated to engage in such consultation with
respect to communications that are (A) principally directed to employees,
customers, partners or vendors so long as such communications are consistent
with previous releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly
by the parties (or individually, if approved by the other party), or (B)
relating to an Acquisition Proposal, Superior Proposal, Change
in Recommendation or "stop-look-and-listen" communication or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act.

Section 6.7.   _Other Employee Benefits_.

  



  

(a)  For a period of not less than twelve (12) months after the
Closing Date (or, if earlier, the date of termination of the relevant
employee), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide
to each employee of the Acquired Companies who is employed as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (each, a "Continuing Employee") with (i) base
salary or base hourly wage rate (as applicable) no less favorable than those
provided to such Continuing Employee prior to the Effective Time, (ii) cash
target bonus and in the case of field-based employees only, cash target
incentive compensation opportunity (excluding retention, change in control
and equity-based compensation), if any, that are substantially comparable
in the aggregate to those provided to Continuing Employees immediately prior
to the Effective Time, (iii) retirement and welfare benefits (excluding any
severance benefits, post-employment health benefits, post-employment welfare
benefits and defined benefit pension and nonqualified deferred compensation
plans), that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to (A) those
provided to Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time or
(B) those provided to employees of Parent or its applicable Subsidiaries, as
determined by Parent in its sole discretion.

  



  

(b)  Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
unless prohibited by applicable Law, give, or use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause to be given, to Continuing Employees credit for purposes of
eligibility to participate (other than any defined benefit pension, post-
employment health benefits or post-employment welfare benefits plan), vesting
and, with respect to vacation, paid-time off and other leave benefits only,
determining level and accrual of benefits under employee benefit
plans, programs or policies maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation
and in which such employees participate after the Effective Time, for such
employees' service prior to the Closing with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, to the same extent recognized by the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Such crediting of service shall not
operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of any such benefit.

  



  

(c) From and after the Effective Time, with respect to each
benefit plan maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation that is
an "employee welfare benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA (each,
a "Parent Welfare Plan") in which any Continuing Employee is or becomes
eligible to participate, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
each such Parent Welfare Plan to (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing
conditions, waiting periods, required physical examinations and exclusions
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable under
such Parent Welfare Plan for such Continuing Employees and their eligible
dependents to the same extent that such pre-existing conditions, waiting
periods, required physical examinations and exclusions would not have applied
or would have been waived under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan in
which such Continuing Employee was a participant immediately prior to his
or her commencement of participation in such Parent Welfare Plan but, with
respect to long-term disability and life insurance benefits and coverage,
solely to the extent permitted under the terms and conditions of Parent's
applicable insurance contracts in effect as of the Effective Time; _provided,
however_ , that for purposes of clarity, to the extent such benefit coverage
includes eligibility conditions based on periods of employment, _Section
6.7(b)_ shall control; and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee and their
eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid
in the calendar year that, and prior to the date that, such Continuing
Employee commences participation in such Parent Welfare Plan in satisfying
any applicable co-payment or deductible requirements under such Parent Welfare
Plan for the applicable calendar year, to the extent that such expenses were
recognized for such purposes under the comparable Company Benefit Plan.

  



  

   

57

 



    



  

(d)  Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor in
accordance with their terms all deferred compensation plans, agreements and
arrangements, severance and separation pay plans, agreements and arrangements,
and all written employment, severance, retention, incentive, change in
control and termination agreements (including any change in control provisions
therein) applicable to employees of the Acquired Companies and in effect on
the date of this Agreement (as listed in Section 6.7(d) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the "Assumed Employee Arrangements"); _provided_
, for the avoidance of doubt, that nothing in this _Section 6.7(d)_ shall be
deemed to prevent Parent or the Surviving Corporation from terminating or
severing any employees from and after the Closing in its sole discretion.
Parent hereby acknowledges that the consummation of the Offer constitutes a
"change of control" or a "change in control" (or a term of similar import) for
purposes of any Company Benefit Plan that contains a definition of "change of
control" or "change in control" (or a term of similar import), as applicable,
including under the Assumed Employee Arrangements. Outstanding cash bonuses
pursuant to the Company's annual bonus plan, the Assumed Employee
Arrangements or any incentive compensation plan for field-based
employees with respect to service during the 2020 calendar year, as in effect
immediately prior to the date hereof and listed in Section 6.7(d) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (including the amounts payable pursuant to such
annual bonus plan and incentive compensation plan), shall be paid to Company
employees who participate in such plans to the extent provided in Section
6.7(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

(e)  The Company shall terminate any and all Company Benefit
Plans intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (the "Company
401(k) Plans"), effective not later than the Business Day immediately
preceding the Acceptance Time. The Company or its applicable Subsidiary shall
provide Parent with evidence that such Company 401(k) Plans have been
terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board (the form and
substance of which shall be subject to review and approval by Parent). The
Company shall take (or cause to be taken) such other actions in furtherance of
terminating such 401(k) Plans as Parent may reasonably require and Parent
shall take all necessary and legally permissible actions to direct its or one
of its Affiliate's defined contribution plan to accept the rollover by any
participant of the Company 401(k) Plan of any "eligible
rollover distribution" (within the meaning of Section 402(c)(4) of the Code)
from or outstanding loans under the Company 401(k) Plans.

  



  

(f) Upon Parent's reasonable request from time to time prior
to Closing, the Company shall, a reasonable period of time following receipt
of such request (but in no event more than five (5) Business Days following
such request), provide Parent with the then-most recent calculations and
reasonable back-up information relating to Sections 280G and 4999 of the
Code relating to the Merger, including any non-compete valuations.

  



  

   

58

 



    



  

(g)  Nothing in this _Section 6.7_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement is intended nor shall be construed to (i) be treated as an
amendment to any particular Company Benefit Plan, (ii) prevent Parent from
amending or terminating any benefit plans in accordance with their terms,
(iii) create a right in any employee to employment with Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any Acquired Company, or (iv) create any third-party
beneficiary rights in any Person with respect to the compensation, terms and
conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be provided to any
Continuing Employee by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Acquired
Company or under any benefit plan which Parent, any Acquired Company or the
Surviving Corporation may maintain.

  



  

Section 6.8.   _Compensation Arrangements_. Prior to the Acceptance
Time, the compensation committee of the Company Board (the "Compensation
Committee") will cause each Company Benefit Plan and Company employment
agreement pursuant to which consideration is payable to any officer, director
or employee who is a holder of any security of the Company to be approved by
the Compensation Committee (comprised solely of "independent directors") in
accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act
and the instructions thereto as an "employment compensation, severance or
other employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2)
under the Exchange Act and satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe
harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) of the Exchange Act.

  



  

Section 6.9.   _Indemnification; Directors ' and Officers'
Insurance_.

  



  

(a) For six (6) years after the Acceptance Time, Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain directors' and
officers' liability insurance, fiduciary liability insurance and employment
practices liability insurance in respect of any acts, errors or omissions
occurring on or before the Acceptance Time, including in respect of
the Transactions, covering each such person currently covered by the
Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance, fiduciary liability
insurance and employment liability insurance policies on terms with respect
to coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policies in
effect on the date hereof; _provided, however_ , that in satisfying its
obligation under this _Section 6.9(a)_ , neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of
the amount the Company paid in its last full fiscal year prior to the date
hereof for such insurance (the "Current Premium") and if such premiums for
such insurance would at any time exceed 300% of the Current Premium, then
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain policies
of insurance that, in Parent's and the Surviving Corporation's good faith
judgment, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal
to 300% of the Current Premium. The provisions of the immediately
preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid "tail"
or "runoff" policies have been obtained by the Company prior to the
Acceptance Time, which policies provide such persons currently covered by such
policies with coverage for an aggregate period of six (6) years with respect
to claims arising from any acts, errors or omissions that occurred on or
before the Acceptance Time, including in respect of the Transactions;
_provided, however_ , that the amount paid for such prepaid policies does not
exceed 300% of the Current Premium. If such prepaid policies have
been obtained prior to the Acceptance Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
(and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such policies
in full force and effect for their full term, and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder.

  



  

   

59

 



    



  

(b)  From and after the Acceptance Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the
Acceptance Time is, or at any time prior to the Acceptance Time was, a
director or officer of the Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company (each an
"Indemnified Party") for any and all costs and expenses (including fees and
expenses of legal counsel, which shall be advanced as they are incurred;
_provided_ that, if required by applicable Law, the Indemnified Party shall
have made an undertaking to repay such expenses if it is ultimately determined
that such Indemnified Party was not entitled to indemnification under this
_Section 6.9(b)_ , such undertaking to be unsecured, interest-free and made
without reference to the Indemnified Party's ability to repay such advances
or ultimate entitlement to indemnification), judgments, fines, penalties or
liabilities (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) imposed upon
or reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with or
arising out of any demand, action, suit or other Legal Proceeding (whether
civil or criminal) in which such Indemnified Party may be involved or with
which he or she may be threatened (regardless of whether as a named party or
as a participant other than as a named party, including as a witness) (an
"Indemnified Party Proceeding") (A) by reason of such Indemnified Party's
being or having been such director or officer or an employee or agent of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or otherwise in connection with any
action taken or not taken at the request of the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company or (B) arising out of such Indemnified Party's service in
connection with any other corporation or organization for which he or she
serves or has served as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or
fiduciary at the request of the Company (including in any capacity with
respect to any employee benefit plan), in each of (A) or (B), whether or not
the Indemnified Party continues in such position at the time such Indemnified
Party Proceeding is brought or threatened and at, or at any time prior to,
the Acceptance Time (including any Indemnified Party Proceeding relating in
whole or in part to the Transactions or relating to the enforcement of this
provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified
Party), to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; and (ii)
fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to:
(x) each indemnification agreement in effect as of the date hereof between the
Company and any Indemnified Party; and (y) any indemnification provision
(including advancement of expenses) and any exculpation provision set forth in
the Company Certificate of Incorporation or Company Bylaws as in effect on
the date hereof. Parent's and the Surviving Corporation's obligations under
the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) shall continue in full force and effect for
a period of six (6) years from the Acceptance Time; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that all rights to indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses in
respect of any claim asserted or made within such period shall continue until
the final disposition of such claim. If Parent or the Surviving Corporation
fails to comply with its obligations in this _Section 6.9(b)_ and an
Indemnified Party commences a suit which results in a determination that
Parent or the Surviving Corporation failed to comply with such obligation,
Parent shall pay such Indemnified Party his or her costs and expenses
(including reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with
such suit, together with interest thereon at the "prime rate" as published in
_The Wall Street Journal_ , Eastern Edition, in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made through the date of payment (calculated daily
on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed,
without compounding).

  



  

   

60

 



    



  

(c)   If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or Entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.9_.

  



  

(d)  The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ are (i) intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his
or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not
in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such individual may have under any certificate of incorporation or
bylaws, by contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation under this _Section 6.9_ shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Party
unless (x) such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or
(y) the affected Indemnified Party shall have consented in writing to such
termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified
Parties shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.9_ ).
Parent and the Surviving Corporation jointly and severally agree to pay or
advance, upon written request of an Indemnified Party, all costs, fees and
expenses, including attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by the Indemnified
Parties in enforcing their indemnity rights and other rights provided in this
_Section 6.9_.

  



  

Section 6.10.   _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall, and shall be permitted to, take all such steps as may
reasonably be necessary to cause the Transactions, including any dispositions
of shares of Company Common Stock (including any Company Compensatory Awards)
by each Person who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

  



  

Section 6.11.   _Transaction Litigation_. The Company shall as promptly
as reasonably practicable notify Parent in writing of, and shall give Parent
the opportunity to participate in the defense and settlement of, any
Transaction Litigation. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably apprised of
the proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to any
Transaction Litigation (to the extent that the attorney-client privilege is
not undermined or otherwise adversely affected), and Parent may offer
comments or suggestions with respect to such Transaction Litigation which the
Company shall consider in good faith. Without otherwise limiting the
Indemnified Parties' rights with regard to the right to counsel, following the
Effective Time, the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to continue to
retain Goodwin Procter LLP or such other counsel selected by such
Indemnified Parties to defend any Transaction Litigation.

  



  

Section 6.12.   _Convertible Notes_.

  



  

(a) Parent and/or the Merger Sub will be permitted, at their
option, to commence and conduct, in accordance with the terms of
the Indenture, one or more offers to purchase and (if it so elects) to
conduct a consent solicitation (a "Debt Offer") with respect to the
outstanding Convertible Notes. If the Parent and/or Merger Sub elect to
conduct a Debt Offer, Parent shall provide the Company with drafts of the
necessary offer to purchase, letter of transmittal or other related documents
in connection with the Debt Offer (collectively, the "Debt Offer Documents")
a reasonable period of time in advance of commencing the applicable Debt
Offer to allow the Company and its counsel to review and comment on the
related Debt Offer Documents. Parent will reasonably consult with the Company
regarding the timing and commencement of any Debt Offer and any relevant
tender or consent deadlines. The closing (or, if applicable,
effectiveness) of any Debt Offer shall be expressly conditioned on the
satisfaction of the conditions to the Closing or the acceptance for purchase
of the Convertible Notes by Parent or Merger Sub, and the Company shall
reasonably cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub to cause any such Debt Offer
to close on the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt; the consummation of
a Debt Offer shall not be a condition to Closing. If the Parent and/or Merger
Sub elect to conduct a Debt Offer, (i) the Debt Offer shall be conducted in
compliance with the Indenture and applicable Law, including all SEC rules and
regulations, and (ii) the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
their respective Company Representatives to use their reasonable best efforts
to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with
any Debt Offer, at the sole expense of Parent.

  



  

   

61

 



    



  

(b)  Subject to the receipt of any requisite consents, the
Company shall execute a supplemental indenture to the Indenture in accordance
with the Indenture, amending the terms and provisions of the Indenture as
described in the Debt Offer Documents as reasonably requested by Parent or
Merger Sub, which supplemental indenture shall become operative no earlier
than the Closing Date or the acceptance for purchase of the Convertible Notes
by Parent or Merger Sub, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Trustee to enter into such supplemental indenture prior to or
substantially simultaneously with the Closing as determined by Parent;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company or any of its
officers, directors or other Company Representatives have any obligation to
authorize, adopt or execute any amendments or other agreement that is not
permitted under applicable Law or would become operative prior to the Closing
Date or the time of acceptance for purchase of the Convertible Notes by
Parent or Merger Sub. The Company shall use its, and shall cause its Company
Representatives to use their, commercially reasonable efforts to, provide all
cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the execution of
the supplemental indentures referred to in the immediately preceding
sentence, at the sole expense of Parent. If requested by Parent, the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its legal counsel to
provide all customary legal opinions required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this _Section 6.12(b)_ to the extent such legal
opinion is required to be delivered prior to the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Company or its legal
counsel be required to give an opinion with respect to a Debt Offer that in
the opinion of the Company, its legal counsel or the Trustee does not comply
with applicable Laws or the Indenture, or an opinion with respect to
financing by Parent or Merger Sub.

  



  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
actions required by the Indenture to be performed by the Company as a result
of the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions, including the giving of any notices that may be required in
connection with the Convertible Notes and the delivery to the Trustee of any
certificates, opinions, documents or instruments required to be delivered to
the Trustee, in each case, in connection with the Transactions or otherwise
required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture as reasonably determined by
Parent. Following the Effective Time, if any Convertible Notes remain
outstanding, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to (at Parent's
sole expense) take all actions required by the Indenture to be performed by
the Company as a result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the giving of any notices that may be required in
connection with the Convertible Notes, the delivery to the Trustee of
any certificates, opinions, documents or instruments required to be delivered
to the Trustee in connection with such transactions or otherwise required
pursuant to the terms of the Indenture.

  



  

   

62

 



    



  

(d)  Parent agrees to hold harmless and reimburse the Company,
its Subsidiaries and their respective Company Representatives from and for
all costs, expenses and liabilities such Persons may incur for actions taken
at the direction or request of Parent or its representatives in connection
with any Debt Offer, except to the extent incurred as a result of the bad
faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of, or material breach of this
Agreement by, the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Company
Representatives, and such Company Representatives shall be express third
party beneficiaries of this sentence, and Parent's obligation in this
sentence shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 6.13.   _Delisting of Company Common Stock_. The Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Company Common Stock to be de-listed from NASDAQ
and de-registered under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable following
the Effective Time.

Section 6.14. _Financing_ (a). Parent, Merger Sub and the Debt Financing
Borrower shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms and subject
only to the conditions set forth in the Commitment Letters, including using
reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in full force and effect the
Commitment Letters, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis and in any event no later
than the Closing Date all conditions applicable to Parent, Merger Sub and the
Debt Financing Borrower under the Debt Commitment Letter, (iii) comply at all
times with its obligations under the Commitment Letters to the extent
constituting a condition to the availability of funds thereunder, (iv)
negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing on the terms and subject only to the conditions set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter (or on other terms that, with respect to
conditionality, are no less favorable to Parent, Merger or the Debt Financing
Borrower than the terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter), (v) enforce
its rights under the Commitment Letters and (vi) consummate the Debt Financing
at or prior to the Closing Date. Upon the reasonable written request of the
Company (or its counsel), Parent shall promptly (and in any event within two
(2) Business Days following such written request) inform the Company and its
counsel in reasonable detail of the current status of the Debt Financing and
the status of Parent's efforts to obtain the Debt Financing. Without limiting
the foregoing, Parent shall promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business
Day following becoming aware thereof) notify the Company in writing if at any
time prior to the Closing Date Parent becomes aware of (A) any breach
or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to give rise to any
breach or default) by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter of which Parent
becomes aware that would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in Debt
Financing in the amount necessary to fund the Required Amount (after taking
into account the Equity Financing) not being available at Closing, (B) the
receipt, on or prior to the Closing Date, of any written notice or other
written communication from any Debt Financing Source with respect to any
actual breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt
Commitment Letter that would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in
Debt Financing in the amount necessary to fund the Required Amount (after
taking into account the Equity Financing) not being available at Closing or
(C) if for any reason Parent believes in good faith that Parent or the
Debt Financing Borrower will not be able to obtain on or prior to the Closing
Date all or any portion of the Debt Financing in the amount necessary to fund
the Required Amount (after taking into account the Equity Financing and any
available cash of Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries).
Upon the reasonable written request of the Company, Parent shall promptly
(and in any event within two (2) Business Days following such written request)
provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any
circumstance referred to in clauses (A), (B) or (C) of the immediately
preceding sentence. Parent, Merger Sub and the Debt Financing Borrower shall
not, without the prior written consent of the Company, agree to or permit any
termination of or amendment, restatement, amendment and restatement,
supplement or modification to be made to the Commitment Letters (other than
to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or other
similar entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the
date hereof)- if such termination, amendment, restatement, amendment and
restatement, supplement, modification or waiver would (A) reduce the aggregate
amount of the Financing such that the aggregate amount of the Financing would
be below the amount required to pay the Required Amount (after taking
into account available cash of Parent, the Company and their respective
Subsidiaries), (B) impose new or additional conditions precedent to the
availability of the Financing or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the
conditions precedent to the Financing in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to materially delay or prevent the funding of the Financing
(or satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing) at the Offer Closing and
at the Closing or (C) adversely impact the ability of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Debt Financing Borrower to enforce its rights against other parties to the
Commitment Letters. Parent shall promptly (and in any event within two (2)
Business Days following receipt) deliver to the Company copies of
any amendment, restatement, amendment and restatement, replacement,
supplement or other modification to, or waiver of any provision under, the
Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing Fee Letter. In the event that the
Debt Financing necessary to fund the Required Amount (after taking into
account the Equity Financing and any available cash of Parent, the Company
and their respective Subsidiaries) will not be available to Parent and the
Debt Financing Borrower in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment
Letter, Parent shall promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day
following the occurrence thereof) notify the Company in writing and, prior to
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article 8_  hereto, use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange,
obtain and consummate as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of
any such financing failure event, alternative debt financing (the
"Alternative Financing"), including from alternative sources in an amount
sufficient to fund the Required Amount (after taking into account the Equity
Financing and any available cash of Parent, the Company and their respective
Subsidiaries) as promptly as possible following the occurrence of such event,
which Alternate Financing will not include terms and conditions that are less
favorable to Parent or the Debt Financing Borrower than those contained in
the Debt Commitment Letter and Debt Financing Fee Letter (determined after
giving effect to all amendments and other modifications permitted pursuant to
the "market flex" provisions of the Debt Financing Fee Letter as if such
amendments and other modifications had been implemented to the maximum extent
permitted thereunder). It is understood and agreed that (i) if Parent is
required to proceed with any Alternative Financing, Parent shall be subject
to the same obligations with respect to such Alternative Financing as set
forth in this Agreement with respect to the Debt Financing and (ii) such
Alternative Financing shall not, without the prior written consent of
the Company, (A) be less than the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing
necessary to fund the Required Amount (after taking into account the Equity
Financing and any available cash of Parent, the Company and their respective
Subsidiaries) (determined after giving effect to all amendments and other
modifications permitted pursuant to the "market flex" provisions of the Debt
Financing Fee Letter as if such amendments and other modifications had been
implemented to the maximum extent permitted thereunder), (B) impose new or
additional conditions to the consummation of the Debt Financing other than
those expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter delivered on the date
hereof or otherwise expand any of the conditions to the consummation of the
Debt Financing set forth therein or (C) otherwise expand, amend or modify any
provision applicable under the Debt Commitment Letter in a manner that would
not be permitted pursuant to Section 6.14(a). In the event that Alternative
Financing is obtained, Parent shall promptly provide the Company with a copy
of the new financing commitment that provides for such Alternative Financing
(the "Alternative Financing Commitment Letter"). If applicable, any reference
in this Agreement to "Debt Financing" shall include "Alternative Financing",
any reference to "Debt Commitment Letter" shall include the "Alternative
Financing Commitment Letter" and any references to "Debt Financing Documents"

(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, nothing in this Section 6.14 will require, and in no event will
the reasonable best efforts of Parent, the Debt Financing Borrower or Merger
Sub be deemed or construed to require, Parent, the Debt Financing Borrower or
Merger Sub to (i) seek the Equity Financing from any source other than a
counterparty to, or in any amount in excess of that contemplated by, the
Equity Commitment Letter or (ii) pay any fees materially in excess of what it
was obligated to pay under the original Debt Commitment Letter (determined
after giving effect to all amendments and other modifications permitted
pursuant to the "market flex" provisions of the Debt Financing Fee Letter as
if such amendments and other modifications had been implemented to the
maximum extent permitted thereunder).

  



  

Section 6.15.   _Financing Assistance_ (a).

  



  

(a) During the period from the date hereof through the earlier of the
Closing Date or the date of termination of this Agreement, the Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
use reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Company Representatives
to provide, in each case at Parent's sole expense, such cooperation as may be
reasonably requested in writing (which, for purposes of this Section 6.15 may
be through email) by Parent in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing, including using reasonable best efforts to: (i) furnish pertinent
and customary information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as may
be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing and
customarily required for completion of similar financings; (ii) upon
reasonable notice and at reasonable times and locations, participate in a
reasonable number of conference calls and presentations with
prospective lenders (which may be telephonic meetings) and otherwise
cooperate with the marketing efforts for any of the Debt Financing; (iii)
provide Parent and the Debt Financing Sources with all documentation and other
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries as shall have
been reasonably requested in writing by Parent that is required in connection
with the Debt Financing by U.S. regulatory authorities under applicable
"know-your-customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations,
including the Patriot Act, and the requirements of 31 C.F.R. §1010.230; and
(iv) execute and deliver any guarantee, pledge and security documents, other
definitive financing documents, or other certificates or documents as may be
reasonably requested by Parent and otherwise reasonably facilitate the
pledging of collateral and the granting of security interests in respect of
the Debt Financing (including intellectual property), which guarantee,
pledge, security documents, definitive financing documents or other
certificates or documents shall only be effective at Closing. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 6.15(a), nothing will require the
Company to provide (or be deemed to require the Company to prepare) any (1)
pro forma financial statements; (2) information regarding any post-Closing or
pro forma cost savings, synergies, capitalization, ownership or other post-
Closing pro forma adjustments; (3) description of all or any portion of the
Financing, including any "description of notes"; (4) risk factors relating to
all or any component of the Financing; (5) other information required by
Rules 3-10 or 3-16 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, any
Compensation Discussion and Analysis or other information required by Item 402
of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act or any other information
customarily excluded from an offering memorandum for private placements of
non-convertible high-yield debt securities under Rule 144A promulgated under
the Securities Act; or (6) any financial or other information not readily
available or prepared in the ordinary course of business of the Company at the
time requested by Parent (the foregoing clauses (1) through (6) is referred
herein as "Excluded Information").

  



  

   

65

 



    



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in Section 6.15(a) to the
contrary, (i) such requested cooperation shall not unreasonably disrupt or
interfere (in the judgment of the Company) with the business or the
operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (ii) nothing in this Section
6.15 shall require cooperation to the extent that it would (A) subject any of
the Company's or its Subsidiaries' respective directors, managers, officers
or employees to any actual or potential personal liability with respect to
matters related to the Debt Financing, (B) conflict with, or violate, the
Company's and/or any of its Subsidiaries' organization documents, material
contractual obligations or any applicable Law, (C) cause any Offer Condition
or condition to the Closing set forth in Article VII to not be satisfied or
(D) cause any breach of this Agreement, (iii) neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee
or incur or assume any liability or other obligation in connection with the
financings contemplated by the Commitment Letters or the Financing prior to
the Effective Time or be required to take any action that would subject it to
actual or potential liability, to bear any cost or expense or to make any
other payment or agree to provide any indemnity in connection with
the Commitment Letters, the Financing or any information utilized in
connection therewith, in each case, that would not be reimbursed or
indemnified by Parent or Merger Sub, (iv) none of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or their respective directors, officers or employees shall be
required to execute, deliver or enter into, or perform any agreement,
certificate, document or instrument with respect to the Financing that is not
contingent upon the Closing and the directors and managers of the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall not be required to adopt resolutions approving the
agreements, documents and instruments pursuant to which the Financing is
obtained unless Parent and Merger Sub shall have determined that such
directors and managers are to remain as directors and managers of such Person
on and after the Closing and such resolutions are contingent upon the
occurrence of, or only effective as of, the Closing, (v) disclosure of any
confidential information to the Debt Financing Sources shall be made subject
to the acknowledgment and acceptance by such Debt Financing Source that
such information is being disseminated on a confidential basis in accordance
with the customary market standards for dissemination of such type of
information and (vi) Parent, Merger Sub and the Debt Financing Borrower agree
to use their commercially reasonable efforts to maintain attorney-client
privilege. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiary's
logos in connection with the debt financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter; provided that such logos are used solely in a manner that
is not intended to, nor reasonably likely to, harm or disparage the Company's
or the Company's Subsidiaries' reputation or goodwill or any of their
respective products, services, offerings or intellectual property rights.

  



  

   

66

 



    



  

(c)  Parent agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse the
Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Company Representatives prior
to the Closing or the termination of this Agreement (and thereafter, promptly
upon demand and in each case directly to the applicable Company
Representative) from and for all costs, expenses, fees, losses, damages,
claims, judgments, fines, penalties, interest, awards and liabilities such
Persons may incur in connection with the Debt Financing and the
performance of their respective obligations under this Section 6.15 and the
provision of any information utilized in connection therewith (other than
information provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries) (including reasonable
and documented costs and expenses of counsel and advisors), except to the
extent incurred as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Company Representatives,
and such Subsidiaries and Company Representatives shall be express third party
beneficiaries of this sentence, and Parent's obligation in this sentence
shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.

 TERMINATION

  



  

Section 8.1.   _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and

time prior to the Acceptance Time;

  



  

(b)  by Parent or the Company upon prior written notice to the
other, if the Acceptance Time has not occurred by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time,
on January 28, 2021 (the "End Date"); _provided_ that the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)_ shall not be available to
any party (or any Affiliate of such party) whose breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement has been the proximate cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the
Acceptance Time to have occurred on or before the End Date;

  



  

(c)  by Parent or the Company upon prior written notice to the
other at any time prior to the Acceptance Time if there shall be any Law
(other than an Order, which is addressed below) enacted after the date hereof
and remaining in effect that makes the acceptance for payment of, or the
payment for, Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer or the Merger
illegal or that prohibits the consummation of the Offer or the Merger, or any
court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity shall have
issued a final and non-appealable Order or shall have taken any other action,
having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the acceptance for payment of, or payment for, Company Common

final and non-appealable;  _provided, however,_ that the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(c)_ shall not be available to
any party (or any Affiliate of such party) whose breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement has been the
proximate cause of, or resulted in, the issuance, promulgation, enforcement or
entry of any such Order;

  



  

(d)  by Parent or the Company upon prior written notice to the
other if the Offer (as it may have been extended pursuant to _Section 2.1(e)_
) expires as a result of the non-satisfaction of one or more Offer Conditions,
or is terminated or withdrawn prior to the Acceptance Time (to the extent
permitted under the terms of this Agreement), without Merger Sub having
accepted for payment any Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer;
_provided, however_ , that a party shall not be permitted to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(d)_ if the non-satisfaction of any
Offer Condition or the termination or withdrawal of the Offer results from
the failure of such party (or any Affiliate of such party) to perform any
covenant required to be performed by such party (or any Affiliate of such
party) at or prior to the Acceptance Time;

  



  

(e)  by Parent upon prior written notice to the Company at any

Change in Recommendation ( _provided_ that, any written notice, including
pursuant to _Section 2.3(d)_ , of the Company's intention to make a Change in
Recommendation in advance of making a Change in Recommendation shall not
result in Parent having any termination rights pursuant to this _Section
8.1(e)_ unless such written notice otherwise constitutes a Change in
Recommendation); _provided, however_ , that Parent shall not be permitted to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(e)_ unless the notice
of termination pursuant to this _Section 8.1(e)_ is delivered by Parent
to the Company within five (5) Business Days following the occurrence of the
event giving rise to Parent's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 8.1(e)_ ;

  



  

   

68

 



    



  

(f)   by the Company prior to the Acceptance Time upon prior
written notice to Parent in connection with the Company Board making a Change
in Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal in order to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement, if the Company and the Company Board shall
have complied in all material respects with the notice, negotiation and other
requirements set forth in _Section 2.3(d)_ with respect to such Superior
Proposal;

  



  

(g)  by Parent upon prior written notice to the Company at any
time prior to the Acceptance Time, if a breach of any representation or
warranty in _Article 4_ or failure to perform any covenant or obligation
contained in this Agreement on the part of the Company shall have occurred
that would cause a failure of any of the conditions set forth in clauses
"2(c)," "2(d)" and "2(e)" of _Annex I_ to exist; _provided, however_ ,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the covenant set forth in Section
6.15 shall be deemed satisfied unless (x) the Debt Financing has not been
obtained primarily as a result of the Company's material breach of its
obligations under Section 6.15, (y) Parent provided to the Company written

the date Parent gives the Company notice of such breach and the Company is
continuing to use commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach, then
Parent may not terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(g)_ on account
of such breach unless such breach shall remain uncured upon the expiration of
such twenty (20) Business Day period; _provided further_ , _however_ , that
Parent shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(g)_ if Parent, Merger Sub or the Debt Financing Borrower is in
breach of its obligations under this Agreement such that the Company would be
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_ ;

  



  

(h)  by the Company upon prior written notice to Parent at any
time prior to the Acceptance Time, if a breach in any material respect of any
representation or warranty or failure to perform in any material respect any
covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub or the Debt Financing Borrower shall have occurred, in each case if
such breach or failure prevents or would reasonably be expected to prevent
Parent, Merger Sub or the Debt Financing Borrower from consummating the
Offer, the Merger or any other Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
for purposes of this _Section 8.1(h)_ , if such a breach is curable by Parent
within twenty (20) Business Days of the date the Company gives Parent written
notice of such breach and Parent is continuing to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cure such breach, then the Company may not terminate
this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(h)_ on account of such breach unless
such breach shall remain uncured upon the expiration of such twenty (20)
Business Day period; _provided further_ , _however_ , that the Company shall
not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(h)_
if the Company is in breach of its obligations under this Agreement such that

prior to the tenth (10th) Business Day following the date hereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(i)_ shall not be available to the Company if the Company is in
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in
this Agreement that has been the proximate cause of, or resulted in, Merger
Sub's failure to commence the Offer in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement; or

  



  

   

69

 



    



  

(j)  by the Company, if each of the following conditions is
satisfied: (i) on the Expiration Date (disregarding any extension pursuant to
_Section 2.1(f)_ , but, for the avoidance of doubt, after giving effect to all
other extensions thereof), all of the Offer Conditions have been satisfied or
waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Acceptance Time, but which conditions would be capable of being
satisfied if the Expiration Date were the date of the Company's delivery of
the Company's Notice), (ii) Merger Sub shall have failed to consummate (as
defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL) the Offer within two (2) Business Days
following the Expiration Date, (iii) the Company has delivered written notice
(the "Company's Notice") to Parent of the Company's intention to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(j)_  if Merger Sub fails to

after 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the fourth (4th) Business Day following the
date of the Company's delivery of the Company's Notice (or such
shorter period of time as remains prior to one minute after 11:59 p.m.
Eastern Time on the End Date; the shorter of such periods, the
"Failure Notice Period"), (iv) Merger Sub fails to consummate (as defined in
Section 251(h) of the DGCL) the Offer prior to the expiration of the Failure

Company stood ready, willing and able to consummate the Transactions.

  



  

Section 8.2.   _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section 8.1_ , this Agreement
shall be of no further force or effect without liability of any party (or any
representative of such party) to each other party hereto; _provided,
however,_ that: (a) this _Section 8.2_ , _Article 1_ and the applicable
definitions elsewhere in this Agreement, the last sentence of _Section
6.4(a)_ , _Section 6.12(d)_ , _Section 6.15(c)_ , _Section 8.3_ and _Article
9_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full
force and effect; and (b) subject in all respects to the limitations set
forth in this _Section 8.2_ , _Section 8.3_ , _Section 9.12_ and
_Section 9.15_ , the termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any
party from any liabilities or damages (which the parties acknowledge and
agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket
costs, and may include to the extent proven the benefit of the bargain lost
by such party or such party's equity holders (taking into consideration all
relevant matters) determined to be damages of such party arising out of its
Willful and Material Breach of any provision of this Agreement or any other
agreement delivered in connection herewith or any fraud, subject only, with
respect to any such liabilities of the Company, to _Section 8.3(b)_ and, with
respect to any such liabilities of Parent and Merger Sub, to _Section 8.3(c)_.

  



  

Section 8.3.   _Expenses; Termination Fees_.

  



  

(a) Except as set forth in this _Section 8.3_ , all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Offer, the Merger
and the other Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses,
whether or not the Offer and Merger are consummated. For the avoidance of
doubt, (i) Parent shall pay all filing fees payable for filings required or
otherwise made pursuant to the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust
Laws, and (ii) the Company shall not be required to pay any fees or other
payments to any Governmental Entity in connection with any filings under the
HSR Act or such other filings as may be required under applicable Antitrust
Laws in connection with the Merger or the other Transactions.

  



  

   

70

 



    



  

(b)  If: (i) (A) this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent
or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ or _Section 8.1(d)_ , (B)
following the date hereof and prior to the time of the termination of this
Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced (and
such Acquisition Proposal shall not have been withdrawn prior to the time of
the termination of this Agreement) and (C) the Company consummates an
Acquisition Proposal (with all references to 20% in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal being treated as 50% for purposes of this clause (i))
within nine (9) months after such termination or the Company enters into a
definitive agreement within nine (9) months after such termination to effect
an Acquisition Proposal, which Acquisition Proposal is subsequently
consummated; (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
8.1(e)_ ; or (iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.1(f)_ , then in the case of each of clauses (i) through (iii), the
Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent, in cash at the time specified
in the next sentence, a termination fee in the amount of $16.25 million (the
"Termination Fee"). Any Termination Fee shall be paid: (x) in the case
of clause (i) of the preceding sentence of this _Section 8.3(b)_ , within two
(2) Business Days after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
such Acquisition Proposal, (y) in the case of clause (ii) of the preceding
sentence of this _Section 8.2(b)_ , within two (2) Business Days following
termination of this Agreement and (z) in the case of clause (iii) of the
preceding sentence of this _Section 8.3(b)_ , substantially concurrently with
a termination of this Agreement under _Section 8.1(f)_ (or no later than on
the next Business Day if such termination occurs on a day that is not a
Business Day). Any Termination Fee due under this _Section 8.3(b)_ shall be
paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
in writing by Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, the Termination Fee shall be
payable only once and not in duplication even though the Termination Fee may
be payable under one or more provisions hereof. In the event that
Parent shall receive full payment of the Termination Fee, the receipt of the
Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all
losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, any of their
respective Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this Agreement
(and the termination hereof), the Offer and the Merger (and the abandonment
thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of
Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any other
Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding
against the Company or any of its Affiliates for damages or any equitable
relief arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the
Transactions or any matters forming the basis for such termination.

  



  

(c) If this Agreement is validly terminated by the Company (i)
pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_ or _Section 8.1(i)_ , and the material breach or
failure to perform by Parent or Merger Sub or the failure to commence the
Offer within the time period specified in Section 2.1(a), as the case may be,
is the primary reason for the failure of the Offer Closing or Closing to
be consummated, or pursuant to _Section 8.1(j)_ , or (ii) if Parent shall
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ and at such time the
Company could have terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_ ,
_Section 8.1(i)_ or _Section 8.1(j)_ , then, if the Company so elects, Parent
shall pay or cause to be paid to the Company a termination fee of $30.0
million (the "Parent Termination Fee"). Any Parent Termination Fee shall be
paid, within two (2) Business Days of the date of the Company's termination
of the Agreement, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated in writing by the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Parent Termination Fee shall be payable only once and not in duplication even
though the Parent Termination Fee may be payable under one or more provisions
hereof. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the
event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company because of a Debt
Failure, or if the Company elects to receive the Parent Termination Fee under
other circumstances where the Parent Termination Fee is payable pursuant to
this _Section 8.3(c)_ , the Parent Termination Fee (including, without
duplication, the Company's right to enforce the Limited Guarantee with respect
thereto, in accordance with the terms thereof, and receive the Parent
Termination Fee from the Guarantors to the extent payable thereunder), shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its Subsidiaries against
the Parent Related Parties or the Debt Financing Sources Related Parties for
all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest,
awards, judgments and penalties suffered as a result of the failure of the
Transactions to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform
hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount, none of the Parent
Related Parties or the Debt Financing Sources Related Parties shall have any
further liability relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions, except that Parent and Merger Sub (or their Affiliates) will
remain obligated with respect to, and the Company may be entitled to remedies
with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement, _Section 6.12(d)_ , _Section
6.15(c)_ , _Section 8.2_ , _Section 8.3(a)_ and _Section 8.3(d)_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document, in any case where the Parent Termination Fee is or would
be payable because of a Debt Failure or where the Company otherwise elects to
receive the Parent Termination Fee, the maximum aggregate liability, whether
in equity or at Law, in Contract, in tort or otherwise, together with any
payment of the Parent Termination Fee and any other payment in connection
with this Agreement or otherwise, of the Parent Related Parties collectively
(including monetary damages for breach, whether willful, intentional,
unintentional or otherwise) (i) under this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document, (ii) in connection with the failure of the Offer, Merger or the
other Transactions to be consummated, or (iii) in respect of any
representation or warranty made or alleged to have been made in connection
with this Agreement or any other Transaction Documents, will not exceed under
any circumstances an amount equal to (x) the Parent Termination Fee , plus (y)
the amounts, if any, due and owing under _Section 6.12(d)_ , _Section
6.15(c)_ and _Section 8.3(d)_ , plus (z) the reimbursement of any other
expenses explicitly required pursuant to this Agreement (collectively, the
"Maximum Liability Amount"), and in no event will the Company, its Affiliates
or any of the Company Representatives seek, directly or indirectly, to
recover against the Parent Related Parties, or compel payment by the Parent
Related Parties of, any damages or other payments whatsoever (including
multiple, consequential, indirect, special, statutory, exemplary or punitive
damages) in excess of the Maximum Liability Amount set forth in this _Section
8.3(c)_. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 8.3(c)_ limits
the Company's right to pursue specific performance as provided in (but
subject to the limitations of) _Section 9.12_.

  



  

   

71

 



    



  

(d) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree
that the agreements contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of
the Transactions, and that, without these agreements, the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement. In the event that the Company
shall fail to pay the Termination Fee when due, Parent shall be entitled to
receive interest on such unpaid Termination Fee, commencing on the date that
the Termination Fee became due, at a rate equal to the "prime rate" as
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ , Eastern Edition, in effect on the
date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment
(calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of
days elapsed, without compounding) and any reasonable and documented out of
pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses)
incurred by Parent and its Affiliates in connection with enforcing its
rights under this _Section 8.3(d)_. In the event that Parent shall fail to
pay or cause to be paid the Parent Termination Fee when due, the Company
shall be entitled to receive interest on such unpaid Parent Termination Fee,
commencing on the date that the Parent Termination Fee became due, at a rate
equal to the "prime rate" as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ , Eastern
Edition, in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through
the date of payment (calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and
the actual number of days elapsed, without compounding) and any reasonable
and documented out of pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by the Company in connection with
enforcing its rights under this _Section 8.3(d)._

right, privilege or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or of any other power, right, privilege or remedy. No party shall be
deemed to have waived any claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such

waiver shall not be applicable or have any effect except in the specific
instance in which it is given.

covenant or agreement of the parties which by its terms contemplates

Section 9.5.   _Applicable Law; Jurisdiction_. This agreement is made
under, and shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of
the State of Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be performed solely
therein, including its statute of limitations, without giving effect to
principles of conflicts of law. Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to and
submits to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware, New Castle County, or, if that court does not have
jurisdiction, a federal court sitting in Wilmington, Delaware (the "Delaware
Courts") in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the Transactions, (b) agrees that all claims in respect
of such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in any such court,
(c) shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion
or other request for leave from any such court and (d) shall not bring any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of
the Transactions in any other court. Each of the parties hereto waives any
defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding
so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be
required of any other Person with respect thereto.

Section 9.6.   _Assignability; Parties in Interest_. This Agreement
shall be binding upon, and shall be enforceable by and inure to the benefit
of, the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. This
Agreement shall not be assignable by any party without the express written
consent of the other parties hereto, and any attempt to make any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void _provided_ that Parent
may assign all or any portion of its rights to any of its Debt
Financing Sources pursuant to the terms of the Debt Financing for purposes of
creating a security interest therein or otherwise assigning as collateral
security in respect of the Debt Financing. Except for the provisions of
_Article 2_ (which, from and after the Acceptance Time, shall be for the
benefit of Persons that are holders of Company Common Stock who have tendered
pursuant to the Offer (and not validly withdrawn) Company Common Stock),
_Article 3_ (which, from and after the Effective Time, shall be for the
benefit of Persons who are holders of the Company Common Stock and Company
Compensatory Awards immediately prior to the Effective Time) and _Section
6.9_ (which, from and after the Acceptance Time, shall be for the benefit of
the Indemnified Parties), nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any Person, other than the parties hereto,
any right, benefit or remedy of any nature; _provided, however,_ that the
Company shall be entitled and have the right to pursue and recover damages in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement in the name of and on behalf of
its stockholders in the event of any breach by Parent or Merger Sub of this
Agreement or in the event of fraud, which right is hereby acknowledged and
agreed to by Parent and Merger Sub.

Section 9.8.   _Severability_. Any term or provision of this
Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any
jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining
terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the
offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other
jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the
parties hereto agree that the court making such determination shall have the
power to limit the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or
to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or
provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing
the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this
Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does
not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto
agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid
and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable
term.

  



  

Section 9.9.   _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and
delivered (including by facsimile or other form of electronic transmission)
in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

  



  

Section 9.10.   _Obligation of Parent_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to
comply in all respects with each of the representations, warranties,
covenants, obligations, agreements and undertakings made or required to be
performed by Merger Sub in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the
Offer, the Merger, and the other Transactions. As a material inducement to the
Company's willingness to enter into this Agreement and perform its
obligations hereunder, Parent hereby unconditionally guarantees full
performance and payment by Merger Sub of each of the covenants, obligations
and undertakings required to be performed by Merger Sub under this Agreement
and the Transactions, subject to all terms, conditions and limitations
contained in this Agreement, and hereby represents, acknowledges and agrees
that any such breach of any such representation and warranty or default in the
performance of any such covenant, obligation, agreement or undertaking of
Merger Sub shall also be deemed to be a breach or default of Parent, and
the Company shall have the right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to
pursue any and all available remedies it may have arising out of any such
breach or nonperformance directly against either or both of Parent and Merger
Sub in the first instance. As applicable, references in this _Section 9.10_
to "Merger Sub" shall also include the Surviving Corporation following the
Effective Time.

  



  

Section 9.11.   _Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
be deemed to limit the ability of the Company or the Company Board to make
any disclosure if the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in
good faith (after consultation with counsel) that failure to do so would
create a material risk of either (a) a breach by the Company Board of its
fiduciary duties to the holders of Company Common Stock or (b) a violation of
any Law.

  



  

   

76

 



    



  

Section 9.12.   _Specific Performance_.

  



  

(a)  The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and
that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached, except as expressly provided
in the following sentence. It is accordingly agreed that, subject to
_Section 9.12(b)_ , the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement (including
specific performance or other equitable relief to cause Parent to perform any
obligations required of it to enforce its rights under the Equity Commitment
Letter) in the Delaware Courts and, in any action for specific performance,
each party waives the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and waives
any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with
such remedy, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity (subject to the limitations set forth in this
Agreement). The parties hereto further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies
provided for in this _Section 9.12(a)_ , a party shall not in any respect
waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to a
party under this Agreement (including monetary damages) for breach of any of
the provisions of this Agreement or (except as provided in _Section 8.3(c)_ )
in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the
remedies provided for in this _Section 9.12(a)_ are not available or otherwise
are not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this _Section 9.12_ shall
require any party hereto to institute any proceeding for (or limit any
party's right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this
_Section 9.12_ prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right
under _Article 8_ (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall
the commencement of any Legal Proceeding pursuant to this _Section 9.12_ or
anything set forth in this _Section 9.12_  restrict or limit any party's
right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article 8_
or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available at
any time.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 9.12(a)_ , it is explicitly agreed
that the right of the Company or any Affiliate or stockholder thereof to
enforce or seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
remedies in connection with enforcing the Parent's, Merger Sub's obligation
(i) to cause the Equity Financing to be funded (whether under this Agreement
or the Equity Commitment Letter) or (ii) to fund the Offer Price or the
Merger Consideration or (iii) to cause the Acceptance Time to occur and
to effect the Offer Closing and the Closing (but, for the avoidance of doubt,
not the right of the Company to seek an injunction, specific performance or
other equitable remedies for any other reason) will be subject to the
following conditions: (A) all of the Offer Conditions have been satisfied or
waived (other than those Offer Conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Acceptance Time, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of
such Offer Conditions at the Acceptance Time), including any deemed
satisfaction or waiver of the Offer Conditions pursuant to _Section 2.1(f)_ ),
(B) the Debt Financing shall have been funded in accordance with the terms of
the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing Sources shall have
irrevocably confirmed in writing that the Debt Financing will be funded in
accordance with the terms thereof at the Offer Closing and at the Closing if
the Equity Financing is funded at the Offer Closing and at the Closing;
_provided_ , that Parent and Merger Sub shall not be required to draw down
the Equity Financing or consummate the Offer or the Merger, as applicable, if
the Debt Financing is not in fact funded at the Offer Closing or the Closing
(other than as a result of a material breach by any of the Covis Parties of
any of their representations, warranties or covenants set forth in
_Section 5.6_ or _Section 6.14_ ), as applicable, (C) the Company shall have
irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that if specific performance is
granted and the Financing is funded, then it would take such actions required
of it by this Agreement to cause the consummation of the Offer and the
Closing to occur and (D) Parent or Merger Sub shall have failed to
consummate the applicable Transactions within two (2) Business Days after
delivery of the Company's irrevocable written confirmation. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for the avoidance of doubt, while
the Company may, subject in all respects to _Section 8.2_ , _Section 8.3(c)_
, _Section 9.12(b)_ and _Section 9.15_  (including, in each case, the
limitations set forth therein and herein), pursue both a grant of specific
performance in accordance with (but subject to the limitations of) this
_Section 9.12_ and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee, if, as and when
available pursuant to _Section 8.3(c)_ , under no circumstances shall the
Company, directly or indirectly, be permitted or entitled to receive (1) both
a grant of specific performance under this _Section 9.12(b)_ that results in
the Closing, on the one hand, and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee
and any amounts as and when due, pursuant to _Section 8.3(d)_ , on the other
hand, or (2) both payment of any monetary damages whatsoever from Parent
or Merger Sub pursuant to an Order or settlement arising in connection with
any Legal Proceeding initiated by the Company for matters related to this
Agreement, on the one hand, and payment of any of the Parent Termination Fee
and any amounts as and when due, pursuant to _Section 8.3(d)_ , on the other
hand.

Section 9.13.   _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

  



  

Section 9.14.   _Debt Financing Sources_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the Company on behalf of itself, its Subsidiaries and its Affiliates hereby:
(i) agrees that any action, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract
or in tort or otherwise, involving any Debt Financing Sources Related Party,
arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, the Debt Financing or any of
the agreements entered into in connection with the Debt Financing (including
the Debt Commitment Letter) or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or the performance of any services thereunder (a "Debt Financing
Action") shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or
state court in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, so long as such
forum is and remains available, and any appellate court thereof and hereby
irrevocably submits itself and its property with respect to any such Debt
Financing Action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court, and such Debt
Financing Action (except to the extent relating to the interpretation of any
provisions in this Agreement (including any provision in any documentation
related to the Debt Financing (including the Debt Commitment Letter) that
expressly specifies that the interpretation of such provisions shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of
Delaware)) shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York (without
giving effect to any conflicts of law principles that would result in the
application of the laws of another jurisdiction), (ii) agrees not to bring or
support, or permit any of its Affiliates to bring or support, any Debt
Financing Action of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Debt Financing
Sources Related Party in any way arising out of or relating to, this
Agreement, the Debt Financing (including the Debt Commitment Letter) or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any
services thereunder in any forum other than any federal or state court in the
Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, (iii) agrees that service of
process in any Debt Financing Action shall be effective if notice is given in
accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section 9.7_ , (iv) irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, the defense of
an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any Debt Financing Action in
any such court with respect to any Debt Financing Action involving any Debt
Financing Sources Related Party, (v) knowingly, intentionally and voluntarily
waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, trial by jury in any
Debt Financing Action involving any Debt Financing Sources Related Party, as
the case may be, in any way arising out of or relating to, this Agreement,
the Debt Financing (including the Debt Commitment Letter) or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any
services thereunder and (vi) agrees that the Debt Financing Sources Related
Parties are express third party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, any of the
provisions in this Agreement reflecting the agreements in this _Section 9.14_
, and such provisions and the definitions of "Debt Financing Sources" and
"Debt Financing Sources Related Parties" shall not be amended, modified or
waived in any way that is adverse to the Debt Financing Sources Related
Parties without the prior written consent of the Debt Financing Sources party
to the Debt Commitment Letter.

  



  

   

78

 



    



  

(b)  The Debt Financing Sources Related Parties will not have
any liability to the Company, or its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective
controlled Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt
Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder, whether in
law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise (other than,
after giving effect to the Closing, the Company in respect of the agreements
contemplated by the Debt Financing and/or the Debt Commitment Letter to which
it is a party). Prior to the Closing, the Company shall not be entitled to
directly enforce any rights under the Debt Commitment Letter, which rights
shall only be permitted to be enforced by Parent (or its applicable
Affiliate).

  



  

Section 9.15. _Non-Recourse_. Each party agrees, on behalf of itself and
its Related Parties, that all Legal Proceedings (whether in Contract or in
tort, in Law or in equity or otherwise, or granted by statute or otherwise,
whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited
partnership or limited liability company veil or any other theory or doctrine,
including alter ego or otherwise) that may be based upon, in respect of,
arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner
to: (a) this Agreement, any of the other Transaction Documents or any of the
transactions contemplated hereunder or thereunder (including the Financing);
(b) the negotiation, execution or performance this Agreement or any of the
other Transaction Documents (including any representation or warranty made in
connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents); (c) any breach or violation of this Agreement or any
of the other Transaction Documents and (d) any failure of any of the
transactions contemplated hereunder or thereunder (including the Financing)

identified as parties to this Agreement, and in the case of the other
Transaction Documents, Persons expressly identified as parties to such
Transaction Documents and in accordance with, and subject to the terms and

, _Section 8.3(c)_ , _Section 8.3(d)_ , _Section 9.12_ and this _Section
9.15_ ) (i) against any Person that is party to, and solely pursuant to the
terms and conditions of, the Confidentiality Agreement, (ii) against each
Guarantor (and their legal successors and assigns of their obligations
hereunder) under, and pursuant to the terms and conditions of the

Annex I 
  
 Conditions of the Offer

  



  

Capitalized terms used in this _Annex I_ and not otherwise defined herein
will have the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement and Plan of Merger
to which it is attached (the " _Agreement_ ").

  



  

(1) Notwithstanding any other terms or provisions of the Offer or the
Agreement, Merger Sub shall not be obligated to irrevocably accept for
payment, or, subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule
14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Merger Sub's obligation to
purchase or return the tendered Company Common Stock promptly after
termination or withdrawal of the Offer), purchase any Company Common Stock
validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date)
pursuant to the Offer (and not theretofore accepted for payment or paid for),
unless:

  



  

(i) there shall have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to
the Expiration Date that number of shares of Company Common Stock that,
considered together with all other shares of Company Common Stock (if any)
beneficially owned by Parent and its Affiliates (excluding any shares of
Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that
have not yet been "received" (as such term is defined in Section 251(h)(6)(f)
of the DGCL)), represent one more than 50% of the sum of (x) the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding at the time of the
expiration of the Offer, _plus_ (y) the aggregate number of shares of Company
Common Stock then issuable to holders of Company Options from which the
Company has received notices of exercise prior to the expiration of the Offer
(and as to which such shares have not yet been issued to such exercising
holders of Company Options), it being understood that Company Compensatory
Awards cancelled in accordance with _Section 3.7_ shall not be included in
such calculation, _plus_ (z) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock issuable to holders of Convertible Notes from which the Company has
