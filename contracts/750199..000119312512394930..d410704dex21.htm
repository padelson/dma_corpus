Statement shall become final and binding upon the Parties on the date (the "

by Buyer unless Buyer gives Notice of its disagreement (" _Notice of
Disagreement_ ") to Seller prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement
shall specify in reasonable detail the dollar amount, nature, and basis of any

shall become final and binding on the Parties on, and the Final Settlement
Date shall be, the earlier of (1) the date upon which Seller and Buyer agree
in writing with respect to all matters specified in the Notice of

upon which Seller receives a Notice of Disagreement, Seller and Buyer shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to attempt to resolve in writing any
differences that they may have with respect to all matters specified in the
Notice of Disagreement. If at the end of such sixty (60) day period (or
earlier by mutual agreement), Buyer and Seller have not reached agreement on
such matters, the matters that remain in dispute (and only such matters) shall
promptly be submitted to Deloitte and Touche LLP (the " _Closing Statement
Arbitrator_ ") for review and final and binding resolution. If Deloitte and
Touche LLP is unable or unwilling to serve as an arbitrator hereunder,

 



_Purchase and Sale Agreement_  then Seller and Buyer shall, in good faith, mutually agree upon an
independent national accounting firm who has not represented either Party at
any time during the five (5) year period of time immediately preceding its
designation hereunder, to serve as the Closing Statement Arbitrator. Buyer and
Seller shall, not later than seven (7) days prior to the hearing date set by
the Closing Statement Arbitrator, each submit a written brief to the Closing
Statement Arbitrator (and a copy thereof to the other Party on the same day)
with dollar figures for settlement of the disputes as to the amount of the
adjusted Adjustment Amount (together with a proposed Closing Statement
that reflects such figures) consistent with their respective calculations
delivered pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_. The hearing shall be conducted on a
confidential basis. The Closing Statement Arbitrator shall consider only those
items or amounts in the Closing Statement which were identified in the Notice
of Disagreement and which remain in dispute and the Closing Statement
Arbitrators decision resolving the matters in dispute shall be based upon and
be consistent with the terms and conditions in this Agreement. In deciding
any matter, the Closing Statement Arbitrator (i) shall be bound by the
provisions of this _Section 2.7_ and the related definitions and (ii) may not
assign a value to any disputed item greater than the greatest value for such
item claimed by either Seller or Buyer or less than the smallest value for
such item claimed by Seller or Buyer in their respective calculations
delivered pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_. The Closing Statement Arbitrator
shall render a decision resolving the matters in dispute (which decision shall
include a written statement of findings and conclusions) promptly after the
conclusion of the hearing, unless the Parties reach agreement prior thereto
and withdraw the dispute from arbitration. The Closing Statement Arbitrator
shall provide to the Parties explanations in writing of the reasons for its
decisions regarding the adjusted Adjustment Amount and shall issue a
Closing Statement reflecting such decision. The decision of the Closing
Statement Arbitrator shall be (i) final and binding on the Parties and (ii)
final and non-appealable for all purposes hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such decision may be reviewed, corrected or set aside by a court of
competent jurisdiction, but only if and to the extent that the Closing
Statement Arbitrator is found by such court of competent jurisdiction (i) to
have made mathematical errors with respect to its decision, or (ii) fraud was
committed by either party. The cost of any arbitration (including the fees and
expenses of the Closing Statement Arbitrator) under this _Section 2.7(b)_
shall be borne entirely by the Party awarded the smaller percentage of the
disputed amount by the Closing Statement Arbitrator. The fees and
disbursements of Sellers independent auditors and other costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the services performed with respect to the
Closing Statement shall be borne by Seller and the fees and disbursements of
Buyers independent auditors and other costs and expenses incurred in
connection with their preparation of the Notice of Disagreement shall be borne
by Buyer. As used in this Agreement, the terms " _Final Closing Statement_ "
shall mean the revised Closing Statement described in _Section 2.7(a)_, as
prepared by Seller and as may be subsequently adjusted to reflect
any subsequent written agreement between the Parties with respect thereto, or
if submitted to the Closing Statement Arbitrator, the Closing Statement issued
by the Closing Statement Arbitrator as described in this _Section 2.7(b)_.

 

(c) _Final Settlement_. If the amount of the adjusted Adjustment Amount as set
forth on the Final Closing Statement exceeds the amount of the Estimated
Adjustment Amount paid at Closing, then, within five (5) days after the Final
Settlement Date, Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount by which the Adjustment
Amount as set forth on the Final Closing Statement exceeds the Estimated
Adjustment Amount paid at Closing. If the amount of the adjusted Adjustment
Amount as set forth on the Final Closing Statement is less than the Estimated

 



_Purchase and Sale Agreement_  Adjustment Amount paid at Closing, then Seller shall pay to Buyer, within
five (5) days after the Final Settlement Date, the amount by which the
adjusted Adjustment Amount, as set forth on the Final Closing Statement, is
less than the Estimated Adjustment Amount shown in the Closing Statement. Any
post-Closing payment made pursuant to this _Section 2.7(c)_ shall be made by
means of a wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account
designated by the Party receiving the funds

and other writings and to take such other actions as may be necessary or
desirable in order to consummate or implement expeditiously the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof.

thereof shall cause, effective as of the Closing Date, the cancellation or
return to Seller of such bonds and guarantees posted (or supported) by the
Company or any of its Affiliates with respect to the Company or the Company
Assets. Buyer shall indemnify Seller and its Affiliates with respect to any
portion of the guaranteed obligations under the CVX Guarantees that are not
replaceable with bonds or letters of credit under the terms thereof (which
amounts are set forth in _Schedule 4.13_ ). Buyer also may provide evidence
that such replacements are not necessary as a result of existing bonds and
guarantees that Buyer has previously posted as long as such existing bonds or
guarantees are adequate to secure the release of those posted (or supported)
by Seller.

6.12 _Non-Solicitation_. Buyer agrees that, for a period beginning on the date
of this Agreement and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, it
will not, and will cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly,
solicit the employment of (including by contracting through an independent
contractor, consultant, or other third party) or hire (including as a
consultant) any of the employees of the Seller or its Affiliates, except as
permitted below, without the prior written consent of Seller. No later than
twenty (20) days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer may present a written list
to Seller of the field employees of Seller and its Affiliates involved with
the operation of the Company Assets that Buyer would like Seller to make
available for employment interviews with Buyer (" _Selected Employees_ ").
Within ten (10) days of receiving Buyers request, Seller shall identify to
Buyer in writing those Selected Employees that Buyer may interview, solicit
for hire, and hire (" _Excepted Employees_ "). Seller agrees to make the
Excepted Employees available to interview with Buyer prior to Closing. Any
Excepted Employee who does not accept Buyers offer of employment within ten
(10) days after Closing shall thereafter cease to be an Excepted Employee and
any further or subsequent solicitation of such employee or hiring of such
employee shall be subject to the conditions and restrictions of this _Section
6.12_. The restrictions above shall not apply to (i) a general advertisement
of employment opportunities by Buyer or its Affiliates not specifically
directed at any employee of Seller and its Affiliates or (ii) any individual
whose employment with Seller and its Affiliates was terminated by Seller and
its Affiliates or has not worked for Seller and its Affiliates for at least
six (6) months prior to such individual being solicited or hired by Buyer or
its Affiliates.

6.13 _Amendment of Schedules_. Prior to Closing, Seller shall have the right
to correct, supplement, or amend the Disclosure Schedules with respect to any
matter hereafter arising or discovered which, if existing or known at the date
of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in
the Disclosure Schedules. Any such correction, supplement, or amendment shall
be delivered to Buyer no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date. For all purposes of this Agreement, including for purposes
of determining whether the

 



_Purchase and Sale Agreement_  conditions set forth in _Article 8_ have been fulfilled, the Disclosure
Schedules shall be deemed to include only that information contained therein
on the date of this Agreement and shall be deemed to exclude all information
contained in any such correction, supplement, or amendment thereto.

6.14  _Assumed Obligations_. Without limiting Buyers rights to indemnity
under this Agreement and Buyers rights under any Title Indemnity Agreement,
from and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall assume and hereby agrees to
fulfill, perform, pay and discharge (or cause to be fulfilled, performed,
paid or discharged) the Assumed Obligations.

6.15 _West Cameron 643 Abandonment Costs_. The West Cameron 643 Abandonment
Costs shall remain the responsibility of Seller and shall not constitute part
of the Assumed Obligations after the Closing Date. To the extent any West
Cameron 643 Abandonment Costs are paid by the Company after the Closing Date,
then Seller shall reimburse the Company for such costs.

6.16 _Suspense Accounts_. On or before the Closing Date, Seller or its
Affiliates shall assign and transfer any suspense accounts related to the
Company Assets to the Company.

6.17 _Financing Matters_. Seller acknowledges that Buyer may undertake an
equity and/or debt financing (collectively, and including, without limitation,
commitments with respect thereto, the " _Financing_ "), the proceeds of which
may be used to fund all or a portion of the Purchase Price. From the date
hereof until the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with its terms, Seller agrees that it shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide, at Buyers sole expense, all customary
cooperation reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with Buyers efforts
to secure the Financing, including (a) using commercially reasonable efforts
to deliver (i) an unaudited balance sheet for the Company as of June 30, 2012,
and June 30, 2011, and the related statements of operations and cash flow for
the six-months ended June 30, 2012, and June 30, 2011 (collectively, the "
_Interim Financial Statements_ "), and (ii) audited balance sheets of the
Company as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and related audited statements of
income, changes in members capital, and cash flow for the years ended

connection with, and consenting to, the delivery of a reserves and estimated
value determination report by W.D. Von Gonten and Company with respect to the
Company Assets as of December 31, 2011, December 31, 2010, and December 31,
2009 (and such other dates that may be applicable in connection with the
Financing); _provided_ , _however_ , that (w) Sellers failure to perform any
of its obligations under this  _Section 6.17_ shall not delay the Closing
hereunder and Buyer may not assert that its conditions to Closing under
_Section 8.1_ have not been satisfied due to any breach

 



_Purchase and Sale Agreement_  by Seller of any of its obligations under this Section 6.17, (x) neither
Seller nor the Company shall be required to pay any commitment or other fee or
incur any other liability in connection with the Financing, (y) such
requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company or the Seller, and (z) neither Seller nor the
Company shall have any liability for any statement, materials or information
(including pro forma statements and projections) provided by Seller or the
Company in connection with the Financing. After Closing, Seller agrees that it
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide as soon as practicable,
at Buyers sole expense, an unaudited balance sheet for the Company as of
September 30, 2012, and September 30, 2011, and the related statements of

September 30, 2011.

6.18 _Payments and Reimbursements_. From the Closing Date until sixty (60)
days following the Final Settlement Date, any proceeds, costs or expenses
that would constitute a Buyers Credit or a Sellers Credit (and other
proceeds, costs or expenses attributable to the Company Assets on or after the
Closing Date) but that are not reflected in the Final Closing Statement shall
be treated as follows: (a) Seller will promptly forward, or cause to be
forwarded, to Buyer any payments received by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller
with respect to proceeds that would constitute a Buyers Credit (or that are
attributable to the Company Assets on or after the Closing Date) but are not
reflected in the Final Closing Statement; (b) Seller will be responsible
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (i) for costs or expenses that would
constitute a Buyers Credit but that are not reflected in the Final Closing
Statement and shall promptly pay, or, if paid by Buyer, promptly reimburse
Buyer for such costs or expenses and (ii) for costs and expenses that have
previously been accounted for as a Sellers Credit but which are paid by Buyer
(or the Company after Closing) and shall promptly reimburse Buyer for such
costs and expenses; (c) Buyer will promptly forward, or cause to be
forwarded, to Seller (i) any payments received by Buyer (or the Company after

accounted for as a Buyers Credit; (d) Buyer will be responsible pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement for costs or expenses that would constitute

the Closing Date) but that are not reflected in the Final Closing Statement
and shall promptly pay, or, if paid by Seller, promptly reimburse Seller for
and hold Seller harmless from and against, such costs or expenses.

6.19 _Interim Period Hedges_. Prior to Closing, Buyer and Seller shall
cooperate and coordinate, and Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts, to acquire the Interim Period Hedges. If Closing does not occur for
any reason (including, without limitation, the termination of this
Agreement by any Party under _Section 10.1_), Seller shall terminate and
settle the Interim Period Hedges. Buyer shall be liable for all costs and
expenses of the Seller in connection with the termination and settlement
of the Interim Period Hedges, including without limitation, any settlement
amount, early termination amount, "close out" amount, breakage fee, penalty or
interest owed by Seller to the hedge counterparty as a result of or arising
out of the termination of the Interim Period Hedges, provided that, if at the
time of such termination and settlement, a termination payment is due to
Seller by the hedge counterparty, Seller shall pay to Buyer one-half of such
termination payment (net of all costs and expenses paid by Seller in
connection with such Interim Period Hedges and the termination thereof).

 



_Purchase and Sale Agreement_ 6.20 _Transition Services Agreement_. If requested by Buyer not less than
twenty (20) days prior to Closing, the Parties will use commercially
reasonable efforts to execute and deliver a transition services agreement
covering services determined by the Parties and on terms and conditions

the Parties.

(c) _Straddle Period_. For purposes of this Agreement, liability for Taxes
with respect to the Company or the Company Assets with respect to any Straddle
Period shall be apportioned as follows: Property and similar ad valorem Taxes
shall be apportioned on a ratable daily basis, and all other Taxes, shall be
apportioned based on an interim closing of the books of the Company as of the
end of the Effective Time. Buyer and Seller shall each timely provide the
other with all information and cooperation reasonably requested by the other
to prepare any Tax Return relating to the Company, the Company Assets or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

7.2 _Responsibility for Tax Audits_. Seller shall control any Tax Audit
relating to the Company or the Company Assets for any Pre-Effective Time Tax
Period with respect to Taxes for which Seller is liable pursuant to _Section
7.1_, and Buyer shall control any other Tax Audit relating to the Company or
the Company Assets; provided, however, that if a Tax Audit relates to Taxes
for which both Parties could be liable under this Agreement, to the extent
practicable, the Tax items with respect to such Tax Audit will be
distinguished and each Party will have the option to control the defense and
settlement of those Taxes for which it could be so liable, but if any Tax
item cannot be identified as being a liability of only one Party or cannot be
separated from a Tax item for which the other Party is liable, Buyer, at its
expense, shall have the option to control the defense and settlement of the
Tax Audit, provided that Buyer shall keep Seller notified of any developments
in such Tax Audit and Seller shall have the right to participate in such Tax
Audit at its own expense; and provided further that no such matter shall be
settled

 



_Purchase and Sale Agreement_  without the written consent of Seller, not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned. Buyer and Seller shall each timely provide the other

transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each Party shall provide the
other with notice of any pending or threatened Tax Audits that could
adversely affect the other.

7.3 _Tax Refunds_. The Parties shall be entitled to any refund with respect
to Taxes for which the Party is responsible pursuant to _Section 7.1_ or

within thirty (30) Business Days after receipt.

7.4 _Transfer Taxes_. Buyer shall be responsible for and indemnify
Seller against any state or local transfer, sales, use, stamp, registration
or other similar Taxes resulting from the transactions contemplated by this

7.5 _Tax Treatment of Indemnities_. Any indemnity paid by a Party to another
Party pursuant to this _Article 7_ or _Article 9_ shall be treated for
federal, state and local income Tax purposes, as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price, unless otherwise required by Law or as agreed by the Parties.

 

7.6 _Survival and Conflict_. The obligations set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_
shall survive Closing for the applicable statute of limitations. Further, in
the event of a conflict between the provisions of this _Article 7_ and any
other provision of this Agreement, this _Article 7_ shall control.

 

7.7 _Section 1031 Exchange_. Seller and Buyer hereby agree that Seller shall
have the right at any time prior to Closing to assign all or a portion of its
rights under this Agreement to a Qualified Intermediary (as that term is
defined in Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(v) of the Treasury Regulations) and/or a
Qualified Exchange Accommodation Titleholder (as that term is defined in
Revenue Procedure 2000-37) in order to accomplish the transaction in a manner
intended to comply, either in whole or in part, with the requirements of a
like-kind exchange pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code. In the event
that Seller assigns its rights under this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
7.7_, Seller agrees to notify Buyer in writing of such assignment at or before
Closing, and Buyer shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the Seller, in connection with enabling the transactions
contemplated herein to qualify in whole or in part as a like-kind exchange
pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code; provided, however, that any costs or
expenses in connection therewith shall be borne solely by Seller and Buyer
shall not be required to incur any additional liability in connection
therewith. Seller and Buyer acknowledge and agree that any assignment of all
or any portion of this Agreement to a Qualified Intermediary and/or Exchange
Accommodation Titleholder shall not release either party from any of their
respective liabilities and obligations to each other under this Agreement.
Without limiting the generality of the above provisions of this  _Section
7.7_, in the event that Seller assigns all or a portion of its rights under
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.7_, then the other certificates,
agreements, instruments and documents to be executed and/or delivered in
connection with this Agreement by Buyer or their Affiliates shall be amended
and modified in a manner satisfactory to Seller to expressly permit, without
further consent or approval, the subsequent assignment and transfer of the
same by the Qualified Intermediary and/or Exchange Accommodation Titleholder
to Seller (or its designee).

period of twelve (12) months. The indemnities provided in _Sections
9.1(b)(iii)_, _(vii)_ , and _(viii)_ shall survive the Closing for a period

Losses under _Section 9.1(b)_ must be made in a Notice delivered to Seller
(or not at all) on or prior to the end of the survival period applicable to
such indemnity as provided above, and the Buyer Indemnified Parties right to
indemnification under _Section 9.1(a)_ and _(b)_ shall be deemed waived and
released if not made on or prior to the end of such survival period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall be no termination of any bona fide
claim asserted pursuant to the indemnities in  _Section 9.1(a)_ and _(b)_ ,
if such bona fide claim is asserted prior to the date of termination for the
applicable indemnity. The Parties intend that this provision modify the
applicable statute of limitations.

 

(c) _Reductions_. The amount of any Losses subject to indemnification under
this shall be reduced or reimbursed, as the case may be, by any third party
insurance proceeds and third party recoveries actually received by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties with respect to such Losses (net of any expenses or costs
incurred in connection with the claim or collection relating thereto and any
increase in premiums as a result thereof). Buyer shall, and shall cause the
Buyer Indemnified Parties to, use commercially reasonable efforts to collect
any amounts available under such insurance coverage and from such other third
party alleged to have responsibility. If a Buyer Indemnified Party receives
an amount under insurance coverage or from such third party with respect to
Losses that were the subject of indemnification under this at any time
subsequent to indemnification provided thereunder, then such Buyer
Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse Seller for such amount (net of any
expenses or costs incurred in connection with the claim or collection relating
thereto and any increase in premiums as a result thereof). 

(d) _Mitigation_. Each Indemnified Party shall make reasonable efforts to
mitigate or minimize Losses under this Agreement upon and after becoming
aware of any event or condition which would reasonably be expected to give
rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable under this _Article 9_ provided,
that such Indemnified Party shall not be required to incur extraordinary
expense or risk to mitigate or minimize any such Losses. If an Indemnified
Party fails to so mitigate an indemnifiable loss under the preceding sentence,
the Indemnifying Party shall have no liability for any portion of such
loss that reasonably could have been avoided had the Indemnified Party made
such efforts.

 



_Purchase and Sale Agreement_ (e) _Payment_. Subject to _Section 9.2(a)_, all amounts for
which indemnification is provided under _Section 7.1_ and this _Article 9_
will be paid in cash in immediately available funds upon (i) agreement of
Buyer and Seller with respect to the amount thereof or (ii) a final, binding
and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction concerning
same.

9.3 _Procedures_. Claims for indemnification under this Agreement shall be
asserted and resolved as follows:

(a) _Third Party Claim_. If any Person entitled to seek indemnification under
_Section 9.1_ (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") receives Notice of the assertion
or commencement of any claim asserted against an Indemnified Party by a third
party (" _Third Party Claim_ ") in respect of any matter that is subject to
indemnification under _Section 9.1_, the Indemnified Party shall promptly (i)
notify the Party obligated to the Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 9.1_
above, (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of the Third Party Claim and (ii)
transmit to the Indemnifying Party Notice (" _Claim Notice_ ") describing in
reasonable detail the nature of the Third Party Claim, a copy of all
papers served with respect to such claim (if any), the Indemnified Partys
best estimate of the amount of Losses attributable to the Third Party Claim
and the basis of the Indemnified Partys request for indemnification under
this Agreement. Failure to timely provide such Claim Notice shall not affect
the right of the Indemnified Partys indemnification hereunder, except to the
extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such delay or omission.

 

(b) _Indemnifying Party_. Except with respect to Tax Audits described in
_Section 7.2_, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the
Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party
notifies the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party elects to assume
the defense of the Third Party Claim (such election to be without prejudice
to the right of the Indemnifying Party to dispute whether such claim is an
indemnifiable Loss under this Agreement), then the Indemnifying Party shall
have the right to defend such Third Party Claim with counsel selected by
the Indemnifying Party (who shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party), by all appropriate proceedings, to a final conclusion or
settlement at the discretion of the Indemnifying Party in accordance with this
_Section 9.3(b)_. The Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such
defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof;
provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement
agreement or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto
without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed) that (i) does not result in
a final resolution of the Indemnified Partys liability to the third party
with respect to the claim (including, in the case of a settlement, an
unconditional written release of the Indemnified Party from all further
liability in respect of such claim) or (ii) may materially and
adversely affect the Indemnified Party (other than as a result of money
damages covered by the indemnity). If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party agrees, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying
Party, to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting
any Third Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest pursuant
to this _Section 9.3(b)_, including the making of any related counterclaim
against the Person asserting the Third Party Claim or any cross complaint
against any Person. The Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control,
any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this  _Section 9.3(b)_, and the Indemnified
Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such
participation.

 



_Purchase and Sale Agreement_ (c) _Indemnified Party_. Except with respect to Tax Audits described in 
_Section 7.2_, if the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified
Party that the Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified Party
pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)_, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right
to defend, and be reimbursed for its reasonable cost and expense (but only if
the Indemnified Party is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder) in
regard to the Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnified Party
(who shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party), by all
appropriate proceedings, which proceedings shall be prosecuted diligently by
the Indemnified Party. In such circumstances, the Indemnified Party shall
defend any such Third Party Claim in good faith and have full control of such
defense and proceedings; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party may not
enter into any compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim if
indemnification is to be sought hereunder, without the Indemnifying Partys
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). The Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any
defense or settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this 
_Section 9.3(c)_, and the Indemnifying Party shall bear its own costs and
expenses with respect to such participation.

(d) _Direct Claim_. Any claim by the Indemnified Party on account of Losses
that does not result from a Third Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") will be
asserted by giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt Notice thereof,
but in any event not later than thirty (30) days after the Indemnified Party
becomes aware of the events that gave rise to such Direct Claim. Such Notice
by the Indemnified Party will describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail,
will include copies of all available material written evidence thereof and
will indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of damages that
has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party
will have a period of ten (10) Business Days within which to respond in
writing to such Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond
within such ten (10) Business Day period, the Indemnifying Party will be
deemed to have rejected such Direct Claim, in which event the Indemnified
Party will be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to the
Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the provisions of this
Agreement.

 

9.4 _Waiver of Consequential Damages_. With respect to any and all Losses for
which indemnification may be available hereunder, no Indemnifying Party shall
have any liability for any consequential, indirect, punitive, exemplary, or
special damages with respect to any claim for which such Indemnifying Party
may have liability pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that this
waiver shall not apply to the extent such consequential, indirect, punitive,
exemplary or special damages are awarded in a Proceeding brought or asserted
by a third party against an Indemnified Party.

 

9.5 _Waivers and Disclaimers_.

(a) _Title and Environmental Matters_. The only representations, warranties,
or covenants being made by Seller with respect to the Companys title to the
Company Assets or the environmental or physical condition of the Company
Assets are in _Section 4.15_ and _Exhibit C_ and all other representations,
warranties, or covenants related to title or the environmental or physical
condition of the Company Assets of any kind or nature, either express,
implied, or statutory, are hereby waived and disclaimed in their entirety.

 



_Purchase and Sale Agreement_ (b) _No Reliance_. Buyer has reviewed and has access to all contracts,
documents, records, and information which it has desired to review in
connection with its decision to enter into this Agreement, and to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer has not relied upon any
representation, warranty, statement, advice, document, projection, or other
information of any type provided by Seller, or its Affiliates, or any of their
Representatives, except for the representations and warranties of Seller set
forth in this Agreement. In deciding to enter into this Agreement, and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer has relied solely upon
its own knowledge, investigation, and analysis (and that of its
Representatives) and not on any disclosure or representation made by, or any
duty to disclose on the part of, Seller or its Affiliates, or any of their
Representatives, other than the representations and warranties of Seller set
forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, nothing
in this Agreement shall restrict or in any way limit claims by the Parties
with respect to breaches or claims based upon fraud, as to which the Parties
shall have all of their rights or remedies at law.

 

(c) _Limited Duties_. Any and all duties and obligations which either Party
may have to the other Party with respect to or in connection with the
Interests, the Company Assets, this Agreement, or the transactions
contemplated hereby are limited to those in this Agreement. The Parties do not
intend (i) that the duties or obligations of either Party, or the rights
of either Party, shall be expanded beyond the terms of this Agreement on the
basis of any legal or equitable principle or on any other basis whatsoever or
(ii) that any equitable or legal principle or any implied obligation of good
faith or fair dealing or any other matter requires either Party to incur,
suffer, or perform any act, condition, or obligation contrary to the terms of
this Agreement and that it would be unfair, and that they do not intend, to
increase any of the obligations of any Party under this Agreement on the
basis of any implied obligation or otherwise.

(d) _Defects_. The Company Assets being transferred to Buyer as a result of
the transfer of the Interests are being accepted by Buyer in their "as is,
where is" condition and state of repair, and with all faults and defects,
without, subject to the exception below, any representation, warranty, or
covenant of any kind or nature, express, implied, or statutory, including, but
not limited to, warranties of marketability, quality, condition, conformity to
samples, merchantability, and/or fitness for a particular purpose, all of
which are expressly disclaimed by Seller and waived by Buyer, except for the
representations and warranties of Seller set forth in this Agreement. Buyer
recognizes that the Company Assets have been used for oil and gas
drilling, completing, fracturing, production, gathering, pipeline,
transportation, storage, and related operations. Physical changes in the
Company Assets and in the lands included therein may have occurred as a result
of such uses. The Company Assets also may include buried pipelines and other
equipment, the locations of which may not be known by Seller or readily
apparent by a physical inspection of the Company Assets. It is understood and
agreed that Buyer shall have inspected prior to Closing (or shall be deemed
to have waived its right to inspect) the leases, equipment, pipelines, and the
associated premises included in the Company Assets and satisfied itself as to
their physical and environmental condition, both surface and subsurface,
and that Buyer shall accept all of the same in their "as is, where is"
condition and state of repair, and with all faults and defects, including, but
not limited to, the presence of naturally occurring radioactive material and
man-made material fibers, subject to the representations and warranties of
Seller set forth in this Agreement.

 



_Purchase and Sale Agreement_ (e) _Additional Disclaimers_. Seller makes no representation, covenant, or
warranty, express, implied, or statutory, (i) as to the accuracy or
completeness of any data or records delivered to Buyer with respect to the
Company or the Company Assets (including, without limitation, any processing,
reprocessing or other interpretation or analysis by the Company, Seller or
any of their Affiliates of any seismic data included in the Company Assets) or
(ii) concerning the quality or quantity of hydrocarbon reserves, if any,
attributable to the Company Assets, or the ability of the Company Assets to
produce hydrocarbons, or the product prices which the Company is or will be
entitled to receive from the sale of any such hydrocarbons.

 

(f) _Waiver of Louisiana Rights in Redhibition_. Buyer expressly waives the
warranty of fitness for intended purposes or guarantee against hidden or
latent redhibitory vices under Louisiana law, including Louisiana civil code
articles 2520 through 2548, and the warranty imposed by Louisiana civil code
article 2475; waives all rights in redhibition pursuant to Louisiana civil
code articles 2520, et seq.; or for restitution or other diminution of the
purchase price; acknowledges that this express waiver shall be considered a
material and integral part of this sale and the consideration thereof;
and acknowledges that this waiver has been brought to the attention of Buyer
and explained in detail and that Buyer has voluntarily and knowingly consented
to this waiver.

9.6 _Exclusive Remedy and Release_. The indemnification and remedies set forth
in _Section 6.3_, _Article 7_, this _Article 9_ , _Exhibit C_ and any Title
Indemnity Agreement shall constitute the sole and exclusive post-Closing
remedies of the Parties with respect to any breach of representation or
warranty or non-performance of any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement. Except as provided in this Agreement or any Title Indemnity
Agreement, if the Closing occurs, each of Buyer and Seller hereby waives,
releases, acquits, and forever discharges the other, its members, their
Affiliates, and its and their officers, directors, members, managers,
partners, employees, or agents, or any other Person acting on behalf of the
other, of and from any and all claims, actions, causes of action, demands,
rights, damages, costs, expenses, Losses, or compensation whatsoever, whether
direct or indirect, known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which such
party, as applicable, may have or which may arise in the future directly or
indirectly arising out of the transactions contemplated hereby, including any
of the foregoing that is from or relating to the possession, use, handling,
management, disposal, investigation, remediation, cleanup, or release of any
Constituents of Concern or any Environmental Law applicable thereto.

 

Article 10.

 

Termination

10.1 _Termination_. At any time prior to the Closing, this Agreement may be
terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby abandoned:

 

(a) by the mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller;

 



_Purchase and Sale Agreement_ (b) by Buyer (provided Buyer is not in material breach of this Agreement),
upon Notice to Seller, if there has been a material breach by Seller of any
representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement that has
prevented the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of Buyer at the
Closing and, if such breach is of a character that it is capable of being
cured, such breach has not been cured by Seller within thirty (30) days after
Notice thereof from Buyer;

(c) by Seller (provided Seller is not in material breach of this Agreement,
excluding _Section 6.17_), upon Notice to Buyer, if there has been a material
breach by Buyer of any representation, warranty, or covenant contained in
this Agreement that has prevented the satisfaction of any condition to the
obligations of Seller at the Closing and, if such breach is of a character
that it is capable of being cured, such breach has not been cured by Buyer
within thirty (30) days after Notice thereof from Seller;

(d) by either Buyer or Seller, upon Notice to the other Party, if any
Governmental Authority having competent jurisdiction has issued a final, non-
appealable Order, decree, ruling or injunction (other than a temporary
restraining order) or taken any other action permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and such injunction shall have become final and non-
appealable;

(e) by either Buyer or Seller, upon Notice to the other Party, if the
transactions contemplated at the Closing have not been consummated by December
31, 2012, provided that neither Buyer nor Seller will be entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.1(e)_ if such Persons
breach of this Agreement has prevented the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

 

(f) by Seller, upon Notice to Buyer, if the sum of all Defect Amounts validly
asserted in any Defect Notice _less_ the sum of all Title Benefit Amounts
validly claimed by Seller under _Exhibit C_ is equal to or greater than 10% of
the Base Purchase Price;

(g) by Buyer, upon Notice to Seller, if the sum of all Defect Amounts validly
asserted in any Defect Notice _less_ the sum of all Title Benefit Amounts
validly claimed by Seller under _Exhibit C_ is equal to or greater than 20%
of the Base Purchase Price; or

(h) by Seller, immediately upon Notice to Buyer, if the Earnest Money Deposit
has not been delivered by Buyer to Seller by 3 pm Houston, Texas time on
September 18, 2012 in accordance with _Section 2.2(b)_.

10.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement
under _Sections 10.1(a)_ , _(b)_ , _(d)_ , _(e)_ (except as provided in the
following sentence),  _(f)_ , and _(g)_ , Seller shall return the Earnest
Deposit to Buyer in immediately available funds within three (3) Business Days
after the event giving rise to such payment to Buyer. If this Agreement is
terminated (i) by Seller under _Section 10.1(c)_, or (ii) by either Party
under _Section 10.1(e)_ if at such time Seller could have terminated this
Agreement under _Section 10.1(c)_ (without regard to any cure periods
provided therein), then Seller shall retain the Earnest Money Deposit as
liquidated damages, which remedy shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
available to Seller for such termination, provided that, nothing in this
_Section 10.2_ shall be construed so as to limit

 



_Purchase and Sale Agreement_  Sellers right to receive any amounts due to it under _Section 6.19_. Buyer
and Seller acknowledge and agree that (i) Sellers actual damages upon the
event of termination of this Agreement as contemplated under the preceding
sentence are difficult to ascertain with any certainty, (ii) that the Earnest
Money Deposit is a reasonable estimate of such actual damages and (iii) such
liquidated damages do not constitute a penalty. If this Agreement is
terminated by Seller under _Section 10.1(h)_, Buyers obligation to deliver
the Earnest Money Deposit to Seller under _Section 2.2(b)_ shall survive such
termination by Seller and Seller shall retain of all of Sellers rights and
remedies in respect of the breach by Buyer of such obligation (including,
without limitation, the right to receive the Earnest Money Deposit and recover
any other damages which Seller may have incurred as a result of such breach).

10.3 _Other Provisions_. Except for Section 10.2, Section 6.3(c), Section
9.1(d), Section 9.4 and Article 11 excluding Section 11.10 (and the
definitions related to any of the foregoing), this Agreement shall, upon
termination hereof pursuant to Section 10.1, become of no further force or
effect. Nothing in Section 10.2 will relieve any Party to this Agreement of
liability for breach of this Agreement occurring prior to any termination, or
for breach of any provision of this Agreement that specifically
survives termination hereunder. The Confidentiality Agreement shall not be
affected by a termination of this Agreement.

Article 11.

11.2 _Assignment_. Neither Party shall assign this Agreement or any part
hereof without the prior written consent of the other Party. Subject to the
foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

11.3 _Rights of Third Parties_. Except for the provisions of _Article 9_ ,
which are intended to be enforceable by the Persons respectively referred to
therein, nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement is intended or shall
be construed to confer upon or give any Person, other than the Parties, any
right or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.

11.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Any facsimile copies
hereof or signature hereon shall, for all purposes, be deemed originals.

11.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Disclosure Schedule
and exhibits to this Agreement), the Assignment and Assumption Agreement, and
the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the
Parties with respect to the subject matter herein and therein and supersede
any other agreements, whether written or oral, that may have been made or
entered into by or among any of the Parties or any of their respective
Affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



_Purchase and Sale Agreement_ 11.6 _Disclosure Schedule_. Unless the context otherwise requires, all
capitalized terms used in the Disclosure Schedule shall have the respective
meanings assigned in this Agreement. No reference to or disclosure of any item
or other matter in the Disclosure Schedule shall be construed as an admission
or indication that such item or other matter is material or that such item or
other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in the Disclosure
Schedule. No disclosure in the Disclosure Schedule relating to any possible
breach or violation of any agreement or Law shall be construed as an
admission or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has
actually occurred. The inclusion of any information in the Disclosure Schedule
shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment by Seller, in and
of itself, that such information is material to or outside the ordinary
course of the business of the Company or required to be disclosed on the
Disclosure Schedule. To the extent readily apparent from the reference that it
would qualify another representation or warranty, each disclosure in the
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to qualify all representations and
warranties of Seller notwithstanding the lack of a specific cross-reference.

 

11.7 _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended or modified in whole or in
part, and terms and conditions may be waived, only by a duly authorized
agreement in writing that makes reference to this Agreement executed by each
Party.

11.8 _Publicity_. Buyer and Seller may make a press release or other public
communication or announcement in connection with the execution of this
Agreement, provided that the Person making such release, communication, or
announcement provides the other Party reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on any such release, communication, or announcement. Except for the
foregoing, all press releases or other public communications of any nature
whatsoever relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
the method of the release for publication thereof, shall be subject to the
prior written consent of Buyer and Seller, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed by such Party. Nothing herein
shall prevent a Party from publishing such press releases or other public
communications as is necessary to satisfy such Partys obligations at Law or
under the rules of any stock or commodities exchange after consultation with
the other Party. If a Party believes it is required to issue or make any
press release or announcement, such Party shall (i) give prompt notice thereof
to the other Party, (ii) allow such other Party reasonable opportunity to
review and provide comments with respect to the content of such press release
or announcement and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to incorporate
any reasonable comment from any other Party prior to any release or
announcement.

 

11.9 _Severability_. If any court of competent jurisdiction holds any
provision of this Agreement invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The Parties further
agree that if any provision contained herein is, to any extent, held invalid
or unenforceable in any respect under the Laws governing this Agreement,
they shall take any actions necessary to render the remaining provisions of
this Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by Law
and, to the extent necessary, shall amend or otherwise modify this Agreement
to replace any provision contained herein that is held invalid or
unenforceable with a valid and enforceable provision giving effect to the
intent of the Parties to the greatest extent legally permissible.

 



_Purchase and Sale Agreement_ 11.10 _Certain Remedies_. Seller agrees that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by
Seller prior to Closing or in connection with the consummation of Closing in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached by Seller. It
is accordingly agreed that Buyer will be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Seller prior to Closing
or in connection with the consummation of Closing and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof against Seller in any court having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which Buyer is
entitled at law or in equity, without posting any bond or other undertaking.
Prior to Closing, Sellers remedies for any breach by Buyer of this Agreement
will be limited to those set forth in _Section 10.1_ and _Section 10.2_.
After Closing, the Parties will be entitled to any remedy available at law or
in equity for breaches of this Agreement.

 

11.11 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

(a) _Law_. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with
the Laws of the State of Texas, without regard to the Laws that might be
applicable under conflicts of laws principles. 

(b) _Forum_. The Parties agree that the appropriate, exclusive and convenient
forum for any disputes between any of the Parties hereto arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be in any state or
federal court in Harris County, Texas, and each of the Parties hereto
irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of such courts solely in respect of
any legal proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement. The Parties
further agree that the Parties shall not bring suit with respect to any
disputes arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
in any court or jurisdiction other than the above specified courts. The
Parties further agree, to the extent permitted by Law, that a final and
nonappealable judgment against a Party in any action or proceeding
contemplated above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any other
jurisdiction within or outside the United States by suit on the judgment, a
certified or exemplified copy of which shall be conclusive evidence of the
fact and amount of such judgment. Except to the extent that a different
determination or finding is mandated due to the applicable law being that of a
different jurisdiction, the Parties agree that all judicial determinations or
findings by a state or federal court in Harris County, Texas with respect to
any matter under this Agreement shall be binding.

(c) _Jurisdiction_. To the extent that any Party hereto has or hereafter may
acquire any immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process
(whether through service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment
in aid of execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its
property, each such party hereby irrevocably (i) waives such immunity in
respect of its obligations with respect to this Agreement, and (ii) submits to
the personal jurisdiction of any court described in _Section 11.11(b)_.

 

(d) _Waiver_. The Parties hereto agree that they hereby irrevocably waive the
right to trial by jury in any action to enforce or interpret the provisions
of this Agreement.

 



_Purchase and Sale Agreement_ 11.12 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of
the Company, the Seller or any of their respective former, current or future
officers, directors, managers, employees, agents and other representatives and
Affiliates shall have any rights or claims against any Financing Source or
other Financing Related Party in connection with the Financing or in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including Section 11.3 and
Section 11.7, (a) no amendment or modification to this Section 11.12 (or
amendment or modification with respect to any related definitions as they
affect this Section 11.12) shall be effective without the prior written
consent of each Financing Source or Financing Related Party and (b) each
Financing Source and Financing Related Party shall be an express third party
beneficiary of, and shall have the right to enforce, this Section 11.12.
