 If Purchaser and Seller cannot agree prior to Closing upon an amount to be paid for all of Seller\'s Used Truck Inventory or an amount to be paid for Seller\'s parts and accessories other than Non-Obsolete parts and accessories and core inventories, then all transactions contemplated by this Agreement other than the sale of the Seller\'s Used Truck Inventory and/or Seller\'s parts and accessories other than Non-Obsolete parts and accessories and core inventories shall occur pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, except that (a) Seller\'s Used Truck Inventory and/or Seller\'s parts and accessories (other than Non-Obsolete parts and accessories and core inventories) shall be classified as Excluded Assets; (b) if Seller\'s Used Truck Inventory is classified as Excluded Assets, then at Seller\'s option, (i) Seller will sell the trucks that constitute Seller\'s Used Truck Inventory on a wholesale basis and such action shall not be deemed to violate _Section 12.8(a)_ hereof, or (ii) Purchaser will use commercially reasonable efforts for 120 days after the Closing Date to sell the trucks that constitute Seller\'s Used Truck Inventory for prices agreed to by one of the Shareholders or their designee on a consigned basis for a fee of 10% of the final sale price of each truck (to be paid to Purchaser); and (c) if Seller\'s parts and accessories other than Non-Obsolete parts and accessories and core inventories are classified as Excluded Assets, then Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts for a period of 180 days to sell such parts and accessories for the same prices as Purchaser would sell like parts or accessories on a consigned basis for a fee of 10% of the final sale price of each part or accessory.

Except as specifically set forth in this _Section 3.2_, Purchaser shall not assume, and shall not be treated as having assumed, any liability or obligation of Seller of any nature whatsoever. 

  

 3.3 _Damage to Assets_. If, on or before the Closing Date, any of the Assets are damaged or destroyed, Seller will immediately notify Purchaser in writing of such damage or destruction. In the event of any such damage or destruction, Purchaser (a) may choose not to purchase any or all of the damaged or destroyed assets and reduce the cash portion of the Purchase Price by an amount attributable to the damages or destroyed assets which is to be an amount negotiated by Seller and Purchaser and (b) shall complete the purchase of the remainder of the Assets. Purchaser shall have no obligation to purchase any Assets that are damaged or destroyed before the Closing Date.

Purchaser will also at its own expense file all necessary non-Income Tax Returns arising in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event a taxing authority asserts that any of the taxes, fees and charges (including penalties and interest) resulting from the transaction set out in this Agreement are due from Seller, and/or Seller is obligated to pay such amounts to a taxing authority, Purchaser agrees to pay such amounts and indemnifies Seller (pursuant to the requirements of _Article 14.1_ of this Agreement) with respect to any such taxes, fees and charges (including penalties and interest). 

  

 3.6 _Allocation of Purchase Price_.

At or prior to the Closing, Purchaser will reimburse Seller for any service fee charged to Seller by IBS in connection with the purchase of Seller\'s accounts receivable. Seller shall be solely responsible for the repurchase of any unpaid accounts receivable if IBS is unable to collect such accounts. After the Closing Date, Purchaser covenants and agrees not to sell parts or accessories to, or perform service for, any former customer of Seller upon notification by IBS that such customer has not paid any amount due Seller (other than amounts that are subject to a legitimate dispute) for the purchase of parts or the performance of service prior to the Closing Date, for so long as such Customer\'s accounts receivable due Seller remain unpaid, provided that Purchaser\'s sale of parts or accessories to such former customers on a cash or credit card basis shall not constitute a violation of Purchaser\'s covenant and agreement in this sentence, unless knowingly sold to such former customer in violation of this _Section 3.7_.

 (a)

 _By Seller and the Shareholders_. Seller and the Shareholders each recognize and acknowledge that they have and will have access to certain confidential information of Seller that is included in the Assets (including, but not limited to, lists of customers, and costs and financial information) that after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be valuable, special and unique property of Purchaser. From the date of this Agreement, Seller and the Shareholders each agree that they will not disclose, and they will use their best efforts to prevent disclosure by any other Person of, any such confidential information to, nor discuss any of the terms of this Agreement with, any Person for any purpose or reason whatsoever, except to authorized representatives of Purchaser. Seller and the Shareholders each recognize and agree that violation of any of the agreements contained in this _Section 12.6(a) _ will cause irreparable damage or injury to Purchaser, the exact amount of which may be impossible to ascertain, and that for such reason, among others, Purchaser shall be entitled to an injunction, without the necessity of posting bond therefor, restraining any further violation of such agreements. Such rights to any injunction shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights and remedies Purchaser may have at law or in equity against either Seller or the Shareholders.  


(b)

 _By Purchaser_. Purchaser recognizes and acknowledges that it may have access to certain confidential information of Seller that is not included in or connected with the Assets and not used or necessary for the Business that after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be valuable, special and unique property of Seller. Purchaser agrees that it will not disclose, and will use its best efforts to prevent disclosure by any other Person of, any such confidential information to any Person for any purpose or reason whatsoever, except to authorized representatives of Purchaser. Purchaser recognizes and agrees that violation of any of the agreements contained in this _Section 12.6(b)_ will cause irreparable damage or injury to Seller, the exact amount of which may be impossible to ascertain, and that for such reason, among others, Seller shall be entitled to an injunction, without the necessity of posting bond therefor, restraining any further violation of such agreements. Such rights to any injunction shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights and remedies Seller may have at law or in equity against Purchaser.  


(c)

 _Exceptions_. The foregoing restrictions will not apply to any information which (i) becomes available to the public generally (otherwise than by reason of a breach of the provisions of this _Section 12.6_), (ii) can be shown by written records to have been known by the disclosing party prior to the date of this Agreement or (iii) is lawfully acquired by the disclosing party from another Person. In the event any confidential information protected by this _Section 12.6_ is required to be disclosed under court or governmental order, rule or regulation, the party required to disclose such confidential information shall immediately provide the party entitled to protection hereunder with notice thereof and shall give full and complete cooperation to such party in its efforts to object to, and to obtain protection of any confidential information that is the subject of, such required disclosure. 
  

  

 12.7 _Assignment of Contracts_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement or any related document shall be construed as an attempt to assign any Contract set forth on _Schedule 4.8_ (as supplemented) under the heading "Consents," without the consent of the 

        
  

other parties thereto unless such consent has been given, or as a matter of
law or by its terms, passes to Purchaser as an incident of the transfers and
assignments to be made under this Agreement. In the event that not all
consents listed on _Schedule 4.8_ (as supplemented) are obtained prior to the
Closing Date, Seller may, in its discretion, elect to waive the condition set
forth in _Section 11.10_ and Purchaser may, in its discretion, elect to waive
the condition set forth in _Section 10.5_. If both Seller and Purchaser
elect to waive said conditions and close the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, then in order for Purchaser to realize the full value of said
Contracts, Seller, at the request and expense of Purchaser, shall take all
such action and do or cause to be done all such things as will, in
the reasonable judgment of Purchaser, be necessary or proper to perform
Seller\'s obligations under such Contracts and preserve their value for the
benefit of Purchaser, including obtaining payment due under said Contracts.
Seller shall promptly pay over to Purchaser all moneys collected by or paid to
it in respect of every such Contract. Nothing in this _Section 12.7_shall
relieve Seller or the Shareholders of their obligations to make their best
efforts to obtain any of the consents set forth on _Schedule 4.8_(as
supplemented) required for the transfer of the Assets and all
rights thereunder to Purchaser.

   

 12.8 _Noncompetition; Nonsolicitation_. 

  

  

 (a)

 _Noncompetition_. Subject to the last paragraph of _Section 3._1, in consideration of the benefits of this Agreement to Seller and the Shareholders and as a material inducement to Purchaser to enter into this Agreement and to pay the Purchase Price, Seller and the Shareholders each hereby covenant and agree that (i) for a period of three years after the Closing Date, neither Seller nor the Shareholders shall, and each shall cause their Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, as proprietor, partner, stockholder, director, officer, employee, consultant, joint venturer, investor or in any other capacity, engage in, or own, manage, operate or control, or participate in the ownership, management, operation or control, of any entity which engages in the business of selling, servicing, renting, leasing, insuring or financing new or used Class 3 through 8 trucks or any other business activity in which Purchaser or any of its Affiliates participates within 200 miles of any of Rush\'s or any of its Affiliates\' geographical or commercial markets, as set forth in Rush\'s dealership agreements with Peterbilt; and (ii) for a period of five years after the Closing Date, neither Seller nor the Shareholders shall, and each shall cause their Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, as proprietor, partner, stockholder, director, officer, employee, consultant, joint venturer, investor or in any other capacity, engage in, or own, manage, operate or control, or participate in the ownership, management, operation or control, of any entity which engages in the business of selling, servicing, renting, leasing, insuring or financing new or used Class 3 through 8 trucks or any other business activity in which Purchaser or any of its Affiliates participates within 200 miles of any of Seller\'s or any of its Affiliates\' geographical or commercial markets, as set forth in Seller\'s dealership agreements with Peterbilt. Provided, however, the foregoing shall not, in any event, prohibit Seller or the Shareholders from purchasing and holding as an investment not more than 1% of any class of publicly traded securities of any entity which conducts a business in competition with the business of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, so long as neither Seller nor the Shareholders participate in any way in the management, operation or control of such entity. It is further recognized and agreed that, even though the activity may not be restricted under the foregoing provision, for a period of three years following the Closing Date, neither Seller nor the Shareholders shall, and each shall cause their Affiliates not to, provide any services to any person or entity which may be used against, or in conflict with the interests of, Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser.  


(b)

 _Judicial Reformation_. Seller and the Shareholders acknowledge that, given the nature of Purchaser and its Affiliates\' business, the covenants contained in this _Section 12.8_ establish reasonable limitations as to time, geographic area and scope of activity to be 
  

      

    

restrained and do not impose a greater restraint than is reasonably necessary
to protect and preserve the goodwill of Purchaser and its Affiliates\'
business and to protect their legitimate business interests. If, however,
this _Section 12.8_ is determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to
be unenforceable by reason of it extending for too long a period of time or
over too large a geographic area or by reason of it being too extensive in any
other respect or for any other reason, it will be interpreted to extend only
over the longest period of time for which it may be enforceable, over the
largest geographic area as to which it may be enforceable and to the maximum
extent in all other aspects as to which it may be enforceable, all as
determined by such court.

   

 (c)

 _Customer Lists, Nonsolicitation_. In consideration of the benefits of this Agreement to Seller and the Shareholders and as a material inducement to Purchaser to enter into this Agreement and to pay the Purchase Price, Seller and the Shareholders each hereby further covenant and agree that for a period of five years following the Closing Date, Seller and the Shareholders shall not, and each shall cause their Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, (i) use or make known to any person or entity the names or addresses of any clients or customers of any of Seller, Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser or any other information pertaining to them, (ii) call on, solicit, take away or attempt to call on, solicit or take away any clients or customers of any of Seller, Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser, or (iii) solicit for employment, recruit, hire or attempt to recruit or hire any employees of any of Seller, Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser.  


(d)

 _Equitable Relief_. In the event of a breach or a threatened breach by either Seller or the Shareholders, or any of their respective Affiliates, of any of the provisions contained in this _Section 12.8_, Seller and the Shareholders each acknowledge that Purchaser and its Affiliates will suffer irreparable injury not fully compensable by money damages and, therefore, will not have an adequate remedy available at law. Accordingly, Purchaser shall be entitled, without the necessity of posting a bond, to obtain such injunctive relief or other equitable remedy from any court of competent jurisdiction as may be necessary or appropriate to prevent or curtail any such breach, threatened or actual. The foregoing shall be in addition to and without prejudice to any other rights that Purchaser may have under this Agreement, at law or in equity, including, without limitation, the right to sue for damages.  


(e)

 _Covenants Independent_. The separate covenants of each of Seller and the Shareholders contained in this _Section 12.8_ will be construed as independent of any other provision in this Agreement, and the existence of any claim or cause of action by Seller or the Shareholders against Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser will not constitute a defense to the enforcement by Purchaser of said provisions. Seller and the Shareholders each understand that the provisions contained in this _Section 12.8_ are essential elements of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, but for their agreement to be bound by the provisions of this _Section 12.8_, Purchaser would not have agreed to enter into this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Seller and the Shareholders each have been advised to consult with, and each represents that it or they have consulted with, counsel in order to be informed in all respects concerning the reasonableness and propriety of this _Section 12.8_ and each acknowledges that the provisions of this _Section 12.8_ are reasonable in all respects. 
  

  

 12.9 _Repayment of Receivables from Affiliates_. Seller and the Shareholders each hereby covenant and agree that at the Closing the Shareholders shall pay for the entire amount due on the accounts receivables from the Shareholders purchased by Purchaser pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)(xv)_ and detailed on _Attachment B_. 

        
  

 12.10 _Repossession Losses, Finance Charge Backs and Buybacks_. Purchaser hereby covenants and agrees that from and after the Closing Purchaser shall assume all liability for repossession losses, finance charge backs and buybacks (including in the latter case lease residual values) incurred in the normal course of the Business, whether prior to or after Closing, and Purchaser will fully indemnify Seller and the Shareholders from any liability associated with such liabilities. 

   

 12.11 _Collection of Warranty Receivables and Delivery of Funds to Seller_. After Closing, the Purchaser, as Seller\'s agent, will use its best efforts to collect the Warranty Receivables owned and retained by Seller by taking those steps necessary to collect such Warranty Receivables in accordance with Purchaser\'s normal policies and procedures for collecting its own warranty receivables. Purchaser agrees to deliver the funds collected from Seller\'s Warranty Receivables to Seller on a monthly basis within 30 days of receipt of such funds. 

  

 12.12 _Release of Guarantees_. If at Closing Seller and the Shareholders have not been released from all guarantees of indebtedness of Seller that are directly related to the Business as listed on _Schedule 12.12_ (other than guarantees of indebtedness related to Excluded Assets, or floor plan financing in place as of the Closing Date to secure Contracts in Transit Receivables), and if after Closing any beneficiaries under any such guarantees require payment by the Seller or Shareholders as guarantors, then Purchaser agrees to pay directly to the beneficiaries of any such guarantees the amounts of such required payments arising out of such guarantees, at the times and in the manner required under any such guarantees, and Rush shall indemnify Seller and the Shareholders with respect to any liability after the Closing under such guarantees. 

   

    13. INDEMNITY BY SELLER AND THE SHAREHOLDERS. 

  

 13.1 _Indemnity_. Seller and the Shareholders (the " _Seller Indemnifying Parties_ ") shall, and hereby do, Jointly and Severally indemnify, hold harmless and defend Purchaser and its officers, directors, employees, agents, consultants, representatives and Affiliates (collectively, the " _Purchaser Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all penalties, demands, damages, punitive damages asserted by third parties against a Purchaser Indemnified Party, or losses, liabilities, suits, costs, costs of any settlement or judgment, claims of any and every kind whatsoever, refund obligations (including, without limitation, interest and penalties thereon) and remediation costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\' fees), of any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties (collectively, " _Purchaser Damages_ "), in any event which Purchaser Damages have been paid by Purchaser Indemnified Parties or incurred by Purchaser Indemnified Parties resulting or arising from or incurred in connection with any one or more of the following (provided that this _Section 13.1_ shall not apply either to any Assumed Obligations or any other liabilities or obligations that have been expressly assumed by Purchaser under this Agreement, or to Purchaser Environmental Liabilities): 

  

  

 (a)

    14. INDEMNITY BY PURCHASER. 

  

 14.1 _Indemnity_. Rush and all Persons included in the Purchaser (the " _Purchaser Indemnifying Parties_ ") shall, and hereby do, Jointly and Severally indemnify, hold harmless and defend Seller and the Shareholders and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, consultants, representatives and Affiliates (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all penalties, demands, damages, punitive damages asserted by third parties against a Seller Indemnified Party, or losses, liabilities, suits, costs, costs of any settlement or judgment, claims of any and every kind whatsoever, refund obligations (including, without limitation, interest and penalties thereon) and remediation costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\' fees), of any of the Seller Indemnified Parties (collectively, " _Seller Damages_ "), in any event which Seller Damages have been paid by Seller Indemnified Parties or incurred by Seller Indemnified Parties resulting or arising from or incurred in connection with any one or more of the following:

(b)

 all claims (whether in contract, in tort or otherwise, and whether or not successful), fines, penalties, liabilities, damages and losses, including but not limited to remedial, removal, response, abatement, clean-up, investigation and monitoring costs and any other related costs and expenses incurred (whether any claims or causes of action relating thereto be asserted in common law or under statute and regardless of form including strict liability and negligence) arising from (a) any violation of any Requirement of Environmental Law or Environmental Permits of Purchaser occurring after the Closing Date; (b) any acts, omissions, conditions, facts, or circumstances occurring after the Closing Date with respect to the Assets, the Business or the operations of Purchaser which give rise to an Environmental Claim after the Closing Date; and (c) any failure of Purchaser to obtain or maintain after the Closing Date, any Environmental Permit;

The Purchaser Indemnifying Parties shall promptly pay, no more frequently than once every 30 days, to Seller or the Shareholders, as applicable, in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds the amount of any Seller Damages to which Seller or the Shareholders, as applicable, may become entitled by reason of the provisions of this Agreement. 

  

 14.3 _Limitations on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Purchaser Indemnifying Parties shall not be liable to indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties for any matter that could be made subject of a claim under this _Article 14_ until the aggregate amount of any

Indemnifying Parties shall be liable to indemnify the Seller Indemnified
Parties for any and all Seller Damages in excess of $500,000. Additionally,
notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, the total
indemnification obligation of the Purchaser Indemnifying Parties to the Seller
Indemnified Parties in connection with any and all Seller Damages shall be
$4,000,000, and the Purchaser Indemnifying Parties shall have no further
indemnification obligations to the Seller Indemnified Parties once, in
the aggregate, the Seller Indemnified Parties have received payment of Seller
Damages from the Purchaser Indemnifying Parties in such amount, except for
claims related to any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or nonfulfillment
of any covenant or agreement on the part of Purchaser, contained in _Sections
5.2_ and _12.10_ and any indemnification provided by Purchaser to Seller and
the Shareholders under the provisions of _Section 12.12_ and claims made
pursuant to _Sections 14.1(b)_ and  _14.1(d)_ , none of which shall not be
subject to such limitation.

  

 14.4 _Insurance and Refunds_. The Purchaser Indemnifying Parties\' indemnification obligations shall be reduced to the extent that any Seller Damages are covered by and paid to a Seller Indemnified Party or any of their Affiliates pursuant to a warranty or indemnification from a third party or third party insurance.

    15. INDEMNIFICATION MATTERS 

  

 15.1 Third-Party Claims 

  

  

 (a)

 Promptly after receipt by a Person entitled to indemnity under _Article 13_ or _14_  (as appropriate) (an " _Indemnified Person_ ") of notice of the assertion of a claim by a third party that gives rise to damages from and against which such Person is indemnified under _Article 13_ or _14_ (as appropriate) (a " _Third- Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Person shall give notice to the Person obligated to indemnify under _Article 13_ or _14_ (an " _Indemnifying Person_ ") of the assertion of such Third-Party Claim, provided that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person will not relieve the Indemnifying Person of any liability that it may have to any Indemnified Person, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Person demonstrates that the defense of such Third-Party Claim is prejudiced by the Indemnified Person\'s failure to give such notice.  


(b)

 If an Indemnified Person gives notice to the Indemnifying Person pursuant to _Section 15.1_ of the assertion of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third-Party Claim and, to the extent that it wishes (unless (i) the Indemnifying Person is also a Person against whom the Third-Party Claim is made and the Indemnified Person determines in good faith that joint representation would be inappropriate or (ii) the Indemnifying Person fails to provide reasonable assurance to the Indemnified Person of its financial capacity to defend such Third-Party Claim and provide indemnification with respect to such Third-Party Claim), to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person. After notice from the Indemnifying Person to the Indemnified Person of its 
  

      

    

election to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Person shall not, so long as it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to
the Indemnified Person under _Article 13_ or  _14_ (as appropriate) for any
fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of
such Third-Party Claim, in each case subsequently incurred by the Indemnified
Person in connection with the defense of such Third-Party Claim, other than
reasonable costs of investigation. If the Indemnifying Person assumes the
defense of a Third-Party Claim, (i) such assumption will conclusively
establish for purposes of this Agreement that the claims made in that Third-
Party Claim are within the scope of and subject to indemnification, and (ii)
no compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claims may be effected by the
Indemnifying Person without the Indemnified Person\'s consent unless (A)
there is no finding or admission of any violation of any legal requirement or
any violation of the rights of any Person; (B) the sole relief provided is
monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Person; and (C) the
Indemnified Person shall have no liability with respect to any compromise or
settlement of such Third-Party Claims effected without its consent. If notice
is given to an Indemnifying Person of the assertion of any Third-Party Claim
and the Indemnifying Person does not, within ten Business Days after the
Indemnified Person\'s notice is given, give notice to the Indemnified Person
of its election to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Person will be bound by any determination made in such Third-
Party Claim or any compromise or settlement effected by the Indemnified
Person.

   

 (c)

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Indemnified Person determines in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that a Third-Party Claim may adversely affect it or its Affiliates other than as a result of monetary damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Person may, by notice to the Indemnifying Person, assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise or settle such Third-Party Claim, but the Indemnifying Person will not be bound by any determination of any Third-Party Claim so defended for the purposes of this Agreement or any compromise or settlement effected without its consent (which may not be unreasonably withheld).  


(d)

 With respect to any Third-Party Claim subject to indemnification under _Article 13_ or _14_ (as appropriate), (i) both the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person, as the case may be, shall keep the other Person fully informed of the status of such Third-Party Claim and any related legal proceedings at all stages thereof where such Person is not represented by its own counsel, and (ii) the parties agree (each at its own expense) to render to each other such assistance as they may reasonably require of each other and to cooperate in good faith with each other in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of any Third-Party Claim.  


(e)

 With respect to any Third-Party Claim subject to indemnification under _Article 13_ or _14_ (as appropriate), the parties agree to cooperate in such a manner as to preserve in full (to the extent possible) the confidentiality of all confidential information and the attorney-client and work-product privileges. In connection therewith, each party agrees that: (i) it will use its best efforts, in respect of any Third-Party Claim in which it has assumed or participated in the defense, to avoid production of confidential information (consistent with applicable law and rules of procedure), and (ii) all communications between any party hereto and counsel responsible for or participating in the defense of any Third-Party Claim shall, to the extent possible, be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privilege. 
  

  

 15.2 _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement or any other Agreement or document entered into with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, the parties 

        
  

hereto acknowledge and agree that their exclusive remedy with respect to any
and all claims against the other parties hereto relating to any of this
Agreement, the Assets, the Business, or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in
_Articles 13_ and _14_ , as applicable, and specific performance (if
specific performance is appropriate to enforce any covenants or agreements of
the other parties set forth in this Agreement).

  

 15.3 _Limitation on Damages_. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no party providing indemnification under this Agreement shall have any obligation to indemnify any party entitled to indemnification for loss of profits or for consequential, incidental, punitive or exemplary damages. 

  

 15.4 _Survival of Indemnification Obligations_. The indemnification obligations set forth in Articles 13, 14 and 15 of this Agreement shall survive for a period of eighteen months from the Closing Date. The indemnification obligations of the Seller Indemnifying Parties to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, on the one hand, and of the Purchaser Indemnifying Parties to the Seller Indemnified Parties, on the other hand, shall only apply to claims for indemnification of which the party seeking indemnification has given the party obligated to provide indemnification written notice of a claim for indemnification, setting forth in reasonable detail the nature and basis of the claim and an estimate of the dollar amount thereof, on or before 548 days after the Closing Date. 

  

    16. ASSUMPTION OF LEASES. At Closing, Seller and Purchaser
shall execute Agreements for Lease Assignment for each Dealership Leased
Facility evidencing the assignment of such leases by Seller and the
assumption of the obligations of the lessee or tenant under such leases by
Purchaser.

   

    17. SPECIAL PROVISIONS REGARDING EMPLOYEES OF SELLER. 

  

 17.1 _New Employees of Purchaser_. It is the intention of Purchaser, and Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees with such position, that any Employees hired by Purchaser (" _Transferred Employees_ ") will be new employees of Purchaser as of the Closing Date or the date of hire, whichever is later. 

  

  

 (a)

 _Credited Service_. On and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall give the Transferred Employees full credit for purposes of eligibility to participate, early retirement eligibility and vesting under any Employee Plans maintained by Purchaser for the Transferred Employees\' service with Seller and the Business to the same extent recognized by the Seller and the Business immediately prior to the Closing Date.  


(b)

 _Employee Benefits_. Purchaser shall: (i) allow each Transferred Employee participating in the Savings Plan as of the Closing Date to become a participant in Rush\'s defined contribution plan that is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and that includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code as of the Closing Date; (ii) effective as of the Closing, make available to all Transferred Employees employee benefits substantially similar in the aggregate as those available to similarly situated employees of the Purchaser; (iii) effective as of the Closing Date, waive any pre-existing condition or waiting period requirements, if any, for the Transferred Employees (and their eligible dependents) under Purchaser\'s health and dental plans or other welfare benefit plans of Purchaser (" _Purchaser Welfare Plans_ ") to the extent restricted by the applicable plan document, policy or insurance carrier and, if applicable, such carrier will waive such requirements upon request by Purchaser; (iv) effective as of the Closing, the Purchaser 401(k) Plan will accept rollovers of benefits distributed to Transferred Employees from the Savings Plan; and (v) provide each Transferred Employee with credit under any Purchaser Welfare Plan for any co-payments and deductibles paid under a corresponding Seller plan in the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket 
  

      

    

requirements under any Purchaser Welfare Plan in which the Transferred
Employees are eligible to participate after Closing.

   

 (c)

 _COBRA_. The Purchaser shall be responsible for providing continuation health coverage, as required under the Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (" _COBRA_ "), to all Employees or former Employees of Seller (" _Affected Employees_ ") and their eligible dependents, as if any such Affected Employees had for purposes of COBRA been employed by Purchaser at all times relevant before the Closing Date, and the Purchaser shall indemnify Seller and Shareholders for any and all loss, cost or expense relating to liabilities and claims arising under COBRA subsequent to the Closing Date. The Purchaser shall maintain an employee welfare benefit plan (as defined in section 3(1) of ERISA) to the extent and for the entire period necessary to satisfy the COBRA obligations, which are outlined in this Section. The provisions of this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall last as long as Purchaser is obligated to provide COBRA to the Affected Employees under applicable law. 
  

  

 17.2 _Cooperation in Employment Screening_. Purchaser specifically does not commit to hire any of the Employees. However, Seller understands and acknowledges that Purchaser intends to offer substantially equivalent employment to substantially all of the Employees as of the Closing Date. Purchaser therefore expects to be able to review Employee records and conduct Employee interviews. Seller agrees that after the date hereof it will make, on a confidential basis, its Employee records available to Purchaser and permit Purchaser to contact its Employees for the purpose of conducting Employee interviews. Seller further agrees to make its Employees designated by Purchaser available to Purchaser for such purpose between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date. 

  

 17.3 _Existing Employee Plans; Assumption of Vacation and Sick Leave Obligations_. At the Closing, Purchaser shall assume Seller\'s obligations to Employees hired by Purchaser for accrued but unused vacation and sick leave. Except for vacation and sick leave time and COBRA obligations assumed by Purchaser as set forth above, Purchaser shall have no obligation after the Closing to continue any pension plans, 401(k) plans or work benefit plans currently offered by Seller to Employees. Except for vacation and sick leave time and COBRA obligations assumed by Purchaser as set forth above, Seller and the Shareholders Jointly and Severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser from and against any claim which may arise because of the failure to continue such pension plans or work benefit programs. 

  

    18. TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated without
(except as provided in this _Article 18_) further obligation of the parties,
as follows:

  

 18.1 _Mutual Consent_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to Closing by mutual written consent of the parties hereto. 

  

 18.2 _Failure of Purchaser to Waive Condition_. This Agreement may be terminated by Seller or any Shareholder as provided in _Section 10.9_. 

  

 18.3 _Non-Satisfaction of Conditions_. This Agreement may be terminated by Purchaser on the one hand, or by Seller or any Shareholder on the other hand, if all conditions, as set forth in this Agreement, to any such party\'s obligations under this Agreement are not satisfied or waived on or prior to the Closing Date. Any such termination shall not limit the remedies additionally available to a party as a result of misrepresentations of or breaches by another party, and any such termination shall not limit Seller\'s and the Shareholders\' right, if any, to be paid the Termination Fee. 

  

 18.4 _Failure to Close_. This Agreement will automatically terminate on June 30, 2005, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before such date, unless the parties shall have otherwise agreed in writing prior to such date. Any such termination shall not limit the remedies additionally available to a party as 

        
  

a result of misrepresentations of or breaches by another party, and any such
termination shall not limit Seller\'s and the Shareholders\' right, if any, to
be paid the Termination Fee.

  

 18.5 _Termination Fee_. In the event that (i) Purchaser terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 18.3_ due to non-satisfaction of the condition provided for in  _Section 10.15_, or (ii) Seller terminates this Agreement in accordance with  _Section 11.8_, Purchaser will be obligated to immediately pay to Seller and the Shareholders a fee in the amount of $1,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "). In the event that the Closing shall not have occurred on or before November 30, 2004, then Purchaser and Seller will enter into an escrow agreement (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ") with an escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") mutually acceptable to Purchaser and Seller, and Purchaser will deliver the Termination Fee in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified by the Escrow Agent to be held in escrow pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. If the Closing shall not have occurred by November 30, 2004 and Purchaser has shall not have paid the Termination Fee to an Escrow Agent, then Seller or the Shareholders may terminate this Agreement. The Escrow Agreement will provide that the Termination Fee will be held by the Escrow Agent until the first to occur of the following: (i) the termination of this Agreement under circumstances that obligate Purchaser to pay the Termination Fee, at which time the Termination Fee (minus all fees and expenses charged in connection with the Escrow Agreement) will be paid to Seller and the Shareholders by the Escrow Agent to satisfy Purchaser\'s obligations to pay the Termination Fee under this _Section 18.5_, (ii) this Agreement is terminated under circumstances that do not obligate Purchaser to pay the Termination Fee, at which time the Termination Fee (minus all fees and expenses charged in connection with the Escrow Agreement) will be refunded by the Escrow Agent to Purchaser, or (iii) the Closing, at which time the Termination Fee (minus all fees and expenses charged in connection with the Escrow Agreement) will be paid to Seller and the Shareholders by the Escrow Agent and the Purchase Price will be reduced by the amount of the Termination Fee (minus all fees and expenses charged in connection with the Escrow Agreement). 

  

 18.6 _Provisions that Survive Termination_. The obligations of the parties under the confidentiality provisions in _Section 12.6_, the governing law provisions in  _Section 20.1_, expense provisions in _Section 20.4_, the arbitration provisions in _Section 20.14_,  the press release and public announcement provisions in _Section 20.12_ and the provisions in _Articles 19_ and this _Section 18.6_ shall survive Termination.

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. The parties agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts of the State of Texas with respect to the breach or interpretation of this Agreement or the enforcement of any and all rights, duties, obligations, powers and other relations among the parties arising under this Agreement. Exclusive venue for any action arising under this Agreement shall be San Antonio, 

        
  

Bexar County, Texas. The section headings contained in this Agreement are for
purposes of convenience only, and shall not be deemed to constitute a part of
this Agreement or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement
in any way.

  

 20.2 _Severability_. Should any provision of this Agreement be held unenforceable or invalid under the laws of the United States of America or the State of Texas, or under any other applicable laws of any other jurisdiction, then the parties hereto agree that such provision shall be deemed modified for purposes of performance of this Agreement in such jurisdiction to the extent necessary to render it lawful and enforceable, or if such a modification is not possible without materially altering the intention of the parties hereto, then such provision shall be severed herefrom for purposes of performance of this Agreement in such jurisdiction. The validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected by any such modification or severance, except that if any severance materially alters the intentions of the parties hereto as expressed herein (a modification being permitted only if there is no material alteration), then the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to agree to appropriate equitable amendments to this Agreement in light of such severance, and if no such agreement can be reached within a reasonable time, any party hereto may initiate arbitration under the then current commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association to determine and effect such appropriate equitable amendments. 

  

 20.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Schedules and the documents and agreements referenced herein including, without limitation, the documents relating to those transactions contemplated by _Section 2.4_ set forth the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and supersede all prior agreements, arrangements and understandings related to the subject matter hereof, except for the letter agreement dated June 3, 2004 between Rush and Seller, which shall remain in full force and effect until and unless the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated. Subject to the preceding sentence, no representation, promise, inducement or statement of intention has been made by any party hereto which is not embodied or referenced in this Agreement, the Schedules or the documents or agreements referenced herein, and no party hereto shall be bound by or liable for any alleged representation, promise, inducement or statement of intention not so set forth. 

  

 20.4 _Expenses_. Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, each of the parties will pay all costs and expenses of its or their performance of and compliance with this Agreement. 

  

 20.5 _Binding Effect_. All the terms, provisions, covenants and conditions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, representatives, successors and assigns. 

  

 20.6 _Assignment_. This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the parties hereto shall not be assigned or delegated by any party hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto. 

  

 20.7 _Amendment; Waiver_. This Agreement may be amended, modified, superseded or canceled, and any of the terms, provisions, representations, warranties, covenants or conditions hereof may be waived, only by a written instrument executed by all parties hereto, or, in the case of a waiver, by the party waiving compliance. The failure of any party at any time or times to require performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect the right to enforce the same. No waiver by any party of any condition contained in this Agreement, or of the breach of any term, provision, representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such condition or breach, or as a waiver of any other condition or of the breach of any other term, provision, representation, warranty or covenant. 

        
  

 20.8 _Gender; Numbers_. All references in this Agreement to the masculine, feminine or neuter genders shall, where appropriate, be deemed to include all other genders. All plurals used in this Agreement shall, where appropriate, be deemed to be singular, and vice versa. 

  

 20.9 _Certain Interpretive Matters and Definitions_. The word "including" means "including, without limitation," and does not limit the preceding words or terms. 

  

 20.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement shall be binding when one or more counterparts hereof, individually or taken together, shall bear the signatures of the parties reflected hereon as signatories. 

  

 20.11 _Facsimile Execution and Delivery_. A facsimile or other electronic reproduction of this Agreement may be executed by one or more parties hereto, and an executed copy of this Agreement may be delivered by one or more parties hereto by facsimile or similar instantaneous electronic transmission device pursuant to which the signature of or on behalf of such party can be seen, and such execution and delivery shall be considered valid, binding and effective for all purposes. At the request of any party hereto, all parties hereto agree to execute an original of this Agreement as well as any facsimile or other reproduction hereof. 

  

 20.12 _Press Releases_. No press releases or other public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be made prior to the Closing Date without the joint approval of Purchaser and Seller, except as required by law. 

   

 20.13 _Review of Counsel_. Each party hereto acknowledges that it and its counsel have received, reviewed and been involved in the drafting of this Agreement and the agreements referenced herein to be executed at Closing and that normal rules of construction, to the effect that ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party, shall not apply. 

  

 20.14 _Arbitration_. 

  

  

 (a)

 The parties will attempt in good faith to resolve promptly by negotiation any and all controversies and disputes arising under, out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (a " _Dispute_ "), other than (i) Disputes arising out of a party\'s fraudulent acts or omissions or willful misconduct, which Disputes shall be submitted directly to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Section 20.14_ and (ii) Disputes arising under _Sections 12.6_ and _12.8_ dealing with restrictive covenants and nondisclosure of confidential information with respect to which the parties expressly reserve the right to petition a court directly for injunctive and other relief without taking any additional steps. If such negotiation has not resulted in a resolution of such Dispute within 30 days of the receipt by a party of a written notification by the other party of a Dispute, such Dispute will be settled by final and binding arbitration in accordance with the procedures and conditions set forth herein, which may be initiated by either party following such 30-day period in accordance with this _Section 20.14_.  


(b)

 Except as modified herein, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1, _et seq_., will apply to any arbitration hereunder.  


(c)

 Any arbitration proceedings hereunder will be conducted in Dallas, Texas. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (the " _AAA_ "), pursuant to the then-prevailing Commercial Arbitration Rules (the " _Rules_ "), subject to the limitations and modifications set forth herein.  


(d)

 Notice of a demand for arbitration (a " _Notice to Arbitrate_ ") must be accompanied by a short and plain statement of the party\'s claim(s), the grounds for same and the relief 
  

      

    

sought and, unless the parties have already agreed upon a single Arbitrator
to conduct the arbitration, shall appoint one Arbitrator. Within 30 days of
receipt of a Notice to Arbitrate, the other party must set forth in writing
and deliver to the party who gave such Notice to Arbitrate an answer setting
forth its response to the claim for relief, as well as any affirmative
defenses and counterclaims and, unless the parties have already agreed upon a
single Arbitrator, shall appoint one Arbitrator. If the parties agree upon a
single Arbitrator, then the date of the other party\'s answer will be the
date of the appointment of the Tribunal.

   

 (e)

 The arbitration will be before a panel (the " _Tribunal_ ") of three neutral arbitrators (each, an " _Arbitrator_ "). If the parties agree upon a single Arbitrator to conduct the arbitration, references herein to the Tribunal mean such single Arbitrator. If the parties have not agreed upon a single Arbitrator, each party shall appoint one Arbitrator as provided in _Section 20.14(d)_. The third Arbitrator shall be appointed jointly by the first two Arbitrators. If the Arbitrators appointed by the parties cannot agree upon a third Arbitrator within 30 business days from their appointment, the third Arbitrator will be selected by the AAA in accordance with the Rules.  


(f)

 Each Arbitrator must be a member of a state bar engaged in the practice of law in the United States or a retired member of a state or the federal judiciary in the United States.  


(g)

 Neither party will have the right to _ex parte_ contact with the Tribunal. The Tribunal is only authorized to, and only has the consent of the parties to, interpret and apply the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The Tribunal is not authorized to and shall not add to, detract from or modify any term or condition of this Agreement, or deprive either party of any right or remedy expressly provided hereunder. In the event that the Arbitrator exceeds his or her authority under this Agreement and violates its provisions, either party may petition a court of competent jurisdiction to vacate the Arbitration Award on the grounds that the Arbitrator exceeded his or her authority. The court shall make its determination based on the record from the arbitration, affidavits submitted by the parties, and briefing submitted by the parties. In any event, the parties expressly waive any right to a jury trial and stipulate that any designated issues will be decided by the court without a jury.  


(h)

 It will be the responsibility of each party to timely comply with the AAA\'s requests for payment of the Tribunal\'s fees. Any Tribunal fees that are due prior to the issuance of an Arbitration Award shall be evenly divided between the parties. Any party who has not complied with any such request within 30 calendar days thereof will be deemed in default of this Agreement and the Tribunal may enter a default judgment against such party on the merits.  


(i)

 The parties will make mandatory disclosures as required under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(1) and (2). The parties will not have the right to conduct and enforce pre-hearing discovery except as follows:  

 

 (i)

 Each party may serve no more than one set of interrogatories limited to no more than 30 questions, including subparts. Answers to interrogatories will be due 30 days after receipt.  


(ii)

 Each party may depose no more than two experts and two fact witnesses.  


(iii)

 The Tribunal will have the right and authority to decide any and all discovery disputes with respect to the foregoing limitations. 
 

  

      

      

 (j)

 The Tribunal will issue and deliver to each party a written and signed award (the " _Arbitration Award_ ") after the conclusion of the hearing before the Tribunal provided in this _Section 20.14_. The Arbitration Award will (i) contain the factual and legal basis for such award, (ii) be based on the evidence admitted and the substantive laws of the State of Texas and (iii) contain an award for each issue and counterclaim. If three Arbitrators have been appointed, the award of the Tribunal shall require a majority of the Arbitrators. The Arbitration Award will, in addition to the relief granted therein, award attorneys\' fees and costs to the prevailing party as the Arbitrator may determine in light of all of the circumstances. The term "costs" includes court costs, the fees of the Tribunal, administrative fees, travel expenses and out-of-pocket expenses such as copying charges, telephone expenses and witness fees (including expert witness fees), and reasonable internal costs. The Arbitration Award will be binding upon the parties in accordance with its terms provided that the Arbitration Award is rendered, and the Arbitration proceedings are conducted, in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement.  


(k)

 The Arbitration Award may be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. 
  

  
  

 20.15 _Bulk Transfer Laws_. Purchaser hereby waives compliance by Seller with the provisions of so-called "bulk transfer law" of any jurisdiction in connection with the sale of the Assets to Purchaser.
