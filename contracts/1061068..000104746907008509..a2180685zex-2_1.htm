AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

  

 This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER is dated as of November 2, 2007 (this " _Agreement_ "), by and among GBandT BANCSHARES, INC., a Georgia corporation (" _GB andT_"), and SUNTRUST BANKS, INC. (" _SunTrust_ "), a Georgia corporation. 

  

W I T N E S S E T H:

  

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of GBandT and SunTrust have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their shareholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction provided for in this Agreement in which GBandT will, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, merge with and into SunTrust (the " _Merger_ "), so that SunTrust is the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes referred to in such capacity as the " _Surviving Corporation_ "); 

  

 WHEREAS, for federal income Tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code and within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g); 

   

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, each individual included on _Schedule A_ attached hereto has executed an agreement (collectively, the " _Voting Agreements_ ") between such individual and SunTrust governing the voting of all shares of GBandT Common Stock (as defined herein) owned by such individual at the GBandT Shareholders Meeting (as defined herein); and 

  

 WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER

  

 1.1 _ The Merger._ 

  

  

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the Georgia Business Corporation Code (the " _GBCC_ "), at the Effective Time GBandT shall merge with and into SunTrust. SunTrust shall be the Surviving Corporation in the Merger and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Georgia. As of the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of GBandT shall cease. 

  

 (b) SunTrust may at any time change the method of effecting the combination (including by providing for the merger of GBandT and a wholly owned subsidiary of SunTrust) if and to the extent SunTrust deems such change to be desirable; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of GBandT\'s shareholders as a result of receiving the Merger Consideration or the Tax treatment of either party pursuant to this Agreement, or (iii) materially impede or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. GBandT shall, if requested by SunTrust, enter into one or more amendments to this Agreement prior to the Effective Time to effect any change permitted by the foregoing sentence. 

  

      

  
 

  

 1.2 _ Effective Time._ The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the certificate of merger (the " _Georgia Certificate of Merger_ ") that shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Georgia on the Closing Date. The term " _Effective Time_ " shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes effective as set forth in the Georgia Certificate of Merger. 

   

 1.3 _ Effects of the Merger._ At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 14-2-1106 of the GBCC. 

  

 1.4 _ Conversion of GBandT Common Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of SunTrust, GBandT or the holder of any of the following securities: 

  

  

 (a) Each share of common stock, $1.00 value per share, of SunTrust (the " _SunTrust Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be affected by the Merger. 

  

 (b) All shares of common stock, no par value per share, of GBandT issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time (the " _GB andT Common Stock_") that are owned, directly or indirectly, by GBandT or SunTrust (other than shares of GBandT Common Stock held in trust accounts (including grantor or rabbi trust accounts), managed accounts and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties (any such shares, " _Trust Account Common Shares_ ")) and other than shares of GBandT Common Stock held, directly or indirectly, by GBandT or SunTrust in respect of a debt previously contracted (any such shares, " _DPC Common Shares_ ") shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no stock of SunTrust and no other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  

 (c) Subject to _Section 1.4(e)_, each share of GBandT Common Stock, except for shares of GBandT Common Stock owned by GBandT or SunTrust or any of their respective wholly owned Subsidiaries (other than Trust Account Common Shares and DPC Common Shares), shall be converted into the right to receive, without interest, that fraction of a fully paid and nonassessable share of SunTrust Common Stock (the " _Merger Consideration_ ") equal to 0.1562 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ "). 

  

 (d) All of the shares of GBandT Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article I_ shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate previously representing any such shares of GBandT Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration (and, in the case of any fractional shares, cash in lieu thereof), into which the shares of GBandT Common Stock represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to this _Section 1.4_ and _Section 2.2(f)_, as well as any dividends to which holders of GBandT Common Stock become entitled in accordance with _Section 2.2(c)_. 

  

 (e) If, after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of SunTrust Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar change in capitalization, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Ratio. 

  

  

 1.5 _ Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards._ 

  

  

 (a) Unless otherwise noted, the provisions of this _Section 1.5_ pertain to all plans sponsored by GBandT under which options and other stock-based amounts are awarded, including the GBandT 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the " _2007 Plan_ ") and the GBandT Stock Option Plan of 1997 (the " _1997 Plan_ ") (collectively, the " _GB andT Stock Plans_"); _provided_ , _however_ , that any accelerated 

  

      

  

vesting performed pursuant to this _Section 1.5_ shall only be performed if
required by the terms of the applicable GBandT Stock Plan as in effect on the
date hereof without any further action by GBandT.

  

 (b) As of the Effective Time, if required by and in accordance with the terms of the applicable GBandT Stock Plans, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any options or other stock-based awards, each participant in any of the GBandT Stock Plans shall fully and immediately vest in any options or other stock-based awards awarded under such GBandT Stock Plans. 

  

 (c) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each option to purchase shares of GBandT Common Stock granted to employees or directors of GBandT or any of its Subsidiaries under any of the GBandT Stock Plans that is outstanding immediately before the Effective Time (collectively, the " _GB andT Options_") shall be converted into an option (an " _Adjusted Option_ ") to purchase, on the same terms and conditions as applied to each such GBandT Option immediately before the Effective Time (taking into account any accelerated vesting of such GBandT Options in accordance with the terms thereof, including terms approved by the GBandT Board before the date of this Agreement as described on _Section 1.5(c)_ of the GBandT Disclosure Schedule (as defined in _Article III_)), the number of whole shares of SunTrust Common Stock that is equal to the number of shares of GBandT Common Stock subject to such GBandT Option immediately before the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share), at an exercise price per share of SunTrust Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price for each such share of GBandT Common Stock subject to such GBandT Option immediately before the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio. In the case of any GBandT Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the above formula shall be adjusted, if necessary, to comply with Section 424(a) of the Code. 

  

 (d) As of the Effective Time, SunTrust shall assume the obligations and succeed to the rights of GBandT under the GBandT Stock Plans with respect to the Adjusted Options. GBandT and SunTrust agree that before the Effective Time each of the GBandT Stock Plans shall be amended, to the extent possible without requiring shareholder approval of such amendments, if and to the extent necessary and practicable, to reflect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the conversion of GBandT Options granted to any employee or director of GBandT or any of its Subsidiaries under a GBandT Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately before the Effective Time pursuant to this _Section 1.5_ and the substitution of SunTrust for GBandT thereunder to the extent appropriate to effectuate the assumption of such GBandT Stock Plans by SunTrust. From and after the Effective Time, all references to GBandT (other than any references relating to a "change in control" of GBandT) in each GBandT Stock Plan and in each agreement evidencing any award of GBandT Options shall be deemed to refer to SunTrust, unless SunTrust determines otherwise. 

  

 (e) As of the Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to receive shares of GBandT Common Stock or benefits measured by the value of a number of shares of GBandT Common Stock, and each award of any kind consisting of shares of GBandT Common Stock, granted under any other GBandT Benefit Plan (including restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance stock units, deferred stock units and dividend equivalents), other than GBandT Options (each, a " _GB andT Stock-Based Award_"), whether vested or unvested, which is outstanding or unsatisfied immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall cease to represent a right or award with respect to shares of GBandT Common Stock and shall be converted, at the Effective Time, into a right or award with respect to shares of SunTrust Common Stock (an " _Assumed Stock-Based Award_ "), on the same terms and conditions (including expiration date, vesting and exercise provisions) as were applicable under the GBandT Stock-Based Awards (but taking into account any changes thereto, including the acceleration thereof, provided for in the GBandT Stock Plans or 

  

      

  
  

other GBandT Benefit Plan or in any award agreement thereunder by reason of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby). The number of shares
of SunTrust Common Stock subject to each such Assumed Stock-Based Award shall
be equal to the number of shares of GBandT Common Stock subject to the GBandT

shares of SunTrust Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificate(s) shall pass, only
upon delivery of Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such
Certificates) to the Exchange Agent and shall be substantially in such form
and have such other provisions as shall be prescribed by the Exchange Agent
Agreement (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions for use in
surrendering Certificate(s) in exchange for the Merger Consideration and any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of SunTrust Common Stock to be issued or
paid in consideration therefor in accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_ upon
surrender of such Certificate and any dividends or distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to  _Section 2.2(c)_.

  

 (b) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate or Certificates, accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a holder of GBandT Common Stock will be entitled to receive promptly after the Effective Time the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of SunTrust Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in respect of the shares of GBandT Common Stock represented by its Certificate or Certificates. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of SunTrust Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with, and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to, this _Article II_. 

  

 (c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to SunTrust Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of SunTrust Common Stock represented thereby, in each case until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this _Article II_. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, following surrender of any such Certificate in accordance with this _Article II_, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the whole shares of SunTrust Common Stock represented by such Certificate and not paid and/or (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions payable with respect to shares of SunTrust Common Stock represented by such Certificate with a record date after the Effective Time (but before such surrender date) and with a payment date subsequent to the issuance of the SunTrust Common Stock issuable with respect to such Certificate. 

  

 (d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing GBandT Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer records of GBandT, the proper amount of shares of SunTrust Common Stock shall be paid or issued in exchange therefor to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Certificate formerly representing such GBandT Common Stock shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment or issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment or issuance to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of SunTrust that the Tax has been paid or is not applicable. The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the first anniversary of the Effective Time, SunTrust) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash in lieu of fractional shares of SunTrust Common Stock otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of GBandT Common Stock such amounts as the Exchange Agent or SunTrust, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or SunTrust, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Holder of shares of GBandT Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or SunTrust, as the case may be. 

  

      

  
  

 (e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of GBandT of the shares of GBandT Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time other than to settle transfers of GBandT Common Stock that occurred before the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of SunTrust Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Article II_. 

   

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of SunTrust Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates for exchange, no dividend or distribution with respect to SunTrust Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of SunTrust. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, SunTrust shall pay to each former shareholder of GBandT who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the arithmetic average of the last reported per share sales prices of SunTrust Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ for each of the five full consecutive NYSE trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Market Price_ ") by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of GBandT Common Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of SunTrust Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 1.4_. 

   

 (g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of GBandT as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time may be paid to SunTrust. In such event, any former shareholders of GBandT who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to SunTrust with respect to the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the SunTrust Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of GBandT Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of SunTrust, GBandT, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of GBandT Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 

  

 (h) If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by SunTrust or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as SunTrust may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

Except as set forth on the GBandT Disclosure Schedule, and subject to the standard set forth in _Section 9.2_, GBandT hereby represents and warrants to SunTrust as follows:

_further_ , that, with respect to this clause (i) a Material Adverse Effect
shall be deemed to include the circumstances and conditions discussed
in clauses (A), (B) and (C) to the extent such changes have a
disproportionate impact on either SunTrust and its Subsidiaries or GBandT and
its Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis, in each respective case), as the

ability of such party to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 3.10 _ Taxes and Tax Returns._ 

  

  

 (a) Each of GBandT and its Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed (including all applicable extensions) all Tax Returns required to be filed by it on or before the date of this Agreement (except as set forth on _Section 3.10(a)(1)_ of the GBandT Disclosure Schedule, all such returns being accurate and complete in all material respects and prepared in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations), has paid all Taxes due and owing by such entity (whether or not shown on such Tax Returns). Each of GBandT and its Subsidiaries has duly paid or made provision for the payment of all Taxes that have been incurred or are due or claimed to be due from it by federal, state, foreign or local taxing authorities (including, without limitation, if and to the extent applicable, those due in respect of its properties, income, business, capital stock, deposits, franchises, licenses, sales and payrolls) other than Taxes that are not yet delinquent, or are being contested in good faith by GBandT or its Subsidiaries as disclosed on _Section 3.10(a)(2)_ of the GBandT Disclosure Schedule, have not been finally determined and have been adequately reserved against. GBandT and its Subsidiaries have withheld and paid all Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with any amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder or other third party. Except as set forth on _Section 3.10(a)(1)_ or _(a)(2)_ of the GBandT Disclosure Schedule, to the knowledge of GBandT and its Subsidiaries, GBandT and its Subsidiaries are not subject to examination, investigation, audit or administrative or judicial proceeding by the Internal Revenue Service (" _IRS_ ") or any foreign, state or local taxing authority (including jurisdictions where GBandT and/or its Subsidiaries have not filed Tax Returns) and have not received any notice indicating an intent to open such audit, investigation, review or proceeding. There are no material disputes pending, or claims asserted, for Taxes or assessments upon GBandT or any of its Subsidiaries for which GBandT does not have adequately disclosed reserves that are sufficient under GAAP. Neither GBandT nor any of its Subsidiaries currently is the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return. Neither GBandT nor any of its Subsidiaries has waived any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency.

Neither GBandT nor any of its Subsidiaries is required to include in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the date hereof as a result of any "closing agreement" as described in Section 7121 of the Code, intercompany transactions or excess loss account described in the Treasury Regulations under Section 1502 of the Code or installment sale or open transaction disposition made prior to the date hereof. Neither GBandT nor any of its Subsidiaries has participated in a "reportable transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(1) or acted as a material advisor within the meaning of Section 6111(b) of the Code with respect to any reportable transaction. No power of attorney has been granted by GBandT or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any matter relating to Taxes, except as disclosed on _Schedule 3.10(a)(3)_ of the GBandT Disclosure Schedule. Neither GBandT nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement, contract, arrangement or plan that has resulted or could result, separately or in the aggregate, in 

  

      

  

the payment of any "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section
280G of the Code (or any corresponding provision of state, local or foreign
Tax law). GBandT and its Subsidiaries have disclosed on their federal income
Tax Returns all positions taken therein that are reasonably likely to give
rise to a "substantial understatement" of federal income Tax within the
meaning of Section 6662 of the Code. Since September 30, 2000, no claim has
ever been made by an authority in a jurisdiction where GBandT or any of its
Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that GBandT or any of its Subsidiaries is
or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. To the knowledge of GBandT
and its Subsidiaries, there are no Liens for Taxes (other than Taxes not yet
due and payable) upon any of the assets of GBandT or any of its Subsidiaries and
there are no such Liens that are pending. Neither GBandT nor any of its
Subsidiaries has directly or indirectly owned an interest in a real estate
investment trust or any legal entity whose purpose is to hold and manage
investment securities. Neither GBandT nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a
member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return
other than a group the common parent of which is GBandT. Neither GBandT nor any
of its Subsidiaries has issued or assumed any corporate acquisition
indebtedness (within the meaning of Section 279(b) of the Code), or any
obligation described in Section 279(a)(2) of the Code. Except as disclosed on
_Section 3.10(a)(4)_ of the GBandT Disclosure Schedule, neither GBandT nor any of
its Subsidiaries owns any direct or indirect interest in an entity that is
characterized as a partnership for Tax purposes. No excess loss account
(within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-19) exists with
respect to GBandT or its Subsidiaries. GBandT has received the Georgia Department
of Revenue\'s approval letter permitting GBandT and its Subsidiaries to file a
consolidated income tax return in Georgia.

entered into before the date of this Agreement. The parties shall
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in
which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 (c) All information and materials provided by GBandT pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement entered into between SunTrust and Keefe Bruyette and Woods, Inc. on behalf of GBandT dated September 10, 2007 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

conditions set forth in this Agreement, and directing that the Merger, on such
terms and conditions, be submitted to GBandT\'s shareholders for their
consideration.

  

 (b) Each of SunTrust and GBandT shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (i) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is required to be obtained by GBandT or SunTrust or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 (a) For the 12 month period following the Effective Time, SunTrust shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to, provide to those individuals actively employed by, or on an authorized leave of absence from, GBandT or one of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time, and who continue their employment with SunTrust or one of its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Covered Employees_ ") with employee benefits, rates of base salary or hourly wage and annual bonus opportunities that are available for similarly situated employees of SunTrust or its affiliates or Subsidiaries; notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (i) be treated as an amendment of any particular GBandT Benefit Plan, (ii) give any third party any right to enforce the provisions of this _Section 6.6_, (iii) limit the right of SunTrust or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Covered Employee at any time or require SunTrust or any of its Subsidiaries to provide any such Covered Employee benefits, rates of base salary or hourly wage or annual bonus opportunities for any period following any such termination, other than as required by applicable law or pro-rata incentive plan payouts or as otherwise provided under this Agreement; or (iv) obligate GBandT, SunTrust or any of their respective Subsidiaries to (A) maintain any particular GBandT Benefit Plan or (B) retain the employment of any particular employee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SunTrust shall have a reasonable period following the Effective Date, as it deems appropriate or necessary, in which to transition Covered Employees from GBandT\'s Benefits Plans to benefits plans maintained by SunTrust or its Subsidiaries. 

  

 (b) To the extent that a Covered Employee becomes eligible to participate in an employee benefit plan maintained by SunTrust or any of its Subsidiaries, other than GBandT or its Subsidiaries, SunTrust shall cause such employee benefit plan to recognize the service of such Covered Employee with GBandT or its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not any benefit accrual), based on information provided by GBandT and the terms and service requirements (including break in service rules) of such employee benefit plan of SunTrust or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ that such recognition of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefits with respect to the Covered Employee. With respect to a Covered Employee who becomes 

  

      

  
  

eligible for participation in the SunTrust Retirement Plan, such Covered
Employee\'s benefits under such plan shall be calculated under the personal
pension account formula, and such Covered Employee\'s service with GBandT and
its Subsidiaries shall be recognized under such plan for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting and pay credits for such Covered
Employee\'s personal pension account. SunTrust shall also credit service with
GBandT or its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility to participate in
SunTrust\'s retiree health plan on an access only basis (with no employer
subsidy for benefits or premiums). In addition, with respect to any health or
dental plan of SunTrust or any of its Subsidiaries (other than GBandT and its
Subsidiaries), for the plan year in which any Covered Employee first becomes
eligible to participate, SunTrust shall (i) cause any pre-existing condition
limitations under such SunTrust or Subsidiary plan to be waived with respect
to such Covered Employee to the extent such limitation would have been waived
or satisfied under the GBandT Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee
participated immediately before such Covered Employee\'s initial
participation in such plan of SunTrust or its Subsidiaries and (ii) cause each
such health or dental plan of SunTrust or its Subsidiaries to recognize any
applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense incurred by each such
Covered Employee in the same calendar year under any such comparable health or
dental plan of SunTrust or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

 (c) If a Covered Employee (other than temporary and/or co-operative employees) who does not have an employment, change-in-control or severance agreement with GBandT or any of its Subsidiaries is involuntarily terminated by SunTrust or any of its Subsidiaries during the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending 12 months after the Effective Time, such Covered Employee\'s right to severance pay, including the amount and form, shall be determined in accordance with the terms of SunTrust\'s severance pay plan (including customary releases and taking into account employee pay grade classifications to be made by SunTrust with respect to Covered Employees and giving service credit for such Covered Employee\'s service with GBandT to be made by SunTrust with respect to Covered Employees) as in effect immediately before the date hereof (subject to later amendments for exemption from or compliance with Section 409A of the Code). 

  

  

 GBandT shall take whatever action necessary to terminate any and all other severance arrangements and to ensure it and SunTrust have no other liability for any other severance payments (other than as set forth in this _Section 6.6(c)_ and _Section 6.6(d)_ below with respect to agreements disclosed in _Section 3.11(i)_ of the GBandT Disclosure Schedule). GBandT shall cooperate with SunTrust to effectuate the foregoing, including SunTrust\'s compliance with the Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act (" _Warn Act_ ") or any similar state or local law (e.g., GBandT will cooperate with SunTrust to deliver Warn Act notices reasonably requested by SunTrust prior to the Effective Time). 

  

 Nothing contained in this _Section 6.6(c)_ shall be construed or interpreted to limit or modify in any way SunTrust at-will employment policy. In addition, in no event shall severance pay payable under this _Section 6.6(c)_ to any Covered Employee who does not have an employment, change-in-control or severance agreement with GBandT be taken into account in determining the amount of any other benefit (including, but not limited to, an individual\'s benefit under any retirement plan, SERP or agreement). If, by reason of the controlling plan document, controlling law or otherwise, severance pay is taken into account in determining any other benefit, the severance pay otherwise payable shall be reduced by the present value of the additional benefit determined under other benefit plans attributable to the severance pay. 

  

  

 (d) From and after the Effective Time, SunTrust shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, honor, in accordance with the terms thereof as in effect as of the date hereof or as may be amended after the date hereof with the prior written consent of SunTrust, each employment agreement, retention agreement and change-in-control agreement listed on _Section 3.11(i)_ of the GBandT Disclosure Schedule (unless otherwise agreed by SunTrust and the applicable counterparty 

  

      

  

to such agreement) and the obligations of GBandT and its Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time under each deferred compensation plan or agreement listed on
_Section 3.11(i)_ of the GBandT Disclosure Schedule. SunTrust agrees to take
all action necessary to effectuate and satisfy the obligations set forth in
the agreements listed in _Section 3.11(i)_ of the GBandT Disclosure Schedule.
GBandT has no contractual responsibility (and has made no promise or commitment
to be responsible) for any Tax, penalty or interest imposed on any person by
reason of any such agreements (or payments thereunder) that result in "excess"
parachute payments under Section 280G of the Code or that fail to satisfy the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code. The obligation of SunTrust or any of
its Subsidiaries to provide severance pay on the termination of employment of
any individual who has an employment agreement, retention agreement or change-
in-control agreement listed on _Section 3.11(i)_ of the GBandT Disclosure
Schedule shall be determined solely in accordance with the terms of such
agreement and neither SunTrust nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any
other obligation to provide severance pay to such individual under Section
6.6(c) or otherwise.

  

 (e) Before the Effective Time, SunTrust may, in its sole discretion, elect to offer to certain GBandT employees (the number and identification of which shall be made in the absolute and sole discretion of SunTrust in coordination with the President of GBandT) retention agreements to assist in the voluntary retention of GBandT employees following the Effective Time. 

  

 (f) If SunTrust so requests (which request shall be made no less than 30 days prior to the Effective Time), GBandT shall take any and all actions required (including, without limitation, the adoption of resolutions by its Board of Directors) to amend, freeze and/or terminate GBandT\'s 401(k) plan or any other GBandT Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, and, if requested by SunTrust, to implement any such actions. 

  

 (g) GBandT shall provide to SunTrust at least 15 days prior to the Effective Time documentation that shows the requirements of Code Sections 401(a)(4), 404, 410(b), 412, 415, 416 and 401(k)(3) and (m)(2) are met by or with respect to each GBandT Benefit Plan subject to such requirements as to the plan\'s latest three plan years which have ended prior to the date of this Agreement. 

  

  

 6.7 _ Indemnification; Directors\' and Officers\' Insurance._ 

  

  

 (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative (a " _Claim_ "), including any such Claim in which any individual who is now, or has been at any time before the date of this Agreement, or who becomes before the Effective Time, a director or officer of GBandT or any of its Subsidiaries or who is or was serving at the request of GBandT or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a director or officer of GBandT or any of its Subsidiaries before the Effective Time or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the parties shall cooperate and use their best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party as provided in their respective certificates or articles of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents), and any existing indemnification agreements set forth on _Section 6.7(a)_ of the GBandT Disclosure Schedule, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of such individuals for acts or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time or taken at the request of SunTrust pursuant to _Section 6.8_, it being understood that nothing in this sentence shall require any amendment to the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

      

  

  

 (b) SunTrust shall cause the individuals serving as officers and directors of GBandT or any of its Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time to be covered for a period of six years after the Effective Time by the directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy maintained by GBandT ( _provided_ that SunTrust may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous than such policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring before the Effective Time that were committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as such; _provided_ that in no event shall SunTrust be required to expend annually in the aggregate an amount in excess of 200% of the annual premiums currently paid by GBandT (which current amount is set forth on _Section 6.7(b)_ of the GBandT Disclosure Schedule) for such insurance (the " _Insurance Amount_ "), and _provided further_ that if SunTrust is unable to maintain such policy (or such substitute policy) as a result of the preceding proviso, SunTrust shall obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount. 

  

 (c) The provisions of this _Section 6.7_ shall survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. 

  

  

 6.8 _ Additional Agreements._ 

  

  

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of SunTrust and GBandT agrees to cooperate fully with each other and to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, at the time and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Merger, including using reasonable best efforts to lift or rescind any injunction or restraining order or other order adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the Merger. 

  

 (b) In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by SunTrust. 

  

 (c) SunTrust and GBandT shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

  

  

 6.9 _ Advice of Changes._ Each of SunTrust and GBandT shall promptly advise the other of any change or event (a) having or reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (b) that it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement; _provided further_ that a failure to comply with this _Section 6.9_ shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement or the failure of any condition set forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied unless the underlying Material Adverse Effect or material breach would independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied. 

   

 6.10 _ No Solicitation._ 

  

  

 (a) None of GBandT, its Subsidiaries or any officer, director, employee, agent or representative (including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other retained representative) of GBandT or any of its Subsidiaries shall directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, encourage, facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) or take any other action designed to facilitate any inquiries or proposals regarding any merger, share exchange, consolidation, sale of assets, sale of shares of capital stock (including by way of a tender offer) or similar transactions involving GBandT or any of its Subsidiaries that, if consummated, would constitute an Alternative 

  

      

  

Transaction (any of the foregoing inquiries or proposals being referred to
herein as an " _Alternative Proposal_ "), (ii) participate in any discussions
or negotiations regarding an Alternative Transaction; or (iii) enter into any
agreement regarding any Alternative Transaction. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the GBandT Board and its representatives shall be permitted, before
the approval of this Agreement by GBandT\'s shareholders, and subject to
compliance with the other terms of this _Section 6.10_ and to first entering
into a confidentiality agreement with the person proposing such Alternative
Proposal on terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable to GBandT
than, those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, to furnish nonpublic
information regarding GBandT to a person, and to consider and participate
in discussions and negotiations with respect to a bona fide Alternative
Proposal received by GBandT that constitutes or is reasonably likely to result
in a Superior Proposal and, if and only to the extent that and so long as the
GBandT Board reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would cause it to violate its
fiduciary duties.

  

  

 As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Transaction_ " means any of (w) a transaction pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) (other than SunTrust or its affiliates), directly or indirectly, acquires or would acquire more than 25% of the outstanding shares of GBandT Common Stock or outstanding voting power or of any new series or new class of preferred stock that would be entitled to a class or series vote with respect to the Merger, whether from GBandT or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (x) a merger, share exchange, consolidation or other business combination involving GBandT (other than the Merger), (y) any transaction pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) (other than SunTrust or its affiliates) acquires or would acquire control of assets (including for this purpose the outstanding equity securities of Subsidiaries of GBandT and securities of the entity surviving any merger or business combination including any of GBandT\'s Subsidiaries) of GBandT, or any of its Subsidiaries representing more than 25% of the fair market value of all the assets, net revenues or net income of GBandT and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately before such transaction, or (z) any other consolidation, business combination, recapitalization or similar transaction involving GBandT or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as a result of which the holders of shares of GBandT immediately before such transactions do not, in the aggregate, own at least 75% of the outstanding shares of common stock and the outstanding voting power of the surviving or resulting entity in such transaction immediately after the consummation thereof in substantially the same proportion as such holders held the shares of GBandT Common Stock immediately before the consummation thereof. 

  

 As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means an Alternative Proposal that the GBandT Board in good faith determines, would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is more favorable from a financial point of view to GBandT\'s shareholders than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (x) after receiving the advice of a financial advisor (who shall be a nationally recognized investment banking firm), (y) after taking into account the likelihood of consummation of such transaction on the terms set forth therein (as compared to the terms in this Agreement) and (z) after taking into account all appropriate legal (with the advice of outside counsel), financial (including the financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory or other aspects of such proposal and any other relevant factors permitted by applicable Law; provided that for purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal", the references to "25%" in the definition of Alternative Transaction shall be deemed to be references to "a majority." 

  

  

 (b) GBandT shall notify SunTrust promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt of any Alternative Proposal, or any material modification of or material amendment to any Alternative Proposal, or any request for nonpublic information relating to GBandT or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records of GBandT or any Subsidiary by any person that informs the GBandT Board or any Subsidiary that it is considering making, or has made, an Alternative Proposal. Such notice to SunTrust shall be made orally and in writing, and shall 

  

      

  

indicate the identity of the person making the Alternative Proposal or
intending to make or considering making an Alternative Proposal or requesting
nonpublic information or access to the books and records of GBandT or any
Subsidiary, and the material terms of any such Alternative Proposal or
modification or amendment to an Alternative Proposal. GBandT shall keep SunTrust
fully informed, on a current basis, of any material changes in the status and
any material changes or modifications in the terms of any such Alternative
Proposal, indication or request. GBandT shall also promptly, and in any event
within 24 hours, notify SunTrust, orally and in writing, if it enters into
discussions or negotiations concerning any Alternative Proposal in accordance
with _Section 6.10(a)_. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, at any time prior to obtaining the approval of this Agreement by GBandT\'s shareholders, GBandT receives an Alternative Proposal (or a subsequent amended Alternative Proposal) that the GBandT Board concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by SunTrust pursuant to clause (ii) below, the GBandT Board may effect a withdrawal of its recommendation of this Agreement; provided, that, the GBandT Board may not effect a withdrawal of its recommendation of this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause unless: (i) GBandT shall have provided prior written notice to SunTrust, at least five days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), of its intention to effect a withdrawal of its recommendation of this Agreement in response to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously provided a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party making such Superior Proposal and other material documents; and (ii) prior to effecting a withdrawal of its recommendation of this Agreement, GBandT shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with SunTrust in good faith (to the extent SunTrust desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Alternative Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal. 

   

 (d) GBandT and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any persons (other than SunTrust) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing. GBandT agrees not to, and to cause its Subsidiaries not to, release any third party from the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any agreement to which GBandT or its Subsidiaries is or may become a party, and shall immediately take all steps necessary to terminate any approval that may have been heretofore given under any such provisions authorizing any person to make an Alternative Proposal. 

  

 (e) GBandT shall ensure that the officers, directors and all employees, agents and representatives (including any investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other retained representatives) of GBandT or its Subsidiaries are aware of the restrictions described in this _Section 6.10_ as reasonably necessary to avoid violations thereof. It is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.10_ by any officer, director, employee, agent or representative (including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other retained representative) of GBandT or its Subsidiaries, at the direction or with the consent of GBandT or its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 6.10_ by GBandT. 

   

 (f) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.10_ shall prohibit GBandT or its Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that compliance with such rules shall not in any way limit or modify the effect that any action taken pursuant to such rules has on any other provision of this Agreement. 

  

      

  
 

  

 6.11 _ Non-Compete Agreements._ Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the individuals listed on _Schedule B_ attached hereto have executed non-compete agreements as a material inducement to SunTrust to enter into this Agreement. 

  

 6.12 _ Dividends._ After the date of this Agreement, each of SunTrust and GBandT shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends in respect of SunTrust Common Stock and GBandT Common Stock and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties that holders of GBandT Common Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, for any quarter with respect to their shares of GBandT Common Stock and any shares of SunTrust Common Stock any such holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger. 

  

 6.13 _ Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)._ SunTrust and GBandT agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain GBandT Insiders (as defined below) in connection with the Merger, both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that GBandT Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion of shares of GBandT Common Stock, GBandT Options and GBandT Stock-Based Awards into shares of SunTrust Common Stock, Adjusted Options and Assumed Stock-Based Awards, respectively, in the Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this _Section 6.13_. Assuming that GBandT delivers to SunTrust the Section 16 Information (as defined below) in a timely fashion, the Board of Directors of SunTrust, or a committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution providing that the receipt by GBandT Insiders of SunTrust Common Stock in exchange for shares of GBandT Common Stock, of Adjusted Options upon conversion of GBandT Options, and of Assumed Stock-Based Awards upon conversion of GBandT Stock-Based Awards, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to the extent such securities are listed in the Section 16 Information, are intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act. The term " _Section 16 Information_" shall mean information accurate in all material respects regarding GBandT Insiders, the number of shares of GBandT Common Stock held by each such GBandT Insider and expected to be exchanged for SunTrust Common Stock in the Merger, and the number and description of the GBandT Options and GBandT Stock-Based Awards held by each such GBandT Insider and expected to be converted into Adjusted Options and Assumed Stock-Based Awards, respectively, in connection with the Merger. The term " _GB andT Insiders_" shall mean those officers and directors of GBandT who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and who are listed in the Section 16 Information. 

   

 6.14 _ Procurement Contracts._ Within twenty (20) days after the date hereof, GBandT shall provide a list to SunTrust of all contracts of GBandT and its Subsidiaries under which third parties license software or provide goods or services to GBandT or any of its Subsidiaries involving annual payments of $100,000 or more.

ARTICLE VIII 
 TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

  

 8.1 _ Termination._ This Agreement may be terminated at any time before the Effective Time, whether before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the shareholders of GBandT:

 (b) _Approvals._ By either GBandT or SunTrust, if 

    

 (i) any Governmental Entity that must grant a SunTrust Requisite Regulatory Approval or a GBandT Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable or any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final and nonappealable order permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 (c) _Delay_. By either GBandT or SunTrust, if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before July 31, 2008, unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth in this Agreement; 

  

 (d) _Material Breach of Representation, Warranty or Covenant_. By either SunTrust or GBandT ( _provided_ that the terminating party is not then in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement), if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of GBandT, in the case of a termination by SunTrust, or SunTrust in the case of a termination by GBandT, which breach, either individually or in the aggregate, would result in, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of any of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.3_, as the case may be, and which is not cured within 45 days following written notice to the party committing such breach or by its nature or timing cannot be cured within such time period; or

 (a) Except as set forth in _Section 8.3(b)_, and except with respect to costs and expenses of printing and mailing the Proxy Statement and all filing and other fees paid to the SEC in connection with the Merger, which shall be borne equally by GBandT and SunTrust, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated. 

  

      

  

 (b) GBandT shall pay to SunTrust, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, a termination fee in the amount of $6,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") and/or expense reimbursement on the following terms: 

    

 (i) If this Agreement is terminated by SunTrust pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_, then GBandT shall pay the Termination Fee on the business day following such termination; 

  

 (ii) If (A) either party shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ and (B) at any time after the date of this Agreement and on or before the date of the GBandT Shareholder Meeting an Alternative Transaction shall have been publicly announced or otherwise communicated to the GBandT Board (a " _Public Proposal_ ") that has not been withdrawn prior to such date, then GBandT shall pay one-third of the Termination Fee on the business day following such termination and, if within 12 months of the date of such termination, GBandT or any of its Subsidiaries enters into any definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, any Alternative Transaction, then GBandT shall pay the remaining two-thirds of the Termination Fee on the date of such execution or consummation; 

  

 (iii) If (A) either party shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ and (B) _Section 8.3(b)(ii)_ does not otherwise apply, then GBandT shall promptly, on the business day after being notified by SunTrust, pay SunTrust all of the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by SunTrust relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including the negotiation hereof and thereof and fees and expenses of attorneys and other advisors) in an amount not to exceed $1,000,000 (the " _Expense Reimbursement_ "), and if within 12 months of the date of such termination, GBandT or any of its Subsidiaries enters into any definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, any Alternative Transaction, then GBandT shall pay the Termination Fee, less the Expense Reimbursement, on the date of such execution or consummation; 

  

 (iv) If (A) either party shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_ and (B) at any time after the date of this Agreement and before such termination there shall have been a Public Proposal that has not been withdrawn prior to such termination, then GBandT shall pay one-third of the Termination Fee on the business day following such termination and, if within 12 months of the date of termination, GBandT or any of its Subsidiaries executes any definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, any Alternative Transaction, then GBandT shall pay the remaining two-thirds of the Termination Fee upon the date of such execution or consummation. 

   

  

 Upon payment of all applicable fees and expenses in accordance with this _Section 8.3_, GBandT shall have no further liability to SunTrust at law or in equity with respect to such termination, or with respect to GBandT Board\'s failure to take action to convene the GBandT Shareholder Meeting and/or recommend that GBandT shareholders adopt this Agreement. 

  

  

 (c) GBandT acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, SunTrust would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if GBandT fails to pay timely any amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ and, in order to obtain such payment, SunTrust commences a suit that results in a judgment against GBandT for the amount payable to SunTrust pursuant to this _Section 8.3_, GBandT shall pay to SunTrust its reasonable, out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys\' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount so payable at the prime lending rate prevailing at such time, as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ , from the date such amounts were required to be paid until the date actually received by SunTrust. 

  

       

 8.4 _ Amendment_. This Agreement may, to the extent legally allowed, be amended by the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the shareholders of GBandT; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the shareholders of GBandT, there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement that (a) alters or changes the amount or the form of the consideration to be delivered under this Agreement to the holders of GBandT Common Stock, if such alteration or change would adversely affect the holders of any security of GBandT, (b) alters or changes any term of the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation if such alteration or change would adversely affect the holders of any securities of GBandT, or (c) alters or changes any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement if such alteration or change would adversely affect the holders of any securities of GBandT, in each case other than as contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties. 

  

 8.5 _ Extension; Waiver_. At any time before the Effective Time, the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. 

  

ARTICLE IX 
 GENERAL PROVISIONS

  

 9.1 _ Closing._ On the terms and subject to conditions set forth in this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 10:00 a.m. on a date and at a place to be specified by the parties, which date shall be no later than five business days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the latest to occur of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing), unless extended by mutual agreement of the parties (the " _Closing Date_ "). If the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ are satisfied or waived during the two weeks immediately before the end of a fiscal quarter of SunTrust, then SunTrust may postpone the Closing until the first full week after the end of that fiscal quarter.

Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, the representations and warranties contained in (a) _Sections 3.1(a)_, _3.2_ , _3.3(a)_ , _3.3(b)(i)_ and  _3.7_ in the case of GBandT, and _Sections 4.1(a)_ , _4.2_ , _4.3(a)_ , _4.3(b)(i)_  and _4.7_ in the case of SunTrust, shall be deemed untrue and incorrect if not true and correct in all material respects, and (b) _Section 3.8(a)_ in the case of GBandT and _Section 4.8(a)_ in the case of SunTrust, shall be deemed untrue and incorrect if not true and correct in all respects.

 9.5 _ Interpretation._ When a reference is made in this Agreement to Articles, Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The GBandT Disclosure Schedule and the SunTrust Disclosure Schedule, as well as all other schedules and all exhibits hereto, shall be deemed part of this Agreement and included in any reference to this Agreement.

purposes of this Agreement, (a) " _person_ " means an individual,
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
association, trust, unincorporated organization or other entity (including
its permitted successors and assigns) and (b) " _knowledge_ " of any person
that is not an individual means the knowledge of such person\'s directors and
senior executive officers.

  

 9.6 _ Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that each party need not sign the same counterpart. 

  

 9.7 _ Entire Agreement._ This Agreement (including the Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits hereto and the other documents and the instruments referred to in this Agreement), together with the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, other than the Confidentiality Agreement. 

  

 9.8 _ Governing Law; Jurisdiction._ This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Georgia applicable to contracts made and wholly performed within such state, without regard to any applicable conflicts-of-law principles. The parties agree that any suit, action or proceeding brought by either party to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in any federal court located in Atlanta, Georgia having jurisdiction over the matter; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such a federal court does not have jurisdiction over the matter, any aforementioned suit, action or proceeding shall be brought in a state court located in Atlanta, Georgia having jurisdiction over the matter. Each of the parties submits to the jurisdiction of any such court in any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and hereby irrevocably waives the benefit of jurisdiction derived from present or future domicile or otherwise in such action or proceeding. Each party irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. 

  

 9.9 _ Publicity._ Neither GBandT nor SunTrust shall, and neither GBandT nor SunTrust shall permit any of its Subsidiaries or agents to, issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) of SunTrust, in the case of a proposed announcement by GBandT, or GBandT, in the case of a proposed announcement by SunTrust or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that any party may, without the prior consent of the other parties (but after prior consultation with the other parties to the extent practicable under the circumstances) issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement to the extent required by law or by the rules and regulations of any applicable securities exchange.

Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by each of the parties and their respective successors and assigns. Except as otherwise specifically provided in _Section 6.7_, this Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to in this Agreement) is not intended to and does not confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies under this Agreement. 

        
  

 9.11 _ Enforcement of Agreement._ The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. 

  

 9.12 _ Severability._ Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only as broad as is enforceable.

 _Exhibit A _

  

 _Form of Affiliate Letter_

  

SunTrust Banks, Inc. 
 303 Peachtree Street NE 
 Atlanta, GA 30308

  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  

 I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of GBandT Bancshares, Inc., a Georgia corporation (" _GB andT_"), as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the rules and regulations (the " _Rules and Regulations_ ") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _Commission_ ") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Act_ "). I have been further advised that pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of November 2, 2007 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), by and between SunTrust Banks, Inc., a Georgia corporation (" _SunTrust_ ") and GBandT, GBandT shall be merged with and into SunTrust (the " _Merger_ "). All terms used in this letter but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement. 

  

 I represent, warrant and covenant to SunTrust that if I receive any SunTrust Common Stock as a result of the Merger: 

  

  

 (a) I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of SunTrust Common Stock in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations. 

  

 (b) I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and discussed its requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of SunTrust Common Stock to the extent I believed necessary with my counsel or counsel for GBandT. 

  

 (c) I have been advised that the issuance of SunTrust Common Stock to me pursuant to the Merger will be registered with the Commission under the Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, I have also been advised that, since at the time the Merger will be submitted for a vote of the shareholders of GBandT I may be deemed to have been an affiliate of GBandT and the distribution by me of SunTrust Common Stock has not been registered under the Act, I may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of SunTrust Common Stock issued to me in the Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under the Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under the Act or (iii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to SunTrust, such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the Act. 

  

 (d) I understand that SunTrust is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer or other disposition of SunTrust Common Stock by me or on my behalf under the Act or to take any other action necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration available. 

  

 (e) I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to SunTrust\'s transfer agents with respect to SunTrust Common Stock and that there will be placed on the certificates for SunTrust Common Stock issued to me, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance: "The securities represented by this certificate have been issued in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 applies and may only be sold or otherwise transferred in compliance with the requirements of Rule 145 or pursuant to a registration statement under that act or an exemption from such registration." 

  

 (f) I also understand that unless the transfer by me of my SunTrust Common Stock has been registered under the Act or is a sale made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145, SunTrust reserves the right to put the following legend on the certificates issued to my transferee: 

     

"The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under
the Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from a person who received   

    

such shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the
Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares have been acquired by the holder
not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution
thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be sold,
pledged or otherwise transferred except in accordance with an exemption from
the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933."

    

  

 It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend, and/or the issuance of a letter to SunTrust\'s transfer agent removing such stop transfer instructions, and the above restrictions on sale will cease to apply, if (A) one year (or such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(2) under the Securities Act or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the Closing Date and the provisions of such Rule are then available to me; (B) if two years (or such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(3) under the Act or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the Effective Time and the provisions of such Rule are then available to me; or (C) I shall have delivered to SunTrust (1) a copy of a letter from the staff of the Commission, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to SunTrust, or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to SunTrust, to the effect that such legend and/or stop transfer instructions are not required for purposes of the Act or (2) reasonably satisfactory evidence or representations that the securities represented by such certificates are being or have been transferred in a transaction made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145 under the Act or pursuant to an effective registration under the Act. 

  

 I recognize and agree that the foregoing provisions also apply to (i) my spouse, (ii) any relative of mine or my spouse occupying my home, (iii) any trust or estate in which I, my spouse or any such relative owns at least 10% beneficial interest or of which any of us serves as trustee, executor or in any similar capacity and (iv) any corporate or other organization in which I, my spouse or any such relative owns at least 10% of any class of equity securities or of the equity interest. 

  

 It is understood and agreed that this letter agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect if the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. 

  

 Execution of this letter agreement should not be construed as an admission on my part that I am an "affiliate" of GBandT as described in the first paragraph of this letter agreement or as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to any claim that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter agreement.
