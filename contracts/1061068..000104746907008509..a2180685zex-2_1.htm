Section&nbsp;368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Code</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), and this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of

disclosed on their federal income Tax Returns all positions taken therein that are reasonably likely to give rise to a "substantial understatement" of federal income Tax within the meaning of
Section&nbsp;6662 of the Code. Since September&nbsp;30, 2000, no claim has ever been made by an authority in a jurisdiction
where GB&amp;T or any of its Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that GB&amp;T or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. To the knowledge of GB&amp;T and its
Subsidiaries, there are no Liens for Taxes (other than Taxes not yet due and payable) upon any of the assets of GB&amp;T or any of its Subsidiaries and there are no such Liens that are pending. Neither
GB&amp;T nor any of its Subsidiaries has directly or indirectly owned an interest in a real estate investment trust or any legal entity whose purpose is to hold and manage investment securities. Neither
GB&amp;T nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return other than a group the common parent of which is GB&amp;T. Neither GB&amp;T nor any of
its Subsidiaries has issued or assumed any corporate acquisition indebtedness (within the meaning of Section&nbsp;279(b) of the Code), or any obligation described in Section&nbsp;279(a)(2) of the
Code. Except as disclosed on </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;3.10(a)(4)</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> of the GB&amp;T Disclosure Schedule, neither GB&amp;T nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any direct or

with respect to GB&amp;T or its Subsidiaries. GB&amp;T has received the Georgia Department of Revenue's approval letter permitting GB&amp;T and its Subsidiaries to file&nbsp;a consolidated income tax return in
Georgia. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Ladies

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of GB&amp;T Bancshares,&nbsp;Inc., a Georgia corporation
("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>GB&amp;T</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c)&nbsp;and (d)&nbsp;of Rule&nbsp;145 of the rules and regulations (the

November&nbsp;2, 2007 (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Merger Agreement</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), by and between SunTrust Banks,&nbsp;Inc., a Georgia corporation
("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>SunTrust</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") and GB&amp;T, GB&amp;T shall be merged with and into SunTrust (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Merger</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). All terms used in
this letter but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
represent, warrant and covenant to SunTrust that if I receive any SunTrust Common Stock as a result of the Merger: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and discussed its requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer or otherwise
dispose of SunTrust Common Stock to the extent I believed necessary with my counsel or counsel for GB&amp;T. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
have been advised that the issuance of SunTrust Common Stock to me pursuant to the Merger will be registered with the Commission under the Act on a Registration
Statement on Form&nbsp;S-4. However, I have also been advised that, since at the time the Merger will be submitted for a vote of the shareholders of GB&amp;T I may be deemed to have been an
affiliate of GB&amp;T and the distribution by me of SunTrust Common Stock has not been registered under the Act, I may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of SunTrust Common Stock issued to me in the
Merger unless (i)&nbsp;such sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under the Act, (ii)&nbsp;such sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the volume and
other limitations of Rule&nbsp;145 promulgated by the Commission under the Act or (iii)&nbsp;in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to SunTrust, such sale, transfer or other disposition
is otherwise exempt from registration under the Act. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
understand that SunTrust is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer or other disposition of SunTrust Common Stock by me or on my behalf under the Act or to
take any other action necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration available. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to SunTrust's transfer agents with respect to SunTrust Common Stock and that there will be placed on the
certificates for SunTrust Common Stock issued to me, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance:&nbsp;"The securities represented by this certificate have been issued in a
transaction to which Rule&nbsp;145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 applies and may only be sold or otherwise transferred in compliance with the requirements of Rule&nbsp;145 or
pursuant to a registration statement under that act or an exemption from such registration." </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
also understand that unless the transfer by me of my SunTrust Common Stock has been registered under the Act or is a sale made in conformity with the provisions of
Rule&nbsp;145, SunTrust reserves the right to put the following legend on the certificates issued to my transferee: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
is understood and agreed that this letter agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect if the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. </FONT></P>
