expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers, consultants and other

 \t\t\t\t 2.8 \t\t\tConversion of Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Company or the
holder of any of the following securities: 

---|--- 

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tNo Effect on Parent Common Stock. Each share of Parent
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain
issued and outstanding and shall not be affected by the Merger. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tConversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of
Company Common Stock (other than the Dissenting Shares and Non-Accredited
Investor Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than any Cancelled Shares) shall, subject to Section 2.8(f), be
converted into the right to receive, without interest, the following
consideration (the "Merger Consideration"): (i) an amount in cash equal to
the Per Share Cash Amount (the "Cash Consideration"), (ii) the number of
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the Exchange Ratio (the "Stock Consideration") and (iii) the right to
receive cash pursuant to Section 9.3. Subject to Section 2.10(h), the total
number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued to Accredited Investors
in the aggregate will be equal to the Aggregate Stock Consideration. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tCancellation of Certain Shares of Company Common Stock.
All shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time that are owned (directly or indirectly) by Parent or
Company or held in treasury by Company (other than (i) shares of Company
Common Stock held in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like, or
otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially owned
by third parties and (ii) shares of Company Common Stock held, directly or
indirectly, by Parent or Company in respect of a debt previously contracted)
shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, 

---|--- 

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t15  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor (such cancelled
shares, the "Cancelled Shares"). 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (d) \t\t\tDissenting Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision
contained in this Agreement, no shares of Company Common Stock that are issued
and outstanding as of the Effective Time and that are held by a stockholder
who has properly exercised such stockholder's appraisal rights (any such
shares being referred to herein as "Dissenting Shares") under Section 17-6712
of the KGCC shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.8(b) and instead shall be entitled to
such rights (but only such rights) as are granted by Section 17-6712 of the
KGCC (unless and until such stockholder shall have failed to perfect, or shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost, such stockholder's right to dissent from
the Merger under the KGCC) and to receive such consideration as may be
determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to and
subject to the requirements of the KGCC. If any such stockholder shall have
failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right prior
to the Effective Time, each of such stockholder's shares of Company Common
Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have made a Cash Election (unless such
stockholder shall have timely submitted to Parent an Investor Questionnaire
establishing such stockholder's status as an Accredited Investor, in which
case such stockholder's shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be
deemed to be Non-Election Shares). If any holder of Dissenting Shares shall
have so failed to perfect or has effectively withdrawn or lost such
stockholder's right to dissent from the Merger after the Effective Time, each
of such stockholder's shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed
to have been converted into and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the
right to receive the Stock Consideration or the Cash Consideration, or a
combination thereof, as determined by Parent in its sole discretion. Company
shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any notice or demand for appraisal or
payment for shares of Company Common Stock received by Company and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to any such demand or notices. Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle, offer
to settle or otherwise negotiate any such demands. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (e) \t\t\tNon-Accredited Investor Shares. All shares of Company
Common Stock that are issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and that
are held by a Holder who has not properly completed and delivered an Investor
Questionnaire to Company prior to the date of this Agreement, or to the
Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.10(b), that certifies, to the
satisfaction of Parent, that such Holder is an "accredited investor" (as such
term is defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act) (an "Accredited
Investor") shall be deemed to be "Non-Accredited Investor Shares" and shall be
converted into the right to receive (A) an amount in cash equal to the Per
Share Amount and (B) the right to receive cash pursuant to Section 9.3. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (f) \t\t\tAdjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall have
been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or
kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock
split, or other similar change in capitalization, an appropriate and
proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Merger Consideration, Per Share
Amount and other dependent items, as applicable.

purposes only and based on the assumptions set forth therein, an illustration
of the calculation of the Per Share Cash Amount and the Exchange Ratio for the
Parent Common Stock is set forth in Section 2.8(g) of the Disclosure Schedule.
In the event of any conflict between Section 2.8(g) of the Disclosure Schedule
and the provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall

---|--- 

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tAs of the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares
of Company Common Stock granted under the Company Equity Plan (each, a
"Company Option") shall be treated as follows: 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t(i) \t\t\tIf, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, all
outstanding and unexercised Company Options are In-the-Money Options assuming
no cash is distributed pursuant to Section 9.3, then each Company Option,
whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall fully vest (to the extent unvested) and, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Amount over
the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of such Company Option,
multiplied by (2) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Option and the right to receive cash pursuant to Section 9.3 in
respect of each share of Company Common Stock underlying such Company Option
as of the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation shall issue the
consideration described in Section 2.9(a)(i)(A), less applicable tax
withholdings, within five (5) business days following the Closing Date. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t(ii) \t\t\tIf, prior to the Effective Time, either Parent or
Company determines in its reasonable judgment that, as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, there will be outstanding and unexercised Company Options
that would not be In-the-Money Options if no cash is distributed pursuant to
Section 9.3, then the board of directors of Company (or the appropriate
committee thereof) shall determine in good faith the "Fair Market Value" (as
defined in the Company Equity Plan) of a share of Company Common Stock as of
the Effective Time, which determination shall be made in consultation with
Parent, and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all
outstanding and unexercised Company Options shall, as of the Effective Time,
be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal
to the product of the excess, if any, of such Fair Market Value over the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock multiplied by the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option (and shall have
no right to receive cash pursuant to Section 9.3), and the aggregate cash
amount payable pursuant to this Section 2.9(a)(ii) shall be deemed to be
Aggregate Option Consideration. Any Company Option that has an exercise price
per share of Company Common Stock that is greater than or equal to such Fair
Market Value shall be cancelled in exchange for no consideration. The
Surviving Corporation shall issue the consideration described in this Section
2.9(a)(ii), less applicable tax withholdings, within five (5) business days
following the Closing Date.

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tAs of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
award in respect of a share of Company Common Stock that is subject to
vesting, repurchase or other lapse restrictions granted under the Company
Equity Plan (each, a "Company Restricted Stock Award") that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall fully vest and, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
respect of each share of Company Common Stock underlying such Company
Restricted Stock Award and the right to receive cash pursuant to Section 9.3
as set forth in Section 2.8(b). 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tPrior to the Effective Time, the board of directors of
Company (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions
and take any necessary actions to effectuate the actions contemplated by this
Section 2.9. Company shall take all necessary actions to ensure that after
the Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
required to deliver shares of Company Common Stock or other capital stock of
Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of Company Options, Company
Restricted Stock Awards or otherwise.

 \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tAt or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, (i) certificates
representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to deliver, and
Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely deliver, the Aggregate
Stock Consideration and (ii) immediately available funds equal to the
Aggregate Cash Consideration (together with, to the extent then determinable,
any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.10(h))
(together, the "Exchange Fund"), and Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent
to timely pay the Aggregate Cash Consideration, and such cash in lieu of
fractional shares, in accordance with this Agreement. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tPrior to the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall
mail to each Holder as of the business day immediately prior to such mailing
or delivery, (i) a letter of transmittal substantially in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit B with such modifications as may be required by the Exchange
Agent) (the "Letter of Transmittal"), (ii) instructions for use in
surrendering shares of Company Common Stock in exchange for the Merger
Consideration, and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in accordance with
Section 2.10(h), and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.10(d) and (iii) an Investor Questionnaire. As
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent
shall mail to each holder of record of Company Common Stock as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than such holders who received a Letter of
Transmittal pursuant to the preceding sentence) (i) a Letter of Transmittal
and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering Certificate(s) representing
shares of Company Common Stock in exchange for the Merger Consideration, and
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or
paid in consideration therefor in accordance with Section 2.10(h), and any
dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.10(d). 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tUpon the later of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the
surrender to the Exchange Agent of Certificates, accompanied by a properly
completed Letter of Transmittal and, 

---|--- 

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t18  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

if applicable, a duly executed Investor Questionnaire that, in the reasonable
determination of Parent, provides that the Holder is an Accredited Investor,
such Holder will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration and any cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by its Certificate(s). Until so surrendered, each Certificate
shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to
receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid upon surrender
of such Certificate in accordance with, and any dividends or distributions to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to, this Article II. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (d) \t\t\tNo dividends or other distributions with respect to
Parent Common Stock shall be paid to the Holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented
thereby, in each case unless and until the surrender of such Certificate in
accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate in accordance with this Article II the record holder thereof shall
be entitled to receive, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable
with respect to the whole shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such
Certificate and not paid and/or (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions payable with respect to shares of
Parent Common Stock represented by such Certificate with a record date after
the Effective Time (but before such surrender date) and with a payment date
subsequent to the issuance of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to
such Certificate. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (e) \t\t\tIn the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate
that is not registered in the stock transfer records of Company, the proper
amount of cash and/or shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid or issued in
exchange therefor to a Person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Certificate formerly
representing such Company Common Stock shall be properly endorsed or otherwise
be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment or
issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of
the payment or issuance to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that the Tax has been
paid or is not applicable. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (f) \t\t\tParent, the Exchange Agent and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration, any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.10(d) and any other amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as Parent, the Exchange Agent
or the Surviving Corporation are required to deduct and withhold under the
Code, or any provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax law. To the extent
that any amount is so deducted or withheld by the Exchange Agent, Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, such amount shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom
such amount otherwise would have been paid. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (g) \t\t\tAfter the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on
the stock transfer books of Company of any shares of Company Common Stock that
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than
to settle transfers of Company Common 

---|--- 

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t19  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

Stock that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented for transfer to Parent, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor in accordance with Section 2.8(b) and the procedures set forth in
this Article II. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (h) \t\t\tNotwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates for
exchange, no dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock
shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any
such fractional share, Parent shall pay to each former stockholder of Company
who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share, an amount in
cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying (i) the
Parent Stock Price by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account
all shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time
and rounded to the nearest one-thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of
Parent Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive. The parties hereto acknowledge that payment of the cash
consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares was not separately
bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off
for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent that would
otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (i) \t\t\tAny portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed
by the stockholders of Company as of the first (1st) anniversary of the
Effective Time shall be paid to Parent. Any former stockholders of Company
who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look
only to Parent with respect to the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on Parent
Common Stock deliverable in this Agreement, in each case, without any interest
thereon. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed as of a date which is
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Parent, Company, or any other Person shall be liable to any
former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in
good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (j) \t\t\tIn the event that any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
reasonably required by Parent and Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person
of a bond in such amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 \t\t\t\t 2.11 \t\t\tEscrow. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall

the Escrow Agreement to act as Escrow Agent (the "Escrow Agent") hereunder.
At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall

cause to be deposited, with the Escrow Agent, immediately available funds
equal to the Escrow Deposit Amount (the "Escrow Fund"). The Escrow Fund shall
be distributed in accordance with Section 9.3.

 \t\t\t\t 2.12 \t\t\tBank Merger. Immediately following the Merger, Company
Banks will merge with and into Parent Bank. Parent Bank shall be the
surviving entity in the Bank Merger and, following the Bank Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Company Banks shall cease. The parties hereto
agree that the Bank Merger will become effective simultaneously with the
Effective Time. The Bank Merger shall be implemented pursuant to a bank
merger agreement, in a form to be specified by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to Company, and Parent and Company shall cause Company Banks and
Parent Bank, respectively, to execute such plan of merger and such usual and
customary certificates of merger and such other documents and certificates as
are necessary to make the Bank Merger effective simultaneously with the
Effective Time.

Section 3.18 of the Disclosure Schedule, there are no legal, administrative,
arbitral or other proceedings, claims or actions or any private environmental

subject to any agreement, order, judgment or decree by or with any court,
governmental authority, regulatory agency or third party imposing any
liability or obligation with respect to the foregoing. There has been no
written third-party environmental site assessment conducted since January 1,

numbers, applicable deductible levels, policy periods, available limits of
coverage, and information regarding any settlement or commutation of the same)
and Company has provided, or made available, true and complete copies of all
such Company Policies to Parent. There is no claim for coverage by Company or

coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters of such
Company Policies or in respect of which such underwriters have reserved their
rights. All premiums payable by Company or its Subsidiaries have been timely
paid, by Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable. Neither Company nor any

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tNeither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
any, and there are no pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened,
legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions or
governmental or regulatory investigations of any nature against Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected to, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tThere is no injunction, order, judgment or decree
imposed upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that would reasonably be
expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

 \t\t\t\t 4.11 \t\t\tNo Undisclosed Liabilities. Except (i) for those
liabilities that are reflected on, reserved against or disclosed in the notes
to Parent's consolidated balance sheets included in the Parent's Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the year ended March 31, 2017 (the "Parent Balance
Sheet"), and (ii) for liabilities incurred since March 31, 2017, in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries has any material liability of any nature whatsoever,
taken as a whole (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and
whether due or to become due), whether or not the same would have been
required to be reflected on the Parent Balance Sheet if it had existed on
March 31, 2017.

 \t\t\t\t 4.12 \t\t\tInsurance. Parent and its Subsidiaries currently
maintain, or are covered by, insurance in such amounts and covering such risks
as is considered by Parent to be reasonable for their respective operations

Parent, such insurance of Parent and its Subsidiaries is valid and enforceable
and in full force and effect in all material respects. Parent believes that
it will be able to renew its existing insurance and its Subsidiaries'
insurance as and when such coverage expires or will be able to obtain
replacement insurance adequate for the conduct of the business and the value
of its properties at a cost that could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

nature seeking to impose or that could reasonably be expected to result in the
imposition, on Company or any of its Subsidiaries, of any liability or
obligation arising under any Environmental Laws pending or, to the Knowledge
of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. To the
Knowledge of Parent, there is no reasonable basis for any such proceeding,
claim, action or governmental investigation that would impose any liability or
obligation that would have or would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of Parent, during or prior to the period of

property, (ii) Parent's or any of its Subsidiaries' participation in the
management of any property, or (iii) Parent's or any of its Subsidiaries'

and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated herein. Each of Parent and Company shall use their reasonable
best efforts to resolve any objections that may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything set forth in this
Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to require
Parent to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any
condition or restrictions, in connection with obtaining the foregoing permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of Governmental Entities or third
parties that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
the business, results of operations or financial condition of Company or
Parent (measured on a scale relative to Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole) or on the expected benefits to be received by Parent from the Mergers
following the Closing, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
determination by a Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that the
Bank Merger may not be consummated as contemplated herein, including
simultaneously with the Effective Time (a "Materially Burdensome Regulatory
Condition"); provided that, if requested by Parent, then Company and its
Subsidiaries will take or commit to take any such action, or agree to any such
condition or restriction, so long as such action, commitment, agreement,
condition or restriction is binding on Company and its Subsidiaries only in
the event the Closing occurs.

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tSubject to applicable law relating to the exchange of
information, Parent and Company shall, upon request, furnish each other with
all information concerning Parent, Company and their respective Subsidiaries,
directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be
reasonably necessary in connection with any statement, filing, notice or
application made by or on behalf of Parent, Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tSubject to applicable law relating to the exchange of
information, Parent and Company shall promptly advise each other upon
receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity or third party whose
consent or approval is required for consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement which causes such party to believe that there
is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval or other
consent or approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such
approval will be materially delayed.

 \t\t\t\t 6.2 \t\t\tAccess to Information. Subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement, each of Company and Parent agrees to provide to the officers,
directors, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors, agents and
other representatives of the other Party, from time to time prior to the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, such information as such
Party shall reasonably request with respect to the other Party's businesses,
financial conditions and operations and such access to the properties, books
and records and personnel as such Party shall reasonably request, which access
shall occur during normal business hours and shall be conducted in such manner
as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the other
Party, and, during such period, such Party shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, make available to the other Party (i) a copy of each report,
schedule, and other document filed or received by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of state or federal banking laws (other than
reports or documents that such Party is not permitted to disclose under
applicable law) and (ii) all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as the other

Party may reasonably request. Parent and Company shall comply with, and cause
their respective officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel,
financial advisors, agents and other representatives to comply with, all of
their respective obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall
survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms set
forth therein.

 \t\t\t\t 6.3 \t\t\tStockholder Approval. Company, the Significant
Stockholders and the board of directors of Company shall use their reasonable
best efforts to obtain from its stockholders the stockholder consent in favor
of the approval and adoption of this Agreement required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement prior to the date and time set
forth in Section 8.1(f). Prior to the receipt of the approval of its
stockholders, Company shall have delivered to its stockholders all required
disclosures under, and in accordance with, applicable law describing this
Agreement, the other agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, including the Mergers. Following the receipt of the approval of its
stockholders, Company shall deliver to its stockholders all notices required
by, and in accordance with, applicable Law and/or its Articles of
Incorporation and bylaws and shall cause such notice to include a copy of
Section 17-6712 of the KGCC and such other information as is required by the

 \t\t\t\t 6.4 \t\t\tPublic Disclosure. Neither Company nor Parent shall,
and neither Company nor Parent shall permit any of its Subsidiaries or agents
to, issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public
announcement with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
without the prior consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld)
of Parent, in the case of a proposed announcement by Company, or Company, in
the case of a proposed announcement by Parent; provided, however, that either
Party may, without the prior consent of the other Party (but after prior
consultation with the other Party to the extent practicable under the
circumstances) issue or cause the publication of any press release or other
public announcement to the extent required by law. Company and Parent agree
that the press release initially announcing the execution of this Agreement
will be a joint press release of Parent and Company.

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tWith respect to any employee benefit plans of Parent or
its Subsidiaries in which any employees of Company and its Subsidiaries who
continue to be employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries) immediately following the Effective Time
(collectively, the "Continuing Employees") become eligible to participate on
or after the Effective Time (the "New Plans"), Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable
efforts to: (i) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
such employees and their eligible dependents under any New Plans, except to
the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would
apply under the analogous Company Benefit Plan, (ii) provide each such
employee and their eligible dependents with credit for any eligible expenses
incurred by such employee or 

---|--- 

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t52  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

dependent prior to the Effective Time under a Company Benefit Plan (to the
same extent that such credit was given under the analogous Company Benefit
Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible, co-
payment or out-of-pocket requirements under any New Plans, and (iii) recognize
all service of such employees with Company and its Subsidiaries for all
purposes in any New Plan to the same extent that such service was taken into
account under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time;
provided that the foregoing service recognition shall not apply (A) to the
extent it would result in duplication of benefits for the same period of
services, (B) for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit
pension or the employer premium subsidy under any retiree medical plan, or (C)
to any benefit plan that is a frozen plan or that provides benefits to a
grandfathered employee population. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tIf requested by Parent in writing at least ten (10)
business days prior to the Effective Time, Company shall cause any 401(k) plan
sponsored or maintained by Company (each, a "Company 401(k) Plan") to be
terminated effective as of the day immediately prior to the Effective Time and
contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing. In the event that Parent
requests that any Company 401(k) Plan be terminated, (i) Company shall provide
Parent with evidence that such plan has been terminated (the form and
substance of which shall be subject to reasonable review and comment by
Parent) not later than two (2) days immediately preceding the Effective Time
and (ii) the Continuing Employees of Company shall be eligible to participate,
effective as of the Effective Time, in a 401(k) plan sponsored or maintained
by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries (a "Parent 401(k) Plan"). Parent and
Company shall take any and all actions as may be required, including
amendments to any Company 401(k) Plan and/or Parent 401(k) Plan, to permit the
Continuing Employees of Company who are then actively employed to make
rollover contributions to the Parent 401(k) Plan of "eligible rollover
distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) in the
form of cash, notes (in the case of loans) or a combination thereof in an
amount equal to the full account balance distributed to such Continuing
Employee of Company from a Company 401(k) Plan.

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tIf requested by Parent in writing at least ten (10)
business days prior to the Effective Time, Company shall cause the Company
Deferred Compensation Plan to be terminated pursuant to Treas. Reg. §
1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B), effective as of the Effective Time and contingent upon
the occurrence of the Closing.

 \t\t\t\t (d) \t\t\tWithout limiting the generality of Section 10.10, the
provisions of this Section 6.5 are solely for the benefit of the parties to
this Agreement, and no current or former employee or any other individual
associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party
beneficiary of this Agreement. In no event shall the terms of this Agreement
be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit Plan or any
"employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by
Parent, Company or any of their respective Affiliates; (ii) alter or limit the
ability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing
Date, Company and its Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or terminate any Company
Benefit Plan, employment agreement or any other benefit or employment plan,
program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date; or (iii) confer upon
any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant, any right to
employment or continued employment or continued service with Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date, Company and its
Subsidiaries), or constitute or create an employment agreement with any
employee.

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tNational Mortgage Business Wind-down. Company shall,
from and after the date hereof use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
National Mortgage Business to be wound down as promptly as practicable and in
any event prior to December 31, 2017. In connection therewith, Company shall
take all actions reasonably requested by Parent to complete such wind down,
including by taking all of the actions set forth on Section 6.6(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule. All costs of winding down the National Mortgage
Business will be borne by the Holders in accordance with this Section 6.6 and
Exhibit C, provided, however, that Parent agrees that it will assume
$1,000,000 of the total costs necessary to wind down the National Mortgage
Business pursuant to this Section 6.6, which will be reflected as a credit on
the National Mortgage Business Settlement Statement as set forth in Exhibit C.

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tNational Mortgage Business Settlement Mechanics. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t(i) \t\t\tPre-Closing Statements. Company shall maintain
sufficiently segregated records to enable the preparation and calculation of
the settlement statement for the National Mortgage Business in the form
attached as Exhibit C ("National Mortgage Business Settlement Statement").
Within fifteen (15) days following the end of August 2017 and each subsequent
month ending prior to the Effective Date, Company shall deliver to Parent an
estimated National Mortgage Business Settlement Statement as of the end of
such completed month. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t(ii) \t\t\tPost-Closing Statements. From and after the Effective
Time, Parent (x) shall prepare and deliver a National Mortgage Business
Settlement Statement to Holders' Representative within ninety (90) days
following the Closing Date and (y) may prepare and deliver to the Holders'
Representative at any time and from time to time, a National Mortgage Business
Settlement Statement covering the period from January 1, 2017 through the date
set forth in such National Mortgage Business Settlement Statement that is not
more than ninety (90) days prior to its delivery (or through the Closing Date
in the case of the first National Mortgage Business Settlement Statement) and
including therein, without duplication, any payments previously made either to
the Holders (or into the Escrow for the benefit of the Holders) or to Parent
from the Escrow Fund. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t(iii) \t\t\tDisputed Statements. Within twenty (20) calendar days
following the delivery of a National Mortgage Business Settlement Statement,
the Holder's Representative may deliver to Parent a notice of objection, but
only on the basis that such National Mortgage Business Settlement Statement
(x) was not prepared in accordance with this Agreement or (y) contains
mathematical error, signed by the Holder's Representative (an "Objection
Notice") or a notice of acceptance signed by the Holder's Representative (an
"Acceptance Notice") with respect to such National Mortgage Business
Settlement Statement. Parent shall provide the Holder's Representative and
its accountants and other representatives, upon five (5) calendar days advance
notice, access to accounting records relating to the National Mortgage
Business Settlement Statement to the extent reasonably requested by the
Holder's Representative. Parent's National Mortgage Business Settlement
Statement shall be final and binding on the Holder's 

---|--- 

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t54  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

Representative and the Holders if an Acceptance Notice is delivered to Parent,
or if no Objection Notice is delivered to Parent within such twenty (20)
calendar day period. Any Objection Notice shall specify the items disputed,
shall describe the reasons for the objection thereof. If an Objection Notice
is delivered to Parent, the Holder's Representative and Parent shall consult
with each other during the fifteen (15) calendar days following the delivery
of an Objection Notice and use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such
dispute. If Parent and the Holder's Representative are unable to reach
agreement within such fifteen (15) day period after an Objection Notice has
been given, the Holder's Representative may within ten (10) days thereafter
(unless such period is extended in writing by Parent) refer such dispute to a
nationally or regionally recognized accounting firm mutually agreed to by
Parent and the Holder's Representative which does not provide accounting or
other services to the Holder's Representative or Parent or their respective
affiliates (the "Unrelated Accounting Firm") and if Holders' Representative
does not refer such dispute to the Unrelated Accounting Firm within such ten
(10)-day period then the National Mortgage Business Settlement Statement
delivered by Parent shall become final and binding as if no Objection Notice
related thereto had been delivered. The Unrelated Accounting Firm shall be
directed to render a written report on the unresolved disputed issues as
promptly as practicable (but in no event later than forty-five (45) days
following submission of the matter to the Unrelated Accounting Firm) and to
resolve the issues of dispute set forth in the Objection Notice. The
resolution of the dispute by the Unrelated Accounting Firm shall be within the
range of the positions submitted by Parent and the Holders' Representative and
shall be final and binding on the Parties with respect to such dispute. The
fees and expenses of the Unrelated Accounting Firm shall be borne by the
Holders and the Holder's Representative. Parent and the Holder's
Representative shall provide the Unrelated Accounting Firm such accounting
records as may be reasonably requested by the Unrelated Accounting Firm in
order for the Unrelated Accounting Firm to resolve the pending dispute.

 \t\t\t\t(iv) \t\t\tPayments Based on Statements. If such National Mortgage
Business Settlement Statement results in an amount due to the Holders, then
Parent shall cause such amount to be delivered to the Escrow Agent for deposit
into the Escrow Fund. If such National Mortgage Business Settlement Statement
results in an amount due from the Holders, then Parent and the Holders'
Representative shall jointly cause the Escrow Agent to distribute such amount
from the Escrow Fund to Parent, and if there is an insufficient balance in the
Escrow Fund then such amount shall be paid by the applicable Significant
Stockholders pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(vii).

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tFrom and after the Effective Time until the sixth (6th)
anniversary thereof, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold
harmless each person who is now, or who has been at any time before the date
of this Agreement, or who becomes before the Effective Time, an officer or
director of Company (each, a "Company Indemnified Party") against all losses,
claims, damages, costs, expenses (including attorneys' fees), liabilities or
judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement (which settlement shall
require the prior written consent of the Surviving Corporation, which consent
shall not be unreasonably

withheld) of or in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding,
investigation or other legal proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative or investigation (each, a "Claim"), in which a
Company Indemnified Party is, or is threatened to be made, a party or witness
or arising out of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of
Company or a Subsidiary if such Claim pertains to any matter of fact arising,
existing or occurring at or before the Effective Time (including the Mergers
and the other transactions contemplated hereby), regardless of whether such
Claim is asserted or claimed before, or after, the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent permitted under Company's certificate of incorporation or
bylaws to the extent permitted by applicable law. The Surviving Corporation
shall pay reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) in
advance of the final disposition of any such proceeding to each Company
Indemnified Party to the full extent permitted by applicable state or federal
law upon receipt of an undertaking to repay such advance payments if he shall
be adjudicated or determined to be not entitled to indemnification under this
Section 6.7(a). 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tAny Company Indemnified Party wishing to claim
indemnification under Section 6.7(a), upon learning of any Claim, shall
promptly notify the Surviving Corporation thereof. In the event of any such
action (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Surviving
Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof, subject to the
reasonable approval of legal counsel by such Company Indemnified Party, and
the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to such Company Indemnified
Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses
subsequently incurred by such Company Indemnified Parties in connection with
the defense thereof, except that if the Surviving Corporation elects not to
assume such defense or counsel for the Company Indemnified Parties advises
that there are substantive issues which raise conflicts of interest between
the Surviving Corporation and the Company Indemnified Parties, the Company
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and the Surviving
Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the
Company Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are received;
provided that the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this
Section 6.7(b) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Company Indemnified
Parties in any jurisdiction; (ii) the Company Indemnified Parties will
cooperate in the defense of any such Claim; and (iii) the Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior
written consent; and provided, further, that the Surviving Corporation shall
not have any obligation hereunder to any Company Indemnified Party when and if
a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine, and such determination
shall have become final, that the indemnification of such Company Indemnified
Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tPrior to August 1, 2017, Company may deliver to Parent
evidence demonstrating that Company, immediately before the "change in
ownership or control" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall be a

but without regard to Section 1361(b)(1)(C) of the Code), which evidence shall
be (i) certified by a nationally recognized certified public accounting firm
or other professional organization that is a certified public accounting firm
recognized as an expert with regards to Section 280G of the Code and that has
been mutually agreed by Parent and Company, (ii) reasonably satisfactory to
Parent, (iii) reasonably satisfactory to Parent's tax preparation firm, and
(iv) reasonably satisfactory to Parent's independent public accounting firm.
If requested by Parent, Company shall deliver updated evidence of the
foregoing as of immediately prior to the Closing.

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tIf, prior to the date set forth in the first sentence of
Section 6.8(a) (or promptly upon Parent's request as set forth in the second
sentence of Section 6.8(a)), Company does not deliver to Parent evidence that
meets the criteria set forth in Section 6.8(a), then, prior to the Closing
Date, Company shall (i) obtain from each "disqualified individual" (within the
meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code and the regulations thereunder), a
written waiver that shall provide that, if the requisite stockholder approval
under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations thereunder is not
obtained, no payments and/or benefits that would separately or in the
aggregate constitute "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code ("Parachute Payments") with respect to such
disqualified individual in the absence of such stockholder approval shall be
payable to or retained by such disqualified individual to the extent such
Parachute Payments would not be deductible by reason of the application of
Section 280G of the Code or would result in the imposition of the excise tax
under Section 4999 of the Code on such disqualified individual; and (ii)
submit to stockholders of Company for approval, in a manner and form that
complies with the stockholder approval procedures set forth in Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations thereunder any payments and/or
benefits that may separately or in the aggregate constitute Parachute Payments
in the absence of such stockholder approval. All determinations regarding the
Parachute Payments, including the assumptions to be used in arriving at such
determination, shall be made by a nationally recognized certified public
accounting firm or other professional organization that is a certified public
accounting firm recognized as an expert in determinations and calculations for
purposes of Section 280G of the Code mutually agreed by Parent and Company.
All materials, if any, produced by Company in connection with the
implementation of this Section 6.8 shall be provided to Parent at least five
(5) business days in advance for Parent's review and comment, and Company
shall consider any of Parent's requested changes or comments in good faith and
not unreasonably omit them.

Closing Date, but subject to delay for any Scheduled Black-Out Period (in
which case within two (2) business days after the lapse thereof) or as set
forth in Section 6.9(c) (in which case as soon as possible after the lapse of
such postponement or suspension in accordance with the terms thereof), Parent
shall file with the SEC either (i) a Shelf Registration Statement or (ii)
pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, a prospectus supplement that
shall be deemed to be part of an existing Shelf Registration Statement in
accordance with Rule 430B under the Securities Act, in each case relating to
the offer and sale of all of the Registrable Securities by the Holders from
time to time in accordance with the methods of distribution elected by the
Holders (which Parent may limit to methods of distribution approved by the
Holders' Representative prior to

the filing of the Shelf Registration Statement) and set forth in the Shelf
Registration Statement and shall, if such Shelf Registration Statement is not
automatically effective, use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Shelf
Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act as
soon as possible after filing. The Holders shall provide, and Parent's
obligation to take the actions contemplated by this Section 6.9 shall be
conditioned upon the Holders providing in a timely manner, all information
relating to the Holders and their respective Affiliates reasonably requested
by Parent prior to the filing of such Shelf Registration Statement for
inclusion or incorporation in the Shelf Registration Statement and the Shelf
Prospectus forming a part thereof. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tParent shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep
such Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective under the Securities
Act in order to permit the Shelf Prospectus forming a part thereof to be
usable by the Holders until the earlier of (i) the date as of which all
Registrable Securities have been sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration
Statement or another Registration Statement filed under the Securities Act
(but in no event prior to any applicable period referred to in Section 4(3) of
the Securities Act and Rule 174 thereunder), (ii) the date as of which all

without restriction and (iii) the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date.

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tParent shall be entitled to postpone (but not more than
two (2) times in any calendar year) the filing or initial effectiveness of, or
suspend the use of, a Shelf Registration Statement if Parent delivers to the
Holders' Representative and the Holders a certificate signed by the Chief
Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer of Parent, which shall be
kept confidential by the Holders' Representative and the Holders, certifying
that, in the good faith judgment of Parent, such registration, offering or use
would reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect or materially
interfere with any bona fide material financing of Parent or any material
transaction under consideration by Parent or would require the disclosure of
information that has not been, and is not otherwise required to be, disclosed
to the public, the premature disclosure of which would materially and
adversely affect Parent. No such postponement or suspension shall exceed
sixty (60) consecutive days, no subsequent such postponement or suspension
shall commence fewer than fifteen (15) days following the expiration of any
preceding period, and the aggregate of all such postponements or suspensions
shall not exceed ninety (90) days in any 360-day period.

which legend shall state in substance: 

---|--- 

 \t\t

 \t\t\t"The securities evidenced by this certificate have been issued and
sold without registration under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act"), or the securities laws of any state of the
United States (a "State Act") in reliance upon certain exemptions from
registration under said acts. The securities evidenced by this certificate
cannot be sold, assigned or otherwise transferred within the United States

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t58  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

unless such sale, assignment or other transfer is (i) made pursuant to an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act and in accordance
with each applicable State Act or (ii) exempt from, or not subject to, the
Securities Act and each applicable State Act. The securities evidenced by this
certificate are subject to restrictions on transfer set forth in a Merger
Agreement dated June 23, 2017, between National Bank Holdings Corporation and
certain other parties thereto (a copy of which is on file with the Secretary
of National Bank Holdings Corporation)." \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t\t (e) \t\t\tNotwithstanding the foregoing, the holder of any
certificate(s) for such shares shall be entitled to receive from Parent new
certificates for a like number of shares not bearing such legend (or the
elimination or termination of such notations or arrangements) upon the request
of such holder at (i) such time as such restrictions are no longer applicable,
and (ii) with respect to the restriction on transfer of such shares other than
pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act, delivery of an
opinion of counsel to such holder, which opinion is reasonably satisfactory in
form and substance to Parent and its transfer agent, that the restriction
referenced in such legend (or such notations or arrangements) is no longer
required in order to ensure compliance with the Securities Act.

Consideration in an amount greater than twenty percent (20%) of the average
daily trading volume of the Parent Common Stock, as reported by the New York
Stock Exchange, for the twenty (20) trading day period immediately preceding
such day. Any such transfer or attempted transfer of Parent Common Stock in
violation of this Section 6.10 shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
be null and void ab initio, and Parent shall not, and shall instruct its
transfer agent and other third parties not to, record or recognize any such
purported transaction on the share register of Parent.

be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, at the time and in the
manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Mergers. In case at any time after
the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of
Parent, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of Company, on the other hand) or to
vest the Surviving Corporation or Parent Bank (as applicable) with full title
to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of

---|--- 

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tAny claim brought under Section 9.1(a) must be brought
on or before the tenth (10th) anniversary of the date hereof, and any claim
made prior to such tenth (10th) anniversary shall survive until the final
resolution of such claim. The party seeking indemnification hereunder (the
"Indemnified Party") shall notify the Holders' Representative on behalf of the
Holders (the Holders collectively, the "Indemnifying Party") following the
assertion of any claim, or the incurrence of any Losses, that might give rise
to indemnification hereunder; provided, however, that the failure to deliver
such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations
hereunder. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tPromptly after the assertion by any third party of any
claim against any Indemnified Party that in the reasonable judgment of such
Indemnified Party may result in the incurrence by such Indemnified Party of
Losses for which such Indemnified Party would be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall deliver to the
Holders' Representative a written notice describing in reasonable detail (to
the extent known) such claim and the Holders' Representative on behalf of the
Indemnifying Party may, at its option, assume the defense of the Indemnified
Party against such claim (including the employment of counsel, who shall be
reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party) at the Indemnifying Party's
expense. Any failure on the part of the Indemnified Party to provide prompt
notice shall not limit any of the obligations of the Indemnifying Party,
except to the extent such failure actually prejudices the defense of such
claim. Any Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel
in any such action or claim and to participate in the defense thereof, but the
fees and expenses of such counsel shall not be at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party; provided that the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible
for the fees and expenses of the Indemnified Party's counsel in any such
action or claim if (i) the named parties to any such action (including any
impleaded parties) include both such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party and such Indemnified Party or the Holders' Representative shall have
been advised in writing by counsel that there may be one or more legal
defenses available to the Indemnified Party which are not available to, or the
assertion of which would be adverse to the interests of, the Indemnifying
Party or (ii) the Indemnified Party shall have been advised in writing by
counsel that the assumption of such defense by the Holders' Representative on
behalf of the Indemnifying Party would be inappropriate due to an actual or
potential conflict of interest (provided that in the case of clause (i) and
(ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for the fees and expenses of
more than one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties, other than local
counsel). In addition, the Holders' Representative on behalf of the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume control of the defense of
any claim, and shall be responsible for the fees and expenses of the
Indemnified Party's counsel if the Holders' Representative on behalf of the
Indemnifying Party shall have failed, within fifteen (15) business days after
having been notified by the Indemnified Party of the existence of such claim
as provided above, to acknowledge that it is obligated to indemnify the
Indemnified Party in respect of such claim and assume the 

---|--- 

 \t\t

  \t\t

defense of such claim or to notify the Indemnified Party in writing that it
shall assume the defense of such claim. No Indemnifying Party shall be liable
to indemnify any Indemnified Party for any settlement of any such action or
claim effected without the consent of the Holders' Representative on behalf of
the Indemnifying Party (not to be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with
the written consent of the Holders' Representative on behalf of the
Indemnifying Party, or if there be a judgment for the plaintiff in any such
action, the Indemnifying Party shall indemnify and hold harmless each
Indemnified Party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such
settlement or judgment, subject to the limitations set forth in Section
9.2(b). If the Holders' Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying Party
shall assume the defense of any claim in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 9.2(b), the Holders' Representative shall obtain the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party before entering into any settlement
of such claim (not to be unreasonably withheld), unless the settlement
releases the Indemnified Party from all liabilities and obligations with
respect to such claim and does not impose injunctive or other equitable relief
against the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party, on the one hand, and
the Holders' Representative and the Indemnifying Party, on the other hand,
each agrees to fully cooperate in all matters covered by this Section 9.2(b),
including, as required, the furnishing of books and records, personnel and
witnesses and the execution of documents, in each case as necessary for any
defense of such third party claim and at no cost to the other party (provided
that any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Indemnified Party incurred
in connection with the foregoing shall be considered part of any Losses
hereunder).

 \t\t\t\t 9.3 \t\t\tEscrow. If any Parent Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification under Section 9.1, such Parent Indemnitee shall first recover
Losses from the Escrow to the extent of remaining funds in the Escrow in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement, and the Escrow Agent shall maintain a
record of the recovered Losses allocable to each Holder as set forth in the
Escrow Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow
Agent shall promptly release (subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement and
this Agreement relating to existing indemnification claims, which shall not be
released until finally determined in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and
this Agreement) upon the third (3rd) anniversary of the Effective Time (and
any interest or dividends earned thereon pursuant to the Escrow Agreement), to
the Holders' Representative for distribution to the Holders (including for
such purpose holders of In-the-Money Options) the balance of the Escrow Fund,
and following such anniversary the Escrow Threshold shall be deemed to be zero
dollars ($0). If, at any time (x) after the date on which the first National
Mortgage Business Settlement Statement delivered by Parent becomes final
pursuant Section 6.6(b) and any distribution from the Escrow Fund required
thereby has been made, and (y) during the term of the Escrow, the Escrow Fund
(reduced for any then outstanding claims for indemnification made by any
Parent Indemnitee) exceeds the Escrow Threshold, Parent shall, if requested by
the Holders' Representative, jointly with the Holders' Representative cause
the Escrow Agent to distribute from the Escrow Fund up to that amount which
would cause the Escrow Fund balance to equal (after reduction for any then
outstanding claims for indemnification made by any Parent Indemnitee) the
Escrow Threshold in effect at such time.

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tThis Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the
conflicts of law principles of any jurisdiction that would apply the law of a
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tThe parties hereby (i) irrevocably submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the United States of America
located in the State of Delaware (the "Federal Courts"), or, if jurisdiction
in the Federal Courts is not available, the courts of the State of Delaware
(the "Delaware Courts"), in respect of any claim, dispute or controversy
relating to or arising out of the negotiation, interpretation or enforcement
of this Agreement or any of the documents referred to in this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (any such claim being a "Covered
Claim"); (ii) irrevocably agree to request that the Federal Courts (or, if
jurisdiction in the Federal Courts is not available, the Delaware Courts)
adjudicate any Covered Claim on an expedited basis and to cooperate with each
other to assure that an expedited resolution of any such dispute is achieved;
(iii) waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or
proceeding raising a Covered Claim that any of the parties hereto is not
subject to the personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Courts or the Federal
Courts or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not
maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may be inappropriate or
inconvenient or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced
in or by such courts; and (iv) irrevocably agree to abide by the rules of
procedure applied by the Federal Courts or the Delaware Courts, as the case
may be, (including the procedures for expedited pre-trial discovery) and waive
any objection to any such procedure on the ground that such procedure would
not be permitted in the courts of some other jurisdiction or would be contrary
to the laws of some other jurisdiction. The parties further agree that any
Covered Claim has a significant connection with the State of Delaware, and
will not contend otherwise in any proceeding in any court of any other
jurisdiction. Each party represents that it has agreed to the jurisdiction of
the Federal Courts and the Delaware Courts in respect of Covered Claims after
being fully and adequately advised by legal counsel of its own choice 

---|--- 

 \t\t

  \t\t

concerning the procedures and law applied in the Federal Courts and the
Delaware Courts and has not relied on any representation by any other party or
its Affiliates, representatives or advisors as to the content, scope, or
effect of such procedures and law, and will not contend otherwise in any
proceeding in any court of any jurisdiction. Nothing herein shall affect the
right of any party to serve process in any other manner permitted by
applicable law. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tEach party acknowledges and agrees that any controversy
which may arise under this Agreement is likely to involve complicated and
difficult issues, and therefore each such party hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any right such party may have to a trial by jury in
respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party
certifies and acknowledges that: (i) no representative, agent or attorney of
any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party
would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver;
(ii) each party understands and has considered the implications of this
waiver; (iii) each party makes this waiver voluntarily; and (iv) each party
has been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the
mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 10.7. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 10.8 \t\t\tSpecific Performance. The parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any party fails to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and that the parties shall be entitled to specific
performance in such event, in addition to any other remedy at law or in
equity. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 10.9 \t\t\tSeverability. Any term or provision of this Agreement
which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining
terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or
enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any
other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be
unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is
enforceable.

 \t\t\t\t 10.10 \t\t\tAssignment; Third-Party Beneficiaries. Neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations shall be assigned by
any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without
the prior written consent of the other parties; provided, however, that
Parent may assign any of its rights under this Agreement to a Subsidiary of
Parent. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their
respective successors and assigns. Except as set forth in Section 6.7, this
Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein) is not
intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder.

 \t\t\t\t 10.11 \t\t\tHolders' Representative. Each of the Holders hereby
irrevocably appoints the Holders' Representative as its representative,
attorney-in-fact and agent, with full power of substitution to act in the
name, place and stead of such Holder with respect to this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement, including with respect to the Escrow and the Escrow Fund,

deliver all ancillary agreements, statements, certificates, notices,
approvals, extensions, waivers, undertakings, amendments and other documents
required or permitted to be given in connection with this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement, the Escrow or the Escrow Fund (it being understood that such
Holder shall execute and deliver any such documents which the Holders'
Representative agrees to execute) and (b) to give and receive all notices and
communications to be given or received under the Escrow Agreement with respect
to the Holders and to receive service of process in connection with the any
claims under the Escrow Agreement against any or all of the Holders, including
service of process in connection with arbitration.

 \t\t\t\t 10.12 \t\t\tAlternative Structure. The parties hereto expressly
agree that if Parent determines that the Aggregate Cash Consideration is
reasonably expected to exceed fifty-five percent (55%) of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration (such determination, an "Excess Cash Event"), the structure of
the Merger shall be revised such that (x) a newly formed wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent shall merge with and into the Company, with Company as
the surviving corporation, immediately after which the Company shall merge
with and into Parent, with Parent as the surviving corporation. This Agreement
and any related documents shall be, or be deemed to have been, appropriately
amended in order to reflect any revised structure or method as contemplated by
this Section 10.12.
