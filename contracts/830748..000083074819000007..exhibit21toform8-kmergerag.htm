each share of Senior Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to

Section 2.8 Surrender and Payment.

(a)Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a paying
agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Paying Agent") to act as the
agent for the purpose of exchanging the Merger Consideration for: (i) a
certificate or certificates representing shares of Capital Stock (each such
certificate, a "Certificate"), or (ii) book-entry shares which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Capital Stock (the "Book-
Entry Shares").

(b)Parent to Provide Cash. On the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to the
Paying Agent for exchange and payment in accordance with this Article II
through such reasonable procedures as Parent may adopt, an aggregate amount of
cash equal to the Merger Consideration.

(c)Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each holder of record of Capital Stock



represented by a Certificate or Book-Entry Share, whose Capital Stock was
converted into the right to receive the Senior Common Stock Merger
Consideration or the Common Stock Merger Consideration, as applicable, a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent, and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify) and instructions to the letter of transmittal for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for the Senior Common Stock Merger Consideration or Common Stock
Merger Consideration, as applicable. Each holder of shares of Capital Stock
that have been converted into the right to receive the Senior Common Stock
Merger Consideration or the Common Stock Merger Consideration, as applicable,
shall be entitled to receive, subject to Section 2.12, the Senior Common Stock
Merger Consideration or the Common Stock Merger Consideration, as applicable,
in accordance with Section 2.7(a) and Section 2.7(b) in respect of the shares
of Capital Stock represented by a Certificate or Book-Entry Share upon (i)
surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with a duly completed
and validly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may
reasonably be requested by the Paying Agent, or (ii) receipt of an "agent's
message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as
the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of Book-Entry Shares.
Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each outstanding
Certificate or Book-Entry Share that, prior to the Effective Time, represented
shares of Capital Stock will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for
all corporate purposes, to evidence only the right to receive the Senior
Common Stock Merger Consideration or the Common Stock Merger Consideration, as
applicable, in accordance with Section 2.7(a) and Section 2.7(b). No interest
shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender or transfer of
any Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

(d)Transfers of Ownership. If any Senior Common Stock Merger Consideration or
Common Stock Merger Consideration, as applicable, is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Book-Entry Share, as applicable, is registered, it will be a
condition to such payment that (i) such Certificate shall be properly endorsed
or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Share
shall be properly transferred, and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result
of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, or to establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such tax has been paid or is
not payable.

(e)Return of Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Merger Consideration
that remains unclaimed by the Effective Time Holders on the date that is six
(6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of
Capital Stock for the Senior Common Stock Merger Consideration or Common Stock
Merger Consideration, as applicable, prior to that time shall thereafter look
for payment of the Senior Common Stock Merger Consideration or Common Stock
Merger Consideration, as applicable, payable in respect of such shares of
Capital Stock to the Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding



anything to the contrary in this Section 2.8, neither Parent nor any other
party hereto shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by the Effective Time Holders
two (2) years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately
prior to such time when such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Authority) shall, to the extent permitted by Law,
become property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

Section 2.9 No Further Ownership Rights in Capital Stock. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Book-Entry Shares or Certificates representing
ownership of shares of Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares,
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Laws. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, such Certificates shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth
in, this Article II.

Section 2.10 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent shall cause to
be paid in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof in such form as may
be reasonably acceptable to Parent, such payment of the Senior Common Stock
Merger Consideration or Common Stock Merger Consideration, as applicable, as
may be required pursuant to this Article II; provided, however, that Parent
may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof,
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a
bond in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against Parent with respect to the Certificates alleged
to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

Section 2.11 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. If at any time after
the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company, the officers and directors of the
Company and the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized in the name of
their respective entities or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful
and necessary action, so long as such action is not inconsistent with this
Agreement.

Section 2.12 Tax Withholding. Each of the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the Merger Consideration payable hereunder, the amounts required to be
deducted and withheld under the Code, or any provision of any U.S. federal,
state, local or non-U.S. tax law. Any amounts so withheld shall be paid over
to the appropriate Governmental Authority. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted and withheld, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such holder in respect
of whom such deduction and withholding was made.

Section 2.13 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) imposed on any Effective Time



Holder or other Person entitled to receive any portion of the Merger
Consideration pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be borne and paid
by such Effective Time Holder or other Person.
