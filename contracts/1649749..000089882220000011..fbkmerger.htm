hereby,  the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I 
  
  THE MERGER

 

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to  the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the Tennessee Business Corporation Act (the " _TBCA_ "), at
the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company (the "
_Merger_ "), with the Company surviving the  Merger as a direct, wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent (hereinafter sometimes referred to in such capacity and
prior to the Upstream Merger as the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). The Company
shall be the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, and  shall continue its
corporate existence under the laws of the State of Tennessee until the

existence of Merger Sub shall terminate.

 

1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the  terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will occur by electronic exchange of
documents at 10:00 a.m. New York City time, on a date which shall be no later
than three (3) business days after the  satisfaction or waiver (subject to
applicable law) of the latest to occur of the conditions set forth in _Article
VII_ hereof (other than those conditions that by their nature can be satisfied
only at the Closing, but subject to the  satisfaction or waiver of all
conditions at the Closing), unless extended by mutual agreement of the parties
hereto (the " _Closing Date_ ").

 

1.3 _Effective Time_. The  Merger shall become effective as set forth in the
articles of merger with respect to the Merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ")
to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Tennessee (the "
_Tennessee Secretary_ ") on the Closing  Date. The term " _Effective Time_ "
shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes effective, as set forth in
the Articles of Merger.

 

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At  and after the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the TBCA.

 


 

 

 

\- 2 -  

1.5 _Conversion of Company Common  Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company,
Merger Sub or the holder of any of the following securities:

 

(a) Subject to _Section 2.2(e)_,  each share of common stock, no par value
(the " _Company Common Stock_ "), of the Company issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for shares of Company Common
Stock owned by the Company as treasury stock or owned  by the Company or
Parent (in each case other than shares (x) held in trust accounts, managed
accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or
agency capacity that are beneficially owned by third parties, or (y) held, 
directly or indirectly, as a result of debts previously contracted), shall be
converted into (i) 0.9650 shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of common stock,
par value $1.00 per share, of Parent (the " _Parent Common Stock_ ") and (ii)
the right  to receive, without interest $2.00 in cash (the " _Per Share Cash
Consideration_ " and together with the shares of Parent Common Stock
referenced in clause (i), the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 

(b) All of the  shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article _I shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist
as of the Effective Time,  and each certificate (each, a " _Certificate_ ,"
it being understood that any reference herein to "Certificate" shall be deemed
to include reference to book-entry account statements relating to the
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock)  previously representing any
such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right
to receive (i) the Merger Consideration, including a certificate (it being
understood that any reference herein to a "certificate"  representing shares
of Parent Common Stock shall be deemed to include, unless the context
otherwise requires, reference to book-entry account statements relating to the
ownership of shares of Parent Common Stock) representing the number of whole 
shares of Parent Common Stock and Per Share Cash Consideration which such
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate have been
converted into the right to receive pursuant to _Section 1.5(a)_ , (ii) cash
in lieu of  fractional shares which the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate have been converted into the right to receive
pursuant to _Section 1.5(a)_ and _Section 2.2(e)_, without any interest
thereon, and (iii) any  dividends or distributions which the holder thereof
has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.2_. Certificates previously
representing shares of Company Common Stock shall be exchanged for the Merger
Consideration and the other amounts  specified in the immediately preceding
sentence upon the surrender of such Certificates in accordance with _Section
2.2_, without any interest thereon. If, prior to the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company  Common Stock shall have
been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or
kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse
stock  split, or other similar change in capitalization, or there shall be
any extraordinary dividend or distribution, an appropriate and proportionate
adjustment shall be made to the Merger Consideration; _provided_ , that
nothing contained in this  sentence shall be construed to permit the Company
or Parent to take any action with respect to the outstanding shares of Parent
Common Stock or Company Common Stock, as applicable, that is expressly
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 


 

 

 

\- 3 -  

(c) Notwithstanding    anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by Company
as treasury stock or owned by the Company or Parent (in each case other than
shares (i) held in trust accounts, managed  accounts, mutual funds and the
like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity that are
beneficially owned by third parties, or (ii) held, directly or indirectly, as
a result of debts previously contracted) shall be cancelled and cease to 
exist and no Merger Consideration shall be delivered or exchanged therefor.

 

1.6 _Treatment of Company Equity  Awards_.

 

(a) At the  Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock (a " _Company Option_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall, automatically, and without
any required action on the  part of the holder thereof, be cancelled, with
the holder of such Company Option becoming entitled to receive, in full
satisfaction of the rights of the holder with respect thereto, the Merger
Consideration in respect of each Net Share (as defined  below) subject to
each Company Option, less applicable Tax withholding, which shall be delivered
as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date and in no event
later than ten (10) business days following the Closing Date. For  purposes
of this _Section 1.6(a)_ :

 

        

(i)

    |  

" _Net Share_ " means, with respect to a Company Option, the quotient obtained
by dividing (A) the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Per  Share Cash
Equivalent Consideration over the per share exercise price of such Company
Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (B)
the  Per Share Cash Equivalent Consideration.

    
---|--- 
    

 

        

(ii)

    |  

" _Per Share Cash Equivalent Consideration_ " means the sum of (x) the product
(rounded to the nearest cent) obtained by multiplying (A) the  Exchange Ratio
by (B) Parent Common Stock Closing Price plus (y) the Per Share Cash
Consideration.

    
---|--- 
    

 

(b) At the  Effective Time, each award of a share of Company Common Stock
subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction (a " _Company
Restricted Stock Award_ "), whether vested or unvested, that was outstanding
as of December 31, 2019 and  remains outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall fully vest and be cancelled and converted
automatically (without any further action on part of the holder thereto) into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect  of each share of
Company Common Stock underlying such Company Restricted Stock Award. Parent
shall issue the consideration described in this _Section 1.6_ (together with
any accrued but unpaid dividends) corresponding to the Company  Restricted
Stock Awards that vest in accordance with this _Section 1.6(c)_, less
applicable Tax withholdings, within five (5) business days following the
Closing Date.

 

(c) At the  Effective Time, each (i) restricted stock unit award in respect
of shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Company RSU Award_ " and, together
with Company Options, Company Restricted Stock Awards and Company RSU

 


 

 

 

\- 4 -  

Awards, " _Company Equity Awards_ ")) that was outstanding as of December 31,
2019 and remains outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall fully vest and shall be  cancelled and converted automatically (without
any further action on part of the holder thereto) into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Company Common Stock
underlying such Company RSU Award. Parent shall  issue the consideration
described in this _Section 1.6(c)_ , less applicable Tax withholdings, within
five (5) business days following the Closing Date; _provided,_ _however_ ,
that, with respect to any Company RSU Award that  constitutes "deferred
compensation" subject to Section 409A of the Code, settlement or payment of
such award shall be made on the earliest permissible date that such delivery
would not trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

 

(d) At the  Effective Time, (i) each Company Restricted Stock Award and
Company RSU Award that was granted on or after December 31, 2019 and is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, automatically
and without any required action on  the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into a restricted stock award (a " _Parent Restricted Stock Award_
") or a restricted stock unit award (a " _Parent RSU Award_ "), respectively,
in respect of that number of shares of Parent Common  Stock (rounded to the
nearest whole share) equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to the Company Restricted Stock Award or Company
RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by  (ii) the
Stock Award Exchange Ratio. Except as expressly provided in this _Section
1.6(d)_ , each such Parent Restricted Stock Awards and Parent RSU Award shall
be subject to the same terms and conditions (including vesting terms) as
applied  to the corresponding Company Equity Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time. The " _Stock Award Exchange Ratio_ " means the sum of (i) the
Exchange Ratio and (ii) the quotient of (x) the Per Share Cash Amount divided
by (y) the Parent  Common Stock Closing Price.

 

(e) Parent shall  take all corporate action necessary to issue a sufficient
number of shares of Parent Common Stock with respect to the settlement of
Company Equity Awards contemplated by this _Section 1.6_, subject to receipt
of the Requisite Parent Vote.   Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent
shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other
appropriate form, including a Form S-1 or Form S-3 in the case of awards held
by former employees and service providers of the  Company) with respect to
the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to Parent Restricted Stock Awards
and Parent RSU Awards and shall maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current 
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as
such awards remain outstanding.

 

(f) At or prior to  the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors
of the Company and its compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this _Section 1.6_.

 

1.7 _Parent Common Stock_. At  and after the Effective Time, each share of
Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of common stock of Parent
and shall not be affected by the Merger.

 


 

 

 

\- 5 -  

1.8 _Merger Sub Common Stock_.   At and after the Effective Time, each share
of common stock of Merger Sub, no par value per share (the " _Merger Sub
Common Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into one share of common  stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

1.9 _Certificate of Incorporation  of Surviving Corporation_. At the
Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub (the " _Merger
Sub Certificate_ "), as in effect at the Effective Time, shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation  until thereafter
amended in accordance with applicable law.

 

1.10 _Bylaws of Surviving  Corporation_. At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of
Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Bylaws_ "), as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with  applicable law.

 

1.11 _Board of Directors_. The  parties hereto shall take all requisite
action so that from and after the Effective Time, the board of directors of
the Surviving Corporation shall consist of the members of the board of
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective  Time until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

 

1.12 _Upstream Merger and Bank  Merger_. Immediately following the Merger and
as part of a single integrated transaction, the Surviving Corporation will
merge with and into Parent (the " _Upstream Merger_ "). Parent shall be the
surviving entity in the Upstream Merger  and, following the Upstream Merger,
the separate corporate existence of the Surviving Corporation shall cease.
Immediately following the Upstream Merger or at such later time as Parent may
determine, Franklin Synergy Bank, (" _Company Bank_ "),  a Tennessee state-
chartered bank and a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, will merge (the "
_Bank Merger_ ") with and into FirstBank, a Tennessee state-chartered bank and
a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Parent Bank_ "). Parent  Bank shall
be the surviving entity in the Bank Merger and, following the Bank Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Company Bank shall cease. The parties hereto
agree that the Upstream Merger shall become effective immediately after the 
Effective Time and that the Bank Merger shall become effective immediately
after the Upstream Merger or at such later time as Parent may determine. Each
of the Upstream Merger and the Bank Merger shall be implemented pursuant to an
agreement and  plan of merger, in a form to be mutually agreed upon by the
parties (the " _Upstream Merger Agreement_ " and the " _Bank Merger Agreement_
", respectively). The Company and Parent shall execute such certificates of
merger and articles of  merger and such other agreements, documents and
certificates as are necessary to make the Upstream Merger effective ("
_Upstream Merger Certificates_ ") immediately following the Effective Time.
The Company shall cause Company Bank, and Parent  shall cause Parent Bank, to
execute such certificates of merger and articles of merger and such other
agreements, documents and certificates as are necessary to make the Bank
Merger effective (" _Bank Merger Certificates_ ") immediately  following the
Upstream Merger or at such later time as Parent may determine.

ARTICLE II 
  
  EXCHANGE OF SHARES

 

2.1 _Parent to Make Merger  Consideration Available_. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with an
exchange agent designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company
(the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the  benefit of the holders of Certificates,
for exchange in accordance with this _Article II_, (i) certificates or, at
Parent's option, evidence of shares in book entry form (collectively, referred
to herein as " _certificates_ "),  representing the shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued to holders of Company Common Stock, (ii) cash in an
aggregate amount necessary to pay the aggregate Per Share Cash Consideration,
and (iii) cash in lieu of fractional shares (such cash and  certificates for
shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions
with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_
"), to be issued pursuant to _Section 1.5_ and paid pursuant to _Section
_2.2(a)   in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.

 

2.2 _Exchange of Shares_.

 

(a) As promptly as  practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event
later than five (5) business days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more Certificates
representing shares of Company Common Stock  immediately prior to the
Effective Time that have been converted at the Effective Time into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Article I_, a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,  and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration,
and  any cash in lieu of fractional shares, which the shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have been
converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Agreement as well as any
dividends or distributions  to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_. Upon
proper surrender of a Certificate or Certificates for exchange and
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed
letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of  such Certificate or
Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable,
(i) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock to which such holder of Company Common Stock shall have become 
entitled pursuant to the provisions of _Article I_ and (ii) a check
representing the amount of (A) the Per Share Cash Consideration and any cash
in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive in
respect of the shares  of Company Common Stock represented by the Certificate
or Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_,
and (B) any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right
to receive pursuant to this _Section 2.2_,  and the Certificate or
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on the Per Share Cash Consideration or any cash in lieu of
fractional shares payable to holders of Certificates. Until  surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 2.2_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon
surrender, the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional 
shares or in respect of dividends or distributions as contemplated by this
_Section 2.2_.

 


 

 

 

\- 7 -  

(b) No dividends  or other distributions declared with respect to Parent
Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with
this _Article II_. After the  surrender of a Certificate in accordance with
this _Article II_, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any
such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable with respect  to the whole shares of Parent
Common Stock which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate have been converted into the right to receive.

 

(c) If any  certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate or Certificates
surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition
of the issuance thereof that  the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of
transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange  Agent in advance any
transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a
certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than
that of the registered holder of the Certificate or Certificates
surrendered,  or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

 

(d) After the  Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates  representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares as provided in this
_Article II_.

 

(e) Notwithstanding    anything to the contrary contained herein, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend
or distribution with respect to Parent Common  Stock shall be payable on or
with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a
shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional  share,
Parent shall pay to each former shareholder of the Company who otherwise would
be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the
nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average of the closing-sale
prices  of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange as reported by
The Wall Street Journal for the five (5) full trading days ending on the
trading day preceding the Closing Date (" _Parent Common Stock Closing Price_
") by (ii) the fraction  of a share (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth
when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock which such holder would
otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 1.5_. The parties
acknowledge that payment of such cash  consideration in lieu of issuing
fractional shares is not separately bargained-for-consideration, but merely
represents a mechanical rounding off for the purposes of avoiding the expense
and inconvenience that would otherwise be caused by the  issuance of such
fractional shares.

 

(f) Any portion of  the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of the Company for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time
shall be paid to Parent. Any former shareholder of the Company that has not
theretofore complied with this

 


 

 

 

\- 8 -  

_Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger
Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and
distributions on the  Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect of each
former share of Company Common Stock such former shareholder holds as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of  Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable
to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount
delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable

withhold from any consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or  any provision of state, local or

Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) will be paid
over by Parent or the Exchange Act to the appropriate  governmental authority
and (ii) will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the person in respect of which the deduction and withholding was made.

upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such person of a bond in such  amount as Parent may determine is
reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger  Consideration, and
any cash in lieu of fractional shares and dividends or distributions
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

good standing under the laws of the State of Tennessee and is a bank holding
company duly registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System (the " _Federal Reserve Board_ ")    under the Bank Holding Company
Act of 1956, as amended (the " _BHC Act_ "). The Company has the corporate
power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted in all  material respects.
The Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction
in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or
location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such 
licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. As
used in this Agreement,  the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with
respect to Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, a material adverse effect on (i) the business, properties, assets,
liabilities, results of operations or  financial condition of such party and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole ( _provided_ that, with respect to this

principles (" _GAAP_ ") or applicable regulatory accounting requirements, (B)
changes, after the date hereof, in laws, rules or regulations of general
applicability to companies in the industries in which such party  and its

Entities, (C) changes, after the date hereof, in global, national or regional
political conditions (including the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism) or

relationships with its customers or employees) or actions expressly required
by this Agreement in contemplation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
(E) a decline in the trading price of a  party's common stock, in and of
itself, or the failure, in and of itself, to meet earnings projections or
internal financial forecasts (it being understood that the underlying cause of
such decline or failure may be taken into account in  determining whether a
Material Adverse Effect has occurred), (F) the expenses incurred by the
Company or Parent in negotiating, documenting, effecting and consummating the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (G) the occurrence of any 
natural or man-made disaster; except, with respect to subclauses (A), (B), (C)
and (G), to the extent that the effects of such change are materially
disproportionately adverse to the business, properties, assets, liabilities,
results of operations  or financial condition of such party and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other companies in the industry
in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate) or (ii) the ability of such
party to timely consummate the transactions  contemplated hereby. As used in

amended, of the Company (the " _Company Charter_ ")  and Amended and Restated

or leasing of property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so

lease its properties and assets and to carry on its  business as now

Merger Sub to the Company concurrently herewith (the " _Parent Disclosure
Schedule_ ");    _provided_ that (i) no such item is required to be set
forth as an exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would not
result in the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or
incorrect, (ii) the mere inclusion of  an item in the Parent Disclosure

section of _Article IV_ shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of

(notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross reference) from a reading of
the disclosure that such disclosure applies to such other sections, or (b) as
disclosed  in any Parent Reports publicly filed with or furnished to the SEC

Common Stock), will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and no
current or past  shareholder of Parent will have any preemptive right or

Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of their
respective properties or assets may be bound, except (in the case of  clause

registration or statement required to be filed pursuant to the laws, rules or
regulations of the United States, any state, any foreign entity, or any
Regulatory Agency, and have paid all fees and  assessments due and payable in
connection therewith, except where the failure to file such report,
registration or statement or to pay such fees and assessments, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a 
Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Except as set forth on _Section 4.5_ of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule and for normal examinations conducted by a
Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of business of Parent and its

report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or furnished to the
SEC since January 1, 2017 by Parent pursuant to the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act (the " _Parent Reports_ ")    has been made publicly
available. No such Parent Report as of the date thereof (and, in the case of
registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness
and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively), contained any  untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except
that  information filed or furnished as of a later date (but before the date
of this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier
date. Since January 1, 2017, as of their respective dates, all Parent Reports
filed under the  Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied in all

 


 

 

 

\- 32 -  

material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, no executive officer of
Parent has failed in any respect to  make the certifications required of him

4.6 _Financial Statements_.

 

(a) The financial  statements of Parent and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the Parent Reports (including the related notes,
where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the
books and records of Parent and its  Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash flows, changes
in shareholders' equity and consolidated financial position of Parent and its
Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or  as of the respective dates
therein set forth (subject in the case of unaudited statements to year-end

respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with 
applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and

in each case, as  indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. The
books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being,
maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other
applicable legal and accounting  requirements and reflect only actual
transactions. Crowe LLP has not resigned (or informed Parent that it intends
to resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of Parent as a
result of or in connection with any disagreements with  Parent on a matter of
accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing
scope or procedure.

 

(b) Except as  would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries has any liability (whether absolute, accrued,
contingent or otherwise and whether due  or to become due) required by GAAP
to be included on a consolidated balance sheet of Parent, except for those
liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance
sheet of Parent included in its Quarterly Report on Form  10-Q for the
quarter year ended September 30, 2019 (including any notes thereto) and for
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since September 30, 2019, or in connection with this Agreement and
the  transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(c) The records,  systems, controls, data and information of Parent and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the  exclusive ownership and direct
control of Parent or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-
direct control that would not reasonably be expected, either  individually or
in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent (i) has
implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information 
relating to Parent, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief
executive officer and the chief financial officer of Parent by others within
those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures and to  make the certifications required by the Exchange

Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (ii) has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to
Parent's outside auditors and the audit  committee of Parent's Board of
Directors (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the

adversely affect Parent's ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information, and (B) to the knowledge of Parent, any fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in  Parent's internal controls over financial reporting.
These disclosures were made in writing by management to Parent's auditor and
audit committee and a copy has been previously provided to the Company. To the
knowledge of Parent, there is no  reason to believe that Parent's outside
auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not
be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the
rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404  of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, without qualification, when next due.

 

(d) Since  January 1, 2017, (i) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries,

had or obtained knowledge  of any material complaint, allegation, assertion
or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing
practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to
loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and  accruals) of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls,
including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or 
auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
has reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of
fiduciary duty or  similar violation by Parent or any of its officers,

the other transactions contemplated hereby.

or would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

 

(b) Except as set  forth on _Section 4.8_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule
and in connection with matters contemplated, required or permitted by this
Agreement, since September 30, 2019 through the date of this Agreement, Parent

material respects in the ordinary course.

(a) Except as  would not reasonably be expected, either individually or in
the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to

propriety of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) There is no  injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory
restriction imposed upon Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of

expected to be material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

4.10 _Taxes and Tax Returns_.   Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has duly
and timely filed (taking into account all applicable extensions) all material
Tax Returns in all jurisdictions in which Tax Returns are required to be filed
by it, and all such Tax Returns are true,  correct and complete in all
material respects. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is the
beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any material Tax
Return (other than extensions to file Tax Returns obtained in the ordinary

shown on any Tax Returns) that are due have been fully and timely paid. Each
of Parent and its Subsidiaries has withheld and paid all material Taxes
required to have been  withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or
owing to any employee, creditor, shareholder, independent contractor or other
third party. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted any

ARTICLE VI 
  
  ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

6.1 _Regulatory Matters_.

 

(a) Parent and the  Company shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC the
Joint Proxy Statement and Parent shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC
the S-4, in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus.
Each of Parent and the Company  shall use its reasonable best efforts to have
the S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable
after such filing and to keep the S-4 effective for so long as necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by  this Agreement, and Parent and
the Company shall thereafter as promptly as practicable mail or deliver the
Joint Proxy Statement to their respective

 


 

 

 

\- 47 -  

shareholders. Parent shall also use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all
necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to
carry out the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, and the Company
shall furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders of
Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any
such action.

 

(b) The parties  hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their
reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file, or cause to be prepared
and filed, all necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices,
petitions and filings, to obtain as  promptly as practicable all permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Regulatory
Agencies and Governmental Entities which are necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement  (including the
Merger and the Bank Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions of
all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such
Regulatory Agencies and Governmental Entities. Without limiting the generality
of the  foregoing, as soon as practicable and in no event later than thirty
(30) business days after the date of this Agreement, Parent and the Company
shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, each prepare and file
any applications, notices  and filings required to be filed with any bank
regulatory agency in order to obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals.
Parent and the Company shall each use, and shall each cause their applicable
Subsidiaries to use, reasonable best efforts to  obtain each such Requisite
Regulatory Approval as promptly as reasonably practicable. Parent and the
Company shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent
practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to 
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all the information
relating to the Company or Parent, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to,  any third party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising
the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as
promptly as practicable. The parties hereto  agree that they will consult
with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by  this
Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters
relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party
shall consult with the other in advance of any meeting or conference with
any  Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, give
the other party and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and participate
in such meetings and  conferences.

 

(c) In furtherance  and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent
and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of,
or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether  temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent or the
Company to take any action, or commit to take any  action, or agree to any
condition or restriction that would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving
effect to the Merger (a " _Materially Burdensome Regulatory  Condition_ ").

 


 

 

 

\- 48 -  

(d) Parent and the  Company shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Joint  Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the  other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(e) To the extent  permitted by applicable law, Parent and the Company shall
promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication from any
Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is required for consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement that causes such party to
believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory
Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be
materially delayed. As used in this Agreement, the " _Requisite   
Regulatory Approvals_ " shall mean all regulatory authorizations, consents,
orders or approvals from (i) the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the
Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions and (ii) any other approvals
set forth in _Sections    3.4_ and _4.4_ that are necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger and the
Bank Merger, or those other authorizations, consents, orders or approvals the
failure of which to be obtained  would reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

 

6.2 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Upon  reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws, each of Parent
and the Company, for the purposes of verifying the representations and
warranties of the other and preparing for the Merger and the other matters
contemplated by this Agreement,  shall, and shall cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, advisors and other representatives of the other party, access, during
normal business hours during the period prior to the  Effective Time, to all
its properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel, information
technology systems, and records, and each shall cooperate with the other party
in preparing to execute after the Effective Time conversion or consolidation 
of systems and business operations generally, and, during such period, each of
Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to,
make available to the other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration  statement and other document filed or received by it during
such period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or federal
or state banking laws (other than reports or documents that Parent or the
Company, as the case may be, is not  permitted to disclose under applicable
law), and (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as such party may reasonably request. Neither Parent nor the Company
nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be  required to provide access
to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or
prejudice the rights of Parent's or the Company's, as the case may be,
customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution  in
possession or control of such information (after giving due consideration to
the existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement
between the parties) or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment,
decree,  fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date
of this Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the
preceding sentence apply.

 


 

 

 

\- 49 -  

(b) Each of Parent  and the Company shall hold all information furnished by
or on behalf of the other party or any of such party's Subsidiaries or
representatives pursuant to _Section 6.2(a)_ in confidence to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the  provisions of the confidentiality
agreement, dated October 24, 2019, between Parent and the Company (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 

(c) No  investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give either party,  directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete  control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries' respective operations.

 

6.3 _Approvals of Parent and  Company Shareholders_. Each of Parent and the
Company shall call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
shareholders (the " _Parent Meeting_ " and the " _Company Meeting_ ,"
respectively) as soon as reasonably practicable  after the S-4 is declared
effective for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Company Vote and the
Requisite Parent Vote required in connection with this Agreement and the
Merger and, if so desired and mutually agreed, upon other matters of the 
type customarily brought before an annual or special meeting of shareholders
to approve a merger agreement or the issuance of shares in connection
therewith (as applicable). The Board of Directors of each of Parent and the
Company shall use its  reasonable best efforts to obtain from the
shareholders of Parent and the shareholders of the Company, as the case may
be, the Requisite Parent Vote, in the case of Parent, and the Requisite
Company Vote, in the case of the Company, including by  communicating to its
respective shareholders its recommendation (and including such recommendation
in the Joint Proxy Statement) that they approve the Parent Stock issuance or
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (as  applicable).
However, subject to _Sections 8.1_ and _8.2_ , if the Board of Directors of
the Company or Parent, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and,
with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors,  determines in
good faith that it would be more likely than not to result in a violation of
its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this
Agreement, then in submitting this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the
Company  or Parent, as the case may be, may (but shall not be required to)
submit this Agreement to its shareholders without recommendation (although the
resolutions approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be
rescinded or amended), in which  event the Board of Directors of the Company
or Parent, as the case may be, may communicate the basis for its lack of a
recommendation to its shareholders in the Joint Proxy Statement or an
appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent  required by law;
_provided_ that the Board of Directors of the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, may not take any of the actions under this sentence unless (i) it
gives the other party at least three (3) business days' prior written  notice
of its intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the event
or circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action
(including, in the event such action is taken in response to an Acquisition
Proposal, the  latest material terms and conditions of, and the identity of
the third party making, any such Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or
modification thereof, or describe in reasonable detail such other event or
circumstances) and (ii) at the end of  such notice period, the Board of
Directors of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, takes into account any
amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by the other party and
after receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and, with  respect to
financial matters, its financial advisor,

 


 

 

 

\- 50 -  

determines in good faith that it would nevertheless be more likely than not to
result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue
to recommend this Agreement.   Any material amendment to any Acquisition
Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this
_Section 6.3_ and will require a new notice period as referred to in this
_Section 6.3_. Parent or the Company  shall adjourn or postpone the Parent
Meeting or the Company Meeting, as the case may be, if, as of the time for
which such meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares of
Parent Common Stock or the Company Common Stock, as the case  may be,
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of such meeting, or if on the date of such meeting the
Company or Parent, as applicable, has not received proxies representing a
sufficient  number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite Company Vote
or the Requisite Parent Vote. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, each
of the Parent Meeting and  Company Meeting shall be convened and the Parent
Stock Issuance shall be submitted to the shareholders of Parent and this
Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of the Company at the Parent
Meeting and the Company Meeting, respectively,  for the purpose of voting on
the approval of such proposals and the other matters contemplated hereby, and
nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve either Parent or the
Company of such obligation. Parent and the Company shall use their 
reasonable best efforts to cooperate to hold the Company Meeting and the
Parent Meeting on the same day and at the same time as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement, and to set the same record date
for each such meeting.

 

6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger_.     Subject in all respects to _Section
6.1_ of this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or  advisable to comply promptly
with all legal and regulatory requirements that may be imposed on such party
or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and the Bank Merger and,
subject to the conditions set forth in _Article VII_, to  consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to
cooperate with the other party to obtain) any material consent, authorization,
order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any
other  third party that is required to be obtained by the Company or Parent
or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger, the
Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

6.5 _Stock Exchange Listing_.   Parent shall cause the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the New
York Stock Exchange, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the
Effective Time.

 

6.6 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) During the  period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
first anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall provide each employee of
the Company and its Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by Parent or its
Subsidiaries immediately following  the Effective Time (collectively, the "
_Continuing Employees_ ") with (i) a base salary or base wage rate, as
applicable, that is no less favorable than the base salary or base wage rate,
as applicable, provided by the Company or any such  Subsidiary to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) annual or
short-term cash incentive compensation target opportunities that, in each
case, are no less favorable than the annual

 


 

 

 

\- 51 -  

or short-term cash incentive compensation target opportunities provided by
Parent to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries, and
(iii) other compensation and  employee benefits that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the other compensation and employee benefits
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries;
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding  the foregoing clauses (ii) and
(iii), until such time as the Continuing Employees commence participating in
the Parent plans and programs, the foregoing obligations shall be deemed
satisfied by the Continuing Employees' continued participation in  the
Company Benefits Plans, it being understood that participation in the Parent
plans and programs may commence at different times. Without limiting the
immediately preceding sentence and unless otherwise addressed in an employment
agreement  entered into with Parent or Parent Bank or an existing employment,
change in control or severance agreement with Company or Company Bank, Parent
shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to, provide to each Continuing
Employee whose employment  terminates during the 12-month period following
the Closing Date with the severance benefits set forth in _Section 6.6(a)_ of
the Parent Disclosure Schedule in each case, determined (A) without taking
into account any reduction after the  Closing in compensation paid to such
Continuing Employee and (B) taking into account each Continuing Employee's
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities)
and, after the Closing, Purchaser and its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) With respect  to any employee benefit plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries
in which any Continuing Employees become eligible to participate on or after
the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to: (i) waive all  pre-existing conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to such employees and their eligible dependents under any New
Plans, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions,  exclusions or
waiting periods would apply under the analogous the Company Benefit Plan, (ii)
provide each such employee and their eligible dependents with credit for any
eligible expenses incurred by such employee or dependent prior to the 
Effective Time under a Company Benefit Plan (to the same extent that such
credit was given under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the
Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible, co-payment or out-of-
pocket requirements under  any New Plans that provide health care benefits,
and (iii) recognize all service of such employees with the Company and its
Subsidiaries for all purposes in any New Plan to the same extent that such
service was taken into account under the  analogous Company Benefit Plan
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the foregoing service recognition
shall not apply (A) to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits
for the same period of services, (B) for purposes of  any defined benefit
pension plan, or (C) for purposes of any benefit plan that is a frozen plan or
provides grandfathered benefits.

 

(c) Parent shall,  or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to, assume and
honor all Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms. Parent hereby
acknowledges that a "change in control" (or similar phrase) within the meaning
of the Company Benefit Plans will  occur at the Effective Time.

 

(d) If requested  by Parent in writing at least twenty (20) business days
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause any 401(k) plan sponsored
or maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Company 401(k)
Plan_ ") to be terminated  effective as of the day immediately prior to the
Effective Time and contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing. In the event
that Parent requests that any Company 401(k)

 


 

 

 

\- 52 -  

Plan be terminated, the Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate,
effective as of the Effective Time, in a 401(k) plan sponsored or maintained
by Parent or one of its  Subsidiaries (a " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ "). The
Company and Parent shall take any and all actions as may be required to permit
the Continuing Employees who are then actively employed to make rollover
contributions to the Parent 401(k) Plan of  "eligible rollover distributions"
(with the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) in the form of cash,
notes (in the case of loans) or a combination thereof. The Company shall
provide Parent with evidence that the Company 401(k) Plan has been 
terminated or amended, as applicable, in accordance with this _Section 6.6(d)_
; _provided_ , that prior to amending or terminating the Company 401(k) Plan,
the Company shall provide the form and substance of any applicable resolutions
or  amendments to Parent for review and approval (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(e) On and after  the date hereof, any broad-based employee notices or
communication materials (including any website posting) with respect to
employment, compensation or benefits matters addressed in this Agreement or
related, directly or indirectly, to the  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be subject to the prior prompt review and comment of the other
party, and the party seeking to distribute any such notice or communication
shall consider in good faith revising such notice or  communication to
reflect any comments or advice that the other party timely provides.

 

(f) Nothing in  this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, director or
consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates any right
to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Company, or any Subsidiary
or affiliate thereof, or shall  interfere with or restrict in any way the
rights of the Company, Parent or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to
discharge or terminate the services of any employee, director or consultant of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates at  any time for any
reason whatsoever, with or without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit Plan, New Plan
or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, 
or (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any particular Company Benefit Plan,
New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or
arrangement after the  Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of
_Section 9.11_, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to
or shall confer upon any person, including, without limitation, any current or
former employee, director or  consultant of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

6.7 _Indemnification; Directors '  and Officers' Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after  the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each present and
former director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries (in each case,
when acting in such capacity)  (collectively, the " _Company Indemnified
Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection
with any threatened or actual claim, action,  suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in
part out of, or pertaining to, the fact that such person is or was a director
or  officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at
the

 


 

 

 

\- 53 -  

request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of
another person and pertaining to matters, acts or omissions existing or
occurring at or prior to the  Effective Time, including matters, acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and Parent shall also advance
expenses as incurred by such Company Indemnified  Party to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law; _provided_ that the Company Indemnified Party to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if
it is ultimately determined that such Company Indemnified  Party is not
entitled to indemnification. Parent shall reasonably cooperate with the
Company Indemnified Party, and the Company Indemnified Party shall reasonably
cooperate with Parent, in the defense of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or  investigation.

 

(b) For a period  of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall
maintain in effect the current policies of directors' and officers' liability
insurance maintained by the Company ( _provided_ that Parent may substitute
therefor policies with a  substantially comparable insurer of at least the
same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims against the present and
former officers and directors of the Company or  any of its Subsidiaries
arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time
(including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); _provided_ that
Parent shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an  amount in
excess of 300% of the current annual premium paid as of the date hereof by the
Company for such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if such premiums for
such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then Parent shall 
cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in Parent's good faith
determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium
equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, Parent may (and with the
prior consent of  Parent, the Company may use its reasonable best efforts to)
obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six-year "tail" policy under the
Company's existing directors and officers insurance policy providing
equivalent coverage to that described in  the preceding sentence if and to
the extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate,
does not exceed the Premium Cap. If Parent or the Company purchases such a
"tail policy," Parent shall maintain such "tail policy" in  full force and
effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder.

 

(c) The  obligations of Parent and the Company under this _Section 6.7_ shall
not be terminated or modified after the Effective Time in a manner so as to
adversely affect any Company Indemnified Party or any other person entitled to
the benefit of  this _Section 6.7_ without the prior written consent of the
affected Company Indemnified Party or affected person.

 

(d) The provisions  of this _Section 6.7_ shall survive the Effective Time
and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If Parent
or any of its successors or  assigns will consolidate with or merge into any
other entity and not be the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger, transfer all or substantially all of its assets or
deposits to any other entity or engage in any similar  transaction, then in
each case to the extent the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.7_ are
not otherwise transferred and assumed by such successors and assigns by
operation of law or otherwise, Parent will cause proper provision to be  made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent will expressly assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.7_.

 


 

 

 

\- 54 -  

6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In  case at any time after the Effective Time
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of Parent, on the one
hand, and a Subsidiary of the Company, on the other)  or to vest Parent or
the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights,
approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the
proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their 
respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be
reasonably requested by Parent.

 

6.9 _Dividends_. After the date  of this Agreement, each of Parent and the
Company shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends in
respect of Parent Common Stock and Company Common Stock and the record dates
and payment dates relating thereto, it being the  intention of the parties
hereto that holders of Company Common Stock shall not receive two dividends,
or fail to receive one dividend, in any quarter with respect to their shares
of Company Common Stock and any shares of Parent Common Stock any  such
holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.

 

6.10 _Advice of Changes_.   Parent and the Company (in such capacity, the "
_Notifying Party_ ") shall each promptly advise the other party of any change
or event (i) that has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Notifying Party or  (ii) which the Notifying Party believes
would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach
of any of the Notifying Party's representations, warranties or covenants
contained herein that reasonably could be expected to give  rise, either
individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition set forth in,
if Parent is the Notifying Party, _Section 7.1_ or _7.3_ , or if the Company
is the Notifying Party, _Section 7.1_ or _7.2_ ; _provided_   that any
failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any
breach shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this _Section 6.10_ or
the failure of any condition set forth in _Section 7.2_ or _7.3_   to be
satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party
failing to give such notice, in each case unless the underlying breach would
independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2_
or _7.3_   to be satisfied.

 

6.11 _Corporate Governance_.

 

(a) On or prior to  the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Parent
shall cause the number of directors that will comprise the full board of
directors of Parent at the Effective Time to be increased by three and to
appoint three then current directors of the  Company to be selected by Parent
in consultation with the Company to fill the vacancies resulting from such
increase (the " _Company Designees_ "). On or prior to the Effective Time, the
Board of Directors of Parent shall also cause at least one  Company Designee
to be appointed to each of the Audit, Compensation and Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committees of the Board of Directors of Parent.

 

(b) On or prior to  the Effective Time, Parent (as the sole shareholder of
Parent Bank) shall cause the number of directors that will comprise the full
Board of Directors of Parent Bank at the Effective Time to be increased by
three, constituted in the same manner and  with the same individuals as the
Board of Directors of Parent.

 


 

 

 

\- 55 -  

(c) As soon as  reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
establish the centralized operations center and mortgage headquarters of the
combined company at the Company's current headquarters in Franklin, Tennessee.

 

6.12 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) The Company  agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their officers, directors,
agents, advisors and representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not
to, directly or indirectly,  (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or
knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any person
concerning any Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) provide  any confidential or
nonpublic information or data to, or have or participate in any discussions
with, any person relating to any Acquisition Proposal, except to notify a
person that has made or, to the knowledge of the Company, is making any 
inquiries with respect to, or is considering making, an Acquisition Proposal,
of the existence of the provisions of this _Section 6.12(a)_; _provided_ that,
prior to the approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company
by  the Requisite Company Vote, in the event the Company receives an
Acquisition Proposal that was not the result of a willful or material breach
of this _Section 6.12_ , it may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and
its Subsidiaries'  Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished
nonpublic information or data and participate in such negotiations or
discussions if its Board of Directors concludes in good faith (after receiving
the advice of its outside counsel, and with  respect to financial matters,
its financial advisor) that failure to take such actions would be more likely
than not to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable
law; _provided_ , _further_ , that, prior to providing  any nonpublic
information permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso, the
Company shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third
party on terms no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality Agreement (an
" _Acceptable  Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which confidentiality agreement
shall not provide such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with the
Company. The Company will, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its Representatives to,  immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this
Agreement with any person other than Parent with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal. The Company will promptly (within  twenty-four (24) hours) advise
Parent following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which
could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal (including the
material terms and conditions of, and the identity of the person  making,
such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Parent reasonably
apprised of any related developments, discussions and negotiations, including
any amendments to or revisions of the material terms of such inquiry or
Acquisition  Proposal. The Company shall (A) withdraw and terminate access
that was granted to any person (other than the parties to this Agreement and
their respective affiliates and Representatives) to any "data room" (virtual
or physical) that was  established in connection with a transaction involving
the Company and (B) use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any existing
confidentiality or standstill agreements to which it or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with the  terms thereof.

 

(b) The Company  shall not, and none of the Board of Directors of the Company
or any committee thereof shall cause or permit the Company to, enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger  agreement

 


 

 

 

\- 56 -  

or other agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement)
relating to any Acquisition Proposal made to the Company.

 

(c) As used in  this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean, other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any offer, proposal or
inquiry relating to, or any third party indication of interest in, (i) any
acquisition or purchase, direct  or indirect, of 20% or more of the
consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or 20% or more of any
class of equity or voting securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries whose
assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 20%  or more of the
consolidated assets of the Company, (ii) any tender offer (including a self-
tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such
third party beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity or voting 
securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in
the aggregate, constitute 20% or more of the consolidated assets of the
Company, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, reorganization,  recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
other similar transaction involving the Company or its Subsidiaries whose
assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 20% or more of the
consolidated assets of the Company.

 

(d) Nothing  contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its
Board of Directors from complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 under the
Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal or from making any legally  required disclosure to the Company's
shareholders; _provided_ that such Rules will in no way eliminate or modify
the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have under
this Agreement.

 

6.13 _Public Announcements_.   Neither the Company nor Parent shall, and
neither the Company nor Parent shall permit any of their respective
Subsidiaries to, issue or cause the publication of any press release or other
public announcement with respect to, or otherwise make any  public statement,
or, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, any
disclosure of nonpublic information to a third party, concerning, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior consent (which
shall not be  unreasonably withheld or delayed) of Parent, in the case of a
proposed announcement, statement or disclosure by the Company, or the Company,
in the case of a proposed announcement, statement or disclosure by Parent;
_provided_ that either  Parent or the Company may, without the prior consent
of the other party (but after prior consultation with the other party to the
extent practicable under the circumstances) issue or cause the publication of
any press release or other public  announcement to the extent required by
applicable law or by the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange.

 

6.14 _Change of Method_. Parent  shall be empowered, at any time prior to the
Effective Time, to change the method or structure of effecting the combination
of the Company and Parent (including the provisions of _Article I_), if and to

_provided_ that no such change shall (a) alter or change the Exchange Ratio or
the Per Share Cash Consideration, (b) adversely affect the Tax treatment of
the Company's shareholders or Parent's  shareholders pursuant to this
Agreement, (c) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Company or Parent
pursuant to this Agreement or (d) materially impede or delay the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a timely  manner. The

 


 

 

 

\- 57 -  

parties agree to reflect any such change in an appropriate amendment to this
Agreement executed by both parties in accordance with _Section 9.2_.

 

6.15 _Restructuring Efforts_.   If either the Company or Parent shall have
failed to obtain the Requisite Company Vote or the Requisite Parent Vote at
the duly convened Company Meeting or Parent Meeting, as applicable, or any
adjournment or postponement thereof, each of the  parties shall in good faith
use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement (it being understood that neither
party shall have any obligation to alter or change any material terms, 
including the Merger Consideration, the amount or kind of the consideration to
be issued to holders of the capital stock of the Company as provided for in
this Agreement, in a manner adverse to such party or its shareholders and/or
resubmit this  Agreement and/or the transactions contemplated hereby (or as
restructured pursuant to this _Section 6.15_) to its respective shareholders
for approval).

 

6.16 _Takeover Statutes_. None  of the Company, Parent or their respective
Boards of Directors shall take any action that would cause any Takeover
Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall take  all necessary
steps to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute
now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport
to  be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each party and
the members of their respective Boards of Directors will grant such approvals
and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement may  be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including, if  necessary, challenging the validity or
applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

 

6.17 _Exemption from Liability  under Section 16(b)_. The Company and Parent
agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain those officers
and directors of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act (the " _Company    Insiders_ "), both prior to
and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that Company Insiders not be
subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection with  the conversion
of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Equity Awards in the Merger, and
for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this
_Section 6.17_. The Board of Directors of Parent and of the Company, or  a
committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term is defined for
purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall prior to the
Effective Time take all such steps as may be required to cause (in the case of
the Company) any  dispositions of Company Common Stock or Company Equity
Awards by the Company Insiders, and (in the case of Parent) any acquisitions
of Parent Common Stock by any Company Insiders who, immediately following the
Merger, will be officers or directors  of Parent subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, in each case pursuant to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to be exempt from liability
pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest  extent
permitted by applicable law.

 

6.18 _Litigation and Claims_.   Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly
notify the other party in writing of any action, arbitration, audit, hearing,
investigation, litigation, suit,

 


 

 

 

\- 58 -  

subpoena or summons issued, commenced, brought, conducted or heard by or
before, or otherwise involving, any Governmental Entity or arbitrator pending
or, to the knowledge of Parent or  the Company, as applicable, threatened
against Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries that (a)
questions or would reasonably be expected to question the validity of this
Agreement or the other agreements contemplated hereby or  thereby or any
actions taken or to be taken by Parent, the Company, or their respective
Subsidiaries with respect hereto or thereto, or (b) seeks to enjoin or
otherwise restrain the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The
Company shall  give Parent the opportunity to participate at its own expense
in the defense or settlement of any shareholder litigation against the Company
and/or its directors or affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and no such  settlement shall be agreed without Parent's
prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld).

 

6.19 _Assumption of Company Debt_.     Parent agrees to execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, by or on behalf of Parent or
Parent Bank (as the case may be), at or prior to the Effective Time, one or
more supplemental indentures, guarantees, and other instruments  required for
the due assumption of the Company's obligations in respect of its outstanding
debt, guarantees, securities, and other agreements to the extent required by
the terms of such debt, guarantees, securities, and other agreements.

 

6.20 _Data Conversion_. From  and after the date hereof, the parties shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate the integration of the
Company with the business of Parent following consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and shall meet on a  regular basis to discuss and plan
for the conversion of the data processing and related electronic information
technology system (the " _Data Conversion_ ") to those used by Parent. The
parties agree to use all commercially reasonable efforts to  promptly
commence preparations for implementation of the Data Conversion, with the goal
of effecting the Data Conversion after the Effective Time and at such later
time as mutually agreed upon by the parties. The parties agree to cooperate
in  preparing for the Data Conversion, including by providing reasonable
access to data, information systems, and personnel having expertise with their
and their respective Subsidiaries' information and data systems; _provided_ ,
_however_ ,  that neither party shall be required to terminate any third-
party service provider arrangements prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall
promptly reimburse the Company on request for reasonable out-of-pocket fees,
expenses or charges that the  Company may incur as a result of taking, at the
request of Parent, any action prior to the Effective Time to facilitate the
Data Conversion.

ARTICLE VIII 
  
  TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

 

8.1 _Termination_. This  Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after approval of the Parent Stock Issuance
or this Agreement by the shareholders of Parent or the shareholders of the
Company (as applicable):

 

(a) by mutual  consent of Parent and the Company in a written instrument, if
the Board of Directors of each so determines by a vote of a majority of the
members of its entire Board;

 

(b) by either  Parent or the Company if any Governmental Entity that must
grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger or the
Bank Merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable or any
Governmental Entity of competent  jurisdiction shall have issued a final
nonappealable law or order permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or
making illegal the consummation of the Merger or the Bank Merger, unless the
failure to obtain a Requisite Regulatory Approval shall  be due to the
failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe
the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;

 

(c) by either  Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before January 21, 2021 (the " _Termination Date_ "), unless
the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure
of the party seeking to terminate  this Agreement to perform or observe the
covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;

 

(d) by either  Parent or the Company (i) if the Requisite Company Vote shall
not have been obtained at the Company Meeting duly convened therefor or at any
adjournment or postponement thereof, or (ii) if the Requisite Parent Vote
shall not have been obtained at  the Parent Meeting duly convened therefor or
at any adjournment or postponement thereof; _provided_ , that no party may
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(d)_ if such party has
breached in any material respect any of  its obligations under this
Agreement, in each case in a manner that caused the failure to obtain the
Requisite Company Vote at the Company Meeting, or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof, or the Requisite Parent Vote at the Parent Meeting,  or
at any adjournment or postponement thereof, as applicable;

 


 

 

 

\- 62 -  

(e) by either  Parent or the Company ( _provided_ that the terminating party
is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of
the covenants or agreements  or any of the representations or warranties (or
any such representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in this
Agreement on the part of the Company, in the case of a termination by Parent,
or Parent, in the case of a termination by  the Company, which breach or
failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate with all other
breaches by such party (or failures of such representations or warranties to
be true), would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the  Closing Date,
the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.2_, in the case of a

shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that:

    |  

_Sections 6.2(b)_ and this _Section 8.2_ and _Article IX_ shall survive any
termination of this Agreement, and

\- 63 -  

 

        

(ii)

    |  

notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither
Parent nor the Company shall be relieved or released from any liabilities  or
damages arising out of its willful and material breach of any provision of
this Agreement occurring prior to termination (which, in the case of the
Company, shall include the loss to the holders of Company Common Stock and
Company Equity  Awards of the economic benefits of the Merger, including the
loss of the premium offered to the holders of Company Common Stock and Company
Equity Awards, it being understood that the Company shall be entitled to
pursue damages for such  losses and to enforce the right to recover such
losses on behalf of its shareholders and the holders of Company Equity Awards
in its sole and absolute discretion, and any amounts received by the Company
in connection therewith may be  retained by the Company).

    
---|--- 
    

 

(b) 
 

 

        

(i)

    |  

In the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
termination of this Agreement, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have
been  made known to senior management or the board of directors of the
Company or has been made directly to its shareholders generally or any person
shall have publicly announced (and, in each case, not unconditionally
withdrawn) an Acquisition  Proposal with respect to the Company and (A)
thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_ without the Requisite Company Vote having been
obtained (and all other conditions set  forth in _Sections 7.1_ and _7.3_ had
been satisfied or were capable of being satisfied at a time prior to such
termination), (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or
the Company pursuant to _Section  8.1(d)(i)_ , or (C) thereafter this
Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ as a result of
a willful breach, and (D) prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after
the date of such termination, the  Company enters into a definitive agreement
or consummates a transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether
or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then the
Company shall, on the earlier of the date it  enters into such definitive
agreement and the date of consummation of such transaction, pay Parent, by
wire transfer of same day funds, a fee equal to $21,400,000 (the "
_Termination Fee_ "); _provided_ that for purposes of this _Section 8.2(b)_, 
all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to "20%" shall
instead refer to "50%".

    
---|--- 
    

 

        

(ii)

    |  

In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
8.1(f)_, then the Company shall pay Parent, by wire transfer of  same day
funds, the Termination Fee no later than two (2) business days after such
termination.

    
---|--- 
    

 

(c) In the event  that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to _Section 8.1(g)_, then Parent shall pay the Company, by wire transfer of
same day funds, the Termination Fee no later than two (2) business days after
such termination.

 


 

 

 

\- 64 -  

(d) Notwithstanding    anything to the contrary herein, but without
limiting the right of any party to recover liabilities or damages arising out
of the other party's fraud or willful and material breach of any provision of
this Agreement, in the event that this  Agreement is terminated as provided
in _Section 8.1_ under circumstances where the Termination Fee is payable and
paid in full, the maximum aggregate amount of monetary fees, liabilities or
damages payable by a single party under this  Agreement shall be equal to the
Termination Fee (together with any amounts specified in _Section 8.2(e)_ ), as
applicable, and no party shall be required to pay the Termination Fee on more
than one occasion.

 

(e) Each of Parent  and the Company acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this _Section 8.2_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other
party would not enter into this Agreement;  accordingly, if Parent or the
Company fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.2_,
and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit which
results in a judgment against the non-paying party for the  Termination Fee,
such non-paying party shall pay the costs and expenses of the other party
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit. In addition, if Parent or the Company, as the case may be, fails to
pay  the amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 8.2_, then such party
shall pay interest on such overdue amounts (for the period commencing as of
the date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and
ending on the date that  such overdue amount is actually paid in full) at a
rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as announced by JPMorgan Chase and Co.
or any successor thereto) in effect on the date on which such payment was
required to be made for the period  commencing as of the date that such
overdue amount was originally required to be paid. The amounts payable by
Parent and the Company, as applicable, pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_ and _(c)_
, respectively, constitute liquidated damages  and not a penalty, and, except
in the case of fraud or willful and material breach of this Agreement, shall
be (together with the amounts specified in this _Section 8.2(e)_ ) the sole
monetary remedy of the Company and Parent, as applicable,  in the event of a
termination of this Agreement specified in such section under circumstances
where the Termination Fee is payable and is paid in full.

warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge

may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this

any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any action for specific
performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement
under any law to  post security or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief.

 


 

 

 

\- 69 -  

9.13 _Severability_. Whenever  possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid,  illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement  shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction
such that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion thereof
shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

 

9.14 _Delivery by Facsimile or  Electronic Transmission_. This Agreement and
any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this
Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent
signed and delivered by means of a facsimile  machine or by email delivery of
a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an
original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version  thereof
delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument
shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or email delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment
hereto or the  fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or email
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation of a
contract and each party hereto forever  waives any such defense.
