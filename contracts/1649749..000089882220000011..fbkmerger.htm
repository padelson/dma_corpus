        of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange as reported by The Wall Street Journal for the five (5) full trading days ending on the trading day preceding the Closing Date (&#8220;<u>Parent Common Stock Closing Price</u>&#8221;) by (ii)&#160;the fraction
        of a share (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to <u>Section&#160;1.5</u>. The parties acknowledge that payment of such cash
        consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares is not separately bargained-for-consideration, but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for the purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience that would otherwise be caused by the
        issuance of such fractional shares.</font></div>
