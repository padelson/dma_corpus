proposal made or submitted to any Relevant Authority in connection with any
such proceeding. 
---|---|--- 
 



   2.6 | In the event that any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding (including Agency Litigation) is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) by a Relevant Authority or private party challenging the
Transaction, RDL and the Purchaser will cooperate in all material respects
with each other and use their respective reasonable best efforts to contest
and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed
or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the Transaction or delays Completion
past the Long Stop Date (collectively, an "Injunction"); provided, however,

will be entitled to direct the defence of any legal, administrative or
judicial action or proceeding in respect of the Transaction, or negotiations
with any Relevant Authority or other person relating thereto, (ii) RDL will
not make any offer, acceptance or counter-offer to or otherwise engage in

reasonable efforts to provide full and effective support of the Purchasers and
its counsel in all such negotiations and discussions with representatives of
any Relevant Authority or other person to the extent requested by counsel to
the Company. RDL and the Purchasers may, as each deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided
to the other pursuant to _clause 2_ as "Outside Counsel Only Material" and may
redact from any information provided to each other and their counsel any
references to its valuation of the Target Group or each other. 
---|--- 



   2.7 | RDL and the Purchasers will: 
---|--- 
 



17 promptly (and in any event no later than the Long Stop Date) any clearance
required under the HSR Act for the consummation of the Transaction; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (B) | use their respective reasonable best efforts to avoid or
eliminate any impediment under any applicable law, rule or regulation that may
be asserted by any Relevant Authority, or any other person, with respect to
the Transaction so as to enable Completion to occur expeditiously (and in any
event no later than the Long Stop Date); 
---|---|--- 



     | (C) | use their respective reasonable best efforts to defend
through Agency Litigation (or, if applicable, other litigation) on the merits
any claim asserted in any court, administrative tribunal or hearing that
the Transaction would violate under any applicable law, rule or regulation of
any Relevant Authority in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or
terminated, any Injunction; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (D) | cause their respective inside and outside counsel to
cooperate in good faith with the others counsel and other representatives and
use their respective reasonable best efforts to facilitate and expedite

practicable dates (and in any event no later than the Long Stop Date). 
---|---|---

their respective affiliates (which in the case of (i) the Purchasers, shall
mean each member of the Purchasers Group and (ii) RDL, shall mean each
member of the Target Group) do not agree to, or take any other action which
leads to, any voluntary extension or delay of the waiting periods under the
HSR Act or the withdrawal of its "Notification and Report Form" pursuant to
the HSR Act unless both RDL and ACI US have given their prior written consent
to such extension, delay or withdrawal, except that, upon notice to RDL, the
Purchasers may withdraw its HSR Filing in the event that counsel to the
Purchasers recommends that such action be taken to avoid a Second Request or
the initiation of Agency Litigation, in which event the Purchasers will refile
their HSR Filing within two Business Days of its withdrawal; provided,
however, that the Purchasers may not voluntarily withdraw and refile its HSR
Filing more than two times without the prior consent of RDL. 
---|--- 



   2.9 | Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, including any statement in this _clause 2_ (Sale and purchase), the

Authority for any reason. For the avoidance of doubt, the covenants in this
_clause 2_ (Sale and purchase) will constitute the parties sole obligations
with respect to efforts to obtain approvals of Relevant Authorities.

may terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other party.

absolute discretion) and are legally entitled to do so, waive any of RDLs
obligations set forth in _Part A_ of _Schedule 1_ (Completion arrangements)

---|---|--- 



     | (B) | an amount equal to the Intra-Group Loan Amount discharged by

---|---|--- 
 

payable in accordance with _clause 4_ (Completion), in the manner described in

---|---|--- 
 



   3.3 | In addition, in accordance with _clause 4_ (Completion), the

Amount"). For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby clarified that
upon discharge of the Intra-Group Loan Amount at Completion, no member of the
Target Group shall have any Relevant Indebtedness. RDL hereby undertakes to
pay to the Purchasers (or, if so directed by the Purchasers, to a member of
the Target Group) in immediately available funds, within 15 Business Days of
receipt of a written notice from the Purchasers setting out in reasonable
detail the nature of any such Relevant Indebtedness (referred to in the
previous sentence) of any member of the Target Group in excess of the Intra
Group Loan Amount, an amount equal to the amount of that Relevant
Indebtedness. 
---|--- 



   3.4 | Except for a payment made pursuant to _sub-clause 3.3_ , any
payment made by any of the parties pursuant to this Agreement shall (so far as
possible) be treated as an adjustment to the Consideration for the
Target Shares to the extent of the payment. Any such adjustment to the
Consideration shall (so far as possible) be allocated and apportioned to the
Target Shares to which the matter giving rise to the adjustment relates and,
to the extent that the adjustment cannot properly be so allocated or
apportioned, pro rata to the allocation and apportionment of the Consideration
in _sub-clause 3.2_. Any payment made pursuant to _sub-clause 3.3_ shall be
treated as a payment to RDL from RD Inc. 
---|--- 



   3.5 | Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary: 
---|--- 



     | (A) | RD Inc. shall be entitled to repay some or all of the Intra-
Group Loan (including accrued interest) by making a payment in cash to RDL in
the Interim Period, and to the extent of such repayment the Intra-Group
Loan Amount shall be reduced accordingly; 
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | RD Europe shall be entitled to pay a cash distribution to
RDL of an amount equal to £1,918,000 (one million, nine hundred and eighteen
thousand pounds) less the amount paid pursuant to _sub-clause 3.5(A)_ ;  
---|---|--- 



     | (C) | any member of the Target Group can transfer funds (by way of
distribution or otherwise) to RD Inc. and RD Europe to facilitate the payments
referred to in this _sub-clause 3.5_ ; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (D) | the total amount that may be paid by RD Inc. and RD Europe
pursuant to _sub-clause 3.5(A)_ and _(B)_ shall not exceed £1,918,000 (one
million, nine hundred and eighteen thousand pounds).  
---|---|---

agreed between RDL and ACI US. 
---|--- 



   4.2 | At Completion, RDL shall do, and shall procure that Cardcast
does, those things listed in _Part A_ of _Schedule 1_ (Completion
arrangements) and the Purchasers shall do those things listed in _Part B_ of

out in _Document 1_ and/or which arises as a result of amendments made to the

     | (A) | all Warranties which are given by reference to RDLs
knowledge, awareness or belief will be repeated by RDL at Completion by
reference to RDLs knowledge, awareness or belief as at the Completion
Date. However, if RDL knows, becomes aware of or believes any fact, matter or
circumstance after the date of this Agreement which would cause any such
Warranty to be untrue when repeated at Completion, they may disclose such
fact, matter or circumstance in the Supplemental Disclosure Letter; 
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | for the purposes of repeating at Completion each of the
Warranties which refers to information disclosed, RDL shall be entitled to

the date of this Agreement and the Disclosure Letter and
Supplemental Disclosure Letter in respect of Warranties given at Completion.
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _sub-paragraph 7.9(D)_ is intended
to limit the provisions of _sub-clause 7.10_. 
---|---|--- 
 



   7.10 | For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in the
Supplemental Disclosure Letter shall operate to reduce or limit the liability
of RDL for breach of any of the Warranties given at the date of this Agreement
or to reduce or limit the operation of _sub-clause 2.3(C)_. 
---|--- 



   7.11 | It is acknowledged that RDL is giving the Warranties under _sub-
clause 7.1_ of this Agreement and RDL acknowledges that it will not be
entitled to claim that it has not given or is not liable under the

provided that RDLs maximum liability under this _sub-clause 7.13(i)_ shall
be capped at an amount equal to the Tax payable by RD Europe on its taxable
income for such year, and (ii) without the prior written consent of ACI UK, no
member of the Retained Group shall file an amendment to any Tax Return that
has been filed that adversely affects the losses, relief, allowance, credit,
deduction, exemption or set-off in respect of any Tax utilised by RD Europe in
making any Tax Return for the years ending 31 December 2011, 31 December 2012
and 31 December 2013. The Purchasers Group shall reasonably co-operate with
RDL and reasonably assist RDL in its compliance with _sub-clause 7.13_
(including, without limitation, accepting a valid surrender of losses, relief,
allowance, credit, deduction, exemption or set-offs as contemplated by
_paragraph (i)_ of this _sub-clause 7.13_ and informing RDL of the amount of
Tax payable by RD Europe on its taxable income for that year _)_ provided,

7.13_.
