seek damages from Buyer on account of such non-payment.

 

(b)If the Closing occurs, the Deposit and the Exclusivity Payment shall be

(d)General. The Additional Consideration shall be a part of the purchase
price for, and shall constitute consideration for, the Company Units and the

of any federal or state securities laws. If there is no WTI Price available

Third Contingent Period, the WTI Price for that week day shall be the WTI
Price for the first week day immediately preceding such week day for which the
WTI Price is available.

(xvii)rights of tenants-in-common in and to any Asset;

 

(xviii)Imbalances, whether resulting from overproduction or underproduction,
and plugging and surface restoration obligations, to the extent such
Imbalances are set forth in Section 7.25 of the Disclosure Schedule;

 

(xix)defects based solely on a lack of information in Sellers' or the
Company's files or references to a document that is not in such files;

 

(xx)any maintenance of uniform interest provision in an operating agreement if
waived by the party or parties having the right to enforce such provision or
if the violation of such provision would not give rise to the unwinding of the
sale of the affected Asset hereunder;

 

(xxi)all Title Defects expressly waived by Buyer in writing or that have been
deemed to have been waived or not otherwise to be Title Defects under Section
4.04(a) or any other provision of this Agreement; and

 

(xxii)Title Defects that have been cured or remedied by possession under
applicable statutes of limitation for adverse possession or for prescription.

 

Section 4.03 Title Defect. The term "Title Defect," as used in this
Agreement, means any encumbrance, encroachment, irregularity, defect in or
objection to the Company's or RNR's ownership of any Asset (excluding
Permitted Encumbrances) that causes the Company or RNR not to have Defensible
Title to that Asset. In evaluating whether a matter constitutes a Title
Defect, due consideration shall be given to whether such matter is of the type
expected to be encountered in the area involved as determined by reasonable
and prudent operators and is customarily acceptable to reasonable and prudent
operators in such area. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement
to the contrary, the following matters shall not constitute, and shall not be
asserted as a Title Defect: (a) defects or irregularities arising out of lack
of corporate authorization or a variation in corporate name, unless Buyer
provides affirmative evidence that such corporate action or variation was not
authorized and results in another Person's superior claim of title to the
relevant Asset; (b) defects that have been cured or remedied by possession
under the applicable statutes of limitation and statutes for prescription or
preemption; (c) defects or irregularities in the early chain of title
consisting of the failure to recite marital status in documents or omissions
of heirship proceedings, unless Buyer provides affirmative evidence that such
failure or omission results in another Person's superior claim of title to the
relevant Asset; (d) defects or irregularities resulting from or related to
probate proceedings or the lack of probate proceedings if the defects or
irregularities have been outstanding for five (5) years or more; or (f) to the
extent not exercised as of the Execution Date or the Closing Date,
conventional rights or reassignment normally actuated by an intent to abandon
or release a Lease and requiring notice to the holders of such rights and any
defect or irregularity as would normally be waived by Persons engaged in the
oil and gas business when purchasing producing properties.

 



   

Section 4.04 Notice of Title Defects.

 

(a)If Buyer discovers any Title Defect affecting any Asset, Buyer shall notify
the Sellers of the alleged Title Defect as promptly as possible but no later
than the expiration of the Examination Period. To be effective, this notice
(a "Title Defect Notice") must (i) be in writing; (ii) be received by the
Sellers prior to the expiration of the Examination Period; (iii) describe the
Title Defect in reasonably sufficient detail (including any alleged variance
in the Net Revenue Interest or Working Interest); (iv) identify the specific
Asset or Assets affected by the Title Defect; and (v) include the value of the
Title Defect as determined by Buyer. Any matters that otherwise may have
constituted Title Defects, but that are not so described in a timely Title
Defect Notice complying and delivered in accordance with this Section 4.04(a),
shall be deemed to have been waived by Buyer for all purposes and shall
constitute Permitted Encumbrances.

 

(b)After receipt of an effective Title Defect Notice, the Sellers shall have
the option, but not the obligation, to attempt to cure the Title Defect at any
time prior to the Closing and to postpone the Closing Date (with respect to
all of the Assets or only those Assets affected by the Title Defect) up to
thirty (30) days beyond the date set forth in Section 12.01 to facilitate the
cure; provided however that the foregoing shall not limit the Sellers' ability
to elect remedies for Title Defects as provided in Section 4.05(a).

 

(c)The value attributable to each Title Defect (the "Title Defect Value") that
is asserted by Buyer in a Title Defect Notice shall be determined in good
faith based upon the criteria set forth below:

 

(i)If the Buyer and Sellers agree on the Title Defect Value, that amount shall
be the Title Defect Value.

 

(ii)If the Title Defect is an Encumbrance on any Asset, the Title Defect Value
is the amount necessary to be paid to remove the Encumbrance from the affected
Asset.

 

(iii)If the Title Defect asserted is that the NRI for a Federal Unit described
on Exhibit F is less than the percentage or decimal interest set forth in
Exhibit F as the Company's NRI for such Federal Unit, then the Title Defect
Value will be the product of (A) the relative change from the NRI as shown in
Exhibit F and (B) the Allocated Value for such Federal Unit.

 

(iv)If the Title Defect represents an obligation, Encumbrance, burden or
charge on the affected Asset (including an instance where the NRI for a Well
is less than the NRI for the applicable Federal Unit or an instance of an
increase in a WI for a Well or Wells for which there is not a proportionate
increase in NRI) for which the economic detriment to Buyer is unliquidated,
the amount of the Title Defect Value shall be determined by taking into
account the portion of the Asset affected by the Title Defect, the legal
effect of the Title Defect, the potential discounted economic effect of the
Title Defect over the life of the affected Asset, the probability that a
potential title failure will result in an actual title failure, the Title
Defect Value placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and the Sellers, and any
such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation.

 



   

(v)If a Title Defect is not in effect, affects only certain depths, or does
not adversely affect an Asset throughout the entire productive life of such
Asset, the consequences of that fact shall be taken into account in
determining the Title Defect Value.

 

(vi)The Title Defect Value of a Title Defect shall be determined without
duplication of any costs or losses included in another Title Defect Value.

 

(vii)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall a Title Defect Value exceed the proportional share of the Allocated
Value of the Federal Unit affected by the Title Defect.

 

(viii)To give the Sellers an opportunity to commence reviewing possible Title
Defects, Buyer shall give the Sellers, on or before 5:00 p.m. Mountain Time
each Friday prior to the expiration of the Examination Period, notice of all
Title Defects discovered by Buyer during the preceding week, which notice may
be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the expiration of the
Examination Period.

 

Section 4.05 Remedies for Title Defects.

 

(a)Subject to the continuing right of the Sellers to dispute the existence of
an asserted Title Defect or the asserted Title Defect Value and subject to the
rights of the Parties under Section 13.01(f), if any Title Defect timely
asserted by Buyer in accordance with Section 4.04(a) is not waived in writing
by Buyer or cured on or before Closing, the Sellers shall elect to:

 

(i)reduce the Purchase Price by the Title Defect Value for the Title Defect as
determined in accordance with Section 4.04(c) or Article XVIII (which shall
cause such asserted Title Defect to become an Assumed Obligation under Section
16.02); or

 

(ii)with Buyer's consent, which consent shall be at Buyer's sole discretion,
indemnify Buyer against all claims resulting from the Title Defect (an
"Indemnified Title Defect") pursuant to an indemnity agreement (the "Title
Indemnity Agreement") in the form attached to this Agreement as Exhibit D;
provided, however, that without Buyer's consent, the Sellers shall not be
entitled to elect to indemnify Buyer under this Section 4.05(a)(ii) for any
Title Defect that is a discrepancy in the Net Revenue Interest or Working
Interest of a well, unit, well location or Lease (as compared to the Net
Revenue Interest or Working Interest set forth in Exhibit F with respect to
such Asset).

 

(b)If at or before the Closing Buyer and the Sellers have not agreed on the
validity of any asserted Title Defect or the Title Defect Value attributable
to the Title Defect or on the remedy to be applied under Section 4.05(a),
Buyer or the Sellers shall have the right to elect to have the Dispute
regarding the validity of the Title Defect or the Title Defect Value
determined by an Independent Expert in accordance with Article XVIII. In that
event, the Purchase Price paid at Closing shall not be reduced by virtue of
the disputed Title Defect or Title Defect Value, but upon the final resolution
of the Dispute, the Title Defect Value, if any, found to be attributable to
the Title Defect shall be refunded by the Sellers to Buyer within five (5)
Business Days of the resolution of the Dispute.

 



   

(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (i) if the value
of a particular individual Title Defect (or individual Title Benefit) does not
exceed $50,000 (net to Sellers' interest), then it shall be deemed to be a
Permitted Encumbrance and no adjustment to the Purchase Price shall be made
for the Title Defect (or Title Benefit), (ii) if the aggregate adjustment to
the Purchase Price determined in accordance with this Agreement for Title
Defects (or Title Benefits) for which an adjustment is to be made pursuant to
clause (i) does not exceed two percent (2%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price
prior to any other adjustments, then they shall be deemed to be Permitted
Encumbrances and no adjustment of the Purchase Price shall be made on account
of Title Defects (or Title Benefits), and (iii) if the aggregate adjustment to
the Purchase Price determined in accordance with this Agreement for Title
Defects (or Title Benefits) for which an adjustment is to be made pursuant to
clause (i) does exceed two percent (2%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price prior
to any other adjustments, then the Purchase Price shall be adjusted only by
the amount of the excess; provided, however, with respect to any Title Defect
(or Title Benefit) that exceeds $50,000 in value (net to Sellers' interest),
the entire Title Defect Value (or Title Benefit) (in each case, counting from
the first dollar) shall be included for purposes of the calculations made in
Section 4.05(c)(ii) and (iii).

 

Section 4.06 Third Party Consents. Sellers shall use reasonable efforts to
obtain all necessary consents from Third Parties, including consents to assign
the Purchased Assets prior to the Closing (other than approvals of any
relevant Governmental Authority that are customarily obtained after the
Closing), and Buyer shall assist Sellers with those efforts. If the holder of
any consent requires that the Buyer deliver proof of its creditworthiness for
the approval of such consent, then the Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with
Sellers and the holder of such consent and deliver to such holder any
reasonably-requested credit or other information concerning the business,
operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or
creditworthiness of Buyer.

 

Section 4.07 Title Benefits; Remedies. 

 

(a)If either Party discovers any Title Benefit during the Examination Period
affecting the Assets, it shall promptly notify the other Party at or before
the expiration of the Examination Period. Subject to Section 4.05(c), the
Company Sellers shall be entitled to an upward adjustment to the Purchase
Price pursuant to Section 12.02(a)(iv) with respect to the Title Benefit. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Title Benefit" means the Company's
interest in any Asset that is greater than or in addition to that set forth in
Exhibit B, including a Net Revenue Interest that is greater than that set
forth in Exhibit B or the Company's Working Interest in any Asset that is less
than the Working Interest set forth in Exhibit B (without a corresponding
decrease in the Net Revenue Interest).

 

(b)If, with respect to a Title Benefit, Buyer and the Company Sellers have not
agreed on the validity of any asserted Title Benefit or the value of same at
or prior to the Closing, the Company Sellers or Buyer shall have the right to
elect to have the Dispute regarding the validity of the Title Benefit or the
value of same determined by an Independent Expert in accordance with Article
XVIII. In that event, Buyer shall pay the undisputed portion of the Purchase
Price with respect to the Asset affected by the Title Benefit at the Closing
and upon resolution of the Dispute, the value of the Title Benefit, if any,
Buyer shall pay to the Company Sellers any unpaid portion within five (5)
Business Days of such determination.

 



   

Article V 
Environmental Matters

 

Section 5.01 Environmental Review.

 

(a)Buyer shall have the right to conduct or cause a consultant reasonably
acceptable to the Sellers ("Buyer's Environmental Consultant") to conduct an
environmental review of the Assets prior to the expiration of the Examination
Period ("Buyer's Environmental Review"). The cost, risk and expense of
Buyer's Environmental Review, if any, shall be borne solely by Buyer. The
scope of work comprising Buyer's Environmental Review shall be limited to a
Phase I review and otherwise as may be agreed by Buyer and the Sellers prior
to commencement. The Environmental Review shall not include any intrusive
test, sampling, boring, or similar procedure without the prior written consent
of the Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. Any such Purchase Price reductions shall count toward Buyer's
termination threshold under Section 13.01(f). Buyer shall, and shall cause
Buyer's Environmental Consultant to, (i) consult with the Sellers before
physically entering any Easement or Real Property to conduct any work
comprising Buyer's Environmental Review, (ii) perform all such work in a safe
and workmanlike manner and so as to not unreasonably interfere with the
operation of the Assets and (iii) comply with all applicable Laws. Buyer
shall be solely responsible for obtaining any consents from a Third Party that
are required to perform any work comprising Buyer's Environmental Review, and
the Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Buyer in
obtaining any such consents. The Sellers shall have the right to have a
representative or representatives accompany Buyer and Buyer's Environmental
Consultant at all times during Buyer's Environmental Review. With respect to
any samples taken in connection with Buyer's Environmental Review, the Sellers
shall have the right to request split samples, at the Sellers expense. Buyer
releases, and shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless, Sellers' Indemnitees
from and against all Losses (REGARDLESS OF WHETHER CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO BY
THE SOLE, JOINT, COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY (BUT
NOT GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT) OF SELLERS' INDEMNITEES) arising
out of, related to, or caused by Buyer's Environmental Review.

 

(b)Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, Buyer shall, and shall cause
Buyer's Environmental Consultant to, treat confidentially any matters revealed
by Buyer's Environmental Review and any reports or data generated from such
review (the "Environmental Information"), and Buyer shall not, and shall cause
Buyer's Environmental Consultant to not, disclose any Environmental
Information to any Governmental Authority or other Third Party, other than
Third Parties involved in the transaction, without the prior written consent
of the Sellers. Buyer may use the Environmental Information only in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which use may
include disclosure to Buyer's advisors, prospective lenders or investors, and
prospective insurers. If Buyer, Buyer's Environmental Consultant or any Third
Party to which Buyer has provided any Environmental Information become legally
compelled to disclose any of the Environmental Information, Buyer shall
provide the Sellers with prompt notice sufficiently prior to any such
disclosure so as to allow the Sellers to file any protective order or seek any
other remedy, as the Sellers deem appropriate under the circumstances. If
this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing, Buyer shall deliver the

 



   

Environmental Information to the Sellers, which Environmental Information
shall become the sole property of the Sellers without charge.

 

(c)Upon completion of Buyer's Environmental Review, Buyer shall, at its sole
cost and expense and without any cost or expense to Sellers' Indemnitees (i)
repair all damage done to the Assets in connection with any Buyer's
Environmental Review, (ii) restore the Assets to the same or better condition
in existence prior to commencement of any Buyer's Environmental Review, and
(iii) remove all equipment, tools or other property brought onto the Assets in
connection with any Buyer's Environmental Review. Any disturbance to the
Assets (including the real property associated with such Assets) resulting
from Buyer's Environmental Review will be promptly corrected by Buyer.

 

(d)During all periods that Buyer, or any of Buyer's representatives are
physically on-site the Assets (including for purposes of Buyer's due diligence
review described in Section 4.01), Buyer shall maintain, or cause its
representatives to maintain, at Buyer or its representative's sole expense and
with insurers reasonably satisfactory to the Sellers, policies of insurance of
the types and in the amounts reasonably requested by the Sellers. Upon
request by the Sellers, Buyer shall provide evidence of such insurance to the
Sellers prior to entering upon the Assets.

 

Section 5.02 Environmental Definitions.

 

(a)Assumed Environmental Obligations. For purposes of this Agreement, the
term "Assumed Environmental Obligations" means, all Losses related to the
operation of the Assets or the condition of the Assets and any surface or
subsurface depths used or affected in connection with the Assets, including
any pooled, communitized or unitized acreage by virtue of the Assets being a
part of the pooled, communitized or unitized area (collectively, the "Subject
Property"), and arising from or relating to the following: (i) any violation
or alleged violation of, or non-compliance with applicable Environmental Law
prior to, on, or after the Effective Time, including the cost of correcting
such violations or noncompliance and any fines or penalties arising out of
such violations or noncompliance; (ii) the release, discharge or disposal of
Hazardous Substances prior to, on, or after the Effective Time, at, on, in,
under, from or migrating to or from the Subject Property, including claims for
property damage, loss, injury, damage to natural resources, bodily injury or
wrongful death, and any investigation, remediation or monitoring with respect
to said Hazardous Substances; (iii) any Environmental Defects; (iv) those
matters that would otherwise be Environmental Defects but for the provisions
of Section 5.04(c); and (v) those matters described on Section 5.02(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule.

 

(b)Environmental Defects. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Environmental Defect" means, with respect to any given Asset, an individual
environmental condition identified with specificity in Buyer's Environmental
Review that constitutes a material violation of Environmental Laws in effect
as of the Execution Date in the jurisdiction in which the affected Asset is
located, excluding, however (i) any environmental conditions that do not
exceed the threshold and deductible values in Section 5.04(c), and (ii) any
environmental conditions that are listed on Section 5.02(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule, in each case, which environmental conditions shall be deemed not to
constitute Environmental Defects, but which shall nonetheless be Assumed
Environmental Obligations.

 



   

(c)Environmental Defect Value. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Environmental Defect Value" means, with respect to any Environmental Defect,
the value, as of the Closing Date, of the estimated Losses to resolve and to
correct the Environmental Defect in the most cost-effective manner reasonably
available, taking into account (i) that non-permanent remedies (such as
mechanisms to contain or stabilize Hazardous Substances, including monitoring
site conditions, natural attenuation, risk-based corrective action,
institutional controls or other appropriate restrictions on the use of
property, caps, dikes, encapsulations, leachate collection systems, etc.) may
be the most cost-effective manner reasonably available, (ii) the continuing
long-term need to operate the Asset, (iii) customary industry practices, (iv)
the net present value of such Environmental Condition, and (v) the
requirements of Environmental Laws. An Environmental Defect caused by or
arising from the same event or occurrence or series of related events or
occurrences may affect more than one Asset, in which case the Environmental
Defect Value for each such Asset will be aggregated with the other Assets
affected by such Environmental Defect caused by or arising from the same event
or occurrence or series of related events or occurrences; provided that, for
purposes of this aggregation clause only, the definition of Environmental
Defect in Section 5.02(b) is amended to mean, with respect to any given Asset,
an individual environmental condition materially affecting such Asset.

 

(d)"Environmental Laws" means all Laws pertaining to health (as relates to
exposure to Hazardous Substances), the environment, wildlife, historic or
natural resources, or the use, storage, emission, discharge, clean-up,
release, or threatened release of Hazardous Substances on or into the
environment or otherwise relating to the manufacture, processing,
distribution, use, treatment, storage, disposal, transportation or handling of
Hazardous Materials, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. § 9601 et seq. and the Navajo Nation
analog to such law; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. §
6901 et seq.; the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U.S.C. § 1251 et
seq.; the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7401 et seq.; the Hazardous Materials
Transportation Act, 49 U.S.C. § 1471 et seq.; the Toxic Substances Control
Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 2601 through 2629; the Oil Pollution Act, 33 U.S.C. § 2701
et seq.; the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, 42 U.S.C. §
11001 et seq.; the Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSH Act"), 29 U.S.C.
§§ 651-678 (as the OSH Act relates to exposure to Hazardous Substances); the
Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 300f through 300j-26; the Endangered
Species Act, 16 U.S.C. §§ 1531-1544; the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, 16 U.S.C.
§§ 703-712; the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, 16 U.S.C. §§ 668-668c;
the National Historic Preservation Act, 16 U.S.C. §§ 470-470w-6, all
regulations implementing these Laws; and all similar Laws entered, issued or
made by any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Assets or the
operation thereof, and all amendments to such Laws.

 

(e)Hazardous Substances. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Hazardous
Substances" means (i) any petrochemical or petroleum products, oil or coal
ash, radioactive materials, radon gas, asbestos in any form that is or could
become friable, urea formaldehyde foam insulation and transformers or other
equipment that contain dielectric fluid which may contain levels of
polychlorinated biphenyls, (ii) any chemicals, materials, or substances
defined as or included in the definition of "hazardous substances," "hazardous
wastes," "restricted hazardous materials," "extremely hazardous substances,"
"toxic substances," "contaminants" or "pollutants" or words of similar meaning
and regulatory effect or (iii) any other chemical, material

 



   

or substance, exposure to which is prohibited, limited or regulated by any
applicable Environmental Law.

 

(f)Indemnified Environmental Defects. For purposes of this Agreement, the
term "Indemnified Environmental Defect" means an Environmental Defect as to
which the Sellers have elected to indemnify Buyer in accordance with Section
5.04(a)(ii).

 

Section 5.03 Notice of Environmental Defects. If Buyer discovers any
Environmental Defect affecting any Asset, Buyer shall notify the Sellers of
the alleged Environmental Defect as promptly as possible but no later than the
expiration of the Examination Period. To be effective, such notice (an
"Environmental Defect Notice") must (i) be in writing; (ii) be received by the
Sellers prior to the expiration of the Examination Period; (iii) describe the
Environmental Defect in reasonably sufficient detail, including (A) the
written conclusion of Buyer's Environmental Consultant that an Environmental
Defect exists, which conclusion shall be reasonably substantiated by the
factual data gathered in Buyer's Environmental Review; and (B) a separate
specific citation of the provisions of Environmental Laws alleged to be
violated; (iv) identify the specific Asset or Assets affected by the
Environmental Defect; (v) if Buyer collected environmental samples, include a
site plan showing the location of such sampling events, boring logs and other
field notes describing the sampling methods utilized and the field conditions
observed, chain-of-custody documentation and laboratory reports; (vi) identify
the procedures recommended to correct the Environmental Defect, together with
any related recommendations from Buyer's Environmental Consultant; and (vii)
state Buyer's estimate of the Environmental Defect Value, including the basis
for such estimate, for which Buyer would agree to adjust the Purchase Price to
accept such Environmental Defect if the Sellers elected Section 5.04(a)(i) as
the remedy for it. Any matters that may otherwise have constituted
Environmental Defects, but that are not so described in a timely Environmental
Defect Notice complying with this Section 5.03, together with any
environmental matter that does not constitute an Environmental Defect, shall
be deemed to have been waived by Buyer for all purposes and constitute an
Assumed Obligation. After receipt of an effective Environmental Defect
Notice, the Sellers shall have the option, but not the obligation, to attempt
to cure the Environmental Defect at any time prior to the Closing and to
postpone the Closing Date (with respect to all of the Assets or only those
Assets affected by the Environmental Defect) up to thirty (30) days beyond the
date set forth in Section 12.01 to facilitate the cure.

 

Section 5.04 Remedies for Environmental Defects.

 

(a)Subject to the continuing right of the Sellers to dispute the existence of
an asserted Environmental Defect or the asserted Environmental Defect Value
and subject to the rights of the Parties under Section 13.01(f), if any
Environmental Defect timely asserted by Buyer in accordance with Section 5.03
is not waived in writing by Buyer or cured on or before Closing, the Sellers
shall elect to:

 

(i)subject to Section 5.04(c), reduce the Purchase Price by the Environmental
Defect Value for the Environmental Defect as determined in accordance with
Section 5.02(c) or Article XVI (which shall cause such alleged Environmental
Defect to become an Assumed Obligation under Section 16.02); or

 



   

(ii)with Buyer's consent, in Buyer's sole discretion, indemnify Buyer against
all claims resulting from the Environmental Defect pursuant to an indemnity
agreement (the "Environmental Indemnity Agreement") in the form attached to
this Agreement as Exhibit E.

 

(b)If at or before the Closing Buyer and the Sellers have not agreed on the
validity of any asserted Environmental Defect or the Environmental Defect
Value attributable to the Environmental Defect or on the remedy to be applied
under Section 5.04(a), Buyer or the Sellers shall have the right to elect to
have the Dispute regarding the validity of the Environmental Defect or the
Environmental Defect Value determined by an Independent Expert in accordance
with Article XVIII. In that event, the Purchase Price paid at Closing shall
not be reduced by virtue of the disputed Environmental Defect or Environmental
Defect Value, but on the final resolution of the Dispute, the Environmental
Defect Value, if any, found to be attributable to the Environmental Defect
shall, subject to Section 5.04(c), be refunded by the Sellers to Buyer within
five (5) Business Days of the resolution of the Dispute.

 

(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (i) if the
Environmental Defect Value (net to Sellers' interest) for a particular
individual Environmental Defect does not exceed $50,000, then no adjustment to
the Purchase Price shall be made for the Environmental Defect, (ii) if the
aggregate adjustment to the Purchase Price determined in accordance with this
Agreement for Environmental Defects for which an adjustment is to be made
pursuant to clause (i) does not exceed two percent (2%) of the Unadjusted
Purchase Price prior to any other adjustments, then no adjustment of the
Purchase Price shall be made on account of Environmental Defects, and (iii) if
the aggregate adjustment to the Purchase Price determined in accordance with
this Agreement for Environmental Defects for which an adjustment is to be made
pursuant to clause (i) does exceed two percent (2%) of the Unadjusted Purchase
Price prior to any other adjustments, then the Purchase Price shall be
adjusted only by the amount of the excess; provided, however, with respect to
any Environmental Defect Value that exceeds $50,000, the entire value of such
Environmental Defect (counting from the first dollar) shall be included for
purposes of the calculations made in Section 5.04(c)(ii) and (iii).

 

Section 5.05 No Warranty Regarding Environmental Matters. EXCEPT WITH
RESPECT TO THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN SECTION 7.14, EACH COMPANY
SELLER WILL CONVEY ITS RESPECTIVE COMPANY UNITS AND RNR WILL CONVEY THE
PURCHASED ASSETS TO BUYER WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS OR ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECTS, EXPRESS, STATUTORY OR IMPLIED,
NOT EVEN FOR RETURN OF THE PURCHASE PRICE. BUYER'S SOLE REMEDY FOR
ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECTS OR OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS (OTHER THAN A BREACH OF
THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN SECTION 7.14) IS THE ENVIRONMENTAL
DEFECT PROCEDURE UNDER THIS Article V.

 

Section 5.06 Physical Condition of the Assets. Buyer acknowledges that the
Assets have been used by the Company for Hydrocarbon drilling, enhanced
recovery and production operations and related field operations, and that
physical changes in the Assets (or adjacent lands) may have occurred as a
result of those uses. In this regard, the Assets may also contain unplugged or
improperly plugged wells, wellbores or buried pipelines or other equipment,
whether or not of

 



   

a similar nature, the locations of which may not now be known by Sellers or be
readily apparent by a physical inspection of the property. Buyer understands
that Sellers may not have the requisite information with which to determine
the exact condition of the Assets or the effect that any such use has had on
the physical condition of the Assets, and Sellers do not make any
representation or warranty with respect to those matters and, except pursuant
to the Environmental Defect procedures in Section 5.04, Buyer expressly
assumes all Liabilities for those matters (REGARDLESS OF WHETHER CAUSED OR
CONTRIBUTED TO BY THE SOLE, JOINT, COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OR
STRICT LIABILITY OF SELLERS' INDEMNITEES).

 

Section 5.07 NORM. Buyer acknowledges that some oilfield production
equipment comprising the Assets may contain asbestos or naturally occurring
radioactive material ("NORM"). In this regard, Buyer specifically
acknowledges that NORM may affix or attach itself to the inside of wellbores,
materials and equipment as scale or in other forms, and that wells, materials
and equipment comprising the Assets or located on a Lease may contain NORM and
that NORM containing materials may have been disposed of on a Lease. Buyer
expressly understands that special procedures may be required for the removal
and disposal of asbestos and NORM from the Assets if and where they may be
found, and, except pursuant to the Environmental Defect procedures in Section
5.04, Buyer assumes Sellers' and the Company's liability for or in connection
with the assessment, remediation, removal, transportation or disposal of any
such materials present on the Assets at or after the Effective Time in
accordance with all requirements of any Governmental Authority (REGARDLESS OF
WHETHER CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO BY THE SOLE, JOINT, COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT
NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY OF SELLERS' INDEMNITEES).

 

Article VI 
Representations and Warranties of Sellers

 

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule attached to this Agreement (the
"Disclosure Schedule"), each Seller jointly and severally represents and
warrants to Buyer on the Execution Date and on the Closing Date that:

 

Section 6.01 Existence. Each of Resolute and HACI is a corporation, and RNR
is a limited liability company, duly formed, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and each has full
legal power, right and authority to carry on its business as such is now being
conducted and as contemplated to be conducted. Each of Resolute, HACI and RNR
is duly qualified to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction
where required to do so, except where the failure to be so duly qualified
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 6.02 Legal Power. Each of Resolute, HACI and RNR has the legal

Section 8.02 Legal Power. Each of Buyer and Parent Guarantor has the legal
power and right to enter into and perform this Agreement and the transactions
it contemplates for Buyer and Parent Guarantor, respectively. The consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not violate, or be in
conflict with:

 

(i)any provision of Buyer's or Parent Guarantor's governing documents,
respectively;

 

(ii)any material agreement or instrument to which Buyer or Parent Guarantor is
a party or by which Buyer or Parent Guarantor is bound, respectively; or

 

(iii)any judgment, order, ruling or decree applicable to Buyer or Parent
Guarantor as a party in interest or any Law applicable to Buyer or Parent
Guarantor, respectively.

 

Section 8.03 Execution. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the transactions it contemplates for Buyer and Parent Guarantor
are duly and validly authorized by all requisite corporate or other action on
the part of Buyer and Parent Guarantor. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by Buyer and Parent Guarantor (and all documents this Agreement
requires be executed and delivered by Buyer or Parent Guarantor at Closing
will be duly executed and delivered by Buyer or Parent Guarantor, as
applicable) and this Agreement constitutes, and at the Closing those other
documents will constitute, the legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer or
Parent Guarantor, as applicable, enforceable against Buyer or Parent

 



   

Guarantor, as applicable, in accordance with their terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy or other similar Laws
affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally as well as to general
principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a proceeding in equity or at law).

 

Section 8.04 Brokers. No broker or finder is entitled to any brokerage or
finder's fee, or to any commission, based in any way on agreements,
arrangements or understandings made by or on behalf of Buyer or Parent
Guarantor or any of their Affiliates for which any Seller has or will have any
Liabilities.

 

Section 8.05 Bankruptcy. There are no bankruptcy, reorganization or

Parent Guarantor's knowledge, threatened against Buyer or Parent Guarantor or
any of their Affiliates.

inquiry by any Person or entity or by any administrative agency or
Governmental Authority and no legal, administrative or arbitration proceeding
pending or, to Buyer's or Parent Guarantor's knowledge, threatened against
Buyer or Parent Guarantor or any of their Affiliates that has materially
affected or will materially affect Buyer's or Parent Guarantor's ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 8.07 Qualifications. Buyer is now, and after the Closing shall
continue to be, qualified to own federal, tribal and state oil, gas and
mineral leases in all jurisdictions to the extent applicable where the Assets
are located, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement will not cause Buyer to be disqualified as such an owner or
operator. To the extent required by the applicable Governmental Authorities,
Buyer shall maintain lease bonds, area-wide bonds or any other surety bonds as
may be required by, and in accordance with, such regulations of Governmental
Entities governing the ownership and operation of such leases.

 

Section 8.08 Investment. Buyer is an "accredited investor," as that term is
defined in Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and will
acquire the Assets and the Company Units for its own account and not with a
view to a sale or distribution in violation of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and the rules and regulations under that statute, any applicable
state blue sky Laws or any other applicable securities Laws. Buyer
understands and acknowledges that if any of the Assets and the Company Units
were held to be securities, they would be restricted securities and could not
be transferred without registration under applicable state and federal
securities Laws or the availability of an exemption from such registration.

 

Section 8.09 Funds. Buyer shall arrange to have available by the Closing
Date sufficient funds to enable Buyer to pay in full the Purchase Price as

Agreement.

 

Section 8.10 Independent Investigation. Buyer and Parent Guarantor are
experienced and knowledgeable investors in the oil, gas and mineral resources
industry that have previously expended substantial amounts in the acquisition
and development of oil, gas and mineral properties. Prior to entering into
this Agreement, Buyer and Parent Guarantor were advised by and have relied
solely on their own legal, tax and other professional counsel concerning this

 



   

Agreement, the Assets, the Purchased Assets, the Company Units and their
value. Buyer and Parent Guarantor are knowledgeable of the usual and
customary practices of producers such as Sellers, including reliance on the
advice of experts (e.g., reservoir and facility engineers, attorneys, tax
advisors, accountants, valuation specialists and environmental consultants),
and they have had (or will have prior to the Closing) access to the Assets,
the officers and employees of the Business, and the books, records and files
of Sellers relating the Business, and in making the decision to enter into
this Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
Buyer and Parent Guarantor have relied solely on the basis of their own
independent due diligence investigation of the Business, upon the
representations and warranties in Article VI and Article VII and upon the
covenants of Sellers' in this Agreement, and not on any other representations,
warranties or covenants of Sellers' or any other Person.

 

Article IX 
COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS

 

Section 9.01 Covenants and Agreements of Sellers. Sellers covenant and
agree with Buyer as follows:

 

(a)Status. Sellers shall use their reasonable efforts to assure that as of
the Closing Date they will not be under any material legal, contractual or
other restriction that would prohibit or delay the timely consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(b)Notices of Claims. Sellers shall promptly notify Buyer if, between the
Execution Date and the Closing Date, Sellers or the Company receive written
notice of any claim, suit, action or other proceeding or written notice of any
default under any Material Agreements affecting the Business, and promptly
notify Buyer of any other event that would have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Business or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(c)Compliance with Laws. During the period from the Execution Date through
the Closing Date (inclusive of both dates), Sellers shall cause the Company
and the Assets to be operated in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable Laws.

 

(d)Technical and Operational Cooperation. From the Execution Date and
continuing until Closing, Sellers shall make those senior and field-level
operational and technical employees directly associated with the Aneth Field
reasonably available during business hours to meet at their regular business
location with Buyer and its representatives for the purpose of assisting Buyer
in gathering and developing information to be furnished to Buyer's independent
petroleum engineer. Sellers shall cause their respective operational and
technical employees directly associated with the Aneth Field to provide,
commercially reasonable assistance in gathering and developing the customary
due diligence information, including such information as is customarily
required to prepare a reserve report, reasonably requested by Buyer and its
representatives and independent petroleum engineer. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary, the assistance to be provided by Sellers' employees hereunder
shall only be provided to the extent such assistance does not unreasonably
disrupt such employee's job performance and the operations of Sellers in the
ordinary course of business.

 



   

(e)Master Service Agreements. After the Closing Date and prior to the
Transition Date, if requested by Buyer, RNR shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to assign to Buyer or its Affiliate any master service agreements to
which RNR is a party and which relate solely to the Assets. For the avoidance
of doubt, Buyer acknowledges that this covenant does not apply to any master
service agreements which relate to assets that do not constitute Assets, even
if such master service agreement also relates to Assets.

 

Section 9.02 Covenants and Agreements of Buyers. Buyer covenants and agrees
with Sellers as follows:

 

(a)Status. Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to assure that as of the
Execution Date it will not be under any material legal, contractual or other
restriction that would prohibit or delay the timely consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(b)Change of Name. As soon as reasonably possible after the Closing (i) but in
no event later than thirty (30) days after Closing, Buyer shall change the
name of the Company to remove the names of Sellers and their Affiliates or any
variations on them, including "Resolute", and Buyer shall make the requisite
filings with, and provide the requisite notices to, the appropriate
Governmental Authorities to accomplish the foregoing and (ii) but in no event
later than sixty (60) days after Closing, unless prohibited by Governmental
Authorities or applicable Laws, Buyer shall remove the names of Sellers and
their Affiliates or any variations on them, including "Resolute", from any
signage located in the Aneth Field.

 

(c)Exxon Escrow Refund. If after the Closing Buyer receives the Exxon Escrow
Refund attributable to the Company as contemplated by the First Escrow
Amendment, Buyer shall immediately notify Sellers of the receipt of the Exxon
Escrow Refund and pay the full amount of the Exxon Escrow Refund received by
Buyer to Sellers within five (5) Business Days of receipt of the Exxon Escrow
Refund. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge that the portion
of the Exxon Escrow Refund attributable to NNOGC will be paid directly by
Exxon to NNOGC. If the final executed First Escrow Amendment contains terms
and conditions which render Buyer unable to fulfill its obligation under this
Section 9.02(c) or which are not consistent with the definition of Exxon
Escrow Refund hereunder, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify
this Agreement so as to effect their original intent under this Section
9.02(c) as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated under this Section 9.02(c) are fulfilled to the
extent possible; provided that, any modification to this Agreement will be in
accordance with Section 10.01(b) and Section 10.03(c).

 

Section 9.03 Covenants and Agreements of the Parties.

 

(a)Communication Between the Parties Regarding Breach. Until the Closing:

 

(i)Buyer shall notify Sellers promptly after Buyer obtains knowledge that any
representation or warranty of Sellers or Buyer contained in this Agreement is
untrue in any material respect or will be untrue in any material respect as of
the Closing Date or that any covenant or agreement to be performed or observed
by Sellers or Buyer prior to or on the Closing Date has not been so performed
or observed in any material respect.

 



   

(ii)Sellers shall notify Buyer promptly after Sellers obtain Knowledge that
any representation or warranty of Buyer or Sellers contained in this Agreement
is untrue in any material respect or will be untrue in any material respect as
of the Closing Date or that any covenant or agreement to be performed or
observed by Buyer or Sellers prior to or on the Closing Date has not been so
performed or observed in any material respect;

 

(iii) If any of Buyer's or Sellers' representations or warranties is untrue or
shall become untrue in any material respect between the date of execution of
this Agreement and the Closing Date, or if any of Buyer's or Sellers'
covenants or agreements to be performed or observed prior to or on the Closing
Date shall not have been so performed or observed in any material respect, but
if such breach of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall (if
curable) be cured in its entirety by the Closing (or, if the Closing does not
occur, by the date set forth in Section 12.01), then such breach shall be
considered not to have occurred for all purposes of this Agreement.

 

(b)Release of Managers, Directors and Officers. Buyer, on its own behalf and
on the behalf of the Company (collectively, the "Releasing Parties"),
effective as of Closing, hereby releases, acquits and forever discharges each
present and former manager, director and officer of the Company, and each
present and former manager, director and officer of RNR who performed services
for the Company, who is an individual (collectively, the "Released Parties"),
from any and all claims, causes of action, demands, costs, debts, damages,
obligations and liabilities, whether known or unknown, which the Releasing
Parties have or may come to have against the Released Parties, whether
directly, indirectly or derivatively, in each case relating to the Released
Parties' services to the Company, except for such claims, causes of action,
demands, costs, debits, damages, obligations or liabilities caused by the
fraud or willful misconduct of any Released Party.

 

(c)Cooperation and Good Faith. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, Buyer and Sellers will use their respective
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other Party or Parties
in doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
transactions, including using reasonable efforts to: (i) cause the conditions
set forth in Article XI to be satisfied and (ii) execute or deliver any
additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to fully carry out the purposes of this
Agreement; provided, however, that the foregoing provisions of this Section
9.03(c) will not require any Party to perform, satisfy or discharge any
obligations of any other Party under this Agreement or otherwise.

 

(d)Governmental Consents. Promptly following the execution of this Agreement,
the Parties will proceed to prepare and file with the appropriate Governmental
Authorities such consents and other state, tribal and federal transfer
documents, including any environmental permits, licenses, registrations and
authorizations, that are necessary in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and will diligently and expeditiously
prosecute, and will cooperate fully with each other in the prosecution of,
such matters.

 



   

(e)Other Actions and Consents.

 

(i)Within five (5) Business Days following the Execution Date, the Company
Sellers and RNR shall notify all holders of (i) Preferential Purchase Rights
relating to the Assets or (ii) rights of consent or approval relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Sellers shall promptly (but not
less than five (5) Business Days prior to Closing) notify Buyer if any
Preferential Purchase Rights are exercised, any consents or approvals denied,
or if the requisite period has elapsed without said rights having been
exercised or consents or approvals having been received. Notwithstanding
anything set forth in this Section 9.03(e), if prior to Closing, any such
Preferential Purchase Rights are timely and properly exercised, the interest
or part thereof so affected shall be eliminated from the Assets and the
Purchase Price reduced by the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to such
interest or part thereof.

 

(ii)With respect to any portion of the Assets for which a Preferential
Purchase Right has not been asserted or waived prior to Closing, or a consent
or other approval has not been granted and, in each case, for which the time
for election to exercise such Preferential Purchase Right or to grant such
consent or approval has not expired (and Buyer is unwilling to assume the
Liability associated with the failure to obtain such consent or approval),
Closing with respect to the specific portion of the Assets subject to such
outstanding obligations will be deferred (the "Third Party Interests"). The
Purchase Price delivered to Sellers at Closing will be reduced by the value of
the Third Party Interests as determined in good faith by the Parties (the
"Third Party Interest Value"). In the event that after Closing any such
Preferential Purchase Right is waived or consent or approval is obtained or
the time for election to purchase or to deliver a consent or approval passes
(such that under the applicable documents the Sellers may sell the affected
Third Party Interest to Buyer), then subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, the Closing with respect to the applicable portion of the Third Party
Interests will proceed promptly. If such waivers, consents or approvals as are
necessary are not received by Sellers within one (1) year following Closing,
Sellers shall retain such Third Party Interests, and the Parties shall have no
further Liability or obligation to each other with respect thereto.

 

(iii)If at or before the Closing Buyer and the Sellers have not agreed on the
Third Party Interest Value attributable to the Third Party Interests, Buyer or
the Sellers shall have the right to elect to have the Dispute regarding the
Third Party Interest Value determined by an Independent Expert in accordance
with Article XVIII. In that event, the Purchase Price paid at Closing shall
not be reduced by virtue of the disputed the Third Party Interest Value, but
upon the final resolution of the Dispute, the Third Party Interest Value found
to be attributable to the Third Party Interests shall be refunded by the
Sellers to Buyer within five (5) Business Days of the resolution of the
Dispute.

 

(iv)If any additional Preferential Purchase Rights are discovered after
Closing, or if a Preferential Purchase Rights holder alleges improper notice,
Buyer agrees to cooperate with Sellers in giving effect to any such valid
Preferential Purchase Rights. In the event any such valid Preferential
Purchase Rights are validly exercised after Closing, Buyer's sole remedy
against Sellers shall be the return by Sellers to Buyer of that portion of the
Purchase Price allocated to the portion of the Assets on which such rights are

 



   

exercised and lost by Buyer to such third Person and an unwinding of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with respect to such Assets. This
provision shall survive the expiration provisions otherwise applicable to the
representation and warranty and indemnification provisions of this Agreement.

 

(f)Release of Encumbrances. At the Closing, Sellers shall provide Buyer
evidence reasonably satisfactory to Buyer of the removal and release of all
Encumbrances on the Assets.

 

Section 9.04 Certain Employee Matters.

 

(a)No later than thirty (30) days prior to the Transition Date, Buyer or one
or more of its Affiliates shall offer employment commencing effective as of
the Transition Date, to each Business Employee who remains a Business Employee
immediately prior to the Transition Date. With respect to each Business
Employee who is not an Excluded Employee or a Union Employee, such offer of
employment shall be (i) at a base salary or base hourly wage that is not less
than the base salary or base hourly wage that such Business Employee was
receiving immediately prior to the Transition Date and (ii) on other terms and
conditions (including participation in retirement and welfare plans and
programs) that are at least as substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to
those provided by RNR and its Affiliates to such Business Employee immediately
prior to the Transition Date (the "Employment Offers"). Each Business
Employee who accepts Buyer's offer of employment and becomes employed by Buyer
or one of its Affiliates on the Transition Date is herein referred to as a
"Transferred Employee." Until the first anniversary of the Transition Date,
each Transferred Employee who is not an Excluded Employee or Union Employee
shall, while employed by Buyer and/or its Affiliates, be employed on terms and
conditions not less favorable, in the aggregate, to those set forth in such
Transferred Employee's Employment Offer. Without limiting the immediately
preceding sentence, Buyer shall provide (or cause one or more of its
Affiliates to provide) each Transferred Employee (other than an Excluded
Employee or Union Employee) whose employment is terminated by Buyer or any of
its Affiliates without "cause" during the period commencing on the Transition
Date and ending on the first anniversary of the Transition Date with severance
benefits that are not less favorable than those set forth in Section 9.04(a)
of the Disclosure Schedule. 

 

(b)No later than thirty (30) days prior to the Transition Date, Buyer or one
or more of its Affiliates shall offer employment commencing effective as of
the Transition Date, to each Union Employee who remains a Business Employee
immediately prior to the Transition Date. Such offer of employment shall be at
a base salary or base hourly wage that is not less than the base salary or
base hourly wage that such Union Employee was receiving immediately prior to
the Transition Date and on other terms and conditions in compliance with the
USW CBA and in no event, no less favorable, in the aggregate, to those
provided by RNR and its Affiliates to such Business Employee immediately prior
to the Transition Date except as such terms and conditions are modified or
amended pursuant to any modification or amendment of the USW CBA negotiated
between Buyer and the Union following Closing. Each Union Employee who
accepts Buyer's offer of employment and becomes employed by Buyer or one of
its Affiliates on the Transition Date shall be considered a Transferred
Employee for all purposes of this Agreement with the sole exception of Section
9.04(a).

 



   

(c)Each of the Sellers shall permit, and cause their Affiliates to permit,
Buyer to contact and make arrangements with the Business Employees regarding
employment or prospective employment by Buyer after the Closing and for the
purpose of ensuring the continuity of the Business, and each Seller agrees not
to discourage, and to cause their Affiliates not to discourage, any Business
Employees from consulting with Buyer.

 

(d)The Sellers shall retain responsibility for the payment of any employee
benefits or entitlement, including severance pay, deferred compensation,
equity-based or cash incentive compensation, accrued vacation, sick or holiday
pay to any Transferred Employee or any other Business Employee pursuant to any
Business Employee Benefit Plan as a result of or in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the
foregoing, with respect to any annual cash bonuses that may be payable to the
Transferred Employees under any short-term incentive plan of RNR or any of its
Affiliates in respect of 2017 performance: (i) the Transferred Employees shall
be deemed to have satisfied all applicable employment conditions
notwithstanding their termination of employment with RNR immediately prior to
the Transition Date; and (ii) subject to the allocation of costs in the
Transition Services Agreement and Section 12.02, RNR or one of its Affiliates
shall pay such bonuses in the ordinary course during 2018, subject to any
applicable performance requirements and the other terms and conditions (other
than employment or service conditions) of the short-term incentive plan.

 

(e)The Parties acknowledge that the transactions provided for in this
Agreement may result in obligations on the part of the Sellers or their
Affiliates and one or more of the Business Employee Benefit Plans that is an
employee welfare benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA) to
comply with the health care continuation requirements of COBRA or state law,
as applicable. The Parties expressly agree that Buyer and Buyer's Employee
Benefit Plans shall have no responsibility for the compliance with such health
care continuation requirements (i) for qualified beneficiaries who previously
elected to receive continuation coverage under the Business Employee Benefit
Plans or who between the date of this Agreement and the Transition Date elect
to receive continuation coverage, or (ii) with respect to those employees and
former employees of the Sellers and their Affiliates who may become eligible
to receive such continuation coverage on or prior to the Transition Date or in
connection with the transactions provided for in this Agreement.

 

(f)For the applicable plan year that includes the Transition Date, the
Transferred Employees shall not be required to satisfy any deductible or out-
of-pocket maximum requirements under the benefit plans, programs and policies
maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates (the "Buyer Plans") that provide medical
(including prescription drug), dental and vision benefits (collectively, the
"Buyer Health Plans") to the extent such requirements were satisfied for the
portion of the current plan year under the Business Employee Benefit Plans
that provide medical, dental and vision benefits (the "Business Employee
Health Plans"). Any waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions and
requirements to show evidence of good health contained in Buyer Health Plans
shall be waived with respect to the Transferred Employees (except to the
extent that any such waiting period, pre-existing condition exclusion, or
requirement of showing evidence of good health applied under the applicable
the Business Employee Health Plans in which the Business Employee participates
or is otherwise eligible to participate as of immediately prior to the
Transition Date).

 



   

(g)Buyer shall cause the Buyer Plans that cover the Transferred Employees
after the Transition Date to credit service with Sellers and their Affiliates
and any formerly affiliated predecessor employers to the extent credited by
Sellers and their Affiliates as service with Buyer under the corresponding or
comparable Business Employee Benefit Plans prior to the Transition Date for
purposes of (i) accruing annual vacation time and paid time off, (ii)
calculating severance benefits under Buyer's severance plan(s), and (iii)
eligibility and vesting (but not for benefit accrual purposes under any
defined benefit pension plan) under the Buyer Plans.

 

(h)From and after the Transition Date, Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall
assume and honor the USW CBA. RNR and Buyer shall cooperate in connection with
any engagement in any type of bargaining required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, for avoidance of
doubt, the Transition Services Agreement) or under applicable Law (including
"effects" bargaining) with the collective bargaining representative of the
Union between the date of this Agreement and the Transition Date.

 

(i)Subject to the terms of the Transition Services Agreement, Buyer and its
Affiliates shall have sole responsibility for all Liabilities relating to or
arising from Buyer's and its Affiliates' employment of the Transferred
Employees on and following the Transition Date. Buyer and its Affiliates shall
be solely responsible for any obligations or liabilities arising under the
WARN Act with respect to or as a result, in whole or in part, of the actions
or omissions of Buyer or any of its Affiliates on or after the Transition
Date. Prior to the Transition Date, Sellers will provide to Buyer a list of
employees and former employees of Sellers and their Affiliates who were
employed in the Business who have incurred an "employment loss" (within the
meaning of the WARN Act) (by date and location) during the ninety (90) day
period preceding the Closing Date. Buyer releases, and shall defend, indemnify
and hold harmless, Sellers' Indemnitees from and against all Losses
(REGARDLESS OF WHETHER CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO BY THE SOLE, JOINT,
COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY OF SELLERS
INDEMNITEES) arising out of, related to, or caused by Buyer's and its
Affiliates' employment of the Transferred Employees following the Transition
Date or the terms and conditions of any Transferred Employee's employment
following the Transition Date.

 

(j) From and after the date hereof until the earlier of the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms or the Transition Date, except in
the ordinary course of business or as required under applicable Law or the
terms of any Business Employee Benefit Plan as of the date hereof, Sellers
shall not, except with Buyer's prior written consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld), (i) increase the compensation or benefits payable
to any Business Employee, (ii) terminate the employment of any Business
Employee whose annual base compensation is greater than $150,000, other than
for cause, or (iii) hire any Business Employee whose annual base compensation
is greater than $150,000. 

 

(k)No provision of this Section 9.04 shall create any Third-Party beneficiary
rights under this Agreement in any Business Employee (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof).

 

(l)From and after the date hereof until the earlier of the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms or the one-year anniversary of the
Closing Date, Buyer

 



   

may not (i) employ, hire or otherwise retain any employee (or person who was
previously an employee in the 180-day period prior to such employment, hiring
or retention) of RNR or any of its Affiliates or (ii) solicit, raid, entice or
induce, directly or indirectly, any employee (or person who was previously an
employee in the 180-day period prior to such solicitation, raid, enticement,
or inducement) of RNR or any of its Affiliates or any other person who is
under contract with or rendering services to RNR or any of its Affiliates in
an employee-like capacity in the day-to-day business operations of RNR or any
of its Affiliates, to (A) terminate his or her employment by, or contractual
relationship with, RNR or its Affiliates, (B) refrain from extending or
renewing the same (upon the same or new terms), (C) refrain from rendering
services to or for RNR or its Affiliates, or (D) become employed by or to
enter into contractual relations with any persons other than RNR or its
Affiliates; provided, however, that the foregoing restrictions shall not apply
to Business Employees and any other employees for which Sellers have given
their specific written consent for Buyer to employ or solicit.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the publication of classified advertisements in
newspapers, periodicals, internet bulletin boards or websites, or other
publications of general availability or circulation not directly or indirectly
targeted at any employees of RNR or its Affiliates and the hiring of any
employees of RNR or its Affiliates who were not previously an employee in the
180-day period prior to the date of such hiring who respond to such
advertisements in his or her own volition shall not be deemed a breach of this
provision unless the advertisement is undertaken as a means to circumvent or
conceal a violation of this provision.

 

(m)As of and effective upon the Transition Date, Sellers shall or shall cause
their Affiliates to (i) assign to Buyer and its Affiliates, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law and the applicable agreement, any and all
nondisclosure agreements or covenants, noncompetition agreements or covenants,
non-solicitation agreements or covenants or other restrictive covenants (the
"Restrictive Covenants") between Sellers or their Affiliates, as applicable,
on the one hand, and any Transferred Employee (other than any Excluded
Employees), on the other hand, and (ii) waive such Restrictive Covenants, and
any related claims against Buyer and its Affiliates and the Transferred
Employees, with respect to the Transferred Employees' employment by Sellers or
their Affiliates and activities for or on behalf of Buyer or its Affiliates
following the Closing.

 

Section 9.05 Required Financial Statements. Sellers acknowledge that Buyer
and its Affiliates may be required to include financial statements and other
financial information relating to the Assets ("Required Financial Statements")
in documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or other
similar securities commissions by Buyer and its Affiliates, and that such
Required Financial Statements may be required to be audited. In that regard,
prior to the Closing and subsequent to the Closing until December 31, 2019 to
the extent Sellers are then in existence, Sellers hereby covenant and agree
(i) to provide reasonable and customary assistance to Buyer in connection with
the preparation of the Required Financial Statements and (ii) to provide Buyer
reasonable access to such records (to the extent Sellers have such
information) and personnel of Sellers as Buyer may reasonably request to
enable Buyer, and its representatives and accountants, at Buyer's sole cost
and expense, to prepare and have audited such Required Financial Statements.
Buyer shall reimburse Sellers for any out of pocket expenses incurred by
Sellers in providing such assistance and access, provided that such expenses
were incurred with Buyer's prior written consent.

 



   

Section 9.06 Hedging Program. 

 

(a)Prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall elect to unwind, terminate or
novate all of the Existing Hedging Agreements and the transactions
contemplated thereby in accordance with the terms of the confirmations
contained in each of the Existing Hedging Agreements.

 

(b)After the Execution Date and upon Buyer's payment of the Deposit, the
Sellers, in consultation with Buyer, shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to implement as promptly as practicable (but within seven (7) Business
Days) a production hedging program for the volumes of crude oil production set
out in items (i) to (iii) below (each such transaction initiated in accordance
with this Section 9.06, a "Specified Hedging Agreement," it being understood
that the Existing Hedging Agreements do not constitute Specified Hedging
Agreements); provided, however, neither the Company nor Sellers shall be
obligated to (x) pay to any counterparty any fee to authorize the initiation
of any Specified Hedging Agreement (unless Buyer agrees to reimburse Sellers
for such fee) or (y) enter into any Specified Hedging Agreement until it has
received Buyer's approval of such Specified Hedging Agreement and the
counterparty's fees in connection therewith (including any novation or
transfer fees to the extent such fees are available at that time). For the
avoidance of doubt, Buyer is obligated to reimburse Sellers for any novation
or transfer fees under Section 9.07 even if the amount of such fees are unable
to be provided by the applicable counterparties at the time of entry into a
Specified Hedging Agreement under this Section 9.06(b).

 

(i)For calendar year 2018, no less than 4,200 barrels of oil per day of
Sellers' daily production of oil from the Assets (it being understood that the
4,000 barrels of oil previously hedged by Sellers in consultation with Buyer
applies towards this Specified Hedging Agreement);

 

(ii)For calendar year 2019, no less than 4,000 barrels of oil per day of
Sellers' daily production of oil from the Assets; and

 

(iii)For calendar year 2020, no less than 3,750 barrels of oil per day of
Sellers' daily production of oil from the Assets.

 

(c)If Sellers and/or the Company have authorized the initiation of any
Specified Hedging Agreement in accordance with this Section 9.06 and the
proposed counterparty thereto fails to initiate such Specified Hedging
Agreement, neither Sellers nor the Company shall be in breach of this Section
9.06 for such counterparty's failure to initiate such Specified Hedging
Agreement; provided, however, Sellers shall have the continuing obligation to
use their commercially reasonable efforts to implement the Specified Hedging
Agreements as soon as reasonably practicable.

 

(d)Prior to the earlier of novation of a Specified Hedging Agreement to Buyer
at Closing or the unwinding of such Specified Hedging Agreement after the
occurrence of an Unwinding Scenario, Sellers and the Company shall (i) comply
with such Specified Hedging Agreement and (ii) not (without the prior written
consent of Buyer) execute or deliver any amendment or modification of, or
waiver of any right under, such Specified Hedging Agreement, transfer any
right or obligation under such Specified Hedging Agreement or (absent mutual
agreement of Sellers and Buyer) terminate such Specified Hedging Agreement.

 



   

(e)Whether or not the Closing occurs, Buyer shall pay, be responsible for,
defend, indemnify, hold harmless and forever release Sellers' Indemnitees from
and against any and all (i) payments made by Sellers or payable by Sellers to
any counterparty to a Specified Hedging Agreement related to entering into the
Specified Hedging Agreements or any amendments, waivers, transfers or
terminations of Specified Hedging Agreements pursuant to Section 9.06(d), (ii)
payments made by Sellers or payable by Sellers related to transferring to, or
novating in favor of, Buyer the Specified Hedging Agreements, (iii) payments
made by Sellers or payable by Sellers related to any monthly settlement of a
Specified Hedging Agreement and (iv) payments made by Sellers or payable by
Sellers under any Specified Hedging Agreement pursuant to an Unwinding
Scenario (as defined below), in each case, without duplication of the Purchase
Price adjustments pursuant to Section 12.02(a)(viii) or Section 12.02(b)(vii)
(the "Hedging Indemnities").

 

(f)If this Agreement is terminated prior to Closing or Buyer fails to assume
the Specified Hedging Agreements or the transactions contemplated thereby at
Closing for any reason whatsoever (other than a default by a counterparty to a
Specified Hedging Agreement) (in either case, an "Unwinding Scenario"), then
Sellers shall, at the sole cost and expense of Buyer, use their reasonable
efforts to unwind all of the Specified Hedging Agreements and the transactions
contemplated thereby within five (5) Business Days following the occurrence of
the Unwinding Scenario in accordance with the terms of the confirmations
contained in each of the Specified Hedging Agreements. In the event of an
Unwinding Scenario, the following shall apply:

 

(i)Within three (3) Business Days after the occurrence of the Unwinding
Scenario, Buyer and Sellers shall endeavor in good faith to agree on the net
aggregate value of all Specified Hedging Agreements to Sellers as of the date
of the Unwinding Scenario. If Buyer and Sellers are unable to so agree, then
within two (2) Business Days thereafter Sellers shall, with respect to each
Specified Hedging Agreement, obtain a written quote from the applicable
counterparty for the amount that such counterparty would pay (expressed as a
positive number) or require to be paid (expressed as a negative number) in
order to terminate such Specified Hedging Agreement as of the date such
quotation is provided and promptly provide a copy thereof to Buyer and such
quote shall be deemed to be agreed to by Buyer and Sellers. The aggregate net
value agreed between Buyer and Sellers or the sum of all such quotations, as
applicable, shall be referred to herein as the "Aggregate Net Hedge Value".

 

(ii)If this Agreement is terminated by Sellers pursuant to Section 13.01(b)
because the conditions set forth in Section 11.02(a) and Section 11.02(b) have
not been satisfied or waived, then (A) if the Aggregate Net Hedge Value is
positive, no payment shall be owing by Sellers to the Buyer with respect to
the Specified Hedging Agreements and (B) if the Aggregate Net Hedge Value is
negative, Buyer shall pay the absolute value of such amount to Sellers within
five (5) Business Days of receipt of such quotations.

 

(iii)If this Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant to Section 13.01(c)
because the conditions set forth in Section 11.03(a) and Section 11.03(b) have
not been satisfied or waived or pursuant to Section 13.01(f), then (A) if the
Aggregate Net Hedge Value is positive, Sellers shall pay the absolute value of
such amount to Buyer

 



   

within five (5) Business Days of receipt of such quotations and (B) if the
Aggregate Net Hedge Value is negative, no payment shall be owing by Buyer to
Sellers with respect to the Specified Hedging Agreements.

 

(iv)If this Agreement is terminated by Buyer or Sellers pursuant to Section
13.01(a), Section 13.01(d) or Section 13.01(e), then (A) if the Aggregate Net
Hedge Value is positive, Sellers shall pay one-half (1/2) of such amount to
Buyer within five (5) Business Days of receipt of such quotations and (B) if
the Aggregate Net Hedge Value is negative, Buyer shall pay one-half (1/2) of
such amount to Sellers within five (5) Business Days of receipt of such
quotations.

 

(v)If an Unwinding Scenario occurs due to Buyer's failure to assume the
Specified Hedging Agreements or the transactions contemplated thereby at
Closing for any reason whatsoever ((x) including due to the failure of Buyer
to engage a counterparty to a Specified Hedging Agreement and (y) other than a
default by a counterparty to a Specified Hedging Agreement), then (A) if the
Aggregate Net Hedge Value is positive, Sellers shall pay such amount to Buyer
within five (5) Business Days of receipt of such quotations and (B) if the
Aggregate Net Hedge Value is negative, Buyer shall pay such amount to Sellers
within five (5) Business Days of receipt of such quotations.

 

(g)Following the Closing Date or the earlier termination of this Agreement,
Buyer shall make any required payments pursuant to the Hedging Indemnities to
Sellers within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of a reasonably detailed
invoice with respect thereto.

 

(h)For the avoidance of doubt and subject to Section 9.06(f), Buyer shall be
entitled to and responsible for, as applicable, all revenues, gains, proceeds,
losses, costs and expenses related to the Specified Hedging Agreements and the
transactions contemplated thereby (whether or not Closing occurs), including
all revenues, gains, proceeds, losses, costs and expenses in an Unwinding
Scenario, it being understood that all such revenues, gains and proceeds shall
be the property of Buyer and that all such losses, costs and expenses shall be
limited to the Hedging Indemnities.

 

(i)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Specified
Hedging Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby and the actions
to be taken by the Parties in accordance with this Section 9.06 and Section
9.07 are an exception to, and will under no circumstance constitute a breach
of, any of (A) the representations and warranties at Section 7.11, or in the
corresponding certificate to be delivered at Closing and (B) the covenants
contained in Section 15.01(b).

 

Section 9.07 Novations. Prior to the Closing, Sellers and Buyer agree to use
commercially reasonable, good faith efforts to negotiate mutually acceptable,
definitive novation instruments with the applicable counterparties to the
Specified Hedging Agreements (the "Novation Instruments"), including any
transferee financial institution that, with Buyer, will be party to the
Specified Hedging Agreements following the Closing. Sellers and Buyer shall
execute and deliver such Novation Instruments to the Specified Hedging
Agreement counterparties at the Closing. Buyer shall execute an ISDA
agreement with each applicable counterparty of the Specified Hedging
Agreements at the Closing and immediately prior to such novation and pay to
Sellers any

 



   

fees paid by Sellers to a trade counterparty that was necessary to effect any
novation contemplated by this Section 9.07, provided that Buyer shall not be
liable for any such fees that are directly attributable to novating hedges
other than Specified Hedging Agreements. Without limiting Buyer's obligation
to pay such fees, Sellers shall consult with Buyer regarding any fees to be
paid to a trade counterparty other than those agreed to pursuant to Section
9.06(b)(x) and (y) and shall also consult with Buyer prior to agreeing to
incur or pay such fees. If Sellers have executed and delivered any Novation
Instrument in accordance with this Section 9.07 and the proposed counterparty
thereto fails to execute and deliver such Novation Instrument, neither Seller
nor Buyer shall be in breach of this Section 9.07 for such counterparty's
failure to execute and deliver such Novation Instrument.

 

Section 9.08 Parent Guarantee. It is acknowledged and agreed that Parent
Guarantor's guarantee of Buyer's performance of Buyer's obligations hereunder
is a material inducement for Sellers to proceed with the execution of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein. In
light of the foregoing, Parent Guarantor shall execute and deliver to Sellers
the parent guarantee in the form of Exhibit H hereto (the "Parent Guarantee").

 

Article X 
Purchase Price Allocation and Tax Matters

 

Section 10.01 Purchase Price Allocation.

 

(a)The Unadjusted Purchase Price has been allocated among the Federal Unit
Agreement Interests as set forth in Exhibit F. Sellers and Buyer agree that
the Allocated Values shall be used to compute any adjustments to the
Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(b)Buyer and Sellers acknowledge that the Purchase Price (as adjusted by the
Purchase Price Adjustments) shall be allocated among the Assets under Section
1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. Prior to the
Closing, Buyer and Sellers will mutually agree regarding allocation of the
Purchase Price (the "Allocation Schedule") and shall prepare their respective
Tax Returns with respect to transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a
manner consistent with the Allocation Schedule. The Allocation Schedule shall
be prepared consistent with the Allocated Values set forth in Exhibit F and
shall be revised to take into account the Purchase Price Adjustments and any
payment of Additional Consideration (exclusive of any imputed interest
required under the Code) consistent with the provisions set forth in this
Section 10.01. Neither Buyer nor Sellers shall take any position inconsistent
with such allocation, as updated by the Parties to reflect any adjustments
pursuant to this Agreement and any Assumed Obligations or other items treated
as consideration for U.S. federal income tax purposes, on any income Tax
Return or otherwise, unless required to do so by applicable Law or a
"determination," within the meaning of Section 1313(a)(1) of the Code;
provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall prevent Buyer or
Sellers from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any taxing
authority based upon or arising out of such allocation, and neither Buyer nor
Sellers shall be required to litigate before any court any proposed deficiency
or adjustment by any taxing authority challenging such allocation. Any
indemnity payments made by a Party (including for the avoidance of doubt
payments made to Sellers of the Exxon Escrow Refund) pursuant to this

 



   

Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal,
state and local income tax purposes unless otherwise required by applicable
Law.

 

(c)For U.S. federal income Tax purposes (and applicable state and local income
Tax purposes to the extent it follows the federal treatment), the Parties
shall treat the sale of the Company as a sale governed by Rev. Rul. 99-6,
Situation 2, with Sellers treated as selling the Company in a fully taxable
transaction to Buyer pursuant to Code Section 741, Buyer treated as acquiring
all of the assets of the Company in a fully taxable transaction, and the
Company treated as terminating and becoming a disregarded entity pursuant to
Code Section 708(b)(1)(A). The Parties shall report, act and file Tax Returns
in all respects and for all purposes consistent with the foregoing treatment
and no Party shall take any position (whether in audits, Tax Return or
otherwise) that is inconsistent with the foregoing treatment, in each case,
unless required to do so by a change in applicable Law or pursuant to the good
faith resolution of a Tax contest.

 

Section 10.02 Transfer Taxes. Buyer shall be responsible for the timely
payment of, and shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sellers (and its
members, managers, officers, employees and agents) from and against, all
Transfer Taxes, if any. Buyer shall prepare and file when due all necessary
documentation and Tax Returns with respect to any such Transfer Taxes;
provided, however, that Sellers shall cooperate with Buyer and take any action
reasonably requested by Buyer to minimize any such Transfer Taxes, provided
Buyer promptly reimburses Sellers for any costs incurred in connection with
any such action taken by Sellers. Any Transfer Taxes imposed on or paid by
Sellers shall be promptly reimbursed to Sellers by Buyer upon written demand
therefor. "Transfer Taxes" means any and all Taxes (excluding Income Taxes or
Asset Taxes), for sales, use, excise, stock, conveyance, registration,
securities transactions, real estate, stamp, documentary, notarial, filing,
recording, and similar Taxes, arising out of or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 10.03 Allocation of Taxes. The following provisions shall govern
the allocation of responsibility as between Buyer, the Company and Sellers for
certain tax matters following the Closing Date:

 

(a)Sellers shall be responsible for the payment of all Taxes of the Company or
with respect to the Assets, and shall be entitled to any refunds with respect
thereto, for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods, and Buyer shall be responsible for
the payment of all Taxes of the Company or with respect to the Assets, and
shall be entitled to any refunds with respect thereto, for all Post-Closing
Tax Periods.

 

(b)Taxes (other than Income Taxes) that are attributable to the severance or
production of Hydrocarbons, or that are imposed on a transactional basis,
shall be deemed attributable to the period during which the production of the
Hydrocarbons or the transaction with respect to such Taxes occurred, as
applicable, and payroll Taxes shall be deemed attributable to the period for
which the payroll accrues. 

 

(c)Income Taxes shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books
as of the close of business on the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt,
all Income Taxes on any taxable income attributable to the Exxon Escrow
Account through and including the Closing Date shall be allocated to Sellers.

 



   

(d)Any Taxes (other than Taxes described in Section 10.03(b) or Section
10.03(c) above) assessed with respect to a period which begins before, and
ends on or after, the Effective Date shall be prorated based on the number of
days in such period up to and including the day before the Effective Date and
the number of days in such period that occur on or after the Effective Date. 

 

(e)If a Tax other than an Income Tax for a period that includes the Effective
Date has not been levied as of the Closing, the amount of such Tax shall be
estimated at the Closing utilizing the most recent information available
regarding such Tax. If any Asset Tax is estimated for purposes of Section
12.02, upon determination of the actual amount of such Taxes, to the extent
not taken into account under Section 12.02, prompt payments will be made
between the Parties to cause the appropriate Party to bear such Taxes
allocable to such Person under this Section 10.03.

 

Section 10.04 Post-Closing Tax Matters. After Closing:

 

(a)Seller Representative shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) all Tax
Returns of the Company due on or after the Closing Date for Pre-Closing Tax
Periods:

 

(i)Seller Representative shall provide a draft to Buyer of each such Tax
Return no later than fifteen (15) days prior to the date on which such Tax
Return is required to be filed. Buyer shall provide written comments to any
Tax Return described in the preceding sentence no later than ten (10) days
prior to the date on which such Tax Return is required to be filed and Seller
Representative will consider Buyer's comments in good faith;

 

(ii)Seller Representative shall pay any Taxes due in respect of such Tax
Returns subject to reimbursement for any Taxes allocated to Buyer under
Section 10.03 and not otherwise adjusted under Section 12.02 or Section 10.03.

 

(b)Buyer shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) all Tax Returns of the
Company due after the Closing Date other than Tax Returns described in Section
10.04(a) above. With respect to any such Tax Returns that include a Straddle
Period:

 

(i)All such Tax Returns shall be prepared by Buyer in a manner consistent with
past practice of the Company relating to the same Taxes (unless otherwise
required by Law);

 

(ii)Buyer shall provide a draft to Seller Representative of each such Tax
Return no later than fifteen (15) days prior to the date on which such Tax
Return is required to be filed. Seller Representative shall provide written
comments to any Tax Return described in the preceding sentence no later than
ten (10) days prior to the date on which such Tax Return is required to be
filed and Buyer will consider Seller Representative's comments in good faith;

 

(iii)If the Parties are unable to agree to any matter reflected on any such
Tax Return the matter shall be submitted to the Independent Expert, who shall
determine the appropriate manner for reporting the item(s) in question;

 



   

(iv)If the disagreement between Buyer and Seller Representative regarding a
Tax Return prepared by Seller Representative under this Section 10.04(b) is
not resolved by the due date of the Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be filed
as prepared by Buyer as modified for any adjustments mutually agreed to by
Buyer and Seller Representative. Any such Tax Return shall be amended as
necessary to reflect the appropriate reporting determined by the Independent
Accountants; and

 

(v)Buyer shall cause the Company to pay any Taxes due in respect of such Tax
Returns subject to prompt reimbursement for any Taxes allocated to Sellers
under Section 10.03 and not otherwise adjusted under Section 12.02 or Section
10.03.

 

(c)All tax sharing agreements between the Company and Sellers or any
affiliated entities of Sellers will be terminated as of the Closing Date.

 

(d)Buyer and Seller Representative shall reasonably cooperate and assist the
other (i) in preparing any Tax Return relating to any Tax imposed with respect
to the Assets or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) in
qualifying for any exemption or reduction in Tax that may be available with
respect to the Assets or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

(e)Buyer and Seller Representative shall reasonably cooperate in preparing for
any audits, examinations or other tax proceedings by, or disputes with, taxing
authorities regarding any Tax with respect to the Assets or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

 

(f)Buyer and Seller Representative shall make available to the other, and to
any taxing authority as reasonably requested, any information, records, and
documents relating to a Tax incurred or imposed with respect to the Assets or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

 

(g)Buyer and Seller Representative (in either case, the "Recipient Party")
shall provide timely notice to the other (the "Notified Party") in writing of
any pending or threatened Tax audit, examination, or assessment that could
reasonably be expected to affect the Notified Party's Tax liability under
applicable Law or this Agreement (a "Tax Controversy"), and promptly furnish
the Notified Party with copies of all correspondence with respect to the Tax
Controversy.

 

(i)If the Notified Party admits its payment or indemnification responsibility
under this Agreement, the Notified Party shall have the right and obligation
to conduct and control, at its own expense, the Tax Controversy, and the
Recipient Party shall not settle any such Tax Controversy without the prior
written consent of the Notified Party, which may not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed; and, the Notified Party may, at its own expense,
initiate any claim for refund or amended return; provided, however, that
without the consent of the Recipient Party, the Notified Party shall not
settle any such Tax Controversy or file any claim for refund or amended return
that may materially and adversely affect the Recipient Party (other than as a
result of the payment of Taxes for which the Notified Party has a payment or
indemnification obligation under this Agreement).

 



   

(ii)If the Notified Party does not admit to its payment or indemnification
responsibility under this Agreement or admits to its payment or
indemnification responsibility under this Agreement but fails to diligently
pursue the conduct of the Tax Controversy, the Recipient Party shall have the
right to conduct, at the expense of the Notified Party, the Tax Controversy
and shall have the right to settle any such Tax Controversy.

 

(iii)Notwithstanding clauses (i) and (ii) above, however, in the event of a
Tax Controversy involving a Straddle Period with respect to which both Buyer
and Sellers are liable for Taxes under Section 10.03, the Recipient Party
shall have the right and obligation to conduct the Tax Controversy, but shall
allow the Notified Party to participate in the Tax Controversy at its own
expense and shall not settle the Tax Controversy in a manner that may
materially and adversely affect the Notified Party without the prior written
consent of the Notified Party, which may not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 

Section 10.05 Refunds. Any Tax refunds that are received by Buyer or the
Company, and any amounts credited against Tax to which Buyer or the Company
become entitled, with respect to Taxes that are allocated to Sellers under
Section 10.03 shall be for the account of Sellers to the extent that Sellers
or the Company paid such Taxes or such Taxes were borne by Sellers under
Section 12.02. Any Tax refunds that are received by Sellers, and any amounts
credited against Tax to which Sellers become entitled, with respect to Taxes
that are allocated to Buyer under Section 10.03 shall be for the account of
Buyer to the extent that Buyer or the Company paid such Taxes or such Taxes
were borne by Buyer under Section 12.02.

Article XIV 
Post-Closing Obligations

 

Section 14.01 Imbalances. For purposes of this Agreement, "Imbalances" means
over-production or under-production subject to an imbalance or make-up
obligation with respect to Hydrocarbons produced from or allocated to the
Subject Interests, regardless of whether such over-production or under-
production, imbalance or make-up obligation arises at the wellhead, pipeline,
gathering system, transportation or other location and regardless of whether
the same arises under contract or by operation of Law. Buyer and the Company
Sellers shall jointly verify the actual net imbalances as of the Effective
Time in the Closing Statement (as set out in Section 7.25 of the

 



   

Disclosure Schedule) and the Accounting Statement and any Imbalances shall be
accounted for between the Parties in the Closing Statement and the Accounting
Statement at the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) closing price per MCF
(or, with respect to oil Imbalances, per barrel) on the third (3rd) Business
Day preceding the Effective Time. This settlement under the Accounting
Statement shall be final and neither Party afterwards shall make claim upon
the other Party concerning the Imbalances. BUYER ASSUMES ALL RIGHTS AND
LIABILITIES RELATING TO IMBALANCES DISCOVERED AFTER THE ACCOUNTING STATEMENT
INCLUDING ANY REVENUE ADJUSTMENT CAUSED BY SUCH SUBSEQUENTLY DISCOVERED
IMBALANCES AND shall DEFEND AND INDEMNIFY SELLERS' Indemnitees FROM AND
AGAINST ANY Losses, BY any Person, ARISING OUT OF SUCH IMBALANCES REGARDLESS
OF SELLERS' NEGLIGENCE OR FAULT (INCLUDING STRICT LIABILITY).

 

Section 14.02 Final Accounting Statement.

 

(a)On or before the ninetieth (90th) day after the Closing Date, Sellers shall
prepare and deliver to Buyer a revised Closing Statement setting forth a
detailed calculation of the actual Purchase Price Adjustments (the "Accounting
Statement"). The Accounting Statement shall include any adjustment or payment
which was not finally determined as of the Closing Date, including any
Imbalances, and the allocation of revenues and expenses as determined in
accordance with Section 12.02. Sellers shall provide Buyer such data and
information as Buyer reasonably may request supporting the amounts reflected
on the Accounting Statement to permit Buyer to agree to the Accounting
Statement. The Accounting Statement shall become final and binding on the
Parties on the thirty-first (31st) day following receipt by Buyer (the "Final
Settlement Date") unless Buyer gives written notice of its disagreement (a
"Notice of Disagreement") to Sellers prior to that date, and upon such Notice
of Disagreement, the Accounting Statement will be final and binding with
respect to all matters other than those specified in the Notice of
Disagreement. Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify in detail the dollar
amount, nature and basis of any disagreement so asserted. If a Notice of
Disagreement is received by Sellers in a timely manner, then the Parties shall
resolve the Dispute evidenced by the Notice of Disagreement in accordance with
Article XVIII.

 

(b)If the amount of the Purchase Price as set forth on the Final Statement
exceeds the amount of the estimated Purchase Price paid at the Closing, then
Buyer shall pay to Sellers the amount by which the Purchase Price as set forth
on the Final Statement exceeds the amount of the estimated Purchase Price paid
at the Closing on or before the third (3rd) Business Day after the Final
Settlement Date (or within the third (3rd) Business Day of resolution of the
Final Statement by an Independent Expert, if applicable). If the amount of
the Purchase Price as set forth on the Final Statement is less than the amount
of the estimated Purchase Price paid at the Closing, then Sellers shall refund
to Buyer the amount by which the Purchase Price as set forth on the Final
Statement is less than the amount of the estimated Purchase Price paid at the
Closing on or before the third (3rd) Business Day after the Final Settlement
Date (or within the third (3rd) Business Day of resolution of the Final
Statement by an Independent Expert, if applicable). For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Final Statement" means (i) the final Accounting Statement
as finalized pursuant to Section 14.02, or (ii) upon resolution of any Dispute
regarding a Notice of Disagreement, the final Accounting Statement reflecting
those resolutions.

 



   

(c)The Parties agree that any and all payments pursuant to this Agreement
shall, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, be treated for all
Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

 

Section 14.03 Further Cooperation. Sellers shall make the Records available
to be picked up by Buyer at the offices of Resolute during normal business
hours within ten (10) Business Days after the Closing to the extent the
Records are in the possession of Sellers and are not subject to contractual
restrictions on transferability. Sellers shall have the right to retain
copies of any of the Records and the rights granted under Section 19.03.

 

Section 14.04 After the Closing. After the Closing Date, Sellers and Buyer,
at the request of the other and without additional consideration, shall
execute and deliver, or shall cause to be executed and delivered, from time to
time such further instruments of conveyance and transfer and shall take such
other action as the other reasonably may request to convey and deliver the
Assets and the Company Units to Buyer and to accomplish the orderly transfer
of the Assets and the Company Units to Buyer in the manner contemplated by
this Agreement.

Section 15.02 Limitations on the Operational Obligations and Liabilities of
Sellers.

 

(a)Buyer acknowledges that the Company owns undivided interests in some or all
of the Assets, and Buyer agrees that, as long as the Company has voted its
interests in a manner that complies with the provisions of this Article XV,
the acts or omissions of the other working interest owners shall not
constitute a violation of the provisions of this Article XV, nor shall any
action required by a vote of working interest owners constitute such a
violation. To the extent that the Company or an Affiliate of the Company is
not the operator of an Asset, the obligations of Sellers in this Article XV
shall be construed to require that Sellers use reasonable efforts (without
being obligated to incur any material expense or institute any cause of
action) to cause the operator of that Asset to take such actions or render
such performance within the constraints of the applicable operating agreements
and other applicable agreements.

 

(b)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article XV, Sellers shall
have no liability to Buyer for, Buyer hereby releases, and Buyer shall defend,
indemnify and hold harmless Sellers and the Company, and their respective
members, managers, Affiliates, co-lessees, co-venturers and its and their
respective officers, directors, managers, employees, agents, partners,
representatives, members, shareholders, Affiliates, subsidiaries, successors
and assigns (collectively, "Sellers' Indemnitees") from, the incorrect payment
of delay rentals, royalties, shut-in royalties or similar payments or for any
failure to pay any such payments through mistake or oversight (REGARDLESS OF
WHETHER CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO BY THE SOLE, JOINT, COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT
NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY OF SELLERS' INDEMNITEES) to the extent that
such payments relate to periods after the Effective Time. In no event shall
Buyer's remedy for Sellers' breach of its obligations under this Article XV
exceed the value of the interest affected by such breach.

 

Section 15.03 Operation of the Assets after the Closing. Except as provided
in the Transition Services Agreement, it is expressly understood and agreed
that the Sellers shall not be obligated to continue operating any of the
operated Assets following the Closing and Buyer assumes full responsibility
for operating (or causing the operation of) all such Assets following the
Closing. The Sellers do not warrant or guarantee that Buyer will become the
operator of the operated Assets or any portion of the Assets, as such matter
will be controlled by the applicable joint operating agreement(s). Without
implying any obligation on the Sellers' part to continue operating any
operated Assets after the Closing, if the Sellers elect to continue to operate
any such Assets following the Closing at the request of Buyer or any Third
Party working interest owner, due to constraints of applicable joint operating
agreement(s), failure of a successor operator to take over operations or other
reasonable cause, the continued operation by the Sellers shall be for the
account of Buyer, at the sole risk, cost and expense of Buyer. Buyer releases
and shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Sellers' Indemnitees, as a part
of the Assumed Obligations, from all Losses (REGARDLESS OF WHETHER CAUSED OR
CONTRIBUTED TO BY THE

 



   

SOLE, JOINT, COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY OF
SELLERS' INDEMNITEES) with respect to (a) continued operations by the Sellers,
(b) Buyer's assumption of operations from the Sellers, and (c) compliance with
the terms of any applicable joint operating agreement related to the election
of a successor operator. Buyer shall conduct or cause to be conducted all
operations on the Assets after Closing in a good and workmanlike manner and in
compliance with all applicable Law and agreements.

 

Section 15.04 Change in Circumstances; Casualty Loss.

 

(a)Buyer shall assume all risk of loss with respect to, and any change in the
condition of, the Assets from the Effective Time until the Closing with
respect to the depletion of Hydrocarbons, the watering-out of any well, the
collapse of casing, sand infiltration of wells and damage to and depreciation
of property, including normal wear and tear.

 

(b)If after the Execution Date and prior to the Closing any part of the Assets
shall be damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty or if any part of the
Assets shall be taken in condemnation or under the right of eminent domain or
if proceedings for such purposes shall be pending or threatened, this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any such
destruction, taking or proceeding, or the threat of any such destruction,
taking or proceeding, and the Parties shall proceed with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding such destruction or taking
without reduction of the Purchase Price, but subject to Section 13.01(f) and
Section 16.04. Sellers and/or the Company shall maintain its existing
insurance coverage with respect to the Assets from the Execution Date until
Closing.

 

(c)Notwithstanding Section 15.04, in the event of any loss described in
Section 15.04(b), and the Closing occurs, then at the Closing, Sellers shall
pay to Buyer all sums paid to Sellers by Third Parties by reason of the
destruction or taking of such Assets and representing the value of such
Assets, including any sums paid pursuant to any policy or agreement of
insurance or indemnity, and shall assign, transfer and set over unto Buyer all
of the rights, title and interest of Sellers in and to any claims, causes of
action, unpaid proceeds or other payments from Third Parties for the value of
such Assets, including any policy or agreement of insurance or indemnity,
arising out of such destruction or taking.

of royalties accruing under the Leases prior to the Effective Time, including,

shall apply only if and to the extent Buyer provides Sellers with a Claim
Notice complying with Section 16.05 on or before the day occurring nine (9)

Section 16.05 Notices and Defense of Indemnified Matters.

 

(a)For purposes of this Section 16.05, the term "Indemnifying Party" when used
in connection with particular Losses shall mean the Party having an obligation
to indemnify another Person with respect to such Losses pursuant to this
Agreement, and the term "Indemnified Party" when used in connection with
particular Losses shall mean the Persons having the right to be indemnified
with respect to such Losses by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
Agreement. In the event that Buyer is the Indemnified Party, Resolute, as the
Seller Representative, shall be deemed the Indemnifying Party with sole
authority to act on behalf of the Sellers on all matters under Article X and
this Article XVI.

 

(b)To make claim for indemnification under any of Section 16.03 or Section
16.04, an Indemnified Party must notify the Indemnifying Party of its claim
under this Section 16.05, including the specific details of and specific basis
under this Agreement for its claim (the "Claim Notice"). In the event that
the claim for indemnification is based upon a claim by a Third Party against
the Indemnified Party (a "Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall provide its
Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of the
Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with respect to
the Claim; provided, however, that the failure of any Indemnified Party to
give timely notice of a Claim as provided in this Section 16.05 shall relieve
the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under Section 16.03 or Section 16.04
(as applicable) only to the extent that failure results in insufficient time
being available to permit the

 



   

Indemnifying Party to defend effectively against the Claim or otherwise
materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party's ability to defend against the
Claim.

 

(c)In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Claim, the
Indemnifying Party, on or before the 30th day after its receipt of the Claim
Notice, shall notify the Indemnified Party whether it admits or denies its
liability to defend the Indemnified Party against the Claim at the sole cost
and expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party is authorized,
prior to and before the expiration of this 30-day period, to file any motion,
answer or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to
protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and that is not
prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party.

 

(d)If the Indemnifying Party admits its liability to defend the Indemnified
Party, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right and obligation to
diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Claim. The Indemnifying
Party shall have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any
compromise or settlement of the Claim. If requested by the Indemnifying
Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate in contesting any Claim which
the Indemnifying Party elects to contest. The Indemnified Party may
participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Claim
controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 16.05. Without
the written consent of the Indemnified Party, an Indemnifying Party shall not
(i) settle any Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to
any Claim which does not include an unconditional written release of the
Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such Claim or (ii) settle
any Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect any Claim in
any manner that may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Party
(other than as a result of money damages covered by the indemnity).

 

(e)If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its liability to defend the
Indemnified Party or admits its liability to defend the Indemnified Party but
fails diligently to prosecute or settle the Claim, then the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to defend against the Claim at the sole cost and expense
of the Indemnifying Party, with counsel of the Indemnified Party's choosing,
subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party to admit its liability to
defend the Indemnified Party and assume the defense of the Claim at any time
prior to its settlement or final determination. If the Indemnifying Party has
not yet admitted its liability to defend the Indemnified Party for a Claim,
the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party of any proposed
settlement and the Indemnifying Party shall have the option, on or before the
tenth (10th) day following receipt of that notice (i) to admit in writing its
liability to defend the Indemnified Party for the Claim, and (ii) if its
liability to defend the Indemnified Party is so admitted, to reject, in its
reasonable judgment, the proposed settlement.

 

(f)In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim
Notice (i) to cure the Losses complained of, (ii) to admit its liability for
those Losses, or (iii) to dispute the claim for those Losses. If the
Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within this 30-day
period that it has cured the Losses or that it disputes the claim for those
Losses, the amount of those Losses shall conclusively be deemed a Liability of
the Indemnifying Party.

(a)Each Seller hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints Resolute (the
"Seller Representative") as such Sellers' true and lawful attorney‑in‑fact and
agent and authorizes the Seller Representative to act exclusively for such
Seller and in such Seller's name, place and stead in any and all capacities
under Article X and Article XVI and to do and perform every act and thing

exclusive power and authority to do and perform each and every act and thing

hereof. Each Seller acknowledges and agree that, by executing this Agreement
and without any further action by such Seller, such Seller hereby ratifies and
approves any delivery by the Seller Representative of any waiver, amendment,
agreement, opinion, certificate or other document contemplated hereby that is
executed by the Seller Representative, and such Seller shall be bound by such
documents or action as fully as if such Seller had executed and delivered such
documents. All decisions of the Seller Representative shall be binding upon
all Sellers, and no Seller shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or
otherwise contest the same.

 

(b)Each Seller agrees that Buyer and the Buyer Indemnitees shall be entitled
to rely on any action taken by the Seller Representative, on behalf of the
Sellers, pursuant to Article X and Article XVI (each, an "Authorized Action"),
without any obligation to inquire of the Sellers, and that each Authorized
Action shall be binding on each Seller as fully as if such Seller had taken
such Authorized Action. Buyer and the Buyer Indemnitees are expressly
authorized to rely on the genuineness of the signature of the Seller
Representative and, upon receipt of any writing which reasonably appears to
have been signed by the Seller Representative, Buyer and the Buyer Indemnitees
may act upon the same without any further duty of inquiry as to the
genuineness of the writing.

Article XVIII 
Dispute Resolution

 

Section 18.01 Scope; Appointment of Independent Expert. All disputes among
the Parties regarding Title Defects, Title Defect Values, Environmental
Defects, Environmental Defect Values, Title Benefits, Third Party Interest
Values or calculation of the Final Statement or revisions thereto ("Disputes")
shall be exclusively and finally resolved pursuant to this Article XVIII. If
the Parties are unable to reach resolution as to any such outstanding Dispute
within five (5) days following delivery of a written notice from either Buyer
or Sellers to the other Party that Buyer or Sellers, as applicable, intends to
submit such Dispute to the Independent Expert for resolution pursuant to this
Article XVIII, then either Party may, by written notice to the other Party (an
"Election Notice"), elect to submit such Dispute to a single arbitrator (the
"Independent Expert"), who shall be selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and
Sellers within fifteen (15) days after the delivery of such Election Notice in
accordance with following:

 

(a)in the case of any Dispute regarding Title Defects, Title Defect Values,
Title Benefits or Third Party Interest Values, the Independent Expert shall be
a title attorney with at least twenty (20) years' experience in oil and gas
titles involving properties in the regional area in which the Assets with
respect to which such Title Defects, Title Benefits or Third Party Interest
are alleged or with respect to which such Title Defect Values or Third Party
Interest Values in dispute are located and who is licensed to practice law in
the state in which such Assets are located;

 

(b)in the case of any Dispute regarding Environmental Defects or Environmental
Defect Values, the Independent Expert shall be an environmental consultant
with at least 20 years' experience involving properties in the regional area
in which the Assets with respect to which such Environmental Defects are
alleged or with respect to which such Environmental Defect Values in dispute
are located;

 

(c)in the case of any Dispute regarding the calculation of the Final Statement
or revisions thereto or the Parties' inability to agree to any matter under
Section 10.04 (Post-Closing Tax Matters), the Independent Expert shall be a
senior partner of an independent accounting firm mutually acceptable to Buyer
and Sellers; and

 



   

(d)in the case of any Dispute, the Independent Expert shall not have had a
substantial relationship with any Party or any Affiliate of any Party during
the two (2) years prior to such selection;

 

provided that, in any case, in the absence of such agreement within fifteen
(15) days of the delivery of the Election Notice, the Independent Expert shall
be selected as would a single arbitrator in accordance with the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the "Rules")
notwithstanding the selection method and criteria set forth in clauses (a)-(d)
above. If any Independent Expert should die, withdraw or otherwise become
incapable of serving or refuse to serve, a successor arbitrator shall be
selected in the same manner as the Independent Expert.

 

Section 18.02 Additional Procedures. All proceedings under this Article
XVIII shall be held in Denver, Colorado, and shall be conducted in accordance
with the Rules, to the extent such Rules do not conflict with the terms of
this Article XVIII. The Independent Expert's final determination shall be
made within twenty-one (21) days after submission of the matters in dispute to
the Independent Expert, shall be in writing, and shall set forth findings and
conclusions upon which the Independent Expert based the award. In the case of
any Dispute regarding Title Defect Values, Environmental Defect Values or
Third Party Interest Values, which when aggregated with all other amounts
claimed or agreed that would be eligible to be counted under Section 13.01(f),
the amount of which would exceed seventeen and one-half percent (17.5%) of the
Unadjusted Purchase Price, the Termination Date shall be extended by the
amount of days taken by the Independent Expert to make its final determination
(counting from the day the matter is submitted to the Independent Expert and
ending on the day the Independent Expert submits its findings in writing to
the Parties). The Independent Expert shall agree to comply with the provisions
set forth in this Section 18.02 before accepting appointment. In making its
determination, the Independent Expert shall be bound by terms of this
Agreement, to the extent applicable, and, subject to the foregoing, may
consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Independent Expert are
necessary to make a proper determination. The Independent Expert, however, may
not determine that (a) a Title Defect Value of a Title Defect is greater than
the Title Defect Value claimed by Buyer in its applicable Title Defect Notice
or less than the amount claimed by Sellers in response to such notice, or (b)
an Environmental Defect Value is greater than the Environmental Defect Value
claimed by Buyer in its applicable Environmental Defect Notice or less than
the amount claimed by Sellers in response to such notice, (c) the value of a
Title Benefit is greater than the amount claimed by Sellers or less than the
amount claimed by Buyer, (d) a Third Party Interest Value is greater than the
amount claimed by Buyer or less than the amount claimed by Sellers, (e) the
value of an upward adjustment to the Purchase Price is greater than the amount
claimed by Sellers, or (f) the value of a downward adjustment to the Purchase
Price is greater than the amount claimed by Buyer. The Independent Expert
shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific
disputed Title Defects, Title Defect Values, Title Benefits, Environmental
Defects, Environmental Defect Values, Third Party Interest Values or
calculation of the Final Statement or revisions thereto submitted by either
Party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with
respect to any matter nor may the Independent Expert determine the
enforceability of a Preferential Purchase Right or Third Party consent right.
Sellers and Buyer shall each bear their own legal fees and other costs.
Sellers and Buyer shall each bear one-half (1/2) of the costs and expenses of
the Independent Expert.

 



   

Section 18.03 Waiver. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, at any time Buyer may waive any Title Defect, Title Defect Value,
Environmental Defect or Environmental Defect Value previously asserted by
Buyer.

 

Section 18.04 Binding Nature. The decision and award of the Independent
Expert with respect to any arbitration under this Article XVIII shall be
binding upon the Parties and final and nonappealable to the maximum extent
permitted by Law, and judgment thereon may be entered in a court of competent
jurisdiction and enforced by either Party as a final judgment of such court.

 

Section 18.05 Confidentiality. Except to the extent necessary to enforce a
decision and award of the Independent Expert, to enforce other rights of the
Parties hereunder, or as required by applicable Law or the rules of any stock
exchange on which the securities of either Party or any of its Affiliates are
listed or are in the process of being listed, the Independent Expert and
Parties, and their counsel, consultants and other representatives, shall
maintain as confidential the fact any proceedings are ongoing, or have been
completed, under this Article XVIII, any decision and award of the Independent
Expert and all documents prepared and submitted by any Party, or its counsel,
consultants and other agents and representatives, in connection with any
proceedings under this Article XVIII.
