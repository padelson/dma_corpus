the applicable standard of conduct. Unless otherwise specified in an agreement with the claimant, an actual determination by the corporation (in the manner provided under the Delaware General Corporation Law) after the commencement of such action
that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct shall not be a defense to the action, but shall create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. </P>
