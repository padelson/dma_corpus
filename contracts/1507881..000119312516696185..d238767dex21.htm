AGREEMENT

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally
bound, hereby agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER 

Section 1.01. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to
as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent.

 

Section 1.02. _Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and
the transactions contemplated hereby shall have been abandoned pursuant to
_Section_ _ _ _8.01_ and  subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable
Law) of the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE_ _ _ _VII_ , the closing of the
Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 10:00 a.m., Dallas, Texas
time, on the second (2nd) business day after the satisfaction or waiver (to
the extent permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in
_ARTICLE VII_ , excluding those conditions that, by their terms, cannot be
satisfied until the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the
extent permitted by applicable Law) of such conditions at the Closing, at the
offices of McDermott Will and Emery LLP, 2501 N. Harwood Street, Suite 1900,
Dallas, Texas 75201, unless another date, time or place is agreed to in
writing by the Company and Parent. The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."

Section 1.03. _Effective Time of the Merger_. Subject to the provisions of
this Agreement, concurrently with the Closing, the parties shall cause a
certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed and
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware
Secretary of State_ ") in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
DGCL and shall make all other filings and recordings required under the DGCL.
The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger
has been duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State or at such later date
or time as may be agreed by the Company and Parent in writing and specified in
the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL (the effective time of
the Merger being hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.04.  _Effects of the Merger; Further Action_. From and after the
Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement
and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the
properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities
and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities
and duties of the Surviving Corporation. If at any time after the Effective
Time any further action is necessary to vest in the Surviving Corporation the
title to all property or rights of Merger Sub or the Company, the authorized
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized in
the name of Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be, to take, and shall
take, any and all such necessary and lawful action.

 

Section 1.05. _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_. At the Effective Time,
(a) the certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended and
restated to read in its entirety as set forth in _Exhibit_ _ _ _A_ hereto and,
as so amended and restated, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended or repealed, subject to the
limitations set forth in _Section_ _ _ _6.05_ , in accordance with its terms
and applicable Law, and (b) the bylaws of the Company shall be amended and
restated to read in their entirety as set forth in _Exhibit_ _ _ _B_ hereto
and, as so amended and restated, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation, until thereafter amended or repealed, subject to the limitations
set forth in  _Section_ _ _ _6.05_ , in accordance with the terms thereof and
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and applicable
Law.

 

Section 1.06. _Directors and Officers_. The directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation following the Merger, and the officers of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the
Surviving Corporation following the Merger, in each case, until their 

 



2  respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until
their earlier death, incapacitation, retirement, resignation or removal in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.

ARTICLE II

 

CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

Section 2.01. _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub or any holder of any shares of capital stock of the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub:

(a) _Common Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation, and all such shares shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and
after the Effective Time, all certificates that, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, represented the common stock of Merger Sub shall, without the
necessity of presenting the same for exchange, be deemed for all purposes to
represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation
into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence.

(b) _Cancellation of Certain Company Common Stock_. Each share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_
") that is held by the Company in treasury, that is owned, directly or
indirectly, by any wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company or that is owned,
directly or indirectly, by Parent, Merger Sub or any other subsidiary of
Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding
and shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no cash or
other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor
(collectively, " _Cancelled Shares_ ").

 

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to the provisions of this
_Section_ _ _ _2.01_ , each share of Company Common Stock (other than
Cancelled Shares and other than Appraisal Shares), issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically cancelled and
shall cease to exist and be converted into the right to receive $22.34 per
share in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable without interest, to
the holder of such share, upon surrender, in the manner provided in _Section_
_ _ _2.04_ , of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
evidenced such share (a " _Certificate_ ") (or, if such share is held in book-
entry or other uncertificated form, upon the entry through a book-entry
transfer agent of the surrender of such share on a book-entry statement; it
being understood that any references herein to " _Certificates_ " shall be
deemed to include references to book-entry account statements relating to the
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock).

 

Section 2.02. _Treatment of Options and Other Equity-Based Awards_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, (i) each option to acquire shares of Company Common
Stock held by any person (a " _Company Option_ "), whether or not granted
under the CompanyÂ’s 2010 Equity Compensation Plan (the " _Equity Compensation
Plan_ "), including without

 



3  limitation, any Assumed Option (as defined in the Equity Compensation Plan),
and whether or not vested and exercisable, that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be automatically cancelled
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, and (ii) each Company
Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective
Time and by its terms has vested prior to the Effective Time or will vest
immediately prior to or upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, shall be
converted into the right to receive from Parent or the Surviving Corporation
as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (and in all events, not
later than the later of (x) five (5) business days thereafter and (y) the end
of the first payroll period ending after the Effective Time) an amount in cash
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price of such Company Option,
by (B) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock that were
issuable upon exercise or settlement of such Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time (such product, the " _Option Cash Payment_ "),
payable without interest, to the holder of such Company Option; _provided_ ,
that if the per share exercise price of any such Company Option equals or
exceeds the Merger Consideration, the holder thereof shall not be entitled to
an Option Cash Payment in respect of such Company Option. From and after the
Effective Time, all Company Options shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically terminate and cease to exist, and each holder of a
Company Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
solely in respect of vested Company Options the right to receive the Option
Cash Payment, if any. Company Options that remain unvested at the Effective
Time shall be cancelled in their entirety and no amounts shall be paid to the
holder thereof.

 

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock awarded that is subject to a
restriction that has not lapsed or other vesting conditions that
remain unsatisfied as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each such
share shall be referred to as a share of " _Company Restricted Stock_ ") and
that is granted under the Equity Compensation Plan, including shares of
Company Restricted Stock granted under the Equity Compensation Plan as
required under the terms of the USMD Salary Deferral Plan, whether or not
subject to any restriction or vested, that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall become fully vested immediately prior to the
Effective Time without any action on the part of the holder thereof, and the
restrictions thereon shall lapse immediately prior to the Effective Time. All
such shares of Company Restricted Stock shall be treated as outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock for purposes of _Section_ _ _ _2.01(c)_. Any
Merger Consideration payable with respect to such shares of Company Restricted
Stock shall be paid out of the Payment Fund in accordance with _Section_ _ _
_2.04_ (less any required Tax withholdings).

(c) Immediately after the Effective Time, Parent shall provide or cause to be
provided to the Surviving Corporation cash in an amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate Option Cash Payments.

 

(d) All payments provided to holders of Company Options pursuant to this
_Section_ _ _ _2.02_ shall be made through ParentÂ’s and the Surviving
CorporationÂ’s payroll systems, subject to withholding in accordance with the
provisions of _Section_ _ _ _2.04(g)_.

 

(e) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement and
in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board shall take all
requisite action, including adopting such resolutions and such other actions
that are necessary to effectuate the treatment of Company Options and shares
of Company Restricted Stock pursuant to this  _Section_ _ _ _2.02_.

 



4 Section 2.03. _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares) that are
held by any holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of
such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section_ _ _ _262_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in 
_Section_ _ _ _2.01(c)_ , but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment
of the fair value of such shares (the " _Appraisal Shares_ ") as shall be
determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 262. From and after
the Effective Time, each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of
such Appraisal Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to properly
perfect or otherwise shall effectively waive, withdraw or otherwise lose the
right to appraisal and payment under, or a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by, Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair
value of such holderÂ’s Appraisal Shares under Section 262 shall cease and each
of such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (as provided
in _Section_ _ _ _2.04(g)_ , less any required Tax withholdings), payable
without interest, as provided in _Section_ _ _ _2.01(c)_ , upon surrender of
a Certificate or proper documentary evidence pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _2.04_
, and such shares shall not be deemed to be Appraisal Shares. The Company
shall give prompt written notice to Parent of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal rights in respect of any shares of Company Common Stock,
and Parent shall have the right to participate in and reasonably direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the
prior consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect
to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

 

Section 2.04. _Exchange and Payment_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) appoint
Computershare Trust Company, N.A., to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ")
for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of the Certificates
in accordance with this _ARTICLE II_ and (ii) enter into a paying agent
agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company and
Parent, with the Paying Agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this _ARTICLE II_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, in trust for
the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock, cash in an amount
sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for all
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares or Appraisal Shares), payable
upon due surrender of the Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this
_ARTICLE II_ (such cash in the aggregate being referred to as the "
_Payment Fund_ "). Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, pending payment thereof by
the Paying Agent to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that 

 



5  such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United
States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the
full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by MoodyÂ’s Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and PoorÂ’s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements, or bankerÂ’s acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of
such bank that are then publicly available). Earnings from such investments
shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Surviving Corporation, and no
part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of the CompanyÂ’s
stockholders. In the event any Appraisal Shares cease to be Appraisal Shares,
Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent in the
Payment Fund, an amount equal to the product of (A) the Merger Consideration
multiplied by (B) the number of such formerly Appraisal Shares. Parent shall
promptly replace any portion of the Payment Fund, as necessary, so as to
ensure that it is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make
prompt payment of the Merger Consideration. The Payment Fund shall not be used
for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement.

 

(b) _Termination of Payment Fund_. The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
at any time after the 180th day following the first anniversary of the
Effective Time to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the
Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the former holders of shares of
Company Common Stock, and any such former holders who have not
surrendered their Certificate (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) in accordance with this _Section_ _ _ _2.04_ prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon due surrender of their
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), in each case,
subject to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any net profit
resulting from, or interest or income produced by, the Payment Fund shall be
payable to the Surviving Corporation.

(c) _Exchange and Payment Procedures_. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, and in any event not later than the third (3rd) business day
following the Closing Date, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail (and to make available for collection by hand) to
each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates held by such person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates (or affidavits of loss together with any required bond or
indemnity in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent, shall be in customary form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Paying Agent, subject to
the CompanyÂ’s approval (not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or
delayed), and shall be prepared prior to Closing) and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration into which such shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by such Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to this
Agreement. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or effective affidavits of
loss together with any required bond or indemnity in lieu thereof) for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by the Surviving Corporation, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto (or, if such shares of Company Common Stock are held in
book-entry or other uncertificated form, upon the entry through a book-entry
transfer agent of the surrender of such shares on a book-entry account
statement), and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate (or effective affidavit of loss
in lieu thereof) shall be

 



6  entitled to receive from the Payment Fund in exchange therefor an amount in
cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such holderÂ’s properly surrendered Certificate (or
effective affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) and (ii) the Merger Consideration
(less any applicable withholding Taxes), and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Company Common Stock that is not registered in the share transfer books of the
Company, the proper portion of the Merger Consideration may be paid in
exchange therefor to a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting
such payment shall pay any transfer and other applicable Taxes required
by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than
the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is
not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any amount
payable upon due surrender of any Certificate (or any effective affidavit of
loss in lieu thereof).

 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock; Share Transfer
Books_. Until duly surrendered as contemplated by  _Section_ _ _ _2.04(c)_ ,
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender an amount in cash
equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such holderÂ’s properly surrendered Certificate (or
effective affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) and (ii) the Merger Consideration
(less any applicable withholding Taxes), without any interest thereon, and
the holders of Certificates shall not have any rights as stockholders of the
Company. All cash paid upon the due surrender of a Certificate (or any
effective affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) in accordance with the terms of
this  _ARTICLE_ _ _ _II_ shall be deemed to have been paid at the Effective
Time in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company
Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate. At the Effective
Time, the share transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the share transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason, the holder of Certificates
shall be given a copy of the letter of transmittal referred to in _Section_ _
_ _2.04(c)_ and instructed to comply with the instructions in that letter of
transmittal in order to receive the cash to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to this  _ARTICLE_ _ _ _II_.

(e) _No Liability_. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other
person shall be liable to any person in respect of any portion of the Payment
Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(f) _Lost, Stolen, Defaced or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact reasonably acceptable to the Surviving Corporation by
the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed
and, if required by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, the
posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable and customary amount as
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in

 



7  respect of such lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed Certificate an amount in
cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such holderÂ’s properly surrendered Certificate (or
effective affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) and (ii) the Merger Consideration
(less any applicable withholding Taxes), without any interest thereon.

 

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
otherwise payable to any person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the " _Code_ ") or any
provision of any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld, such amounts shall (i) shall
be remitted by the applicable entity to the appropriate Governmental
Authority and (ii) be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having
been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

 

Section 2.05. _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this
Agreement, if, at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company, or securities convertible into or exchangeable
into or exercisable for shares of such capital stock, shall occur, including
by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including
reverse stock split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment
of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date
during such period, merger or similar transaction, the Merger Consideration
and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect such change and such adjustment shall
provide the CompanyÂ’s stockholders with the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such change; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing in this _Section_ _ _ _2.05_ shall be deemed to permit or
authorize the Company to effect any such change that it is not otherwise
authorized or permitted to undertake pursuant to this Agreement, including
pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _5.01_.

schedules, declarations, statements, applications and other documents
required to be filed with or furnished to the SEC by it prior to the date
hereof and since July 1, 2013 (collectively, in each case as may have been
amended since their filing, the " _Company Reports_ "), each of which, as of
their respective effective dates or filing dates, as applicable, and as
amended prior to the date of this Agreement, complied in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Securities Act_ "), the
Exchange Act, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_
"), each as in effect on the date such Company Report was so filed or
effective. Except to the extent that any information in any Company Report has
been revised or superseded by a Company Report filed prior to the date hereof,
none of the Company Reports (including any financial statements or 

 



12  schedules included therein), when filed or furnished, contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. None of the CompanyÂ’s subsidiaries is required to
file any forms, reports or documents with the SEC under the Exchange Act. As
of the date of this Agreement, there are no unresolved comments received by
the Company from the Staff of the SEC with respect to any of the Company
Reports.

consolidated interim financial statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments and the absence of notes not required by GAAP) and (iii) fairly
presents in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the
Company and its subsidiaries as of the date thereof and the consolidated
results of operations and cash flows of the Company and its subsidiaries for
the period then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited interim Financial

the aggregate, were not, and would not be reasonably expected to be,
material).

(c) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the
Exchange Act) sufficient for the Company and its subsidiaries to comply in all
material respects with all applicable legal and accounting requirements
required by Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act; such
disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that
material information relating to the Company, including its
consolidated subsidiaries, required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC
rules and forms, and that all such material information is accumulated and
communicated to the CompanyÂ’s principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and
to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding the CompanyÂ’s and each of its subsidiariesÂ’
disclosure controls and procedures. With respect to each Annual Report on Form
10-K, each Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and each amendment of any such
report included in the Company Reports filed after the effective date of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the principal executive officer and the principal
financial officer of the Company (or each former principal executive officer
and each former principal financial officer of the Company) have made all
certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any related rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC. The Company has disclosed, based on its
most recent evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures prior to the
date hereof, to the CompanyÂ’s auditors and the audit committee of the Company
Board (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
or operation of internal controls over financial reporting which, at the time
of such disclosure, were then reasonably likely to adversely affect in any
material respect the CompanyÂ’s

 



13  ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and
(ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that, at the time of such disclosure,
involved management or other employees who then had a significant role in the
CompanyÂ’s internal controls over financial reporting. As used herein, the

assigned to them in Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing
Standard 2, as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

subsidiary of the Company, (iv) for liabilities or obligations that have been
discharged or paid in full, (v) for liabilities and obligations (other than

of the Company has incurred any liabilities or obligations of any nature
that, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether or not such
liabilities or obligations would be required by GAAP to be recognized or
disclosed on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its subsidiaries
or in the notes thereto.

consistent with past practice, except in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby,

properties or rights of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, any of the executive officers or directors of the

or inaccurate in any material respect at any time from the date hereof to the
Effective Time, only to the extent that such breach would reasonably be
expected to result in any of the conditions to the obligations of Parent and

that such notice shall not be deemed to (i) modify or cure any breach of any

(a) Subject to and in accordance with the Company Organizational Documents and
applicable Laws, including Section 228 and Section 251(c) of the DGCL,
immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
parties hereto, the Company shall seek to obtain as promptly as practicable,
and in any event, on or before 5:00 p.m., Dallas, Texas time, on the day
immediately following the date of this Agreement (the " _Stockholder Approval
Deadline_ "), an irrevocable written consent from Ventures in substantially
the form attached to this Agreement as  _Exhibit_ _ _ _C_ in order to satisfy
the Common Stockholder Approval in lieu of a meeting pursuant to Section 228
of the DGCL (such written consent, as duly executed and delivered by Ventures,
the " _Ventures Consent_ ") for the purpose of adopting this Agreement.
Promptly following the receipt by the Company of the Ventures Consent, if
delivered to the Company from Ventures, the Company shall deliver to Parent a
copy of the executed Ventures Consent (including by facsimile or other
electronic image scan transmission).

(b) If the Ventures Consent is obtained and delivered to Parent before the
Stockholder Approval Deadline, as soon as reasonably practicable, and in any
event within ten (10) days,

 



39  thereafter, the Company shall, with the assistance of Parent, giving good
faith consideration to ParentÂ’s comments, prepare and file with the SEC an
information statement in preliminary form of the type contemplated by Rule
14c-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act related to the Merger and this
Agreement (including therein a notice of appraisal rights in accordance with
Section 262(d) of the DGCL and the notices of action by written consent
required by Section 228(e) of the DGCL) (collectively, as amended or
supplemented, the " _Information Statement_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if, and only if, an Alternative Approval Determination is made, as soon as
reasonably practicable thereafter, the Company shall, with the assistance of
Parent, giving good faith consideration to ParentÂ’s comments, and in lieu of
the Information Statement, prepare and file with the SEC preliminary proxy
materials constituting the Proxy Statement and shall take, in accordance with
the Company Organizational Documents and applicable Laws, all reasonable
actions necessary to seek the Common Stockholder Approval, as mutually agreed
by the Company and Parent, by either: (1) soliciting the written consent of
the CompanyÂ’s stockholders by proxy (the " _Company Stockholders Consent_ ")
or (2) soliciting the vote of the CompanyÂ’s stockholder at a meeting of the
CompanyÂ’s stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ "). Unless the
Company Board has made a Change in Board Recommendation in accordance with
_Section_ _ _ _6.03_ , the Company shall include the Company Board
Recommendation in any Proxy Statement filed by the Company in accordance
herewith.

(c) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have the
Information Statement or Proxy Statement, as applicable, cleared by the SEC as
promptly as practicable and shall thereafter file with the SEC and mail to the
Company stockholders as promptly as practicable the definitive Information
Statement or Proxy Statement, as applicable, and all other materials required
for obtaining either the Company Stockholders Consent or holding the Company
Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall (i) use its commercially reasonable
efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments
received from the SEC or any required amendments with respect to the
preliminary Information Statement or Proxy Statement, as applicable, and
resolve such comments with the SEC, and (ii) as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date on which the Company files the definitive
Information Statement or Proxy Statement, as applicable, in compliance with
the Exchange Act, cause such filing to be mailed to the stockholders of the
Company. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall furnish all
information concerning itself and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as may be reasonably requested by the SEC in connection with the
preparation, filing and distribution of an Information Statement or a Proxy
Statement, as applicable. The Company shall notify Parent and Merger Sub
promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any
request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the
Information Statement or Proxy Statement, as applicable, or for additional
information and shall consult with Parent and Merger Sub regarding, and supply
Parent and Merger Sub with copies of, all correspondence between the Company
and its officers, directors, employees, accountants, consultants, auditors,
counsel, financial advisors and other agents and representatives
(collectively, " _Representatives_ "), on the one hand, and the SEC and its
staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Information Statement or Proxy
Statement, as applicable. Prior to filing or mailing any proposed amendment of
or supplement to the Information Statement or Proxy Statement, as applicable,
or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company
shall (x) provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
such document or response and (y) give reasonable consideration to all
additions, deletions or changes 

 



40  suggested thereto by Parent and its legal counsel. If at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholders Consent or the Company Stockholders Meeting
any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
affiliates, is discovered by the Company or Parent that should be set forth in
an amendment or supplement to the Information Statement or Proxy Statement, as
applicable, so that such filing shall not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, or as
otherwise required by applicable Law or any applicable rules or regulations
of Nasdaq, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the
other parties, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information promptly shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required
by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company, in each case as and
to the extent required by applicable Law or any applicable rules or
regulations of Nasdaq.

 

(d) If an Alternative Approval Determination is made, the Company shall seek
the Company Stockholders Consent unless the Company and Parent mutually
determine, in good faith, that seeking the Company Stockholders Consent may be
reasonably expected to be adverse to the Company or otherwise delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in which case
the Company shall hold a Company Stockholders Meeting in accordance herewith.
If there is an Alternative Approval Determination and the parties have
determined (and such determination is made in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence) to hold a Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company,
acting through the Company Board, shall promptly and duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold as soon as reasonably practicable following confirmation
by the SEC that the SEC has no further comments to the Proxy Statement a
Company Stockholders Meeting, and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to solicit and obtain the Common Stockholder Approval at such Company
Stockholders Meeting. Subject to termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.01_ , if there is an Alternative Approval Determination and the
parties have determined (and such determination is made in accordance with the
first sentence of this _Section 6.01(d)_ ) to seek the Company
Stockholders Consent and such Company Stockholders Consent is not obtained,
the Company shall be required to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting and
comply with its other obligations under this Agreement regardless of whether
the Company Board has effected a Change in Board Recommendation (as defined
in _Section 6.03(c)_ ) in accordance with _Section 6.03(c)_. Notwithstanding
any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Company may, after
consultation with Parent, determine to adjourn, recess or postpone the
Company Stockholders Meeting (i) to the extent required by Law or fiduciary
duty, (ii) to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or
amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the stockholders of
the Company within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, (iii) if, as of the time for which the Company
Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement), there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business of the Company Stockholders Meeting, solely for the purpose of
obtaining, and for the time reasonably necessary to obtain, such a quorum, or
(iv) if, as of the time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement), sufficient votes
to constitute the Common Stockholder Approval have not been obtained,
solely for the purpose of soliciting, and for the time reasonably necessary
to solicit, additional proxies and votes to obtain Common Stockholder
Approval.

 

(e) All documents that the Company, Parent or Merger Sub are responsible for
filing with the SEC in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
shall comply in all material respects with the requirements of applicable Law,
including the Exchange Act.

negotiation and execution of this Agreement or any Acquisition Proposals (it

Company shall not be required to afford such access if such access would
reasonably be likely to (i) unreasonably disrupt or interfere with the
business or operations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) violate
the terms of the Clean Room Agreement or any other Contract to which the
Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party (provided that, in the case of
the other Contracts, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain consent of the counterparties to provide access to such other
Contracts), (iii) cause a risk of loss of attorney/client privilege or trade
secret protection to the Company or any of its subsidiaries (provided that the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to develop an
alternative to providing such information reasonably acceptable to
Parent), (iv) disclose any confidential competitive information of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates (except pursuant to, and in

purpose of transition planning and to enable Parent to make presentations to,
and discuss with, certain employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, as
reasonably determined and agreed to by the Company and Parent, ParentÂ’s plans
and strategies for post-Closing operations subject to necessary antitrust
safeguards. The Company shall have the right to have a Representative present
at all meetings between Parent and its Representatives and any employees of
the Company and its subsidiaries. Any such meetings shall be conducted in such
a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of
the Company or its subsidiaries or otherwise unreasonably interfere with the
prompt and timely discharge by such employees of the Company and its
subsidiaries of their normal duties. Parent shall not provide any written
information or written materials to any employees of the Company and its
subsidiaries at any such meetings or otherwise without the prior written
consent of the Company.

results for any period after the date of this Agreement prior to making any
such financial results publicly available and (ii) any report or document
(other than reports under Section 16 of the Exchange Act) to be filed with the
SEC after the date of this Agreement prior to any such filing, it being
understood that, in either case, Parent shall have no liability solely by
reason of being provided with any such documents. Parent shall maintain the
confidentiality of all such information until such information is otherwise
made public by the Company.

all information provided pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _6.02(a)_ , _Section_ _ _
_6.02(b)_ and Section 6.02(c), in confidence to the extent required by, and in
accordance with, the provisions of that certain agreement, dated September
16, 2015, between Optum, Inc. and the Company (the " _Non-Disclosure

(a) Subject to _Section_ _ _ _6.03(b)_ , _Section_ _ _ _6.03(c)_ ,  _Section_
_ _ _6.03(d)_ , _Section_ _ _ _6.03(e)_ , and _Section_ _ _ _6.03(f)_ , until
the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to  _Section_ _ _ _8.01_ , the Company shall (x) not, and shall not
permit any of its subsidiaries, its subsidiariesÂ’ officers or directors, the
senior management-level employees or above, or the Financial Advisor
to (collectively with the Company, the " _Company Non-Solicit Parties_ "),
and (y) direct its and its subsidiariesÂ’ Representatives (other than
Representatives that are Company Non-Solicit Parties) (collectively, the "
_Other Non-Solicit Parties_ " and together with the Company Non-Solicit
Parties, the " _Non-Solicit Parties_ ") not to (and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts in respect thereof), directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
initiate, or knowingly take any action to encourage or facilitate the making
or completion of any Acquisition Proposal or the making of any proposal that
would reasonably be expected to lead to the making or completion of any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into, conduct, engage or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
person any non-public material information relating to the Company or any of
its subsidiaries, or knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate or
encourage any effort by, any third party that is seeking to make, or has made,
any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve any transaction under, or any third
party becoming an "interested stockholder" under, Section 203 of the DGCL,

term sheet, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other Contract relating to the
making or completion of any Acquisition Proposal or (v) propose publicly to do
any of the foregoing related to an Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the
ability of the Non-Solicit Parties to take actions described in _Section_ _ _
_6.03(b)_ , the Company shall cause the Company Non-Solicit Parties, and shall
direct the Other Non-Solicit Parties to immediately cease and cause to be
terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any person conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Subject to _Section_ _ _
_6.03(b)_ and _Section_ _ _ _6.03(c)_ , the Company shall not furnish
any non-public information relating to the Company, or afford access to the
books and records or Representatives of the Company, to any third party that
is seeking to or may make, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, and, if
requested in writing by Parent, shall

 



43  use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such third party (or
its agents or advisors) already in possession of non-public information in
respect of the Company or its subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf
of the Company or its subsidiaries to return or destroy (and confirm
destruction of) all such information; _provided_ , that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall not be required to cease furnishing, or cause
any third party to destroy, information to any third party to the extent any
such information has been or is hereafter provided in connection with the
CompanyÂ’s or its subsidiariesÂ’ _bona fide_ business relationship with such
third party (including if such third party is a customer, supplier or partner
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries); _provided_ , that the Company
determines in good faith that any such information so provided is
not reasonably expected to be used in connection with an Acquisition Proposal
and, in the case of third party relationships existing prior to or as of the
date hereof, such information is consistent with information historically
provided to such third party and in the case of new relationships, consistent
with the types of information historically provided to similar third parties.
The Company shall not terminate, waive, amend, release or modify any material
provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any
of its subsidiaries is a party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section_ _ _ _6.03_ shall
prohibit the Company from rendering inapplicable, exempting or taking any
action to render inapplicable or exempt any person from any standstill
agreement or similar arrangement, or the provisions of any Takeover Statute,
to permit such person to make an Acquisition Proposal and engage in
negotiations with respect to such proposal, subject to the other provisions of
this _Section_ _ _ _6.03_ , _provided_ , that the Company Board determines
(upon recommendation of the Special Committee and after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties or obligations under
applicable Law.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section_ _ _ _6.03(a)_ , and
subject to  _Section_ _ _ _6.03(c)_ , if at any time during the Applicable
Period the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal from any person that did
not result from or arise in connection with a material breach of  _Section_ _
_ _6.03(a)_ , and the Company Board determines in good faith (upon
recommendation of the Special Committee and after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be
expected to result in a Superior Proposal, then the Non-Solicit Parties may
(i) negotiate and enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such
person, (ii) furnish information and data (including any non-public
information) regarding, and afford access to, officers, employees, agents,
properties, offices and facilities and to the books, personnel, Contracts and
records of the Company and its subsidiaries to such person and its
representatives pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; and (iii)
enter into, maintain and participate in discussions or negotiations with such
person and its representatives with respect to such Acquisition Proposal or
otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in, or facilitate, any such
discussions or negotiations. The parties agree that nothing in this Agreement
shall prevent the Non-Solicit Parties, following receipt of an Acquisition
Proposal from a person, from (x) contacting such person solely in order to
request clarification of the terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal
made by such person to the extent necessary to determine whether
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to
result in a Superior Proposal or (y) directing any persons to this Agreement.

 



44 (c) The Company Non-Solicit Parties may not (and shall direct the Other Non-
Solicit Parties not to (and shall use commercially reasonable efforts in
respect thereof) take the actions described in _Section_ _ _ _6.03(b)(ii)_ -
_(iii)_ unless:

 

(i) the Company has (A) previously received from such person an executed
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (B) previously (or within one
business day following disclosure to such other person) made available to
Parent any non-public information to be provided to such person to the extent
not previously provided to Parent;

 

(ii) the Company Board has determined in good faith, upon recommendation from
the Special Committee and (A) after consultation with its outside financial
and legal advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a
Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal and
(B) after consultation with its legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directorsÂ’
fiduciary duties or obligations under applicable Law; and

 

(iii) the Company has delivered to Parent written notice prior to taking any
such action described in  _Section_ _ _ _6.03(b)(ii)_ - _(iii)_ (A) stating
that the Company Board intends to take such action and (B) including a copy of
such Acquisition Proposal (including any materials relating to such
personÂ’s proposed equity and debt financing, if any, but excluding the
identity of (and specifically identifying information regarding) such person)
and an executed copy of the Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(d) Except as set forth in _Section_ _ _ _6.03(e)_ , the Company and/or the
Company Board, as applicable, shall not:

 

(i) (A) withhold, amend, withdraw (or modify or qualify in any material
respect) the Company Board Recommendation, (B) adopt, approve or recommend to
stockholders the adoption of any Acquisition Proposal, (C) publicly propose to
take any such actions described in the foregoing _clauses_ _ _ _(A)_ and _(B)_
, or (D) following public disclosure of an Acquisition Proposal during the
Applicable Period, fail to publicly confirm the Company Board Recommendation
promptly, and in any event within ten (10) business days after such
Acquisition Proposal has been publicly disclosed, and within five (5)
business days after Parent so requests in writing thereafter (it being
understood that the Company will have no obligation to make such reaffirmation
on more than two (2) separate occasions) (each such action set forth in this
_Section 6.03(d)(i)_ being referred to herein as a " _Change in Board
Recommendation_ "); or

 

(ii) enter into, or permit the Company to enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other agreement constituting or directly related to, or which is
intended to or is reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal
(other than any Acceptable Confidentiality Agreements entered into in
accordance with _Section_ _ _ _6.03(b)(i)_ ) or require the Company to
abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger and other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



45 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
during the Applicable Period (and, for the avoidance of doubt, only during
such period), the Company Board may make a Change in Board Recommendation if
and only if (x) the Company Board determines that, subject to complying with 
_Section_ _ _ _6.03(e)(i)_ Â– _Section_ _ _ _6.03(e)(iii)_ , an Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or (y) subject to complying with
_Section_ _ _ _6.03(e)(i)_ Â–  _Section_ _ _ _6.03(e)(iii)_ , an Intervening
Event has occurred and is continuing, solely to the extent that with respect
to the prior clauses (x) or (y), the Company Board has determined (upon
recommendation of the Special Committee and after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with
the directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties or obligations under applicable Law. The
Company Board may not make a Change in Board Recommendation as described in
_Section_ _ _ _6.03(d)_ unless:

(i) the Company has (1) given Parent at least six (6) business daysÂ’ prior
written notice of its intention to make a Change in Board Recommendation,
which written notice shall state that the Company Board has determined the
existence of a Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event, and shall provide,
as applicable, (x) the identity of the person making such Superior Proposal
(including the identity of such personÂ’s proposed equity financing sources), a
description of the material terms of such Superior Proposal, and unredacted
(other than with respect to any financing fees) copies of the proposed
agreements and equity financing commitments, and any amendments or
modifications thereto, or (y) a summary describing, in all material respects,
the Intervening Event; and (2) during such six (6) business day period,
negotiated, (and has directed the Other Non-Solicit Parties to negotiate (and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts in respect thereof)), in good faith
with Parent and its affiliates and their respective representatives (to the
extent Parent desires to negotiate) regarding an amendment of this Agreement
so that the Company Board would no longer be permitted to make a Change in
Board Recommendation;

 

(ii) during such six (6) business day period, either (1) Parent shall not have
proposed written revisions, binding on Parent upon acceptance by the Company,
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement or (2) if Parent shall have
proposed written revisions, binding on Parent upon acceptance by the Company,
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board shall have
determined (upon recommendation of the Special Committee and after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) that in the case of a Superior Proposal, the
third partyÂ’s Acquisition Proposal remains a Superior Proposal with respect
to ParentÂ’s revised written proposal, or in the case of an Intervening Event,
such Intervening Event is continuing; and

 

(iii) the Company shall keep Parent reasonably and promptly informed of the
status and any material developments with respect to any such Acquisition
Proposal or Intervening Event.

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section_ _ _ _6.03_ shall prohibit the Company
from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state
securities Laws with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, including taking and
disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14e-2(a) or
14d-9 under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to stockholders) or
(ii) making any disclosure to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders, if, in the good

 



46  faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, failure to do so would be inconsistent with the Company BoardÂ’s
fiduciary duties or obligations or constitute a violation of disclosure
requirements under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that a factually
accurate public statement by the Company that describes the CompanyÂ’s receipt
of an Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect
thereto (and no other material communication other than as contemplated by the
foregoing as to receipt and operation), or any disclosure that constitutes a
"stop, look and listen" communication of the type contemplated by Section
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (and no other material communication other
than as contemplated by Section 14d-9(f)) or similar communication to the
stockholders of the Company, shall not constitute a Change in Board
Recommendation (including for purposes of _Section_ _ _ _6.03(e)(ii)_ ) or an
approval or recommendation with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and the
Company considers in good faith comments from Parent with respect to such
statement or disclosure (to the extent reasonably practicable based on the
time required to make such statement or disclosure and other relevant
circumstances).

 

Section 6.04. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Except as contemplated herein, from the Effective Time through the first
anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall provide or cause to be
provided to each Company Employee who remains in the employment of Parent or
any of its subsidiaries immediately following the Effective Time (a "
_Continuing Employee_ "): (i) a base salary or wages and cash
bonus opportunities (other than any retention or other special or non-
recurring bonus or cash awards) that are no less favorable, in the aggregate,
to those that were provided to the Continuing Employee immediately before the
Effective Time; and (ii) employee benefits (other than any retention, change
of control, equity-based compensation, or other special or non-recurring bonus
or cash awards) that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those
provided to the Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) Parent shall ensure that Continuing Employees receive credit (for purposes
of eligibility to participate and vesting, but not for defined benefit
pension benefit accrual or participation, retiree medical, or for purposes of
any equity compensation program) for service with the Company and its
subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (to the same extent such service
credit was granted under the Company Plans) under the comparable employee
benefit plans, programs and policies of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
any of their subsidiaries in which such employees become participants (the "
_Parent Employee Plans_ "), as if such service had been performed with Parent
or any of its subsidiaries, except to the extent that such service crediting
would result in duplication of benefits for the same period of service and
for purposes of any nonqualified retirement plan. In addition, Parent shall
ensure that: (i) each Continuing Employee shall be eligible to participate,
without any waiting time, in any and all Parent Employee Plans
providing group health benefits to the extent such Parent Employee Plans
replace coverage under a similar or comparable Company Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participated immediately before such replacement, (ii) for
purposes of each Parent Employee Plan providing group health benefits to any
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, any pre-existing
conditions or limitations, evidence of insurability, actively-at-work or
similar requirements and eligibility waiting periods shall be waived with
respect to such Continuing Employees and his or her covered dependents; and
(iii) each Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents shall receive
full credit under Parent Employee 

 



47  PlanÂ’s for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs towards
applicable deductibles, co-insurance and annual out-of-pocket limits for
expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time under the Company Plans in the
Company PlanÂ’s plan year in existence at the Effective Time; _provided_ that
the Surviving Corporation provides Parent with the information reasonably
required to process such information, and Parent, as the sole stockholder of
the Surviving Corporation, shall reasonably facilitate the provision of such
information, to the extent available. Nothing in this _Section_ _ _ _6.04(b)_
is intended to amend any employee benefit plans, obligate Parent to maintain
any particular employee benefit plan or arrangement, or prevent Parent from
modifying or terminating any employee benefit plans in a manner permissible
under the terms thereof.

 

(c) Nothing contained in this _Section_ _ _ _6.04_ , express or implied (i)
shall be construed to establish, amend, or modify any Parent Employee Plan,
program, agreement or arrangement or (ii) is intended to confer upon any
person (including Continuing Employees, retirees, or dependents or
beneficiaries of employees or retirees) any rights as a third-
party beneficiary of this Agreement.

(d) If requested in writing by Parent at least ten (10) business days prior to
the anticipated Closing Date, on or prior to Closing, the Company and its
applicable subsidiaries shall adopt written resolutions of the applicable
board of directors in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent providing for
the termination of each Company Plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code (the " _Company_ _ _ _401(k)_ _ _ _Plan_ "), to cease contributions to
the Company 401(k) Plan and to one hundred percent (100%) vest all
participants under the Company 401(k) Plan, such termination and vesting to be
effective no later than the business day preceding the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company 401(k) Plan termination may be made
contingent upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 6.05. _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) The Surviving Corporation, Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses existing as of the
date hereof in favor of the current or former directors, officers or
employees, as the case may be, of the Company or its subsidiaries as provided
in the Company Organizational Documents shall survive the Merger, be honored
by the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries and shall continue in full
force and effect. For a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date, the
Company (and following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation)
shall maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses provisions of the respective certificates of incorporation and bylaws
or similar organizational or governing documents of the Company and its
subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or in any
indemnification agreements of the Company or its subsidiaries with any of
their respective directors, officers or employees as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify
any such provisions except as either required by applicable Law or to make
changes permitted by applicable Law that would enhance the rights thereunder
of any individuals who at the Effective Time were current or
former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries to indemnification or advancement of expenses. From and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Company (and following the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation) and its subsidiaries to honor, in accordance
with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in this _Section_
_ _ _6.05_.

 



48 (b) Without limiting _Section_ _ _ _6.05(a)_ or any rights of any
Indemnified Party (as defined below) pursuant to any indemnification
arrangement, from and after the Closing through the sixth (6th) anniversary of
the date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent, the Company (and
following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) and their respective
subsidiaries shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each current and former
officer or director of the Company and its subsidiaries (each, taken together
with such personÂ’s heirs, executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified
Party_ "), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments,
inquiries, fines and reasonable and documented fees, costs and expenses,
including attorneysÂ’ fees, investigation expenses and disbursements
(collectively, " _Costs_ "), incurred in connection with any threatened or
actual Action directly or indirectly arising out of or pertaining to (i) the
fact that an Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director, employee,
fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or (ii) matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including any claim
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions and actions
contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under the Company
Organizational Documents and the DGCL. In the event of any such Action, each
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to the prompt advancement (and Parent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make or cause to be made such
advancement within ten (10) business days following a request, but in no
event shall such advancement be made later than thirty (30) days following any
such request) of expenses actually and reasonably incurred in the defense of
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from the Surviving
Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by the Company Organizational
Documents and the DGCL following request by the Indemnified Party therefor;
_provided_ that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the DGCL, to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined by final adjudication that such person
is not entitled to be indemnified by the Surviving Corporation as authorized
by the DGCL, (x) without limiting the foregoing, each Indemnified Party may
retain the CompanyÂ’s regularly engaged independent legal counsel (provided
that such engagement would not create or develop into a conflict for such
legal counsel under applicable rules of professional conduct) or other
counsel satisfactory to such Indemnified Party, subject to the consent of the
insurance carrier under the Tail Policy (if and to the extent required under
the Tail Policy), and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Party
promptly following receipt of statements therefor; _provided_ _that_ , Parent
shall not be required to pay the fees and expenses of more than one (1) legal
counsel to represent the Indemnified Parties in connection with a specific
Action or series of factually related Actions unless the engagement of one (1)
legal counsel to represent all Indemnified Parties in such Action(s) would
create, or reasonably be expected to develop into, a conflict under
applicable Law or rules of professional conduct for such legal counsel, in
which case, the foregoing limitation on ParentÂ’s obligation to pay the fees
and expense of legal counsel shall not be applicable, and (y) none of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry
of any judgment in any threatened or actual Action (and in which
indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder), unless
such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of
such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Action or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing to such
settlement, compromise or consent and (z) Parent and the Surviving
Corporation

 



49  shall use commercially reasonable efforts to reasonably cooperate in the
defense of any matter for which the Indemnified Party could seek
indemnification hereunder, in each case at its own expense. With respect to
any determination of whether an Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification by the Company (and following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation) under this _Section_ _ _ _6.05(b)_ , the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to require that such determination be made by
special, independent legal counsel selected by the Indemnified Party, subject
to the consent of the insurance carrier under the Tail Policy (if and to the
extent required under the Tail Policy), and approved by the Company or
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and who has not otherwise
performed material services for Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates within the last three (3)
years; _provided_ _that_ Parent shall not be required to pay the fees and
expenses of more than one (1) special, independent legal counsel to determine
whether more than one Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under
this _Section_ _ _ _6.05(b)_ in connection with a specific Action or series of
factually related Actions unless the engagement of one (1) special,
independent legal counsel to make such determination for all such Indemnified
Parties would create, or reasonably be expected to develop into, a conflict
under applicable Law or rules of professional conduct for such legal counsel,
in which case, the foregoing limitation on ParentÂ’s obligation to pay the fees
and expense of special, independent legal counsel shall not be applicable.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a directorsÂ’ and
officersÂ’ liability insurance "tail" policy or "runoff" policy covering a
period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time (the " _Tail Policy_
") with respect to acts and omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective
Time, which policy (i) must include at least the same coverage as that which
currently exists for each Indemnified Party under the CompanyÂ’s current
directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance (on terms and conditions which
are not less advantageous to any beneficiary thereof) and (ii) shall be
purchased from the CompanyÂ’s current carrier or another carrier with a rating
no lower than the A.M. Best rating of A; _provided_ that the annual premium
for the Tail Policy does not exceed 300% of the aggregate premiums paid by
the Company for directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance in 2015. Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain the Tail Policy in full force and
effect and shall honor all obligations thereunder.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Action (whether
arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made against any
Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective
Time, the provisions of this _Section_ _ _ _6.05_ shall continue in full
force and effect until the final disposition of such Action.

(e) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall pay, or shall cause to be
paid, all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees, that may
be actually incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the obligations of
this _Section_ _ _ _6.05_ ; _provided_ that such Indemnified Party is the
prevailing party in any such Action.

(f) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition
to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may
have under the certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational
or governing documents of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or the
Surviving Corporation, any other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or
otherwise. Subsequent amendment, termination or repeal of the certificates of

 



50  incorporation, bylaws or other organizational or governing documents of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or of the Surviving Corporation shall not
diminish or impair the rights of any Indemnified Party. The provisions of
this _Section_ _ _ _6.05_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and
expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives.

(g) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume or succeed to the
obligations set forth in this  _Section_ _ _ _6.05_.

(h) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
and its subsidiaries shall honor and perform in all respects to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable Law, in accordance with their respective terms,
each of the covenants contained in this _Section_ _ _ _6.05_.

 

Section 6.06. _Regulatory Approvals and Other Matters_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and
except with respect to filings and approvals required pursuant to Antitrust
Laws, which are exclusively set forth in _Section_ _ _ _6.06(b)_ Â– _Section_ _
_ _6.06(c)_ , each party shall reasonably cooperate and use its respective
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) prepare promptly and file, as promptly
as practicable all necessary documentation, (ii) effect all necessary
applications, notices, petitions, filings and other documents, as promptly as
practicable or (iii) make or obtain all necessary Approvals from any
Governmental Authority and all other persons necessary or advisable to

consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all such necessary
or advisable Approvals. Each of Parent and the Company shall have the right to
review and approve in advance drafts of all such necessary applications,
notices, petitions, filings and other documents made or prepared in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Each party shall
promptly notify the other party of any failure or prospective failure to make
or obtain any such Approvals and shall provide, as promptly as practicable,
copies of all consents obtained by it.

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall (i) prepare and file any
notification and report forms and related material required under the HSR Act,

as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than five (5) business days
from the date hereof except by mutual consent confirmed in writing); (ii)
provide or cause to be provided as promptly as practicable any information and
documentary material that may be requested by the U.S. Department of Justice
(the " _DOJ_ ") or Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") under the HSR Act
or by any Governmental Authority with regulatory jurisdiction over enforcement
of any Antitrust Laws (each such Governmental Authority, a " _Governmental
Antitrust_  

 



51   __ _Authority_ "); and (iii) use their reasonable best efforts to secure as
promptly as is practicable the termination or expiration of any waiting
periods under any applicable Antitrust Law, to obtain the approval of any
Governmental Antitrust Authority, as applicable, for the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. Parent shall pay all filing fees under the
HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws. Subject to applicable Law prohibiting
or otherwise limiting the exchange of information, each of Parent and the
Company shall promptly inform each other of any material communication (or
other correspondence or memoranda) received from, or given to, the DOJ, the
FTC, or any other Governmental Antitrust Authority. Neither Parent nor the
Company shall commit to or agree with any Governmental Authority to stay, toll
or extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or any additional
applicable Antitrust Laws, without the prior written consent of the other.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, in no event shall Parent or any of its affiliates be required to,
nor shall the Company or any of its affiliates, without prior written consent
of Parent, (i) pay any sums or concede anything of value in excess of
$100,000, (ii) sell or otherwise dispose of, or hold separate and agree to
sell or otherwise dispose of, assets, categories of assets or businesses of
the Company or Parent or their respective subsidiaries or affiliates, or
otherwise take or commit to take any action that would reasonably limit
ParentÂ’s, the CompanyÂ’s or any of their respective affiliatesÂ’ freedom of

product lines or assets, (iii) terminate, modify or extend any existing
relationships and contractual rights and obligations of the Company or Parent

relationships and contractual rights and obligations of the Company or Parent
or their respective subsidiaries or affiliates, (v) terminate any relevant

Governmental Antitrust Authority) or (vii) litigate or defend against any
Action brought by a Governmental Antitrust Authority, including any Action
brought by a Governmental Antitrust Authority seeking a temporary restraining
order or an injunction challenging any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Laws. In addition, Parent and
its affiliates shall be permitted to acquire any equity interest in, acquire
all or substantially all of the assets of, merge, consolidate, enter into a
share exchange or business combination with, or enter into any other similar
transaction or series of transactions with, any person and the parties agree
that, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, no such transaction
shall be a breach of this Agreement.

 

(d) If any administrative or judicial Action is instituted (or threatened to
be instituted) by or before a Governmental Authority challenging the
transactions contemplated hereby as violating any applicable Laws, each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause their respective
affiliates to, cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to avoid and
resolve any such Action.

Merger and announcing this Agreement shall be a joint press release of the
Company and Parent to be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and Company, and,
thereafter, neither the Company, Parent nor Merger Sub shall, or permit their
Representatives to, issue or cause the publication of any press release or
other public announcement (to the extent not previously issued or made in

 



52  accordance with this Agreement) with respect to this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated hereby, except to the extent required by applicable
Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange or as may be requested by a Governmental Authority, in
which case the issuing party shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult

public statement, allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such
release or public statement in advance of such issuance and shall accept any
reasonable comments of such party; _provided_ that the restrictions in this 
_Section_ _ _ _6.07_ shall not apply to any communication regarding a Change
in Board Recommendation.

Company Board shall take all such steps as may be required, in accordance with
the procedures set forth in Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act and
in accordance with the Interpretative Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by
the SEC relating to Rule 16b-3, to cause any dispositions of equity securities
of the Company (including derivative securities with respect to equity
securities of the Company) resulting from the transactions contemplated
hereby by each officer or director of the Company who is subject to Section 16

hereof (including  _Section_ _ _ _6.01_ and _Section_ _ _ _6.06_ ), the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to

Section 9.05. _Interpretation; Disclosure Schedule_.

 

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to Appendices, Articles,
Sections, Schedules or Exhibits, such reference shall be to an Appendix,
Article, Section, Schedule or Exhibit of this Agreement, respectively, unless
otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words
"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be
deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation". The
words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used
in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole, including the
exhibits and schedules hereto, and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive. Unless the context of this
Agreement clearly requires otherwise, references to the plural include the
singular. References to a person are also to its permitted successors and
assigns. Whenever the context may require, any pronoun in the masculine,
feminine, and neuter gender shall include any other gender and words in the
singular form shall be construed to include the plural and vice versa. Any
agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in any
agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement,
instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented,
including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and
(in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and
references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. References to "dollars" or
"$" shall mean United States dollars. Any reference to days means calendar
days unless business days are expressly specified. When calculating the period
of time before which, within which or following which any act is to be done
or step taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the reference date
in calculating such period shall be excluded, and if the last day of such
period is not a business day, the period shall end on the next succeeding
business day. References to "written" or "in writing" include in electronic
form.

 

(b) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all payments pursuant
hereto shall be made by wire transfer in United States Dollars in immediately
available funds without any set-off, deduction, or counterclaim whatsoever.

(c) The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party because of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

(d) The parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the Disclosure Schedule may
include certain items and information solely for informational purposes for
the convenience of Parent and Merger Sub and (ii) the inclusion of any
information in the Disclosure Schedule shall not be 

 



64  deemed an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself and solely by virtue
of the inclusion of such information in the Disclosure Schedule, that such
information is required to be listed in the Disclosure Schedule or that such
items are material to the CompanyÂ’s business, the Company or any of its
subsidiaries. The headings, if any, of the individual sections of the
Disclosure Schedule are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed
to constitute a part thereof or a part of this Agreement. The Disclosure
Schedule is arranged in sections corresponding to those contained in _ARTICLE_
_ _ _III_ merely for convenience, and the disclosure of an item or
information in one section of the Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
particular representation or warranty shall be deemed adequately disclosed as
an exception with respect to all other representations or warranties to the
extent that the relevance of such item to such representations or warranties
is reasonably apparent on the face of such item, notwithstanding the presence
or absence of an appropriate section of the Disclosure Schedule with respect
to such other representations or warranties or the presence or absence of a
reference thereto in either the Disclosure Schedule or in the particular
representation or warranty.

 

(e) The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the Disclosure Schedule is
not intended and shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment of
the materiality of such amounts or items, nor shall the same be used in any
dispute or controversy between the parties hereto to determine whether any
obligation, item, or matter (whether or not described herein or included in
any schedule) is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement (other than
with respect to any representation, warranty, or provision of this Agreement
in which such specification occurs).

(f) To the extent that a representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement addresses a particular issue with specificity (a " _Specific
Representation_ "), and the representation or warranty set forth in _Section_
_ _ _3.05(d)_ also addresses such issue, then such Specific Representation
shall be deemed to control whether there has been a breach of representation
or warranty with respect to such issue.

Section 9.06. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without rendering invalid, illegal or unenforceable the
remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity,
legality or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement
in any other jurisdiction so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transaction contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be
unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is
enforceable.

 

Section 9.07. _Entire Agreement; No Other Representations or Warranties._

 

(a) This Agreement (including the Disclosure Schedule and the appendices,
exhibits and schedules to this Agreement), the Non-Disclosure Agreement and
any documents delivered by the parties hereto in connection herewith
constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements,
understandings, negotiations, representations, correspondence, undertakings,
and communications, both written and oral, among the parties with respect
thereto.

shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder if the
assignee does not perform its obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit
of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any
purported assignment or delegation not permitted under this Section shall be
null and void _ab initio_ and shall have no force or effect. Notwithstanding
anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be interpreted to
confer on any person other than the parties or their respective permitted
successors and assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under
or by reason of this Agreement (except as provided in _Section_ _ _ _6.05_
and _ARTICLE_ _ _ _I_ and _ARTICLE_ _ _ _II_ concerning payment to the holders
of Company Common Stock, Company Options and Company Restricted Stock,
which provisions shall inure to the benefit of the persons benefiting
therefrom who are expressly intended to be third-party beneficiaries thereof
and who may enforce the covenants contained therein; _provided_ , however,
that, prior to the Effective Time, the rights and remedies conferred on the
holders of Company Common Stock, Company Options and Company Restricted Stock
pursuant to _ARTICLE_ _ _ _I_ and _ARTICLE_ _ _ _II_ concerning the payments
provided therefor under _ARTICLE_ _ _ _II_ may only be enforced by the
Company acting on the behalf of such holders).

Section 9.09. _Counterparts; Effect; Facsimile Signatures_. This Agreement
may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to
be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement,
and shall become effective when one or more

 



66  counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same
counterpart. The exchange of copies of this Agreement and of signature pages
by facsimile, email in portable document format (PDF), or other electronic
transmission shall constitute effective execution and delivery of this

for all purposes. Signatures of the parties transmitted by facsimile, email in
portable document format (PDF), or other electronic transmission shall be
deemed to be their original signatures for all purposes.

such document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the parties
irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such Action shall be heard
and determined in the aforementioned courts. The parties hereby consent to and
grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over
the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other
papers in connection with any such Action in the manner provided in this
_Section_ _ _ _9.10_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law shall
be valid and sufficient service thereof.

(c) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
LAW, ALL OF ITS RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED UPON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF

all of the directorships to which directors could be elected at an annual
meeting held at the effective time of such action are vacant and are filled by
such action.

 

Section 2.03. _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the stockholders, called
by the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer, may be held at any
time and for any purpose or purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by statute.
Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to
the purposes stated in the notice thereof (except to the extent that such
notice is waived or is not required as provided in the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware (the "Delaware General Corporation Law") or these
Bylaws).

 



Ex. B-1 Section 2.04. _Quorum, Adjourned Meetings_. Stockholders may take action on a
matter at a meeting only if a quorum exists with respect to that matter.
Except as otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of
Incorporation, the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at the
meeting, and who are present in person or represented by proxy, shall
constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of
business. Where a separate vote by a class or series or classes or series is
required, a majority of the outstanding shares of such class or series or
classes or series, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute
a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter.
Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting (other than solely to
object (1) to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting, or
(2) (if it is a special meeting) to consideration of a particular matter at
the meeting that is not within the purpose or purposes described in the
meeting notice), it is deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder
of the meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting unless a new record
date is or must be set for the adjourned meeting. The holders of a majority of
the voting shares represented at a meeting, whether or not a quorum is
present, may adjourn such meeting from time to time.

Section 2.05. _Voting_. Unless otherwise provided in the Delaware General
Corporation Law or in the corporationÂ’s Certificate of Incorporation, and
subject to the other provisions of these Bylaws, each stockholder shall be
entitled to one vote on each matter, in person or by proxy, for each share of
the corporationÂ’s capital stock that has voting power and that is held by such
stockholder. Cumulative voting shall not be allowed in the election of
directors or for any other reason. No proxy shall be voted or acted upon
after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer
period. A duly executed appointment of proxy shall be irrevocable if the
appointment form states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it
is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable
power.

Section 2.06. _Required Vote._ When a quorum is present at any meeting of
stockholders, all matters shall be determined, adopted and approved by the
affirmative vote (which need not be by ballot) of the holders of a majority of
the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and
entitled to vote with respect to the matter, unless the proposed action is one
upon which, by express provision of statute or of the Certificate of
Incorporation, a different vote is specified and required, in which case such
express provision shall govern and control with respect to that vote on that
matter. If the Certificate of Incorporation provides for more or less than one
vote for any share, on any matter, every reference in these Bylaws to a
majority or other proportion of stock, voting stock or shares shall refer to
a majority or other proportion of the votes of such stock, voting stock or
shares. Where a separate vote by a class or classes is required, the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of such class or
classes present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting shall be the
act of such class. Notwithstanding the foregoing, directors shall be elected
by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or represented by
proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors.

Section 2.07. _Record Date_. In order that the corporation may determine the
stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders,
the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted
by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more than sixty
days nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting. If no record date
is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining
stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders
shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which
notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day
next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of
stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting, unless the Board
of Directors fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of
Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the

 



Ex. B-2  date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the
Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more than ten days
after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by
the Board of Directors. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of
Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the
Board of Directors is required by the Delaware General Corporation Law, shall
be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action
taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation in the manner
prescribed by Section 213(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. If no
record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the
Board of Directors is required by the Delaware General Corporation Law, the
record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate
action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the
day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior
action.

 

Section 2.08. _List of Stockholders_. After the record date for a meeting of
stockholders has been fixed, at least ten days before such meeting, the
officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the corporation shall make a
list of all stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in
alphabetical order and showing the address of each stockholder (but not the
electronic mail address or other electronic contact information, unless the
Board of Directors so directs) and the number of shares registered in the name
of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any
stockholder for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period of at least
ten days prior to the meeting: (1) on a reasonably accessible electronic
network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is
provided with the notice of the meeting, or (2) during ordinary business
hours, at the principal place of business of the corporation. If the meeting
is to be held at a place, then such list shall also, for the duration of the
meeting, be produced and kept open to the examination of any stockholder who
is present at the time and place of the meeting. If the meeting is to be held
solely by means of remote communication, then such list shall also be open to
the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on
a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to
access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.

 

Section 2.09. _Notice of Meetings_. Notice of any meeting of stockholders,
stating the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, the means of remote
communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to
be present in person and vote at such meeting, and (if it is a special
meeting) the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall
be given to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting not less than
ten nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting (except to the
extent that such notice is waived or is not required as provided in the
Delaware General Corporation Law or these Bylaws). Such notice shall be given
in accordance with, and shall be deemed effective as set forth in, Sections
222 and 232 (or any successor section or sections) of the Delaware General
Corporation Law.

 

Section 2.10. _Waiver of Notice_. Whenever the giving of any notice is
required by statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a
written waiver thereof signed by the person or persons entitled to said
notice, or a waiver thereof by electronic transmission by the person entitled
to said notice, delivered to the corporation, whether before or after the
event as to which such notice is required, shall be deemed equivalent to
notice. Attendance of a stockholder at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of
notice (1) of such meeting, except when the stockholder at the beginning of
the meeting objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the
meeting, and (2) (if it is a special meeting) of consideration of a particular
matter at the meeting that is not within the purpose or purposes described in
the meeting notice, unless the stockholder objects to considering the matter
at the beginning of the meeting.

Section 2.11. _Written Action_. Any action required or permitted to be taken
at a stockholdersÂ’ meeting may be taken without a meeting, without prior
notice and without a vote, if the action is taken by persons who would be
entitled to vote at a meeting and who hold shares having voting power equal
to not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to
authorize or take the action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote
were present and voted. The action must be evidenced by one or more
written consents

 



Ex. B-3  describing the action taken, signed by the stockholders entitled to take
action without a meeting, and delivered to the corporation in the manner
prescribed by the Delaware General Corporation Law for inclusion in the
minute book. No consent shall be effective to take the corporate action
specified unless the number of consents required to take such action are
delivered to the corporation within sixty days of the delivery of
the earliest-dated consent. A telegram, cablegram or other electronic
transmission, including e-mail, consenting to such action and transmitted by a
stockholder or proxyholder, or by a person or persons authorized to act for a
stockholder or proxyholder, shall be deemed to be written, signed and dated
for the purposes of this Section 2.11, provided that any such telegram,
cablegram or other electronic transmission sets forth or is delivered with
information from which the corporation can determine (1) that the telegram,
cablegram or other electronic transmission was transmitted by the stockholder
or proxyholder or by a person or persons authorized to act for the stockholder
or proxyholder and (2) the date on which such stockholder or proxyholder or
authorized person or persons transmitted such telegram, cablegram or
electronic transmission. The date on which such telegram, cablegram or
electronic transmission is transmitted shall be deemed to be the date on
which such consent was signed. No consent given by telegram, cablegram or
other electronic transmission shall be deemed to have been delivered until
such consent is delivered to the corporation in accordance with Section
228(d)(1) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Written notice of the
action taken shall be given in accordance with the Delaware General
Corporation Law to all stockholders who do not participate in taking the
action who would have been entitled to notice if such action had been taken
at a meeting having a record date on the date that written consents signed by
a sufficient number of holders to take the action were delivered to the
corporation.

 

Section 2.12. _Remote Communication_. If authorized by the Board of Directors,
and subject to such guidelines as the Board of Directors may adopt,
stockholders and proxyholders not physically present at a meeting of
stockholders may, by means of remote communication, participate in a meeting
of stockholders and be deemed present in person and vote at such meeting
whether such meeting is held at a designated place or solely by means of
remote communication, provided that (1) the corporation implements reasonable
measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at
the meeting by means of remote communication is a stockholder or proxyholder,
(2) the corporation implements reasonable measures to provide such
stockholders and proxyholders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the stockholders, including an
opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially
concurrently with such proceedings, and (3) if any stockholder or proxyholder
votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote communication,
a record of such vote or other action is maintained by the corporation.

ARTICLE III

 

DIRECTORS

Section 3.01.  _General Powers_. The business and affairs of the corporation
shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors, subject
to any limitation set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation or as
otherwise may be provided in the Delaware General Corporation Law.

Section 3.02. _Number_. The number of directors of the corporation shall be
determined from time to time by the Board of Directors but in no case shall
the number of directors be less than one.

Section 3.03. _Nomination and Term of Office_. The Board of Directors shall
nominate candidates to stand for election as directors; and other candidates
also may be nominated by any corporation stockholder, provided such other
nomination(s) are submitted in writing to the Secretary of the corporation,
or such other officer of the corporation as may be designated by the Board of
Directors, no later than ninety days prior to the meeting of stockholders at
which such directors are to be elected, together with the identity of the
nominator and the number of shares of the corporationÂ’s stock owned, directly
or indirectly, by the nominator. The directors shall be elected at the annual
meeting of the stockholders, except as provided in Section 3.09 hereof, and
each director elected shall hold office until such directorÂ’s successor is
elected and qualified or until the directorÂ’s earlier death, resignation or
removal. Directors need not be stockholders.

 



Ex. B-4 Section 3.04. _Board Meetings_. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may
be held without notice at such time and at such place as shall from time to
time be determined by the Board of Directors. Special meetings of the Board of
Directors may be called by any director on one dayÂ’s notice to each other
director, either personally or by telephone, express delivery service (so
that the scheduled delivery date of the notice is at least one day in advance
of the meeting), telegram, facsimile transmission, electronic mail (effective
when directed to an electronic mail address of the director), or other
electronic transmission, as defined in Section 232(c) (or any successor
section) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (effective when directed to
the director), and on five daysÂ’ notice by mail (effective upon deposit of
such notice in the mail). The notice need not describe the purpose of a
special meeting.

Section 3.05.  _Waiver of Notice_. A director may waive any notice required
by statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws before or after
the date and time stated in the notice. Except as set forth below, the waiver
must be in writing, signed by the director entitled to the notice, or made by
electronic transmission by the director entitled to the notice, and delivered
to the corporation for inclusion in the minute book. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a directorÂ’s attendance at or participation in a meeting waives
any required notice to the director of the meeting unless the director, at the
beginning of the meeting, objects to holding the meeting or transacting
business at the meeting and does not thereafter vote for or assent to action
taken at the meeting.

Section 3.06. _Quorum_. A majority of the directors holding
office immediately prior to a meeting of the Board of Directors shall
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at such meeting. The vote
of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a
quorum shall be the act of the Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise
specifically provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or by
these Bylaws.

 

Section 3.07. _Remote Communications_. Members of the Board of Directors may
participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors by any communication by
means of which all participating directors can simultaneously hear each other
during the meeting. A director participating in a meeting by this means is
deemed to be present in person at the meeting.

 

Section 3.09. _Vacancies; Newly Created Directorships_. Vacancies and newly
created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of
directors may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors
then in office, although fewer than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.
The previous sentence notwithstanding, whenever the holders of any class or
classes of stock or series thereof are entitled to elect one or more directors
by the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, vacancies and newly
created directorships of such class or classes or series may be filled by
the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors elected by such class or
classes or series thereof then in office, or by a sole remaining director so
elected. Each director so chosen shall hold office until the next election of
directors of the class to which such director was appointed, and until such
directorÂ’s successor is elected and qualified, or until the directorÂ’s earlier
death, resignation or removal. In the event that one or more directors resign
from the Board of Directors, effective at a future date, a majority of the
directors then in office, including those who have so resigned, shall have
power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when
such resignation or resignations shall become effective, and each director so
chosen shall hold office until the next election of directors, and until such
directorÂ’s successor is elected and qualified, or until the directorÂ’s earlier
death, resignation or removal.

 

Section 3.10. _Removal_. Any or all of the directors may be removed from
office at any time, with or without cause, in accordance with Section 141(k)
of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

 



Ex. B-5 Section 3.11. _Written Action_. Any action required or permitted to be taken
at any meeting of the Board of Directors may be taken without a meeting if
the action is taken by all members of the Board of Directors. The action must
be evidenced by one or more consents in writing or by electronic transmission
describing the action taken, signed by each director, and delivered to the
corporation for inclusion in the minute book.

Section 3.12.  _Committees_. The Board of Directors may designate one or more
committees, each committee to consist of one or more directors. The Board of
Directors may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any
committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting
of the committee. If a member of a committee shall be absent from any meeting,
or disqualified from voting thereat, the remaining member or members present
and not disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or members
constitute a quorum, may, by unanimous vote, appoint another member of the
Board of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of such absent or
disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the
resolution of the Board of Directors, shall have and may exercise all the
powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the
business and affairs of the corporation; but no such committee shall have the
power or authority in reference to approving or adopting, or recommending to
the stockholders, any action or matter (other than the election or removal of
directors) expressly required by the Delaware General Corporation Law to be
submitted to stockholders for approval or adopting, amending or repealing any
Bylaw of the corporation; and unless the resolution designating the committee,
these Bylaws or the Certificate of Incorporation expressly so provide, no such
committee shall have the power or authority to declare a dividend, to
authorize the issuance of stock, or to adopt a certificate of ownership and
merger pursuant to Section 253 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Such
committee or committees shall have such name or names as may be determined
from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors. Each
committee shall keep regular minutes of its meetings and report the same to
the Board of Directors, when required. Unless otherwise specified in the
resolution of the Board of Directors appointing the committee, all provisions
of the Delaware General Corporation Law and these Bylaws relating to meetings,
action without meetings, notice (and waiver thereof), and quorum and voting
requirements of the Board of Directors apply, as well, to such committees and
their members. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation,
these Bylaws, or the resolution of the Board of Directors designating the
committee, a committee may create one or more subcommittees, each
subcommittee to consist of one or more members of the committee, and delegate
to a subcommittee any or all of the powers and authority of the committee.

 

Section 3.13. _Compensation_. The Board of Directors shall from time to time
determine the amount and type of compensation, if any, to be paid to
directors for their service on the Board of Directors and its committees. No
such payment shall preclude any director from serving the corporation in any
other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.

 

ARTICLE IV

officers as the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer, if any, or

CAPITAL STOCK

Section 5.01. _Certificate_ _for Shares_. The shares of the corporation shall
be represented by certificates, provided that the Board of Directors may
provide by resolution that some or all of any or all classes or series of
the corporationÂ’s stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution
shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate
is surrendered to the corporation. Every holder of stock represented
by certificates, and, if stock is issued in uncertificated form, each holder
thereof, shall be entitled upon request to have a certificate (representing
the number of shares registered in certificate form) signed in the name of the
corporation by the President or Vice-President, and by the Treasurer or an
Assistant Treasurer, or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the
corporation. Any or all the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile.
In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar whose signature or facsimile
signature appears on a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer,
transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be
issued by the corporation with the same effect as if such person were such
officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.

Section 5.02. _Issuance of Shares_. The Board of Directors is authorized to
cause to be issued shares of the corporation up to the full amount authorized
by the Certificate of Incorporation in such amounts as may be determined by
the Board of Directors and as may be permitted by law. No shares shall be
allotted except in consideration of cash or other property, tangible or
intangible, received or to be received by the corporation under a written
agreement, of services rendered, or of other consideration as may be allowed
under Section 152 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

Section 5.03. _Transfer of Shares_. The shares of stock of the
corporation shall be transferable on the books of the corporation by the
holder thereof in person or by his or her attorney upon surrender for
cancellation of a certificate or certificates for the same number of shares,
or other evidence of ownership if no certificates shall have been issued,
with an assignment and power of transfer endorsed thereon or attached thereto,
duly executed, and with such proof of the validity of the signature as the

appoint one or more transfer agents and registrars to maintain the share
records of the corporation and to effect share transfers on its behalf.

 

Section 5.04. _Stockholders of Record_. The corporation shall be entitled to
recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the
owner of shares to receive dividends, to receive notifications, to vote as
such owner, and to exercise all the rights and powers of an owner. The
corporation shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to
or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether
or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise may
be provided by the Delaware General Corporation Law.

 

Section 5.05. _Loss of Certificates_. Any stockholder claiming a certificate
for shares to be lost, stolen or destroyed shall make an affidavit of that
fact in such form as the Board of Directors shall require and shall, if the
Board of Directors so requires, give the corporation a bond of indemnity in
form, in an amount, and with one or more sureties satisfactory to the
Board of Directors, to indemnify the corporation against any claim which may
be made against it on account of the certificate alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed or on account of the reissue of such certificate,
whereupon a new certificate may be issued in the same tenor and for the same
number of shares as the one alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

Section 6.02. _Entitled Stockholders_. In order that the corporation may
determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or
other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to
exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock,
or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix
a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be
not more than sixty days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the
record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the
close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the

INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE

 

Section 7.01. _Authorization of Indemnification_. Each person who was or is a
party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative, investigative or otherwise and whether by or in the
right of the corporation or otherwise (a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact
that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is
or was a director or officer of the corporation or is or was serving at the
request of the corporation as a director, officer, trustee, employee, partner
(limited or general) or agent of another corporation or of a partnership,
joint venture, limited liability company, trust or other enterprise, including
service with respect to an employee benefit plan, shall be (and shall be
deemed to have a contractual right to be) indemnified and held harmless by
the corporation (and any successor to the corporation by merger or otherwise)
to the fullest extent authorized by, and subject to the conditions and (except
as provided herein) procedures set forth in the Delaware General Corporation
Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but any such amendment
shall not be deemed to limit or prohibit the rights of indemnification
hereunder for past acts or omissions of any such person insofar as such
amendment limits or prohibits the indemnification rights that said law
permitted the corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all
expenses, liabilities and losses (including attorneysÂ’ fees, judgments, fines,
ERISA taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement)
reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith;
provided, however, that the corporation shall indemnify any such person
seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof)
initiated by such person (except for a suit or action pursuant to Section 7.02
hereof) only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board
of Directors. Persons who are not directors or officers of the corporation
and are not so serving at the request of the corporation may be similarly
indemnified in respect of such service to the extent authorized at any time by
the Board of Directors. The indemnification conferred in this Section
7.01 also shall include the right to be paid by the corporation (and such
successor) the expenses (including attorneysÂ’ fees) incurred in the defense of
or other involvement in any such proceeding in advance of its final
disposition; provided, however, that, if and to the extent the Delaware
General Corporation Law requires, the

 



Ex. B-9  payment of such expenses (including attorneysÂ’ fees) incurred by a director
or officer in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding shall be made
only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of
such director or officer to repay all amounts so paid in advance if it shall
ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be
indemnified under this Section 7.01 or otherwise; and provided further, that
such expenses incurred by other employees and agents may be so paid in advance
upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Board of Directors deems
appropriate. The financial ability of any person to make a
repayment contemplated by this Section 7.01 shall not be a prerequisite to
the making of an advance.

Section 7.02. _Right of Claimant to Bring Action Against the Corporation_. In
order for any claimant to seek indemnification from the corporation under this
Article VII, the claimant shall deliver a written claim to the corporation
specifying in reasonable detail the amount of indemnification sought and a
description of the persons, dates and circumstances giving rise to the
indemnification claim. Such determination shall be made: (a) by the Board of
Directors by a majority of a quorum consisting of directors who were
not parties to the proceeding giving rise to the indemnification claim, (2)
if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, a majority vote of
such a quorum so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion,
or (c) by the corporationÂ’s stockholders. If a claim under this Section 7.02
is not paid in full by the corporation within sixty days after a written claim
has been received by the corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter
bring an action against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the
claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled
to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such action. It shall be a defense
to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for
expenses incurred in connection with any proceeding in advance of its final
disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been
tendered to the corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of
conduct which make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law
for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed or is
otherwise not entitled to indemnification under Section 7.01, but the burden
of proving such defense shall be on the corporation. The failure of the
corporation (in the manner provided under the Delaware General Corporation
Law) to have made a determination prior to or after the commencement of such
action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances
because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the
Delaware General Corporation Law shall not be a defense to the action or
create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of
conduct. Unless otherwise specified in an agreement with the claimant, an
actual determination by the corporation (in the manner provided under the
Delaware General Corporation Law) after the commencement of such action that
the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct shall not be a
defense to the action, but shall create a presumption that the claimant has
not met the applicable standard of conduct.

 

Section 7.03. _Non-exclusivity_. The rights to indemnification and advance
payment of expenses provided by Section 7.01 hereof shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification and
advance payment of expenses may be entitled under any Bylaw, agreement, vote
of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action
in his or her official capacity and as to action in another capacity while
holding such office. No repeal or modification of the foregoing sentence shall
adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the corporation
existing by virtue of the foregoing sentence at the time of such repeal or
modification.

Section 7.04. _Survival of Indemnification_. The indemnification and advance
payment of expenses and rights thereto provided by, or granted pursuant to,
Section 7.01 hereof shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or
ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer,
employee, partner or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the personal
representatives, heirs, executors and administrators of such person.

 

Section 7.05. _Insurance_. The corporation shall have, to the fullest extent
permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, the power to purchase and
maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer,
employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of
the corporation as

 



Ex. B-10  a director, officer, employee, partner (limited or general) or agent of
another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, limited liability
company, trust or other enterprise, against any liability asserted against
such person or incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of
such personÂ’s status as such, and related expenses, whether or not the
corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
liability under the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

Section 7.06. _Modification_. Any repeal or modification of this Article VII
shall be prospective only and shall not adversely affect any right or
protection of, or any limitation of the liability of, a director or officer of
the corporation existing at, or arising out of facts or incidents occurring
prior to, the effective date of such repeal or modification.

ARTICLE VIII

 

AMENDMENTS

Section 8.01.  _Amendment_. Subject to the limitations set forth in Section
7.06, these Bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed and new Bylaws may be
adopted by the stockholders or by the Board of Directors at any regular
meeting of the stockholders or of the Board of Directors, at any special
meeting of the stockholders or of the Board of Directors or by written action
by the stockholders or by the Board of Directors if notice of such alteration,
amendment, repeal or adoption of new Bylaws be contained in the notice of
such meeting or any notice required for such written action. The power of the
Board of Directors to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws shall not divest or limit
the power of the stockholders to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws, and a Bylaw
amendment adopted by the stockholders which specifies the votes that shall be
necessary for the election of directors shall not be further amended or
repealed by the Board of Directors.

 

Any action taken or authorized by the stockholders or by the Board of
Directors, which would be inconsistent with the Bylaws then in effect but is
taken or authorized by a vote or written action that would be sufficient to
amend the Bylaws so that the Bylaws would be consistent with such action,
shall be given the same effect as though the Bylaws had been temporarily
amended or suspended so far, but only so far, as is necessary to permit the
specific action so taken or authorized.

ARTICLE IX

this corporation (1) to attend any meeting of security holders of
other corporations or legal entities in which this corporation may hold

Chief Executive Officer may, from time to time, grant such power and authority
to one or more other persons. The corporation may rely on any instrument
signed by an officer of any stockholder of the corporation as the act of such
stockholder of the corporation, unless the Board of Directors or the Chief
Executive Officer has knowledge that such reliance is not reasonable. 

Section 9.02. _Purchase and Sale of Securities_. Unless otherwise ordered by
the Board of Directors, and subject to any limitations imposed by the Chief
Executive Officer of the corporation, any elected or appointed officer of the
corporation shall have full power and authority on behalf of this corporation

may, from time to time, confer like powers upon any other person or persons.
