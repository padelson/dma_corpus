allocated to each such Property on Schedule 2.2. Seller has accepted such
Allocated Values for purposes of this Agreement and the transactions

or 3.13;

(c)with respect to production, pipeline, storage, processing, or other
imbalances or overlifts, decreased (for the aggregate amounts owed by Seller
to any third Person as of the Effective Time) or increased (for the aggregate
amounts owed by any third Person to Seller as of the Effective Time), as
applicable, (A) in the case of gaseous Hydrocarbons, on the basis of $1.74,
multiplied by the amount of imbalance in MMBtu (as adjusted for MMBtu content
in the case of natural gas liquids), (B) in the case of

oil Hydrocarbons, on the basis of $42.20, multiplied by the amount of the
imbalance in barrels; or (C) by an amount agreed to in writing by the Parties;

(d)increased by the aggregate amount of Seller's share of any merchantable
Hydrocarbon inventories produced from or credited to the Properties in storage
tanks included in the Assets upstream of delivery points to the relevant
purchasers on the Effective Time based on the quantities in such storage tanks
as of the Effective Time as measured by and reflected in Seller's records,
multiplied by (A) in the case of gaseous Hydrocarbons, $1.74, (as adjusted for
MMBtu content in the case of natural gas liquids), or (B) in the case of oil
Hydrocarbons, multiplied by $42.20;

(e)increased by the net amount of all prepaid expenses other than Taxes with
respect to the Assets attributable to periods from and after the Effective
Time (including bonuses; rentals; and cash calls to third Person operators)
which have been paid or economically borne by Seller or its Affiliates;

(f)without limiting either Party's rights under Article 11, adjusted for

connection with sales of oil, gas, or other Hydrocarbons that are not included
as Property Costs under Section 2.3(f)(ii); and (z) Property Costs that are
otherwise paid or economically borne by Seller in relation to any proceeds or
in earning or receiving thereof, and excluding the effects of any Hedges,
futures, options, swaps, or other derivatives); and

(B)other income earned with respect to the Assets attributable to the periods
from and including the Effective Time and excluding the effects of any Hedges,
futures, options, swaps, or other derivatives;

(ii)increased by an amount equal to the amount of all Property Costs which are
incurred in the ownership and operation of the Assets from and after the
Effective Time but paid or economically borne by or on behalf of Seller or any

costs already deducted in the determination of proceeds in Section 2.3(f)(i);
and

(iii)decreased by the amount of all positive Purchaser Responsibility Suspense
Amounts, to the extent such positive Purchaser Responsibility Suspense Amounts
are not transferred to Purchaser's control at the Closing;

(i)increased by the amount of Asset Taxes allocated to Purchaser pursuant to
Section 9.1 but paid or otherwise economically borne by Seller (or any of its
Affiliates) (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any Asset Taxes that were
withheld or deducted from, or otherwise netted against, the gross amount paid
or payable to Seller in connection with a transaction to which Section 2.3(f)
applies, and therefore were taken into account in determining the proceeds
"received" by Seller for purposes of applying Section 2.3(f) with respect to
such transaction); and

(ii)decreased by the amount of all Asset Taxes allocated to Seller in
accordance with Section 9.1 but paid or otherwise economically borne by
Purchaser (or any of its Affiliates);

(h)with respect to overhead costs of Seller incurred from the Effective Time
to the Closing Date, increased by an amount equal to:

(i)with respect to any Assets subject to a joint operating agreement, that

for each horizontal Well, a drilling well rate of Eight Thousand Dollars
($8,000) per month (prorated for less than a full month) and a producing well
rate of Eight Hundred Dollars ($800) per month and (B) for each vertical Well,
a drilling well rate of Six Thousand Dollars ($6,000) per month (prorated for
less than a full month) and a producing well rate of Six Hundred Fifty Dollars
($650) per month; and

(i)decreased or increased, as applicable, for any other amount provided for in
this Agreement or agreed upon by Seller and Purchaser in writing.

The amount of each adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price described in
Section 2.3(f) shall be determined in accordance with Accounting Principles
using the accrual method of accounting and COPAS, as consistently applied.

2.4 Certain Ordinary-Course Costs and Revenues.

(a)With respect to revenues earned or Property Costs incurred with respect to
the Assets prior to the Effective Time but received or paid after the
Effective Time:

(i)Seller shall be entitled to all amounts earned from the sale, during the
period up to but excluding the Effective Time, of Hydrocarbons produced from,
or attributable to, the Properties, which amounts are received prior to the
Cut-Off Date (net of any (A) Royalties; (B) gathering, processing, and
transportation costs paid in connection with sales of Hydrocarbons that are
not included as Property Costs under Section 2.4(a)(ii); and (C) Property

income earned with respect to the Assets up to but excluding the Effective
Time and received on or before the Cut-Off Date.

(ii)Seller shall be responsible for (and entitled to any refunds and
indemnities with respect to) all Property Costs incurred prior to the
Effective Time; provided, however, that Seller's responsibility for the
foregoing shall terminate on the Cut-Off Date.

(b)Purchaser shall be entitled to all amounts earned from the sale, during the
period from and after the Effective Time, of Hydrocarbons produced from, or
attributable to, the Properties, and to all other income earned with respect
to the Assets from and after the Effective Time, and shall be responsible for
(and entitled to any refunds and indemnities with respect to) all Property
Costs incurred from and after the Effective Time.

(c)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, without
duplication of any adjustments made pursuant to Section 2.3(f), should
Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser receive after Closing any proceeds or
other income to which Seller is entitled under Section 2.4(a), Purchaser shall
fully disclose, account for, and promptly remit the same to Seller.

(d)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, without
duplication of any adjustments made pursuant to this Article 2, should Seller
or any Affiliate of Seller receive after Closing any amounts earned from the
sale of Hydrocarbons produced from, or attributable to, the Properties or
other income earned with respect to the Assets for the period of time from and
after the Effective Time, Seller shall fully disclose, account for, and
promptly remit the same to Purchaser.

(e)Seller shall have no further responsibility for Property Costs incurred
with respect to the Assets, to the extent such amounts have not been received
or paid, respectively, on or before the Cut-Off Date.

2.5 Procedures.

(a)All adjustments and payments made pursuant to this Article 2 shall be
without duplication of any other amounts paid or received under this
Agreement.

(b)For purposes of allocating production (and accounts receivable with respect
thereto) under Section 2.3 and Section 2.4, (i) liquid Hydrocarbons shall be
deemed to be "from or attributable to" the Properties when they pass through
the pipeline flange connecting into the tank batteries related to each Well,
and (ii) gaseous Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or attributable to"
the Properties when they pass through the delivery point sales meters or
similar meters at the point of entry into the pipelines through which they are
transported. Seller shall use reasonable interpolative procedures to arrive at
an allocation of production when exact meter readings or gauging or strapping
data are not available.

(c)Surface use or damage fees and other Property Costs that are paid
periodically shall be prorated based on the number of days in the applicable
period falling before, or on or after, the Effective Time.

(d)After Closing, Purchaser shall handle all joint interest audits and other
audits of Property Costs covering periods for which Seller is in whole or in
part responsible under Section 2.4, provided that Purchaser shall not agree to
any adjustments to previously assessed costs for which Seller is liable, or
any compromise of any audit claims to which Seller would be entitled, without
the prior written consent of Seller, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld. Each Party shall provide the other with a copy of all applicable
audit reports and written audit agreements received by such Party and relating
to periods for which Seller is partially responsible.

(e)"Earned" and "incurred," as used in Section 2.3 and Section 2.4, shall be
interpreted in accordance with accounting recognition guidance under the
Accounting Principles.

2.6 Additional Consideration.

(a)If the Closing occurs, Purchaser shall pay to Seller as part of the
Purchase Price Additional Consideration Payments up to an aggregate sum of
23.076923076923% of the Unadjusted Purchase Price (which in the case of this
Agreement is an amount equal to Sixty Million Dollars ($60,000,000)) (the
"Additional Consideration Cap"), subject to the terms and conditions of this
Section 2.6. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser shall have no liability or
obligation to make any Additional Consideration Payments to Seller in excess
of the Additional Consideration Cap and, if at any time, Seller has received
aggregate Additional Consideration Payments equal to the Additional
Consideration Cap, then Purchaser shall have no further obligations or
liabilities under this Section 2.6.

(b)The "2019 Additional Consideration Payment", if any, shall be calculated as
follows: if the 2019 WTI Price is (i) less than Sixty Dollars ($60) per
barrel, there shall not be any 2019 Additional Consideration Payment; (ii)
equal to or greater than Sixty Dollars ($60) per barrel but less than Sixty-
Five Dollars ($65) per barrel, the 2019 Additional Consideration Payment shall
be an amount equal to 3.46153846% of the Unadjusted Purchase Price (which in
the case of this Agreement is an amount equal to Nine Million Dollars
($9,000,000)); or (iii) equal to or greater than Sixty-Five Dollars ($65) per
barrel, the 2019 Additional Consideration Payment shall be an amount equal to
8.012820511% of the Unadjusted Purchase Price (which in the case of this
Agreement is an amount equal to Twenty Million Eight Hundred Thirty-Three
Thousand Three Hundred Thirty-Three Dollars and 33/100 ($20,833,333.33)).

(c)The "2020 Additional Consideration Payment", if any, shall be calculated as
follows: if the 2020 WTI Price is (i) less than Sixty Dollars ($60) per
barrel, there shall not be any 2020 Additional Consideration Payment; (ii)
equal to or greater than Sixty Dollars ($60) per barrel but less than Sixty-
Five Dollars ($65) per barrel, the 2020 Additional Consideration Payment shall
be an amount equal to 3.46153846% of the Unadjusted Purchase Price (which in
the case of this Agreement is an amount equal to Nine Million Dollars
($9,000,000)); or (iii) equal to or greater than Sixty-Five Dollars ($65) per
barrel, the 2020 Additional Consideration Payment shall be an amount equal to
8.012820511% of the Unadjusted Purchase Price (which in the case of this
Agreement is an amount equal to Twenty Million Eight Hundred Thirty-Three
Thousand Three Hundred Thirty-Three Dollars and 33/100 ($20,833,333.33)).

(d)The "2021 Additional Consideration Payment" (and together with the 2019
Additional Consideration Payment and the 2020 Additional Consideration
Payment, if any, the "Additional Consideration Payments"), if any, shall be
calculated as follows: if the 2021 WTI Price is (i) less than Sixty Dollars
($60) per barrel, there shall not be any 2021 Additional Consideration
Payment; (ii) is equal to or greater than Sixty Dollars ($60) per barrel but
less than Sixty-Five Dollars ($65) per barrel, the 2021 Additional
Consideration Payment shall be an amount equal to 3.46153846% of the
Unadjusted Purchase Price (which in the case of this Agreement is an amount
equal to Nine Million Dollars ($9,000,000)); or (iii) equal to or greater than
Sixty-Five Dollars ($65) per barrel, the 2021 Additional Consideration Payment
shall be an amount equal to 8.012820511% of the Unadjusted Purchase Price
(which in the case of this Agreement is an amount equal to Twenty Million
Eight Hundred Thirty-Three Thousand Three Hundred Thirty-Three Dollars and
33/100 ($20,833,333.33)).

(e)Subject to the Additional Consideration Cap and to Sections 2.6(f) and
2.6(g), each Additional Consideration Payment, if any, shall be paid by
Purchaser to Seller by wire transfer in immediately available funds within
sixty (60) days after the last calendar day of the 2019, 2020 and 2021
calendar years, as applicable.

(f)Within ten (10) days after the last calendar day of each of the 2019, 2020
and 2021 calendar years, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a statement setting
forth Purchaser's good faith calculation of the applicable Additional
Consideration Payment (each, an "Additional Consideration Statement"). As soon
as reasonably practicable, and in any event within ten (10) days after
Seller's receipt of an Additional Consideration Statement, Seller may return
to Purchaser a written report containing any proposed changes to such
Additional Consideration Statement (an "Additional Consideration Dispute
Notice"). Any changes not so specified in a timely delivered Additional
Consideration Dispute Notice shall be deemed waived, and Purchaser's
determinations with respect to all such elements of the applicable Additional
Consideration Statement that are not addressed specifically in the Additional
Consideration Dispute Notice shall prevail. If Seller fails to timely deliver
an Additional Consideration Dispute Notice to Purchaser containing changes
Seller proposes to be made to the applicable Additional Consideration
Statement, the applicable Additional Consideration Statement as delivered by
Purchaser will be deemed to be correct and will be final and binding on the
Parties and not subject to further audit or arbitration.

(g)Seller and Purchaser shall work together in good faith to resolve any
matters addressed in an Additional Consideration Dispute Notice. If Seller and
Purchaser are unable to resolve all of the matters addressed in an Additional
Consideration Notice within ten (10) Business Days after the delivery of such
Additional Consideration Dispute Notice by Seller to Purchaser, either Party
may notify the other Party of its election to submit such unresolved matters
to arbitration and thereafter the Parties shall promptly submit all unresolved
matters addressed in such Additional Consideration Dispute Notice to
arbitration in accordance with this Section 2.6(g). Within ten (10) Business
Days of a matter being submitted to arbitration in accordance with the
preceding sentence, each Party shall (i) summarize its position with regard to
such dispute and (ii) submit such summaries to a nationally-recognized
independent accounting firm as selected by mutual agreement of the Parties
(the "Additional Consideration Arbitrator"), together with the applicable
Additional Consideration Dispute Notice, applicable Additional Consideration
Statement, and any other documentation such Party may desire to submit. If the
Parties cannot agree on an Additional Consideration Arbitrator within five (5)
Business Days after a Party's election to submit such matters to arbitration
under this Section 2.6(g), then the Parties shall formally request the
Houston, Texas office of the American Arbitration Association (or, if there is
no such office, the office of the American Arbitration Association serving
Houston, Texas) to select the Additional Consideration Arbitrator. Within ten
(10) Business Days after receiving the Parties' respective submissions, the
Additional Consideration Arbitrator shall render a decision choosing either
Seller's position or Purchaser's position with respect to each matter
addressed in any Additional Consideration Dispute Notice, based on the
materials described above. Any decision rendered by the Additional
Consideration Arbitrator pursuant hereto shall be final, conclusive, and
binding on Seller and Purchaser and enforceable against the Parties in any
court of competent jurisdiction. The costs of the Additional Consideration
Arbitrator shall be borne equally between Seller and Purchaser. Within ten
(10) days after the Additional Consideration Arbitrator renders a decision
pursuant to this Section 2.6(g), Purchaser shall pay to Seller the Additional
Consideration Payment owing to Seller, if any, by wire transfer in immediately
available funds.

(h)As used in Section 2.6, (i) the "2019 WTI Price" means the simple
arithmetic average of the final monthly settlements for each month from
January 2019 through December 2019 for NYMEX Light Sweet Crude Oil Futures, as
reported by the CME Group Inc. ("CME") under the "Settlements" tab, with the
"Futures" choice selected, which chart can currently be accessed at the
following link:https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/crude-oil/light-sweet-
crude_quotes_settlements_futures.html. For clarification, the simple
arithmetic average of the 2019 WTI Price would be calculated by adding the
twelve (12) final monthly settlements together and dividing the sum by twelve
(12); (ii) the "2020 WTI Price" means the simple arithmetic average of the
final monthly settlements for each month from January 2020 through December
2020 for NYMEX Light Sweet Crude Oil Futures, as reported by CME under the
"Settlements" tab, with the "Futures" choice selected, which chart can
currently be accessed at the following
link:https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/crude-oil/light-sweet-
crude_quotes_settlements_futures.html. For clarification, the simple
arithmetic average of the 2020 WTI Price would be calculated by adding the
twelve (12) final monthly settlements together and dividing the sum by twelve
(12); and (iii) the "2021 WTI Price" means the simple arithmetic average of
the final monthly settlements for each month from January 2021 through
December 2021 for NYMEX Light Sweet Crude Oil Futures, as reported by CME
under the "Settlements" tab, with the "Futures" choice selected, which chart
can currently be accessed at the following
link:https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/crude-oil/light-sweet-
crude_quotes_settlements_futures.html. For clarification, the simple
arithmetic average of the 2021 WTI Price would be calculated by adding the
twelve (12) final monthly settlements together and dividing the sum by twelve
(12). For the avoidance of doubt, the January 2019 settlement (settled
December 19, 2018) was $47.20/barrel, the February 2019 settlement (settled
January 22, 2019) was $52.57/barrel, the March 2019 settlement (settled
February 20, 2019) was $56.92/barrel, and the April 2019 settlement (settled
March 20, 2019) was $59.83/barrel.

(i)Any Additional Consideration Payments paid pursuant to this Section 2.6
shall be considered an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes to
the extent permitted by Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
Purchaser shall have the right at the time payment is due pursuant to this
Section 2.6 to set-off against, offset, recoup or withhold from the Additional
Consideration Payments, if payable, in respect of any amounts that are
conclusively due and payable to Purchaser by Seller pursuant to this
Agreement, including any such amounts conclusively due and payable to
Purchaser by Seller pursuant to the indemnification obligations under Article
11.

(j)The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the contingent rights to receive
Additional Consideration Payments shall not be represented by any form of
certificate or other instrument, are not transferable, except by operation of
Law and as permitted by Section 12.9 of this Agreement, and do not constitute
an equity or ownership interest in Purchaser or any of its respective
Affiliates, (ii) Seller shall not have any rights as a securityholder of
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates as a result of the contingent right to
receive any Additional Consideration Payments hereunder, and (iii) no interest
is payable with respect to any Additional Consideration Payments contemplated
hereby.

(k)In the event Purchaser sells, transfers or otherwise disposes of the Assets
in a transaction in which the acquirer of the Assets (or a group of affiliated
acquirers) acquires all or substantially all of the assets of Purchaser (a
"Subject Transaction"), then Purchaser shall be required to either:

(i)Cause such acquierer(s) to expressly assume in writing upon consummation of
the Subject Transaction the covenants of this Section 2.6 that remain
outstanding as of the time of such transaction; or

(ii)At any time prior to or contemporaneously with the consummation of the
Subject Transaction, (A) procure a letter of credit in favor of Seller issued
by a nationally recognized banking association (which shall include JPMorgan
Chase Bank) or such other financial institution reasonably acceptable to
Seller, in an amount equal to the Financial Assurance Amount and otherwise on
customary terms and conditions; (B) deposit with a third party escrow agent,
which shall be a nationally recognized banking association (which shall
include JPMorgan Chase Bank) or such other financial institution reasonably
acceptable to Seller, an amount equal to the Financial Assurance Amount
pursuant to an escrow agreement on customary terms and conditions; or (C)
procure such other credit support or financial assurance for the benefit of
Seller in an amount equal to the Financial Assurance Amount that is reasonably
acceptable to Seller (any of the foregoing described in clause (A), (B) or (C)
or any combination thereof, the "Financial Assurance"). Any such Financial
Assurance procured by Purchaser shall be required to be maintained in an
aggregate amount (the "Financial Assurance Amount") equal to the then
aggregate amount of Additional Consideration that (as of the relevant time of
determination) may become due and payable to Seller under this Section 2.6,
taking into account the Additional Consideration Cap and any Additional
Consideration Payments previously paid to Seller hereunder (or determined not
to be due and payable to Seller hereunder). For clarity, the amount of the
Financial Assurance Amount shall automatically be reduced (and any cash
deposited by Purchaser pursuant thereto shall be promptly released to
Purchaser) as and to the extent Additional Consideration Payments that become
due and payable to Seller are actually paid to Seller or are no longer
available to become due and payable to Seller, in each case, in accordance
with this Agreement.

2.7 Withholding. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration otherwise payable or deliverable to Seller such amounts as
required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code, under any Tax
law or pursuant to any other applicable Laws; provided that Purchaser will use
commercially reasonable efforts to first notify Seller of its withholding
obligation and provided further that Purchaser will cooperate in good faith
with Seller to minimize, to the extent permissible under

applicable Law, the amount of any such deduction or withholding. To the extent
such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid absent such deduction or withholding.

ARTICLE 3

TITLE AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

3.1 Purchaser's Title Review.

(a)From and after the Execution Date, and pursuant and subject to the terms of
Sections 6.1 and 6.5, Purchaser shall have the right to conduct a review of
Seller's title to the Assets. Without limiting Purchaser's right to
indemnification pursuant to Article 11 with respect to a breach of Sections
4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.9, 4.12, 4.13, 4.14, 4.18, 4.19, 6.4 or clauses (h) or (k) of
the definition of "Retained Obligations", the provisions of this Article 3,
the special warranty of Defensible Title in the Assignment and Bill of Sale,
and the condition to Closing in Section 7.2(d) provide Purchaser's exclusive
remedy with respect to any Title Defects or other deficiencies or defects in
Seller's title to the Properties.

(b)Purchaser's rights with respect to title to the Properties pursuant to this
Article 3 are limited to the Properties, and, except with respect to the
representations and warranties of Seller in Sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.9, 4.12,
4.13, 4.14, 4.18 and 4.19, Seller hereby expressly disclaims and negates any
and all warranties of title whatsoever, whether express, implied, statutory,
or otherwise, except for the special warranty of Defensible Title in the
Assignment and Bill of Sale.

(c)The Assignment and Bill of Sale to be executed and delivered by the Parties
at Closing (the "Assignment and Bill of Sale") shall be in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit B, and shall contain a special warranty of Defensible Title
to the Properties shown on Exhibit A‑1 and Exhibit A‑2 by, through or under
Seller and its Affiliates, but not otherwise, subject to the Permitted
Encumbrances. Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived all breaches of
Seller's special warranty of Defensible Title set forth in the Assignment and
Bill of Sale for which Purchaser has not furnished to Seller a valid defect
claim notice that satisfies the requirements set forth in Section 3.6(a)(i)
through (v) on or before the date forty-eight (48) months after Closing.
Purchaser shall not be entitled to protection under Seller's special warranty
of Defensible Title in the Assignment and Bill of Sale against any Title
Defect (i) reported by Purchaser to Seller in a Title Defect notice delivered
by Purchaser pursuant to Section 3.6(a) prior to the Defect Claim Deadline or
(ii) for which Purchaser had actual knowledge of but did not submit a Title
Defect notice to Seller regarding the same; provided, that Purchaser's
recovery under this Agreement for a Title Defect reported prior to the Defect
Claim Deadline that would otherwise constitute a breach of Seller's special
warranty of Defensible Title contained in any Assignment and Bill of Sale
shall not be subject to the individual claim threshold set forth in Section
3.9(a)(viii)(A) or the deductible set forth in Section 3.9(a)(viii)(C). If
Purchaser provides written notice of a breach of the special warranty to
Seller, Seller shall have a reasonable opportunity to cure such breach. In any
event, the recovery on a breach of Seller's special warranty under any
Assignment and Bill of Sale shall not exceed the Allocated Value of the
affected Asset and will not be subject to the individual claim threshold set
forth in Section 3.9(a)(viii)(A) or the deductible set forth in Section
3.9(a)(viii)(C).

3.2 Definition of Defensible Title.

(a)As used in this Agreement, the term "Defensible Title" means that record
and beneficial title of Seller in the Leases (limited to the Target
Formations, as such Target Formations are further limited with respect to such

Wells (limited to those formations in which such Well is currently producing
or, with respect to a Well that is not currently producing, the last depth or
formation at which it produced) which,

as of the Effective Time, Defect Claim Deadline and the Closing Date and
subject to the Permitted Encumbrances:

(i)with respect to each Well set forth on Exhibit A‑2, entitles Seller to not

proportionate increase in Seller's Net Revenue Interest for such Well;

(iii)with respect to each Lease on Exhibit A‑1, entitles Seller to ownership
of not less than the Net Acres set forth in Exhibit A‑1 for such Lease, and
entitles Seller to not less than the Net Revenue Interest set forth in Exhibit
A‑1 for such Lease, except for, in each case, (A) decreases in connection with
those operations in which Seller may elect after the Execution Date, in
compliance with this Agreement, to be a non-consenting co-owner, (B) decreases

Property to be less than Defensible Title. As used in this Agreement, the term
"Title Benefit" means any right, circumstance, or condition that operates to
(i) increase the Net Revenue Interest of Seller as of the Effective Time,
Defect Claim Deadline and the Closing Date in any Property above that shown
for such Property on Exhibit A‑1 or Exhibit A‑2 without causing at least a
proportionate increase in, with respect to Properties that are Wells, Seller's
Working Interest, or, with respect to Properties that are Leases, Seller's Net
Acre ownership, above that shown for such Property on Exhibit A‑1 or Exhibit
A‑2, as applicable, (ii) increase the Net Acre ownership of Seller as of the
Effective Time, Defect Claim Deadline and the Closing Date in any Lease above

Claim Deadline and the Closing Date in any Well below that shown for such Well
on Exhibit A‑2 without causing at least a proportionate decrease in Seller's

rights, nets profits interests, net profits royalty interests, net profits
overriding royalty interests, carried interests, operating rights, record
title interests, and other interests located within the Development Area that
are not described on Exhibit A‑1. As used in this Article III, the term

3.4 Environmental Assessment; Environmental Defects.

(a)From and after the Execution Date, and subject to the terms of Sections 6.1
and 6.5 and this Section 3.4, Purchaser shall have the right to conduct, or
cause an environmental consulting or engineering firm (the "Environmental
Consultant") to conduct, an inspection of the environmental condition and
compliance status of the Properties (the "Environmental Review") which may
include conducting a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment in accordance with
the ASTM International Standard Practice Environmental Site Assessments: Phase
I Environmental Site Assessment Process (Publication Designation: E1527-13 or
E2247-16) ("Phase I"). If Seller or any of its Affiliates is not the operator
of a Property, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
permission from the third Person operator of such non-operated Property for
Purchaser or the Environmental Consultant to conduct the Environmental Review;
provided, however, that with respect to such non-operated Properties, Seller
shall have no liability to Purchaser for failure to obtain such third Person
operator's permission (provided Seller uses such commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain such permission), and Seller shall not be required to make
any payments or undertake any obligations for the benefit of any other Person
with respect to such access to such non-operated Properties. Seller shall have
the right to have one or more representatives accompany Purchaser and the
Environmental Consultant at all times during the Environmental Review. The
Environmental Review and any access under Section 6.1 shall not include any
sampling, boring, operation of Equipment, or other invasive activity (each, an
"Invasive Activity") without the prior written consent of Seller, which
consent can be withheld in Seller's sole discretion with respect to Properties
operated by Seller, and that of any applicable third Person operator with
respect to any properties not operated by Seller or any of its Affiliates;
provided, however, that in the event Purchaser's Phase I identifies a
potential Environmental Defect and Purchaser reasonably concludes that it is
necessary to conduct an Invasive Activity on the Property prior to the Defect
Claim Deadline and Seller or such third Person operator, as applicable, fails
to grant such consent within five (5) Business Days of receipt of Producer's
request to perform such Invasive Activity, then Purchaser shall have the right
to exclude the affected Property from the transactions contemplated hereunder
and, in such event, (i) the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be decreased by
the Allocated Value, if any, of such affected Property, (ii) such affected
Properties shall be deemed to be excluded from the definition of "Assets" and
from the exhibits attached hereto, (iii) such affected Property shall be
deemed to constitute Excluded Assets, and (iv) Purchaser shall have no rights
or obligations with respect to such Excluded Assets. In performing its
Environmental Review, Purchaser shall (and shall cause the Environmental
Consultant and Purchaser's other representatives to): (1) perform all work in
a safe and workmanlike manner; (2) perform all work in such a way as to not
unnecessarily and unreasonably interfere with the operation of any Property or
the business of Seller; (3) materially comply with all applicable Laws; and
(4) at its sole cost, risk, and expense, with respect to any physical damages
caused by the Environmental Review, repair any disturbances to the Properties
caused by the Environmental Review.

(b)Purchaser shall provide to Seller (free of cost) copies (electronic or
paper, at Purchaser's option) of any final environmental reports and results
(including any interim, draft or preliminary reports or results) generated by
the Environmental Consultant with respect to any Environmental Defect
Purchaser asserts. Except (i) as may be required or permitted pursuant to the
exercise of the rights and fulfillment of the obligations of a Party under
this Agreement, (ii) as may be required by applicable Law (including as may be
required by deposition, interrogatories, requests for information or documents
in legal or regulatory proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or
other similar process or Law), or (iii) for information which is or becomes
public knowledge through no fault of the Person against whom this sentence is
sought to be enforced, Purchaser and Seller shall maintain, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates and each of such Person's officers, directors,
employees, contractors, consultants (including the Environmental Consultant),
and other advisors to maintain, all information, reports (whether interim,
draft, final, or otherwise), data, work product, and other matters obtained or
generated from or attributable to the Environmental Review (the "Environmental
Information") strictly confidential, and shall

not disclose all or any portion of the Environmental Information to any third
Person without the consent of Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If this
Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing (or if the Agreement is not
terminated prior to Closing, then any Environmental Information with respect
to any Excluded Asset), (x) Purchaser shall deliver the Environmental
Information to Seller, which Environmental Information shall become the sole
property of Seller and (y) the foregoing confidentiality obligations set forth
in this Section 3.4(b) shall not apply to Seller and its Affiliates and its
and their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors and
consultants. Each Party shall be responsible for the compliance of its
Affiliates, and its and their respective officers, directors, employees,
contractors, consultants (including the Environmental Consultant), and other
advisors with the immediately preceding sentence. If the Closing occurs, the
foregoing confidentiality obligations set forth in this Section 3.4(b) shall
not apply to Purchaser and its Affiliates and its and their respective
officers, directors, employees, contractors and consultants.

(c)Purchaser acknowledges that the Assets have been used for the exploration,
development, and production of Hydrocarbons and that there may be petroleum,
produced water, wastes, or other substances or materials located in, on, or
under the Properties or associated with the Assets. Equipment and sites
included in the Assets may contain Hazardous Substances or hazardous
materials, including asbestos and naturally occurring radioactive material
("NORM"). NORM may affix or attach itself to the inside of wells, materials,
and equipment as scale, or in other forms. The wells, materials, and equipment
located on the Properties or included in the Assets may contain hazardous
materials, including asbestos and NORM. Hazardous materials, including
asbestos and NORM, may have come into contact with various environmental
media, including water, soils, or sediment. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 3.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement, except with
respect to the representations and warranties of Seller in Section 4.16,
Seller makes no, and hereby disclaims any, representation or warranty, express
or implied, with respect to the presence or absence of NORM, asbestos,
mercury, drilling fluids and chemicals, Hazardous Substances and produced
waters and Hydrocarbons in or on the Properties or Equipment.

3.5 Environmental Defects. As used in this Agreement, the term "Environmental
Defect" means (a) a condition, matter, obligation, event or circumstance with
respect to a given Asset that causes such Asset (or Seller with respect to
such Asset) to be in violation of Environmental Law or not to be in compliance
with, or to be subject to a remedial or corrective action obligation pursuant
to, Environmental Law or (b) the existence as of the Defect Claim Date of with
respect to the Assets or the operation thereof of any environmental pollution,
contamination or degradation in excess of standards permitted under
Environmental Law; provided, however, that the term "Environmental Defect"
shall not include (i) obligations to plug or abandon any well or (ii) the
matters that are disclosed on Schedule 3.5.

3.6 Notice of Title and Environmental Defects and Benefits; Adjustment.

(a)If Purchaser elects to assert a claim for a Title Defect, Purchaser must
deliver a defect claim notice or notices to Seller on or before 5:00 p.m.
local time in Houston, Texas on the date that is fifty (50) days after the
Execution Date (the "Defect Claim Deadline"), provided that Purchaser shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to give Seller, on or before the end of
each calendar week prior to the Defect Claim Deadline, written notice of all
alleged Title Defects discovered by Purchaser during such calendar week, which
notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the Defect Claim
Deadline, provided, further, that failure of Purchaser to comply with such
weekly notice requirement shall not be deemed a waiver of any of Purchaser's
rights hereunder with respect to such Title Defects. Each such defect claim
notice shall be in writing and shall include:

(i)a detailed description of the alleged Title Defect(s);

(ii)the Property affected (and the Target Formation with respect to such
Property if less than all Target Formations are affected);

(iii)the Allocated Value of the Property subject to the alleged Title
Defect(s);

(iv)to the extent available, copies of supporting documents reasonably
necessary for Seller (as well as any attorney or examiner hired by Seller) to

(v)Purchaser's reasonable estimate of the Title Defect Amount attributable to
such individual alleged Title Defect and the reasonable computations and
information upon which Purchaser's estimate is based.

to such individual alleged Title Defect is less than the amount set forth in
Section 3.9(a)(viii)(A).

WITHOUT LIMITATION OF PURCHASER'S RIGHT TO INDEMNIFICATION SET FORTH IN
ARTICLE 11 WITH RESPECT TO BREACHES OF SECTIONS 4.2, 4.6, 4.12(D), 4.16 OR 6.4
AND SECTION 11.2(B)(I) WITH RESPECT TO CLAUSES (E), (J) AND (K) IN THE
DEFINITION OF "RETAINED OBLIGATIONS," PURCHASER SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED
AND RELEASED, AND COVENANTS THAT IT SHALL WAIVE AND RELEASE, ANY AND ALL
ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECTS AND OTHER DEFECTS AND DAMAGES RELATED TO THE
ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION OF THE PROPERTIES OR THE PRESENCE OF HAZARDOUS
MATERIALS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH MATTERS WOULD CONSTITUTE AN ENVIRONMENTAL

THERETO) FOR WHICH SELLER HAS NOT RECEIVED, ON OR BEFORE THE DEFECT CLAIM
DEADLINE, A VALID

ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECT CLAIM NOTICE THAT SATISFIES ALL OF THE CONDITIONS AND
REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 3.6(C).

(d)Purchaser agrees to reasonably cooperate with Seller in reviewing and
commenting on any curative materials provided by Seller (or Seller's
representatives) to Purchaser with respect to potential Title Defects and
Environmental Defects of which Seller is made aware of prior to Closing.
Failure of Purchaser to comply with the covenants of this Section 3.6(d) shall
not be deemed a waiver of any of Purchaser's rights hereunder with respect to
such Title Defects, Title Benefits or Environmental Defects.

3.7 Cure; Removal.

(a)Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at
Seller's sole cost, risk, and expense, to cure or remove to the reasonable
satisfaction of Purchaser, on or before ninety (90) days after the Closing
Date (the "Cure Date"), any alleged Title Defects or Environmental Defects of
which Seller has been advised by Purchaser pursuant to Section 3.6(a) or
3.6(c). To exercise such cure right Seller shall provide written notice to
Purchaser of its intent to attempt to cure such alleged Title Defects or
Environmental Defects on or before 5:00 p.m. local time in Houston, Texas, on
the date that is at least one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing Date. With
respect to any Title Defect or Environmental Defect that Seller elects to cure
pursuant to this Section 3.7(a), the Title Defect Amounts and Environmental
Defect Amounts with respect to such Title Defect or Environmental Defect shall
be addressed as provided in Section 3.8(e) for purposes of Closing and
thereafter any adjustment required under Section 3.8(a) with respect thereto
shall be made pursuant to Section 3.8(f). The election by Seller to attempt to
cure one or more of such alleged Title Defects or Environmental Defects shall
not affect the rights and obligations of the Parties under Section 3.10 with
respect to dispute resolution. Seller's election to attempt cure an alleged
Title Defect or Environmental Defect shall not constitute a waiver of any of
the rights of Seller pursuant to this Article 3, including Seller's right to
dispute the existence, nature, or value of such Title Defect or Environmental
Defect. As soon as reasonably practical after Seller cures a Title Defect or
Environmental Defect, but in any event no later than the Cure Date, Seller
shall provide Purchaser a written notice of such cure (a "Cure Notice"). In
the event that any such cure efforts for Environmental Defects require Seller
and its representatives to access the Assets after Closing, Purchaser shall
provide Seller reasonable access during the Cure Period to the affected Assets
that are operated by Purchaser (but shall have no obligation to seek or
provide access for affected Assets operated by a third party) and the Parties
shall enter into a commercially typical and reasonable access and indemnity
agreement relating to such access that is mutually acceptable to the Parties.
In performing any such on-site curative actions, Seller shall keep Purchaser
reasonably apprised of the status, scope and work program therefor. Purchaser
shall have the right to consent to any contractor who will access the Assets
to perform such curative work on Seller's behalf, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(b)With respect to any Title Defect or Environmental Defect which Seller has
elected to attempt to cure pursuant to Section 3.7(a) above, subject to the
determination by the Title Arbitrator or Environmental Arbitrator, as
applicable, of the existence or Title Defect Amount or Environmental Defect
Amount with respect to such a Title Defect or Environmental Defect, to the
extent any such Title Defect or Environmental Defect is cured by Seller on or
before the Cure Date, the amount of any previous deduction from the Unadjusted
Purchase Price for such Title Defect or Environmental Defect shall be
addressed as provided in Section 3.8(f).

(c)Any dispute relating to whether and to what extent a Title Defect or
Environmental Defect has been cured shall be deemed to be a Disputed Matter
and shall be resolved as set forth in Section 3.10, except that on or after
ten (10) Business Days after the date that Seller delivers to Purchaser the
Cure Notice either Party may notify the other Party of its election to submit
any such matter to arbitration

and thereafter the Parties shall promptly submit such matter to the Title
Arbitrator or Environmental Arbitrator, as applicable; provided, however, that
any prior or concurrent determination by a Title Arbitrator or Environmental
Arbitrator with respect to Title Defects or Environmental Defects (or factual
or legal matters relating thereto, even if determined in connection with the
resolution of an otherwise unrelated dispute) which Seller has elected to
attempt to cure pursuant to Section 3.7(a) shall be binding on the Parties
with respect to such Title Defect or Environmental Defect (or factual or legal
matters relating thereto, even if determined in connection with the resolution
of an otherwise unrelated dispute).

(d)Seller shall have the right to exclude an Asset from this Agreement if
Purchaser's estimate of the Environmental Defect Amount, as set forth in a
notice delivered in accordance with 3.6(c), in each case, exceeds eighty
percent (80%) of the Allocated Value of the Asset affected thereby, in which
case, (A) the affected Asset shall not be conveyed to Purchaser at Closing,
(B) the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced at Closing by the Allocated
Value of such Asset (without regard to the limitations set forth in Section
3.9(c)(iv)), (C) such Asset shall be deemed to be deleted from Exhibit A‑1
and/or Exhibit A‑2 attached hereto and added to Schedule 1.3 attached hereto
and (D) such Asset shall constitute an Excluded Asset for all purposes
hereunder; provided that in such event the Environmental Defect Amount for the
affected Asset(s) so excluded will not count towards the deductible set forth
in Section 3.9(c)(iv)(B).

3.8 Adjustment for Title Defects and Benefits and Environmental Defects.

(a)With respect to each Asset for which Title Defects or Environmental Defects
have been reported under Section 3.6(a) or 3.6(c), such Asset shall, unless
Seller exercises its right in Section 3.7(d), be assigned at Closing subject
to all Title Defects and Environmental Defects, and the Purchase Price (either
at Closing or post-Closing, depending on when such Title Defects and
Environmental Defects are agreed upon by the Parties, exclusively and finally
resolved by arbitration pursuant to Section 3.10(a) or Section 3.10(b) or
cured, as applicable), shall be reduced by (i) in the case of Title Defects,
an amount determined pursuant to Section 3.9(a) (the "Title Defect Amount"),
and (ii) in the case of an Environmental Defect, an amount determined pursuant
to Section 3.9(c) (the "Environmental Defect Amount"), in each case as
provided in Sections 3.8(d), 3.8(e) and 3.8(f), as applicable.

(b)With respect to each Property affected by Title Benefits reported under
Section 3.6(b), such Property shall be assigned at Closing with such Title
Benefits, and any reduction to the Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to
Section 3.8(a) (either at Closing or post-Closing, depending on when such
Title Benefits are agreed upon by the Parties or exclusively and finally
resolved by arbitration pursuant to Section 3.10(a), as applicable) shall be
offset by an amount as determined pursuant to Section 3.9(b) (the "Title
Benefit Amount"), in each case as provided in Sections 3.8(d), 3.8(e) and
3.8(f), as applicable.

(c)Seller and Purchaser shall attempt to agree upon all the existence of any
Title Defects, Title Benefits or Environmental Defects reported pursuant to
Sections 3.6(a), 3.6(b) and 3.6(c) above, as applicable, and any corresponding
Title Defect Amounts, Title Benefit Amounts, and Environmental Defect Amounts
on or before the Closing Date. If Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree by
the Closing Date, then, subject to Section 3.7, the Title Defects, Title
Benefits, Environmental Defects, reported pursuant to Sections 3.6(a), 3.6(b)
and 3.6(c), as applicable, and any corresponding Title Defect Amounts, Title
Benefit Amounts, and Environmental Defect Amounts which are then in dispute
(each, a "Disputed Matter") shall be exclusively and finally resolved by
arbitration pursuant to Section 3.10(a) with respect to Disputed Matters
concerning Title Defects, Title Benefits, Title Defect Amounts and/or Title
Benefit Amounts, and Section 3.10(b) with respect to Disputed Matters
concerning Environmental Defects and/or Environmental Defect Amounts.

(d)At Closing, the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be adjusted (i) in
accordance with Section 3.8(a) with respect to any Title Defects and
Environmental Defects which (A) Seller has not elected to attempt to cure
pursuant to Section 3.7(a) and (B) which are not Disputed Matters, and (ii) in
accordance with Section 3.8(b) with respect to any Title Benefits which are
not Disputed Matters.

(e)At Closing, an amount equal to the sum of all reasonably estimated Title
Defect Amounts and Environmental Defect Amounts (as determined in good faith
by Purchaser in its Title Defect and Environmental Defect claim notices) and
all reasonably estimated Title Benefit Amounts (as determined, with respect to
each Title Benefit, in good faith by the applicable Party providing a Title
Benefit claim notice) related to (i) any Title Defects and Environmental
Defects which Seller elects to attempt to cure pursuant to Section 3.7(a) or
(ii) which are Disputed Matters (such aggregate amount, the "Defect Escrow
Amount"), shall, after giving effect to the provisions of Sections
3.9(a)(viii), 3.9(b)(v) and 3.9(c)(iv), be deducted in the calculation of the
Closing Payment, as provided in Section 8.4(a); and at the Closing, Purchaser
shall deposit the Defect Escrow Amount into an escrow account (the "Defect
Escrow Account") established with JPMorgan Chase Bank (the "Defect Escrow
Agent") pursuant to an escrow agreement in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Parties (the "Defect Escrow Agreement"). The Defect Escrow
Amount shall be held, invested and disbursed in accordance with the terms of
this Article 3 and the Defect Escrow Agreement pending the curing or
resolution of the applicable Title Defects and Environmental Defects. Each
Party shall deliver to the Defect Escrow Agent any customary "know your
customer" information as requested by the Defect Escrow Agent. The fees and
expenses of the Defect Escrow Agent shall be borne one-half (1/2) by Purchaser
and one-half (1/2) by Seller.

(f)After Closing, (i) the Purchase Price shall be adjusted for any Title
Defects and Environmental Defects which (A) Seller elects to attempt to cure
pursuant to Section 3.7(a) and actually cures or (B) which are Disputed
Matters and (ii) any adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to
Section 3.8(a) and Section 3.8(f)(i), if any, will be offset by any Title
Benefits which are Disputed Matters as provided in this Section 3.8(f). Within
ten (10) Business Days after the determination of all Disputed Matters
submitted to a Title Arbitrator or Environmental Arbitrator pursuant to
Section 3.10(a) and Section 3.10(b), as applicable, the Parties shall, after
giving effect to the limitations provided in Section 3.9, execute joint
written instructions to the Defect Escrow Agent instructing it to pay (i) to
Purchaser, the sum of the Title Defect Amounts and Environmental Defect
Amounts associated with (A) those Title Defects and Environmental Defects
which Seller elected to attempt to cure pursuant to Section 3.7(a) which are
not Disputed Matters and which are not fully cured as provided in Section 3.7
(provided, however, if curative efforts by Seller mitigated an uncured Title
Defect or Environmental Defect, the Title Defect Amount or Environmental
Defect Amount associated with such Title Defect or Environmental Defect shall
be revised pursuant to Section 3.9(a) or Section 3.9(c), as applicable) and
(B) any Disputed Matters, determined in favor of Purchaser by the applicable
Title Arbitrator or Environmental Arbitrator under Section 3.10(a) or Section
3.10(b), less any offset for such sum of Title Benefits which are Disputed
Matters and are determined in favor of Seller by the Title Arbitrator under
Section 3.10(a) and (ii) to Seller, the remainder of the Defect Escrow Amount.
The Parties shall treat for Tax purposes, any amounts paid pursuant to this
Section 3.8(f) as an adjustment to the Purchase Price and any payment made
pursuant to this Section 3.8(f) shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to a bank account or accounts to be designated in writing by
the Party receiving such payment.

3.9 Calculation of Title Defect Amounts, Title Benefit Amounts, and
Environmental Defect Amounts.

(a)The Title Defect Amount resulting from a Title Defect shall be determined
as follows:

(i)if Purchaser and Seller agree in writing upon the Title Defect Amount, that
amount shall be the Title Defect Amount;

(ii)if the Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance, or other charge which is
liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount
necessary to be paid to unconditionally remove the Title Defect from Seller's
interest in the affected Property;

(iii)if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) Seller's
aggregate ownership of Net Acres for any Lease and (B) the amount of Net Acres
set forth for such Lease in Exhibit A‑1, then the Title Defect Amount shall be
the product of the Allocated Value of such Lease multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the difference between the number of Net Acres owned by
Seller in such Lease and the number of Net Acres set forth for such Lease in
Exhibit A‑1 and the denominator of which is the Net Acres set forth for such
Lease in Exhibit A‑1;

(iv)if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) Seller's Net
Revenue Interest for any Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest stated in
Exhibit A‑1 or Exhibit A‑2 for such Property, and for which there is not at
least a proportionate increase in Seller's Working Interest

or Net Acre ownership for such Property from that set forth in Exhibit A‑1 or
Exhibit A‑2, as applicable, for such Property, as applicable, then the Title
Defect Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Property
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the decrease in Seller's
Net Revenue Interest and the denominator of which is Seller's Net Revenue
Interest stated on Exhibit A‑1 or Exhibit A‑2 for such Property; provided,
however, that if the Title Defect does not affect the Property throughout its
entire productive life, the Title Defect Amount determined under this Section
3.9(a)(iv) shall be reduced to take into account the applicable time period
only;

(v)if the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden, or
charge upon, or other defect in title to, the affected Property of a type not
described in subsections (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) above, the Title Defect
Amount shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the
Property so affected, the portion of Seller's interest in the Property
affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the
potential discounted economic effect of the Title Defect over the productive
life of the affected Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect by
Purchaser and Seller, the age of the factual matters causing or constituting
the alleged Title Defect, the probability that title failure will occur with
respect to any Title Defect that represents only a possibility of title
failure, and such other factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation;

(vi)if a Title Defect is reasonably susceptible of being cured, the Title
Defect Amount shall be no greater than the reasonable cost and expense of
curing such Title Defect;

(vii)the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder or for which Purchaser otherwise receives credit
in the calculation of the Purchase Price; and

(viii)notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 3:

(A)an individual claim for a Title Defect for which a valid claim notice is
given prior to the Defect Claim Deadline shall only generate an adjustment to
the Unadjusted Purchase Price under this Article 3 if the Title Defect Amount
with respect thereto exceeds Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000); provided,
however, for purposes of determining whether the Title Defect Amount of a
Property that is a Lease exceeds Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000), the Title
Defect Amounts of all Properties that are a part of such Lease will be
aggregated;

(B)the aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title
Defects upon any given Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such
Property; and

(C)there shall be no adjustment to the Purchase Price for Title Defects unless
and until the aggregate of all Title Defect Amounts which would generate an
adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section
3.9(a)(viii)(A) exceeds one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the Unadjusted
Purchase Price, and then only to the extent that such aggregate amount exceeds
one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price.

(b)The Title Benefit Amount resulting from a Title Benefit shall be determined
as follows:

(i)if Purchaser and Seller agree in writing upon the Title Benefit Amount,
that amount shall be the Title Benefit Amount;

(ii)if the Title Benefit represents a discrepancy between (A) Seller's
aggregate Net Acre ownership in any Lease and (B) the amount of Net Acres
shown for such Lease in

Exhibit A‑1, then the Title Benefit Amount shall be the product of the
Allocated Value of such Lease multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which
is difference between the number of Net Acres owned by Seller in such Lease
and the number of Net Acres set forth for such Lease in Exhibit A‑1 and the
denominator of which is the Net Acres set forth for such Lease in Exhibit A‑1;

(iii)if the Title Benefit represents a discrepancy between (A) the Net Revenue
Interest for any Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest stated with respect
to such Property in Exhibit A‑1 or Exhibit A‑2, the Title Benefit Amount shall
be the product of the Allocated Value of the affected Property multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest increase and the
denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest stated in Exhibit A‑1 or
Exhibit A‑2 with respect to such Property; provided, however, that if the
Title Benefit does not affect a Property throughout the entire productive life
of the Property, the Title Benefit Amount determined under this Section
3.9(b)(iii) shall be reduced to take into account the applicable time period
only;

(iv)if a Title Benefit represents a right, circumstance, or condition of a
type not described in subsections (i), (ii) or (iii) above, the Title Benefit
Amount shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the
Property so affected (or in the event the Title Benefit is of the type
discussed in clause (iv) of the definition of thereof, the Allocated Value of
the Properties nearest by of the same or similar type and covering the same
Target Formation(s)), the portion of Seller's interest in the Property so
affected, the legal effect of the Title Benefit, the potential discounted
economic effect of the Title Benefit over the productive life of any affected
Property, the values placed upon the Title Benefit by Purchaser and Seller,
and such other factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation; and

(v)notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 3:

(A)an individual claim for a Title Benefit for which a valid claim notice is
given prior to the Defect Claim Deadline shall only be taken into account
under this Article 3 to offset Title Defect Amounts if the Title Benefit
Amount with respect thereto exceeds Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000);
provided, however, for purposes of determining whether the Title Benefit
Amount of a Property that is a Lease exceeds Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000),
the Title Benefit Amounts of all Properties that are a part of such Lease will
be aggregated; and

(B)in no event shall the Purchase Price be increased in respect of any Title
Benefit or Title Benefit Amount; rather the amount of all individual Title
Benefits that individually exceed the threshold described in clause (v) above
shall offset any downward adjustment to the Purchase Price to which Purchaser
would otherwise be entitled pursuant to this Agreement in respect of Title
Defects.

(c)The Environmental Defect Amount resulting from an Environmental Defect
shall be determined as follows:

(i)if Purchaser and Seller agree on the Environmental Defect Amount, that
amount shall be the Environmental Defect Amount;

(ii)the Environmental Defect Amount shall include but shall not exceed the
reasonable cost of the response required under Environmental Laws that
addresses the applicable Environmental Defect with the most cost-effective
Remediation of such Environmental Defect (considered as a whole, taking into
consideration any material impacts such response may have on the continued,
safe and prudent operation of the Affected Asset);

(iii)the Environmental Defect Amount with respect to an Environmental Defect
shall be determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in
another Environmental Defect Amount or adjustment to the Purchase Price
hereunder; and

(iv)notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 3:

(A)an individual claim for an Environmental Defect for which a valid claim
notice is given prior to the Defect Claim Deadline shall only generate an
adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price if the Environmental Defect Amount
with respect thereto exceeds One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000);

(B)there shall be no adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price for
Environmental Defects unless and until the aggregate of all Environmental
Defect Amounts which would generate an adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase
Price pursuant to Section 3.9(c)(iv)(A) exceeds one and one-half percent (1.5
%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price, and then only to the extent that such
aggregate amount exceeds one and one-half percent (1.5 %) of the Unadjusted
Purchase Price.

3.10 Dispute Resolution.

(a)Except as provided in Section 3.7(c), with respect to any Disputed Matter
concerning Title Defects, Title Benefits, Title Defect Amounts and/or Title
Benefit Amounts ("Disputed Title Matters"), on or after a date that is ten
(10) Business Days following the Closing Date, either Party may notify the
other Party of its election to submit all remaining Disputed Title Matters to
a title attorney with at least ten (10) years' experience in oil and gas
titles in the State of Texas, as selected by mutual agreement of Purchaser and
Seller (the "Title Arbitrator") and thereafter the Parties shall promptly
submit such remaining Disputed Title Matters to the Title Arbitrator. If
Purchaser and Seller have not agreed upon a Person to serve as Title
Arbitrator within ten (10) Business Days of a Party's election to submit such
Disputed Title Matters to the Title Arbitrator, the Parties shall, within five
(5) Business Days after the end of such ten (10) Business Day period, formally
apply to the Houston, Texas office of the American Arbitration Association (or
in the event that there is no such office in Houston, Texas at such time, to
any other office of the American Arbitration Association) to choose the Title
Arbitrator and submit such Disputed Title Matters along with such application.
The Title Arbitrator shall not have worked as an employee or outside counsel
for any Party orits Affiliates during the ten (10) year period preceding the
arbitration or have any financial interest in the dispute other than the
payment of the Title Arbitrator's fees and expenses incurred as Title
Arbitrator.

(b)Except as provided in Section 3.7(c), with respect to any Disputed Matter
concerning Environmental Defects and Environmental Defect Amounts ("Disputed
Environmental Matters"), on or after a date that is ten (10) Business Days
following the Closing Date, either Party may notify the other Party of its
election to submit all remaining Disputed Environmental Matters to a reputable
environmental consultant with at least ten (10) years' experience in
corrective environmental action regarding oil and gas properties in the State
of Texas, as selected by mutual agreement of Purchaser and Seller (the
"Environmental Arbitrator") and thereafter the Parties shall promptly submit
such remaining Disputed Environmental Matters to the Environmental Arbitrator.
If Purchaser and Seller have not agreed upon a Person to serve as
Environmental Arbitrator within ten (10) Business Days of a Party's election
to submit such Disputed Environmental Matters to the Environmental Arbitrator,
the Parties shall, within five (5) Business Days after the end of such ten
(10) Business Day period, formally apply to the Houston, Texas office of the
American Arbitration Association (or in the event that there is no such office
in Houston, Texas at such time, to any other office of the American
Arbitration Association) to choose the Environmental Arbitrator and submit
such Disputed Environmental Matters along with such application. The
Environmental Arbitrator shall not have worked as an employee or outside
consultant for any Party or

its Affiliates during the ten (10) year period preceding the arbitration or
have any financial interest in the dispute other than the payment of the
Environmental Arbitrator's fees and expenses incurred as Environmental
Arbitrator.

(c)In each case above, the arbitration proceeding shall be held in Houston,
Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not
conflict with the terms of this Section 3.10. The Title Arbitrator's or
Environmental Arbitrator's determination, as applicable, shall be made within
forty-five (45) days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be
final and binding upon the Parties, without right of appeal. In making their
respective determinations, the Title Arbitrator and the Environmental
Arbitrator shall be bound by the provisions of this Article 3 and may consider
such other matters as, in the opinion of the Title Arbitrator or Environmental
Arbitrator (as applicable), are necessary or helpful to make a proper
determination. The Title Arbitrator and Environmental Arbitrator may consult
with and engage disinterested third Persons to advise the arbitrator,
including petroleum engineers. The Title Arbitrator and Environmental
Arbitrator shall act as experts for the limited purpose of determining the
specific Disputed Matters submitted by any Party, may only award Seller's
position or Purchaser's position with respect to Title Defect Amounts, Title
Benefit Amounts and Environmental Defect Amounts (or a position in between
Seller's position and Purchaser's position) and may not award damages,
interest, fees or penalties to any Party with respect to any matter. Seller
and Purchaser shall each bear their own legal fees and other costs of
presenting their respective cases to any Title Arbitrator or Environmental
Arbitrator pursuant to this Section 3.10. The fees and expenses of the Title
Arbitrator and Environmental Arbitrator shall be paid by Seller, on the one
hand, and by Purchaser, on the other hand, based upon the proportion as
determined by such Title Arbitrator or Environmental Arbitrator, in each case,
that the amount actually contested but not awarded to Seller or Purchaser,
respectively, bears to the aggregate amount actually contested by Seller and
Purchaser.

3.11 Notice to Holders of Consent and Preferential Purchase Rights. No later
than ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof, Seller shall prepare and
send (a) notices to the holders of any consents to the assignment of the
Assets that may be triggered by the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including to the holders of Material Consents that are set forth on
Schedule 4.9(b) but excluding any consent or approval of Governmental
Authorities customarily obtained after Closing) requesting consents to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) notices to the holders of
any applicable preferential rights to purchase or similar rights requesting
waivers of such rights, including those that are set forth on Schedule 4.9(a),
in each case, in compliance with the terms of such rights. Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such consent to assignment of the
Assets and such preferential right to purchase to be obtained and delivered or
waived, as applicable, prior to Closing; provided, that except as provided in
the following sentence, Seller shall not be required to make any payments or
undertake any material obligations for the benefit of the holders of such
rights in order to obtain the consents and waivers. Seller shall be obligated
to pay any amount in accordance with the current University of Texas
System/University Lands Rate and Damage Schedule to the extent necessary to
obtain consents to assignment for an Asset. Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with Seller in seeking to obtain such
consents, approvals, permissions, and waivers; provided, that Purchaser shall
not be required to make any payments or undertake any obligations or
liabilities in order to obtain such consents, approvals, permissions and
waivers.

3.12 Consent Requirements.

(a)Unless the Parties otherwise agree in writing, in no event shall there be
transferred at Closing any Asset (other than a Right of Way) for which a
Material Consent has not been obtained prior to Closing.

(b)In cases in which the Asset subject to such an un-obtained Material Consent
is an Asset other than a Property, and Purchaser is assigned the Property or
Properties to which such Asset relates, but such Asset is not transferred to
Purchaser due to the un-waived Material Consent requirement, until the date of
the final adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price under Sections 8.4(b) or
8.4(c) (the "Final Adjustment Date"), the Parties shall continue to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Material Consent so that such
Asset can be transferred to Purchaser upon receipt of the Material Consent,
and, if permitted pursuant to applicable Law and agreement, such Asset shall
be held by Seller for the benefit of Purchaser, Purchaser shall pay all
amounts due thereunder or with respect thereto, and Purchaser shall be
responsible for the performance of any obligations under or with respect to
such Asset to the extent that Purchaser has been transferred the Assets
necessary to such performance until the applicable Material Consent is
obtained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except for payments by Seller in
accordance with the current University of Texas System/University Lands Rate
and Damage Schedule, neither Party shall be required to make any payments or
undertake any material obligations for the benefit of the holders of any
un‑obtained Material Consents subject to this Section 3.12(b). With respect to
the Assets for which the un‑obtained Material Consent is not obtained by or
before the Final Adjustment Date, Seller shall promptly reimburse Purchaser
for the costs and expenses paid by Purchaser associated with such Assets and
Purchaser shall promptly reimburse Seller for the revenues associated with
such Assets.

(c)In cases in which the Asset subject to such a Material Consent requirement
is a Property and the Material Consent to the transfer of such Property is not
obtained by Closing, either Party may elect to exclude the Property subject to
such Material Consent and, subject to the remainder of this Section 3.12(c),
(i) the affected Property shall not be conveyed to Purchaser at Closing, (ii)
the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced at Closing by the Allocated
Value of such Property, (iii) such Property shall be deemed to be deleted from
Exhibit A‑1 and/or Exhibit A‑2 attached hereto and added to Schedule 1.3
attached hereto and (iv) such Property shall constitute an Excluded Asset for
all purposes hereunder. If any such Material Consent requirement with respect
to which an adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price is made under Section
2.3(b) is subsequently satisfied prior to the date of the final adjustment to
the Unadjusted Purchase Price under Section 8.4(b) or Section 8.4(c), (A)
Seller shall, promptly after such Material Consent requirement is satisfied,
convey the applicable Property to Purchaser; (B) the Parties shall deliver all
instruments and documents that would have been required under the terms hereof
to be delivered at Closing with respect to such Properties at Closing; (C)
Purchaser shall, simultaneously with the conveyance of the applicable
Property, pay the amount of any previous deduction from the Unadjusted
Purchase Price (subject to all other applicable adjustments with respect to
such Property (or portion thereof) under this Agreement); and (D) such
Property shall no longer be deemed to be (x) deleted from Exhibit A‑1 and/or
Exhibit A‑2, (y) added to Schedule 1.3 attached hereto and (z) an Excluded
Asset for any purposes hereunder. Notwithstanding the forgoing, in cases in
which the Asset subject to such a Material Consent requirement is a Right of
Way, such Right of Way shall nevertheless be assigned by Seller to Purchaser
at Closing as part of the Assets, without adjustment to the Purchase Price in
respect of such un-obtained consent, and Purchaser shall have no claim
against, and Seller shall have no liability for, the failure to obtain such
consent (provided that the forgoing shall not limit Purchaser's remedies under
this Agreement with respect to a breach by Seller of its covenants in Section
3.11).

(d)If Seller fails to obtain a consent prior to Closing and such consent is
not a Material Consent, then the Asset (or the portion thereof) subject to
such un-obtained consent shall nevertheless be assigned by Seller to Purchaser
at Closing as part of the Assets, without adjustment to the Purchase Price in
respect of such un-obtained consent, and Purchaser shall have no claim
against, and Seller shall have no liability for, the failure to obtain such
consent (provided that the forgoing shall not limit Purchaser's remedies under
this Agreement with respect to a breach by Seller of its covenants in Section
3.11).

3.13 Preferential Purchase Rights.

(a)Any preferential purchase right must be exercised subject to all terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, including the successful Closing of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 on the dates set forth herein. The
consideration payable under this Agreement for any particular Asset for
purposes of preferential purchase right notices shall be the Allocated Value
for such Asset, adjusted as set forth herein.

(b)If any preferential right to purchase any Asset is validly exercised prior
to Closing, (i) the affected Asset shall not be conveyed to Purchaser at
Closing, (ii) the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated
Value of such Asset, (iii) such Asset shall be deemed to be deleted from the
Exhibits attached hereto and added to Schedule 1.3 attached hereto, (iv) such
Asset shall constitute an Excluded Asset for all purposes hereunder, and (v)
Seller shall convey the affected Asset to the preferential right holder on the
terms and provisions set out in the applicable preferential right provision
and shall be entitled to the consideration paid by such holder.

(c)Should a third Person fail to validly exercise or waive its preferential
right to purchase as to any portion of the Assets prior to Closing, and the
time for exercise or waiver has not yet expired by Closing, then (i) such
Assets (or portions thereof) shall not be conveyed to Purchaser at Closing,
(ii) the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of
each such Asset (or portion thereof); (iii) each such affected Asset (or
portion thereof) shall be subject to the remainder of this Section 3.13(c) and
Section 3.13(d), and (iv) Seller shall continue to use commercially reasonable
efforts (without the obligation to make any payments or undertake any
obligations for the benefit of the holders of such preferential rights to
purchase) to obtain the waiver of the preferential purchase right and shall
continue to be responsible for the compliance therewith. Should the holder of
the preferential purchase right validly exercise the same after Closing, (A)
such affected Asset shall be deemed to be deleted from the Exhibits attached
hereto and added to Schedule 1.3 attached hereto, (B) such Asset (or portion
thereof) shall constitute an Excluded Asset for all purposes hereunder, and
(C) Seller shall convey the affected Asset (or portion thereof) to the
preferential right holder on the terms and provisions set out in the
applicable preferential right provision and Seller shall be entitled to the
consideration paid by such holder.

(d)In the event that, after Closing, a preferential purchase right with
respect to an Asset (or portion thereof) not conveyed to Purchaser at Closing
pursuant to Section 3.13(c) is waived or the time for exercise of such right
has expired pursuant to its terms without exercise in writing by the holder
thereof, (i) Purchaser shall purchase the affected Asset (or portion thereof)
on the terms set forth in this Agreement at a delayed closing which shall
occur within ten (10) Business Days following the date on which Seller obtains
such waiver, or the time period for exercising the applicable preferential
right has expired (which date shall, with respect to such Asset, or portion
thereof, be considered to be the Closing Date), (ii) the Parties shall deliver
all instruments and documents that would have been required under the terms
hereof to be delivered at Closing with respect to such Asset at such delayed
Closing; and (iii) Purchaser shall, simultaneously with the conveyance of the
applicable Asset (or portion thereof), pay the amount of any previous
deduction from the Unadjusted Purchase Price (subject to all other applicable
adjustments with respect to such Property under this Agreement) to Seller and
(iv) such Asset shall no longer be (A) deemed to be deleted from the Exhibits
attached hereto, (B) added to Schedule 1.3 attached hereto and (C) an Excluded
Asset for any purposes hereunder. Purchase Price adjustments calculated in the
same manner as the adjustments in Section 2.3 with respect to the affected
Asset (or portion thereof), if any, shall be calculated from the period from
and after the Effective Time to the date of the conveyance, and the net amount
of such adjustment, if positive, shall be paid by Purchaser to Seller, and, if
negative, by Seller to Purchaser at the delayed Closing.

material obligations to or by Seller) to obtain permission for Purchaser to
gain access to third Person operated Properties to inspect the condition of
the same. Seller or its designee shall have the right to accompany Purchaser
and its representatives whenever they are on site on the Assets.

6.2 Notification of Breaches. Without limiting the Seller Group's or Purchaser
Group's right to indemnification or to assert its right to seek

or warranties are untrue or shall become untrue in any material respect
between the date hereof and the Closing Date, or (ii) any of the other Party's
covenants or agreements to be performed or observed prior to or on the Closing
Date shall not have been so performed or observed in any material respect,
but, in each case, if such breach of representation, warranty, covenant, or
agreement shall (if curable) be cured to the reasonable satisfaction of the
non-breaching Party on or before the Closing, then such breach shall be
considered not to have occurred for all purposes of this Agreement.

Purchaser or Seller to such Party's investors and prospective investors, such
Party's employees and other Persons, provided such press releases and

compliance of its respective Affiliates. The Parties agree that neither
Purchaser nor Seller will have an adequate remedy at law if any of the
foregoing Persons violate (or threaten to violate) any of the terms of this
Section 6.3. In such event, Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, shall have the

Purchaser's approval of any action restricted by this Section 6.4 shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed and shall be considered granted in full
within five (5) Business Days (unless a shorter time is reasonably required by
the circumstances and such shorter time is specified in Seller's notice) of
delivery of Seller's notice to Purchaser requesting such consent unless
Purchaser notifies Seller to the contrary during that period; provided, that
Purchaser's consent with respect to the matters addressed in Sections 6.4(a)
and 6.4(i) may be withheld in Purchaser's sole discretion. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 6.4, in the event of an emergency, Seller
may take such action as reasonably necessary and shall notify Purchaser of
such action promptly thereafter. Purchaser acknowledges that Seller owns

undivided interests in the Assets and may not be the operator of all of the
Assets, and Purchaser agrees that the acts or omissions of third Persons
(including the applicable operators of the Assets) who are not Affiliates of
Seller shall not constitute a violation of the provisions of this Section 6.4,
nor shall any action required by a vote of working interest owners constitute
such a violation so long as Seller and its controlled Affiliates have voted
their respective interests in a manner consistent with the provisions of this
Section 6.4. Any matter approved (or deemed approved) by Purchaser pursuant to
this Section 6.4 that would otherwise constitute a breach of one or more of
Seller's representations and warranties in Article 4 shall be deemed to be an
exclusion from all representations and warranties for which it is relevant.

6.5 Indemnity Regarding Access. Prior to Closing, Purchaser's access to the
Assets and its (and its Affiliates and representatives) examinations and
inspections, whether under Section 6.1, Section 3.4, or otherwise, shall be at

ALL CLAIMS AGAINST SELLER, ITS AFFILIATES, AND EACH OF THEIR RESPECTIVE
PARTNERS, MEMBERS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, ATTORNEYS, CONTRACTORS,
AGENTS, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES, ARISING IN ANY WAY THEREFROM, OR IN ANY WAY
CONNECTED THEREWITH, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR
WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF SUCH PERSONS. Subject to Purchaser Group's right to
indemnification under Article 11, Purchaser agrees to indemnify, defend, and
hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates, the other owners of interests in the
Properties, and all such Persons' directors, officers, employees, agents, and
representatives from and against any and all Damages, including Damages
attributable to personal injury, death, or property damage, arising out of, or
relating to, access to the Assets prior to the Closing by Purchaser, its
Affiliates, or its or their respective directors, officers, employees, agents,
or representatives, EVEN IF CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE
(WHETHER SOLE, JOINT, OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT
OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PERSON, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE
OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF SUCH PERSONS AND EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT SUCH DAMAGES
ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO, ARISE OUT OF OR ARE IN CONNECTION WITH CONDITIONS

applicable Affiliates to make) (i) all required filings, and prepare
applications to, and conduct negotiations with, each Governmental Authority as
to which such filings, applications or negotiations are necessary or
appropriate in the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
(ii) provide such information as the other may reasonably request in order to
make such filings, prepare such applications and conduct such negotiations.
Each Party shall reasonably cooperate with and use all reasonable efforts to
assist the other with respect to such filings, applications and negotiations.
Purchaser and Seller shall each bear one-half of the cost of all filing or
application fees payable to any Governmental Authority with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, regardless of whether Purchaser,
Seller, or any Affiliate of any of them is required to make the payment.

(b)On or before the Closing Date, Purchaser shall have posted or obtained such
Credit Support from Governmental Authorities or that is otherwise set forth on
Schedule 4.17 in each case as may be required for the ownership of the Assets,
and shall provide Seller with evidence of the same.

(c)Promptly after Closing, Purchaser (with the assistance of Seller, subject
to Section 12.3) shall (i) record all assignments executed at Closing in the
records of the applicable Governmental Authority, (ii) actively pursue the

consents and approvals customarily obtained after closing as may be required

6.7 Further Assurances. After Closing, Seller and Purchaser each agrees to

further documents as are reasonably requested by the other for carrying out
the purposes of this Agreement or of any document delivered pursuant to this

operatorship of the Assets to be transferred to Purchaser. Purchaser

6.9 Satisfaction of Closing Conditions. Subject to the other terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each Party agrees to use commercially reasonable

this Agreement, in which case such different standard shall apply) to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and to ensure (to the extent possible) the satisfaction of its
conditions to Closing set forth in Section 7.1 (with respect to Purchaser) or
Section 7.2 (with respect to Seller).

6.10 Confidentiality. Seller and Purchaser each acknowledge that confidential
information of the other may be disclosed to, made available to, or otherwise
obtained by such Party (in its capacity as the recipient of such confidential
information, the "Receiving Party"), whether prior to or after the date of
this Agreement. Receiving Party shall hold such information in accordance with
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement; provided that the phrase "enter
into a definitive agreement" in the first sentence of Section 12 of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall be disregarded and the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement as they apply to this Section 6.10 shall not
terminate until the Closing (if the Closing occurs). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained therein, if the Closing should occur, the
confidentiality obligations with respect to Purchaser and its representatives
in the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue with respect to the Excluded
Assets but not otherwise and shall be deemed terminated for all purposes with
respect to the Assets.

6.11 Tag Rights.

with its Tag Rights Agreement.

(b)Promptly upon execution of this Agreement, Seller shall send to each Tags

Seller's intent to sell and Purchaser's intent to purchase the interests of
each Tag Rights Seller, in each case, in compliance with the applicable Tag
Rights Agreement (each, a "Tag Rights Notice"), and Purchaser shall offer to
purchase all of such Tag Right Seller's right title and interest in and to the
properties subject to the Tag Rights Agreement using the form of offer
attached hereto as Exhibit F. Seller shall promptly provide Purchaser updates
as to the status (and copies) of the delivery of the Tag Rights Notices and
any written correspondence, elections or waivers among Seller and each Tag
Rights Seller regarding such Tag Right Seller's tag right.

6.12 Amendment to Schedules. Purchaser agrees that, with respect to the
representations and warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement, Seller
shall have the continuing right until the Closing to add, supplement, or amend
the Seller Disclosure Schedules to the representations and warranties of
Seller with respect to any matter hereafter arising or (with respect to a
representation or warranty qualified by Seller's knowledge) discovered which,
if existing or (if applicable) known at the Execution Date or thereafter,
would have been required to be set forth or described in such Seller
Disclosure Schedules. For all purposes of this Agreement, including for
purposes of determining whether the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 have
been fulfilled, the Disclosure Schedules attached to this Agreement shall be
deemed to include only that information contained therein on the Execution
Date and shall be deemed to exclude all information contained in any addition,
supplement, or amendment thereto; provided, however, that if (a) if any
matters disclosed pursuant to any such addition, supplement or amendment at or
prior to Closing would, individually or in the aggregate, constitute a breach
of any of the representations or warranties of Seller set forth in Article IV
such that Purchaser's conditions to Closing set forth in Section 7.2 are not
satisfied, (b) Seller certifies to Purchaser in writing that such condition(s)
remain unsatisfied and (c) Purchaser nonetheless elects to proceed with the
Closing and the Closing occurs, then all matters disclosed pursuant to any
such addition, supplement, or amendment at or prior to the Closing shall be
waived and Purchaser shall not be entitled to make a claim with respect
thereto pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise; provided
further, however, that nothing in this Section 6.12 shall be deemed to limit
or otherwise affect Purchaser's indemnification rights under Section
11.2(b)(i) with respect to clause (c) of the definition of Retained
Obligations.

6.13 Seller Indebtedness. Seller shall use reasonable efforts to obtain on or
prior to the Closing Date releases and terminations (including UCC-3
termination statements) of any mortgages, deeds of trust, assignments of
production, financing statements, and fixture filings with respect to existing
indebtedness of Seller or its Affiliates secured by the Assets, which releases

efforts to cause its Affiliates to cooperate) with Purchaser and its
Affiliates and their respective agents and representatives to provide
information that is within its possession or, if such information is in the
possession of third Persons, which it can obtain or cause to be provided
without unreasonable effort or expense, regarding the Assets to the extent
Purchaser believes it is reasonably necessary for Purchaser and its Affiliates
in connection with any filings, financial statements relating to the Assets or
to Seller or its Affiliates meeting the requirements of Regulation S-X

Purchaser's Auditor of any financial statements relating to the Assets that
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates reasonably requests and that is necessary
to comply with the requirements of applicable securities Laws or other Tax,
financial or reporting requirements. Such cooperation will include (i)
reasonable access to Seller's officers, managers, employees, agents and
representatives who were responsible for preparing or maintaining the
financial records and work papers and other supporting documents used in the
preparation of such financial statements as may be reasonably required by
Purchaser's Auditor to perform an audit or conduct a review in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards or to otherwise verify such financial
statements, (ii) delivery of one or more customary representation letters from
Seller to Purchaser's Auditor that are reasonably requested by Purchaser to
allow such auditors to complete an audit (or review of any financial
statements), and to issue an opinion acceptable to Purchaser's Auditor with
respect to an audit or review of those financial records required pursuant to
this Section 6.14(b) and (iii) using reasonable efforts to obtain the consent
of the independent auditor of Seller that conducted any audit of such
financial statements to be named as an expert in any report filed by Purchaser
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Purchaser will reimburse
Seller promptly, but not later than ten (10) Business Days after receipt of
demand in writing therefor, for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by Seller or its Affiliates (or their respective accountants
and auditors) in complying with the provisions of Section 6.14.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall expand Seller's
representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements set forth in this
Agreement or give Purchaser, its Affiliates, or any third Person any rights to
which it is not entitled hereunder.

(c)For a period of three (3) years following the Closing Date, Seller shall,
and shall cause its respective Affiliates to, retain all books, records,
information and documents in its or their possession that are reasonably
necessary to prepare and audit financial statements with respect to the

Purchaser in connection with Closing. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold
harmless Seller Group from and against any and all Damages suffered or
incurred by them arising from any claims by third Persons or Governmental
Authorities against them in connection with any action taken by them at the
request of Purchaser pursuant to Section 6.14 or in connection with the
arrangement of any financings or securities offerings and any filing made
pursuant to applicable securities Laws or other disclosures in connection with
any such financings or securities offerings, except to the extent such Damages
arise as a result of the gross negligence or intentional misconduct of any
member of the Seller Group.

6.15 Non-Negotiation. From and after the Execution Date up to and including
the Closing Date (or earlier termination of this Agreement), Seller shall not,
and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, (a) actively
market the sale of any material portion of the Assets to any Person other than
Purchaser or its Affiliates (an "Acquisition Transaction"), (b) solicit or
initiate negotiations, submissions of proposals or offers in respect of any
Acquisition Transaction, or (c) permit any Person (other than Purchaser and
its Affiliates and their respective advisors) to conduct any on-site diligence
with respect to the Assets for the purposes of an Acquisition Transaction.

6.16 Personnel.

(a)Schedule 6.16 sets forth a list of employees of Seller or its Affiliate who
may be considered for employment by Purchaser or its Affiliates (collectively,
the "Available Employees"). Seller shall make available for interview by
Purchaser or its Affiliates, at Purchaser's request, the Available Employees
within five (5) days after the Execution Date. In the event that Purchaser
chooses to interview an Available Employee prior to the Closing (an
"Interview"), Purchaser shall have the right, but not the obligation, at the
sooner of (i) fourteen (14) Business Days after the Interview or (ii) ten (10)
days prior to Closing, to make a written offer of employment or consultancy
(as an employee, contractor or consultant) to an Available Employee that is
conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing, as further described in Section
6.16(b). Any such offer of employment shall include employment terms that
credit employment

service with Seller and its Affiliates under the employee benefit plans
maintained by Purchaser or its Affiliate for purposes of eligibility and
vesting (but not for benefit accruals). No such offer of employment or
consultancy shall be for employment or consultancy that begins prior to the
Closing.

(b)To the extent that Purchaser intends to make any offer to any of the
Available Employees, Purchaser shall provide written notice of the offer (and
the terms and conditions thereof, including the proposed term, compensation
and benefits offered) to Seller. If, within one (1) year after Closing,
Purchaser intends to make any offer of employment or consultancy (as employee,
contractor or consultant) to any Available Employee that did not become an
employee or consultant to the Purchaser at the Closing, Purchaser will provide
Seller with written notice at least five (5) Business Days prior to making any
such offer (and the terms and conditions thereof, including the proposed term,
compensation and benefits offered).

(c)Seller and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
Section 6.16 are included for the sole benefit of Seller and Purchaser and
that nothing contained herein, express or implied, is intended to (i) confer
upon any Person (including any Available Employee) any right to an offer of
employment or continued employment for any period or continued receipt of any
specific employee benefit, (ii) constitute an amendment to or any other
modification of any employee benefit plan, program or agreement of any kind or
(iii) create any third party beneficiary or other rights in any other Person,
any participant in any benefit plan or any dependent or beneficiary thereof.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as limiting the power of Seller
or Purchaser or any of their Affiliates to amend or terminate any particular
employee benefit plan, program, agreement or policy or to amend the terms of
employment or compensation of any Transferring Employee or to terminate the
employment of any Transferring Employee at any time and for any reason.

6.17 Resolution of Seller Responsibility Suspense Amounts and Purchaser
Responsibility Suspense Amounts.

(a)Schedule 6.17 lists, as of the date set forth on Schedule 6.17, the Seller

(b)From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller of
any resolution or release of Purchaser Responsibility Suspense Amounts that
relates to Seller Responsibility Suspense Amounts and shall provide Seller
such information reasonably requested by Seller relating to such resolution or
release so that Seller can resolve or release its related Seller

of "Retained Obligations," Purchaser shall, to the extent reasonably requested
by Seller, cooperate with Seller in connection with such resolution or release
of Seller Responsibility Suspense Amounts.

(c)From and after the Closing Date, Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser of
any resolution or release of Seller Responsibility Suspense Amounts that
relates to Purchaser Responsibility Suspense Amounts and shall provide
Purchaser such information reasonably requested by Purchaser relating to such
resolution or release so that Purchaser can resolve or release its related
Purchaser Responsibility Suspense Amounts. Without limitation of Seller's
right to indemnification under Section 11.2(a)(i) with respect to Section
11.1(b), Seller shall, to the extent reasonably requested by Purchaser,
cooperate with Purchaser in connection with such resolution or release of
Purchaser Responsibility Suspense Amounts.

preliminary settlement statement, as agreed by the Parties, will be used to
adjust the Purchase Price at Closing, provided, however, that if the Parties
cannot agree on all adjustments set forth in the preliminary settlement
statement prior to the Closing, then any such unagreed adjustments as set
forth in the preliminary settlement statement presented by Seller will be used
to adjust the Purchase Price at Closing provided, further, that amounts in the
preliminary settlement statement with respect to Title Defect Amounts,
Environmental Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts shall be determined in
accordance with Article 3. The estimate determined in accordance with this
Section 8.4(a), less the Deposit and the Defect Escrow Amount as determined
pursuant to Section 3.8(e) (if any), shall constitute the dollar amount to be
payable by Purchaser to Seller at the Closing (the "Closing Payment").

(b)As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing but not later than the
ninetieth (90th) day following the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and
deliver to Purchaser a draft statement setting forth the final calculation of
the Purchase Price and showing the calculation of each adjustment under
Section 2.3, based on the most recent actual figures available for each
adjustment. Seller shall supply to Purchaser reasonable documentation in the
possession of Seller or its Affiliates reasonably necessary to support the
items for which adjustments are proposed or made in the settlement statement
delivered by Seller, and a brief explanation of any such adjustments and the
reasons therefor. As soon as reasonably practicable, but not later than the
thirtieth (30th) day following receipt of such statement from Seller,
Purchaser may deliver to Seller a written report containing any changes that
Purchaser proposes be made to such statement, which shall include reasonable
documentation in the possession of Purchaser or its Affiliates reasonably
necessary to support the proposed changes. Seller may deliver a written report
to Purchaser during this same period reflecting any changes that Seller
proposes to be made to such statement as a result of additional information
received after the statement was prepared. If Purchaser does not deliver

such report to Seller on or before the end of such thirty (30) day period,
Purchaser shall be deemed to have agreed with Seller's statement, and such
statement shall become final and binding upon the Parties, without limiting
payments made pursuant to Sections 9.1(c) or Purchaser's right to indemnity
under Section 11.2(b)(i) with respect to clause (c) of the definition of
Retained Obligations.

(c)The Parties shall undertake to agree on the final statement of the Purchase
Price no later than forty-five (45) days after delivery of Seller's statement.
In the event that the Parties cannot reach agreement within such period of
time, either Party may propose to the other Party that the Parties refer the
items of adjustment which are in dispute to the Houston, Texas office of a
nationally-recognized independent accounting firm or consulting firm mutually
acceptable to both Purchaser and Seller (the "Accounting Arbitrator"), for
review and final determination by arbitration and thereafter the Parties shall
promptly submit such items of adjustment which are in dispute to the
Accounting Arbitrator. If Purchaser and Seller have not agreed upon a mutually
acceptable Person to serve as the Accounting Arbitrator within ten (10)
Business Days of a Party proposing that the disputed items of adjustment be
referred to the Accounting Arbitrator, the Parties shall, within ten (10)
Business Days after the end of such initial ten (10) Business Day period,
formally apply to the Houston, Texas office of the American Arbitration
Association (or in the event that there is no such office in Houston, Texas at
such time, to any other office of the American Arbitration Association) to
choose the Accounting Arbitrator. The Accounting Arbitrator shall conduct the
arbitration proceedings in Houston, Texas in accordance with the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such
rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section 8.4(c). The Accounting
Arbitrator's determination shall be made within forty-five (45) days after
submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding on all
Parties, without right of appeal, without limiting payments made pursuant to
Sections 9.1(c) or Purchaser's right to indemnity under Section 11.2(b)(i)
with respect to clause (c) of the definition of Retained Obligations. In
determining the proper amount of any adjustment to the Purchase Price, the
Accounting Arbitrator shall be bound by the terms of Article 2 and may not
increase the Purchase Price more than the increase proposed by Seller nor
decrease the Purchase Price more than the decrease proposed by Purchaser, as
applicable. The Accounting Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited
purpose of determining the specific disputed aspects of Purchase Price
adjustments submitted by any Party and may not award damages, interest (except
as expressly provided for in this Section 8.4(c)) or penalties to any Party
with respect to any matter. Seller and Purchaser shall each bear their own
legal and accounting fees and other costs of presenting its case to the
Accounting Arbitrator. Seller shall bear one‑half and Purchaser shall bear
one‑half of the costs and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator. Within ten
(10) days after the earlier of (i) the expiration of Purchaser's thirty (30)
day review period without delivery of any written report or (ii) the date on
which the Parties or the Accounting Arbitrator finally determine the Purchase
Price, (x) Purchaser shall pay to Seller the amount by which the Purchase
Price (less the Deposit and the Defect Escrow Amount) exceeds the Closing
Payment or (y) Seller shall pay to Purchaser the amount by which the Closing
Payment exceeds the Purchase Price (less the Deposit and the Defect Escrow
Amount), as applicable.

(d)Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to assist Seller in preparation of
the final statement of the Purchase Price under Section 8.4(b) by furnishing
invoices, receipts, reasonable access to personnel, and such other assistance
as may be reasonably requested by Seller to facilitate such process post-
Closing.

(e)All payments made or to be made under this Agreement to a Party shall be
made by electronic transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account
as may be specified by such Party in writing.

ARTICLE 9

TAX MATTERS

9.1 Allocation of Asset Taxes.

(a)Seller shall be allocated and bear all Asset Taxes attributable to (i) any
Tax period ending prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the portion of any
Straddle Period ending immediately prior to the Effective Time. Purchaser
shall bear and be allocated all Asset Taxes attributable to (A) any Tax period
beginning on or after the Effective Time and (B) the portion of any Straddle
Period beginning at the Effective Time.

(b)For purposes of determining the allocations described in Section 9.1(a),
(i) Asset Taxes that are attributable to the severance or production of
Hydrocarbons (other than such Asset Taxes described in clause (iii), below)
shall be allocated to the period in which the severance or production giving
rise to such Asset Taxes occurred; provided that, if Purchaser becomes
entitled, pursuant to Section 2.4(a), to any amounts earned from the sale of
Hydrocarbons prior to the Effective Time, which amounts are received after the
Cut-Off Date, Purchaser shall be allocated all Asset Taxes attributable to the
production of such Hydrocarbons or the receipt of proceeds therefrom
notwithstanding that such Hydrocarbons were produced prior to the Effective
Time, (ii) Asset Taxes that are based upon or related to sales or receipts or
imposed on a transactional basis (other than such Asset Taxes described in
clause (i) or (iii)), shall be allocated to the period in which the
transaction giving rise to such Asset Taxes occurred, and (iii) Asset Taxes
that are ad valorem, property or other Asset Taxes imposed on a periodic basis
pertaining to a Straddle Period shall be allocated between the portion of such
Straddle Period ending immediately prior to the Effective Time and the portion
of such Straddle Period beginning at the Effective Time by prorating each such
Asset Tax based on the number of days in the applicable Straddle Period that
occur before the date on which the Effective Time occurs, on the one hand, and
the number of days in such Straddle Period that occur on or after the date on
which the Effective Time occurs, on the other hand. For purposes of clause
(iii) of the preceding sentence, the period for such Asset Taxes shall begin
on the date on which ownership of the applicable Assets gives rise to
liability for the particular Asset Tax and shall end on the day before the
next such date.

(c) 

(i)Subject to Section 9.1(c)(ii), Purchaser shall pay (or cause to be paid)
prior to delinquency, all Asset Taxes that become due after the Closing Date.
With respect to any such Asset Taxes that are attributable to any Tax period
beginning before the Effective Time, Purchaser shall send to Seller a
statement that allocates each such Asset Tax pursuant to Section 9.1 based
upon the amount of such Asset Tax actually invoiced and paid to the applicable
Governmental Authority by Purchaser. Such statement shall be accompanied by
proof of Purchaser's actual payment of each such Asset Tax. Within ten (10)
Business Days of receipt of each such statement and proof of payment, Seller
shall reimburse Purchaser for Seller's allocated portion of each such Asset
Tax, less any amounts reflected as a reduction in the Purchase Price
attributable to such Asset Tax pursuant to Section 2.3(g)(ii) (as reflected on
the settlement statement as finally determined pursuant to Section 8.4(b) or
Section 8.4(c), as applicable).

(ii)Notwithstanding Section 9.1(c)(i), Seller shall be responsible for paying
(or causing to be paid) prior to delinquency (i) any severance Asset Taxes
through the production month in which the Closing occurs and (ii) sales or use
Asset Taxes attributable to any Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or
prior to the Closing Date, in each case, that become due after the Closing
Date, and the

preparation and timely filing of any Tax Return relating to such Asset Taxes.
Seller shall provide Purchaser with copies of any such Tax Returns and proof
of payment of such Asset Taxes.

(iii)The Parties agree that (A) this Section 9.1(c) is intended to solely
address the timing and manner in which certain Tax Returns relating to Asset
Taxes are filed and the Asset Taxes shown thereon are paid to the applicable
taxing authority, and (B) nothing in this Section 9.1(c) shall be interpreted
as altering the manner in which Asset Taxes are allocated to and economically
borne by the Parties (except for any penalties, interest or additions to Tax
imposed as a result of any breach by a Party of its obligations under this
Section 9.1(c), which shall be borne by such Party).

9.2 Transfer Taxes. To the extent that any sales, purchase, transfer, stamp,
documentary stamp, registration, use or similar Taxes are payable by reason of
the sale of the Assets under this Agreement ("Transfer Taxes"), such Transfer
Taxes shall be borne and timely paid one-half by Purchaser and one-half by
Seller. Purchaser and Seller shall reasonably cooperate in good faith to
minimize, to the extent permissible under applicable Law, the amount of any
such Transfer Taxes.

9.3 Cooperation on Tax Matters. The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to
the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation, or other proceeding with
respect to Taxes relating to the Assets. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon another Party's request) the provision of records and
information that are relevant to any such Tax Return or audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
under this Agreement. Seller and Purchaser agree to retain all books and
records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Assets relating to any
taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the
statute of limitations of the respective taxable periods and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Authority.

9.4 1031 Like-Kind Exchange Cooperation. Seller and Purchaser agree that
either or both of Seller and Purchaser may elect to treat the acquisition or
sale of all or a portion of the Assets as an exchange of like-kind property
under Section 1031 of the Code (an "Exchange"), provided that Closing shall
not be delayed by reason of the Exchange. Each Party agrees to use reasonable
efforts to cooperate with the other Party in the completion of such an
Exchange including an Exchange subject to the procedures outlined in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1031(k)-1 and/or Internal Revenue Service Revenue
Procedure 2000-37. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall have the right at any
time prior to Closing to assign all or a portion of its rights under this
Agreement to a qualified intermediary (as that term is defined in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(v)) or an exchange accommodation
titleholder (as that term is defined in Internal Revenue Service Revenue
Procedure 2000-37) to effect an Exchange. In connection with any such
Exchange, any exchange accommodation title holder shall have taken all steps
necessary to own the Assets (or the applicable portion of the Assets) under
applicable Law. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that neither an assignment
of a Party's rights under this Agreement for purposes of an Exchange nor any
other actions taken by a Party or any other person in connection with the
Exchange shall release any Party from, or modify, any of their respective
liabilities and obligations (including indemnity obligations to each other)
under this Agreement, and no Party makes any representations as to any
particular Tax treatment that may be afforded to any other Party by reason of
such assignment or any other actions taken in connection with the Exchange.
Any Party electing to treat the acquisition or sale of all or a portion of the
Assets as an Exchange shall be obligated to pay all additional costs incurred
hereunder as a result of the Exchange, and in consideration for the
cooperation of the other Party, the Party electing Exchange treatment shall
agree to pay all costs associated with the Exchange and to indemnify and hold
the other Party, its Affiliates, and its and their respective former, current
and future partners, members, shareholders, owners, officers, directors,
managers, employees, agents and representatives harmless from and against any
and all Damages and Taxes arising out of, based upon, attributable to or
resulting from the Exchange or transactions or actions taken in

connection with the Exchange that would not have been incurred by the other
Party but for the electing Party's Exchange election.

9.5 Allocation of Purchase Price. Purchaser and Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to agree to an allocation of the Purchase Price and any
other items properly treated as consideration for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes among the Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and, to the extent allowed under
applicable federal income tax Law, in a manner consistent with the Allocated
Values, within thirty (30) days after the date that the final statement of the
Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to Section 8.4 (the
"Allocation"). If Seller and Buyer reach an agreement with respect to the
Allocation, (i) Purchaser and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to update the Allocation in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code following
any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii)
Purchaser and Seller shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, report
consistently with the Allocation, as adjusted, on all Tax Returns, including
Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 (Asset Acquisition Statement under Section
1060), which Purchaser and Seller shall timely file with the IRS, and neither
Seller nor Purchaser shall take any position on any Tax Return that is
inconsistent with the Allocation, as adjusted, unless otherwise required by
applicable Law; provided, however, that neither Party shall be unreasonably
impeded in its ability and discretion to negotiate, compromise and/or settle
any Tax audit, claim or similar proceedings in connection with such
allocation.

9.6 Tax Proceedings. After the Closing:

(a)Purchaser shall promptly provide Seller with written notice of any
inquiries, audits, examinations or proposed adjustments by any Governmental
Authority or any other Claim relating to Asset Taxes ("Tax Proceeding"), which
relates to any Asset Taxes for any Tax period ending prior to the Effective
Time other than a Straddle Period; provided that the failure of Purchaser to
give notice of a Tax Proceeding as provided in this Section 9.6(a) shall not
relieve Seller of its obligations under Section 6.5, Section 9.4 or Article
11, except to the extent such failure results in insufficient time being
available to permit Seller to effectively defend against the Tax Proceeding or
otherwise materially prejudices the Seller's ability to defend against the Tax
Proceeding. Seller shall have the sole right to defend any such Tax Proceeding
relating to any Tax period ending prior to the Effective Time, but not a
Straddle Period, provided that Purchaser shall have the right to participate
in any such Tax Proceeding and Seller shall not settle any such Tax Proceeding
without the written consent of Purchaser (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(b)The Parties shall promptly provide each other with notice of any Tax
Proceeding that relates to any Asset Taxes for any Straddle Period. Purchaser
and Seller shall jointly control the conduct of any Tax Proceeding relating to
Asset Taxes for a Straddle Period, and neither Purchaser nor Seller shall
settle any such Tax Proceeding without the written consent of the other Person
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(c)Seller shall promptly provide Purchaser with written notice of any Tax
Proceeding, which relates to any Asset Taxes for any Tax period beginning on
or after the Effective Time other than a Straddle Period. Except as provided
in Section 9.6(a) and Section 9.6(b), Purchaser shall have the right to
control all other Tax Proceedings with respect to Asset Taxes.

ARTICLE 10

TERMINATION

10.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
Closing:

(a)by the mutual prior written consent of Seller and Purchaser;

(b)by either Seller or Purchaser if the Closing has not occurred on or before
June 28, 2019;

(c)by Seller, at Seller's option, if any of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.1 (other than Sections 7.1(c) or 7.1(d)) have not been satisfied by
the Target Closing Date (except for those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Closing and that would have been capable of being
satisfied at the Closing) and, following written notice thereof from Seller to
Purchaser specifying the reason such condition is unsatisfied (including any
breach by Purchaser of this Agreement), such condition remains unsatisfied for
a period of fifteen (15) days after Purchaser's receipt of written notice
thereof from Seller; or

(d)by Purchaser, at Purchaser's option, if any of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.2 (other than Sections 7.2(c) or 7.2(d)) have not been satisfied by
the Target Closing Date (except for those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Closing and that would have been capable of being
satisfied at the Closing) and, following written notice thereof from Purchaser
to Seller specifying the reason such condition is unsatisfied (including any
breach by Seller of this Agreement), such condition remains unsatisfied for a
period of fifteen (15) days after Seller's receipt of written notice thereof
from Purchaser; or

(e)by either Seller or Purchaser if consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby is enjoined, restrained or otherwise prohibited or
otherwise made illegal by the terms of a final, non-appealable order;

provided, however, that Purchaser shall not be entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Sections 10.1(b) or 10.1(d) above if Purchaser is, at
such time, in material breach of this Agreement, and provided further that
Seller shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Sections
10.1(b) or 10.1(c) above if Seller is, at such time, in material breach of
this Agreement.

10.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 10.1, subject to the remainder of this Section 10.2 and Section 10.3,
this Agreement shall become void and of no further force or effect (except for
the provisions of Section 1.2, this Article 10, Sections 3.4(b), 4.10, 4.21,
5.10, 6.3, 6.5, 6.10, 11.3 (as it relates to claims under Section 6.5), 12.1,
12.2, 12.3, 12.5, 12.6, 12.7, 12.8, 12.10, 12.12, 12.13, 12.15, 12.16, and
12.17, all of which shall continue in full force and effect) and Seller shall
be free immediately to enjoy all rights of ownership of the Assets and to
sell, transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of all or any portion of the
Assets to any Person without any restriction under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the termination of
this Agreement under Section 10.1 shall, subject to the remainder of this
Section 10.2, not relieve any Party from liability for any failure to perform
or observe in any material respect any of its agreements or covenants
contained herein that are to be performed or observed at or prior to Closing.
In the event this Agreement is terminated by Seller under Sections 10.1(b) or
10.1(c), all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of Purchaser set
forth in Section 7.2 (other than those actions or deliveries to occur at
Closing or contingent upon the satisfaction of other conditions precedent set
forth in Section 7.2 at Closing) have been met (or waived in writing by
Purchaser), and Seller is ready, willing and able to perform its obligations
under Section 8.2), then Seller shall be entitled, at its sole and exclusive
remedy, to retain the Deposit, free of any claims by Purchaser or any other
Person. It is expressly stipulated by the Parties that the actual amount of
Damages resulting from any termination of the type set forth in this Section
10.2 would be difficult to determine accurately because of the unique nature
of this Agreement, the unique nature of the Assets, the uncertainties of
applicable commodity markets and differences of opinion with respect to such
matters, and that the Parties hereby agree and acknowledge that the amount of
the Deposit hereunder (a) represents a reasonable

estimate of the minimum amount of Damages that the Seller would suffer as a
result of such a termination and (b) represents reasonable consideration for
the Seller removing the Assets from the marketplace during the period from the
Execution Date until the termination hereof. In the event this Agreement is
terminated by Purchaser under Sections 10.1(b) or 10.1(d), all of the
conditions precedent to the obligations of Seller set forth in Section 7.1
(other than those actions or deliveries to occur at Closing or contingent upon
the satisfaction of other conditions precedent set forth in Section 7.1 at
Closing) have been met (or waived in writing by Seller), and Purchaser is
ready, willing and able to perform its obligations under Section 8.3), then
Purchaser shall receive back the Deposit, free of any claims by Seller or any
other Person and Purchaser shall be entitled to seek to recover Damages from
Seller equal to its actual out‑of‑pocket costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided that
any such recovery shall not exceed an amount equal to the Deposit.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if a Party has failed to
perform or observe in any material respect any of its agreements or covenants
contained herein which are to be performed or observed at, prior to or, if
Closing has occurred, after the Closing (including, if applicable, the
obligation of Seller to consummate the Closing, but specifically excluding the
obligation of Purchaser to consummate the Closing), the other Party may seek
specific performance of such covenant or agreement at any time prior to the
valid termination of this Agreement without the necessity of posting bond or
furnishing other security; provided, however, Seller shall not have the right
to specific performance of, or other equitable relief with respect to, the
obligation of Purchaser to consummate the Closing. Each Party understands and
agrees that the other Party may suffer irreparable damage as a result of it
failing to perform or observe in any material respect any of its agreements or
covenants contained herein which are to be performed or observed at, prior to
or, if Closing has occurred, after the Closing. Accordingly, each Party waives
any right it may have to challenge the enforceability of this Agreement by a
decree of specific performance and agrees it will not argue in any proceeding
that the requirements for specific performance have not been met, that
monetary damages constitute a sufficient remedy or make any other argument in
opposition to the specific performance of this Agreement.

10.3 Distribution of Deposit Upon Termination. If this Agreement is terminated
for any reason (other than a termination by Seller as permitted pursuant to
Sections 10.1(b) or 10.1(c) where Seller is entitled to retain the Deposit as
provided in Section 10.2), Seller shall deliver to Purchaser the Deposit, free
of any claims by Seller or any other Person with respect thereto.

ARTICLE 11

INDEMNIFICATION; LIMITATIONS

EVEN IF SUCH DAMAGES ARE CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER

INDEMNIFIED PERSON, INVITEE, OR THIRD PERSON, AND WHETHER OR NOT CAUSED BY A

(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, from
and after Closing, Seller's and Purchaser's sole and exclusive remedy against
each other with respect to breaches of the representations, warranties,
covenants, and agreements of the Parties contained in this Agreement
(excluding Sections 6.5 and 6.7, which shall also be separately enforceable by
Seller and Purchaser, as applicable, pursuant to whatever rights and remedies
are available to it outside of this Article 11), and the affirmations of such

(d)The Parties shall treat, for Tax purposes, any amounts paid pursuant to
this Article 11 as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

11.3 Indemnification Actions. Except as provided in this Article 11, all

(a)For purposes of this Article 11, the term "Indemnifying Person" when used
in connection with particular Damages shall mean the Person having an
obligation to indemnify another Person or Persons with respect to such Damages
pursuant to this Article 11, and the term "Indemnified Person" when used in
connection with particular Damages shall mean a Person having the right to be

indemnified with respect to such Damages pursuant to this Article 11, Section
6.5 or Section 9.4 (including, for the avoidance of doubt, those Persons
identified in Section 11.3(g)).

(b)To make a claim for indemnification under Section 6.5, Section 9.4 or this
Article 11, an Indemnified Person shall notify the Indemnifying Person of its
claim, including the specific details of and specific basis under this
Agreement for its claim (the "Claim Notice"). In the event that the claim for
indemnification is based upon a claim by a third Person against the
Indemnified Person (a "Claim"), the Indemnified Person shall provide its Claim
Notice promptly after the Indemnified Person has actual knowledge of the Claim
and shall enclose a complete copy of all papers (if any) served with respect
to the Claim; provided that the failure of any Indemnified Person to give
notice of a Claim as provided in this Section 11.3 shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Person of its obligations under Section 6.5, Section 9.4 or this
Article 11, except to the extent such failure results in insufficient time
being available to permit the Indemnifying Person to effectively defend
against the Claim or otherwise materially prejudices the Indemnifying Person's
ability to defend against the Claim. In the event that the claim for
indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a representation,
warranty, covenant, or agreement, the Claim Notice shall specify the
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement that was inaccurate or
breached and the basis of such inaccuracy or breach.

(c)In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Claim, the
Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim
Notice to notify the Indemnified Person whether it admits or denies its
obligation to defend and indemnify the Indemnified Person against such Claim
under Section 6.5, Section 9.4 or this Article 11, as applicable. If the
Indemnifying Person does not notify the Indemnified Person within such thirty
(30) day period regarding whether the Indemnifying Person admits or denies its
obligation to defend the Indemnified Person, it shall be conclusively deemed
obligated to provide such indemnification hereunder. The Indemnified Person is
authorized, prior to and during such thirty (30) day period but prior to the
Indemnifying Person admitting (or being deemed to have admitted such
obligation pursuant to this Section 11.3(c)) its obligation to provide
indemnification with respect to the matter in question, to file any motion,
answer, or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to
protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Person and that is not
prejudicial to the Indemnifying Person.

(d)If the Indemnifying Person admits its obligation (or is deemed to have
admitted its obligation), it shall have the right and obligation to diligently
defend and indemnify, at its sole cost and expense, the Claim. The
Indemnifying Person shall have full control of such defense and proceedings,
including, subject to the remainder of this Section 11.3(d), any compromise or
settlement thereof. If requested by the Indemnifying Person, the Indemnified
Person agrees to cooperate in contesting any Claim which the Indemnifying
Person elects to contest (provided, however, that the Indemnified Person shall
not be required to bring any counterclaim or cross-complaint against any
Person). The Indemnified Person may, at its own expense, participate in, but
not control, any defense or settlement of any Claim controlled by the
Indemnifying Person pursuant to this Section 11.3(d). An Indemnifying Person
shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, settle any
Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto that (i)
does not result in a final, non-appealable, resolution of the Indemnified
Person's liability with respect to the Claim (including, in the case of a
settlement, an unconditional written release of the Indemnified Person from
all further liability in respect of such Claim) or (ii) may materially and
adversely affect the Indemnified Person (other than as a result of money
damages covered by the indemnity).

(e)If the Indemnifying Person does not admit its obligation or admits its
obligation but fails to diligently defend, indemnify against, or settle the
Claim, then the Indemnified Person shall have the right to defend against the
Claim (at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Person, if the
Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder), with counsel of
the Indemnified Person's

choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Person to admit its
obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Person and assume the defense of the
Claim at any time prior to settlement or final, non-appealable determination
thereof. If the Indemnifying Person has not yet admitted its obligation to
defend and indemnify the Indemnified Person, the Indemnified Person shall send
written notice to the Indemnifying Person of any proposed settlement and the
Indemnifying Person shall have the option for ten (10) days following receipt
of such notice to (i) admit in writing its obligation for indemnification with
respect to such Claim and (ii) if its obligation is so admitted, assume the
defense of the Claim, including the power to reject the proposed settlement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the defense of any
Claim that principally involves Asset Taxes shall be governed by Section 9.6.

(f)In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Claim, the
Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim
Notice to (i) cure the Damages complained of, (ii) admit its obligation to
provide indemnification with respect to such Damages, or (iii) dispute the
claim for such Damages. If the Indemnifying Person does not notify the
Indemnified Person within such thirty (30) day period that it has cured the
Damages or that it disputes the claim for such Damages, the Indemnifying
Person shall be conclusively deemed to be obligated to provide indemnification
hereunder.

(g)Any claim for indemnity under Section 6.5, Section 9.4 or this Article 11
by any Affiliate, partner, member, shareholder, owner, officer, director,
manager, employee, agent or representative must be brought and administered by
the applicable Party to this Agreement that is related to such Person. No
Indemnified Person other than Seller and Purchaser shall have any rights
against Seller or Purchaser under the terms of Section 6.5, Section 9.4 or
this Article 11 except as may be exercised on its behalf by Purchaser or
Seller, as applicable, pursuant to this Section 11.3(g). Seller and Purchaser
may elect to exercise or not exercise indemnification rights under this
Section 11.3 on behalf of the other Indemnified Persons affiliated with it in
its sole discretion and shall have no liability to any such other Indemnified
Person for any action or inaction under this Section 11.3.

11.4 Casualty and Condemnation.

(a)Subject to Seller's representations, warranties and covenants made pursuant
to this Agreement, from and after the Effective Time, if Closing occurs,
Purchaser shall assume all risk of loss with respect to production of
Hydrocarbons through normal depletion (including watering out of any Well,
collapsed casing or sand infiltration of any Well) and the depreciation of any
Equipment due to ordinary wear and tear, in each case, with respect to the
Assets.

(b)If, after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing Date, any portion of
the Assets is destroyed by fire or other casualty or is expropriated or taken
in condemnation or under right of eminent domain (each, a "Casualty Loss"),
Purchaser shall, subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement,
nevertheless be required to close and Seller, at the Closing, shall pay to
Purchaser all sums paid to Seller by non-Affiliate third Persons by reason of
such Casualty Loss insofar as with respect to the Assets and shall assign,
transfer and set over to Purchaser or subrogate Purchaser to all of Seller's
right, title and interest (if any) in insurance claims, unpaid awards and
other rights against non-Affiliate third Persons arising out of such Casualty
Loss insofar as with respect to the Assets; provided, however, that Seller
shall reserve and retain all rights, title, interests and claims against third
Persons who are not Affiliates of Seller for the recovery of Seller's costs
and expenses incurred prior to the Closing in pursuing or asserting any such
insurance claims or other rights against such third Persons with respect to
any such Casualty Loss.

11.5 Limitation on Actions.

(a)The representations and warranties of Seller in Article 4 (excluding the
Fundamental Representations and Sections 4.3 and 4.8) and the corresponding
representations, warranties, and affirmations given in the certificates
delivered at Closing pursuant to Sections 8.2(e) shall survive the Closing for
a period of twelve (12) months and shall thereafter terminate. The Fundamental
Representations and the corresponding representations, warranties, and

days and shall thereafter terminate. The representations and warranties of
Seller in Section 4.8 and the corresponding representations, warranties, and
affirmations given in the certificates delivered at Closing pursuant to
Section 8.2(e) shall survive the Closing until the Cut-Off Date and shall
thereafter terminate. The covenants and agreements of Seller in this Agreement
to be performed on or prior to the Closing Date, and the corresponding
affirmations given in the certificate delivered at Closing pursuant to Section
8.2(e), shall survive the Closing for a period of twelve (12) months. The
covenants and agreements of Seller in this Agreement to be performed after the
Closing Date shall survive the Closing until performed. The remainder of this
Agreement shall survive the Closing and delivery of the Assignment and Bill of
Sale without time limit except as may otherwise be expressly provided herein.
Representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements shall be of no further
force and effect after the date of their expiration (if applicable), provided
that there shall be no termination of any bona fide claim asserted pursuant to
this Agreement with respect to such a representation, warranty, covenant, or
agreement prior to its expiration date.

thereafter terminate, except, in each case, as to matters for which a specific
written claim for indemnity has been delivered to the Indemnifying Person on
or before such termination date in accordance with Section 11.3. Purchaser's
indemnities set forth in Section 11.2(a)(i) relating to the Assumed
Obligations shall survive the Closing without time limit.

(c)Seller shall not have any liability for any indemnification under Section
11.2(b)(ii) with respect to breaches of Section 6.4(d) or Section
11.2(b)(iii), except for breaches of the Fundamental Representations and the
representations and warranties in Section 4.3 for which the following
limitations shall not apply, for an individual matter until and unless the
amount of the liability for Damages with respect to which Seller admits (or it
is otherwise finally determined) that Seller has an obligation to indemnify
Purchaser pursuant to the terms of Section 11.2(b)(ii) or 11.2(b)(iii) (as
applicable) exceeds One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) (the "Individual

Purchaser shall be borne solely and entirely by Purchaser.

12.4 Records.

(a)As soon as practicable, but in no event later than thirty (30) days after

at Seller's sole cost and expense, the original Records (or digital copies of

12.5 Governing Law. This Agreement and the legal relations between the Parties
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of

application of the Laws of another jurisdiction.

12.6 Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial. Each Party submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any United States federal court or Texas state court sitting
in Houston, Texas with respect to any dispute, claim, or controversy arising
out of, in relation to, or in connection with, this Agreement, and each of the

controversy, or claim arising out of, in relation to, or in connection with,
title or environmental matters pursuant to Section 3.10 or the determination
of Purchase Price adjustments pursuant to Section 8.4(b) is referred to an
expert pursuant to those Sections) will be instituted exclusively in such a
court. Each Party (a) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
such courts, (b) waives any objection to laying venue in any such action or
proceeding in such courts, (c) waives any objection that such courts are an
inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over it, and (d) agrees that
service of process upon it may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by
registered mail (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid,
to it at its address specified in Section 12.2. The foregoing consents to
jurisdiction and service of process shall not constitute general consents to
service of process in the State of Texas for any purpose except as provided
herein and shall not be deemed to confer any rights on any Person other than
the Parties to this Agreement. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING, OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY AGAINST ANOTHER IN
ANY MATTER WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF, IN RELATION TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH,
THIS AGREEMENT.

12.7 Captions. The captions in this Agreement are for convenience only and
shall not be considered a part of or affect the construction or interpretation
of any provision of this Agreement.

12.8 Waivers. Any failure by any Party to comply with any of its obligations,
agreements, or conditions herein contained may be waived by the Party to whom
such compliance is owed by an instrument signed by the Party to whom
compliance is owed and expressly identified as a waiver, but not in any other
manner. No course of dealing on the part of Seller or Purchaser, or their
respective Affiliates and its and their respective former, current and future
partners, members, shareholders, owners, officers, directors, managers,
employees, agents and representatives or any failure by Seller or Purchaser to
exercise any of its rights under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver
thereof or affect in any way the right of such Party at a later time to
enforce the performance of such provision. No waiver of, or consent to a
change in, any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall
constitute a waiver of, or consent to a change in, other provisions hereof
(whether or not similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver
unless otherwise expressly provided.

12.9 Assignment.

(a)Other than as permitted by Section 9.4 or as required by Section 2.6(k)(i),
no Party shall assign or otherwise transfer all or any part of this Agreement
to any third Person, nor shall any Party delegate any of its rights or duties
hereunder to any third Person, without the prior written consent of the other
Party and any transfer or delegation made without such consent shall be void
ab initio; provided, that either Party shall be entitled to assign its rights
under Section 2.6 at any time after the Closing pursuant to a sale of all or
substantially all of such Party's assets without the other Party's consent;
provided further, nothing in this Section 12.9 shall require the consent of
the other Party in connection with a first Party's

change of control, merger, consolidation or stock sale. Any assignment of this
Agreement permitted by this Section 12.9 shall be made subject to the
obligations contained in this Agreement and such assignment shall not relieve
the assigning Party of any obligations and responsibilities hereunder. Subject
to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

12.10 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement and the
documents to be executed hereunder and the exhibits and schedules attached
hereto and thereto constitute the entire agreement among the Parties
pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior agreements,
understandings, negotiations, and discussions, whether oral or written, of the
Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof. In entering into this
Agreement, neither Party has relied on any statement, representation,
warranty, covenant, or agreement of the other Party or its representatives
other than those expressly contained in this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, this Agreement constitutes a "definitive written agreement" as
contemplated by the Confidentiality Agreement and, as such, upon Closing the
Confidentiality Agreement shall automatically terminate, effective as of the
Closing Date, or if Closing does not occur, the Confidentiality Agreement
shall survive in accordance with its terms.

12.11 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by an
agreement in writing signed by Seller and Purchaser and expressly identified
as an amendment or modification.

12.12 No Third-Person Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement shall entitle
any Person other than Purchaser and Seller to any claim, cause of action,
remedy or right of any kind, except the rights expressly provided to the
Persons described in Section 6.5, Section 9.4 and Article 11.

12.13 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement, or any application
thereof, is held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect under any
Law, this Agreement shall be reformed to the extent necessary to conform, in
each case consistent with the intention of the Parties, to such Law, and, to
the extent such provision cannot be so reformed, then such provision (or the
invalid, illegal, or unenforceable application thereof) shall be deemed
deleted from (or prohibited under) this Agreement, as the case may be, and the
validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained
herein (and any other application of such provision) shall not in any way be
affected or impaired thereby.

12.14 Time of the Essence. Time is of the essence in this Agreement. If the
date specified in this Agreement for giving any notice or taking any action is
not a Business Day (or if the period during which any notice is required to be
given or any action taken expires on a date which is not a Business Day), then
the date for giving such notice or taking such action (and the expiration of
such period during which notice is required to be given or action taken) shall
be the next day which is a Business Day.

(a) references to any gender includes a reference to all other genders; (b)
references to the singular include the plural, and vice versa; (c) reference

Dollars; and (g) "include" and "including" mean include or including without

12.16 Construction. This Agreement is the result of arm's-length negotiations
from equal bargaining positions. It is expressly agreed that this Agreement
shall not be construed against any Party,

and no consideration shall be given or presumption made, on the basis of who
drafted this Agreement or any particular provision hereof.

12.17 Limitation on Damages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, neither Purchaser nor Seller, nor any of their respective
indemnified Persons shall be entitled to exemplary, consequential, special, or
punitive damages in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (other than consequential, special, or punitive damages
actually incurred by the indemnified Person pursuant to a claim by a third
Person within the scope of the indemnification obligations set forth in this
Agreement) and Purchaser and Seller, for themselves and on behalf of their
respective indemnified Persons, hereby expressly waive any right to
consequential, special, or punitive damages in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby (other than consequential, special,
or punitive damages suffered by third Persons for which responsibility is
allocated between the Parties).

12.18 Other Sales. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that in addition to its
purchase of the Assets under, and pursuant to, this Agreement, it may also be
purchasing from each Tag Rights Seller working interest in oil and gas
properties (and associated assets) that are related to the Assets. Purchaser

and agreements of Seller in this Agreement and all documents required to be

Tag Rights Seller, (b) the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of any Tag Rights Seller in any agreement or other document entered

representation, warranty, covenant or agreement by any Tag Rights Seller under
any agreement or other document entered into with Purchaser or for any payment
or indemnification obligation of any Tag Rights Seller under any agreement or
other document entered into with Purchaser and (d) Purchaser, on behalf of
itself and the Purchaser Group, hereby releases, remises and forever
discharges Seller and the Seller Group from any and all suits, legal or
administrative proceedings, liabilities or interest whatsoever, whether in
contract, tort or otherwise, known or unknown, which Purchaser or Purchaser
Group might now or subsequently have, based on, relating to or arising out of
