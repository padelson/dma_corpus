2 SECTION 2.03 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. (a) _Estimated Closing Adjustment_.
No more than seven Business Days and not less than three Business Days prior

statement (the " _Estimated Adjustment Statement_ ") setting forth in
reasonable detail (A) Sellers good faith estimate of (1) Net Working Capital
(" _Estimated Net Working Capital_ ") calculated in the manner set forth on

Company as of the Measurement Time, and (2) Closing Date Cash (" _Estimated
Closing Date Cash_ "), and (B) Sellers calculation of the Estimated Closing
Adjustment and the Closing Date Payment. The Estimated Adjustment Statement
shall include all supporting calculations and records. Seller shall provide
Purchaser with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the components of the Estimated Adjustment Statement after delivery of the

and shall cause the Company to provide, Purchaser and Purchasers independent

(b) _Closing Statement_. No later than 60 days after the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Seller a written
statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail (i)
Purchasers calculation of (A) Net Working Capital, which shall be accompanied
by a balance sheet of the Company as of the Measurement Time, and (B) Closing
Date Cash and (ii) Purchasers calculation of the Closing Adjustment.

(c)  _Disputes_.

(i) If Seller disagrees with the Closing Statement or Purchasers calculation
of Net Working Capital, Closing Date Cash or the resulting Closing Adjustment
delivered pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.03(b)_, then Seller may, within 45
days after receipt by Seller of the Closing Statement and such calculations,
deliver a written notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") to Purchaser providing in
reasonable detail the reason for any disagreement and Sellers calculation (in
accordance with the Stated Accounting Principles in the case of Net Working
Capital and Closing Date Cash) of such disputed items or amounts. Except as
set forth in any Dispute Notice delivered in accordance with this _Section_ __
_ 2.03(c)_, Seller shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and
amounts contained in the Closing Statement and the calculation of Net Working
Capital, Closing Date Cash, and the resulting Closing Adjustment delivered
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.03(b)_. Seller may deliver a Dispute Notice
disagreeing with any individual item or amount contained in such
calculations.

(ii) In connection with the preparation of the Closing Statement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.03(b)_ and during the period of any dispute within the
contemplation of this _Section_ __ _ 2.03(c)_, from the Closing Date through
the resolution of any adjustment to the Closing Date Payment contemplated by
this _Section_ __ _ 2.03_, Purchaser and Seller shall, and shall cause their
Affiliates to provide the other party and the other partys investment
bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other advisors, agents
or representatives (collectively, the " _Representatives_ ") with reasonable
access to the personnel, properties, books and records reasonably requested by
the other party for any purpose relating to any adjustment contemplated by
this _Section_ __ _ 2.03_ and otherwise cooperate in good faith with the
other party and its Representatives, in each case, subject to customary
confidentiality and indemnity agreements, including by providing reasonable
access on a timely basis to all information reasonably requested by the other
party as it relates to the determination of the Estimated Adjustment Statement
or Closing Statement and the calculation of the components thereof (including
Net Working Capital, Closing Date Cash and the Closing Adjustment).

 



3 (iii) If a Dispute Notice is delivered in accordance with this  _Section_ __
_ 2.03(c)_, then Seller and Purchaser shall, during the 30 days following
such delivery, seek in good faith to reach agreement on the disputed items or
amounts in order to resolve the applicable dispute and finally determine Net
Working Capital, Closing Date Cash and the Closing Adjustment, as applicable.
At the end of such period, if Seller and Purchaser are unable to reach such
agreement with respect to any dispute set forth in the Dispute Notice, they
shall promptly thereafter submit to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, or if such
firm is unable or unwilling to act, such nationally recognized independent
public accounting firm as shall be agreed upon in writing by Seller and
Purchaser (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") for review the relevant portions of this
Agreement, the Closing Statement and the disputed items or amounts set forth
in the Dispute Notice that remain in dispute for the purpose of calculating
Net Working Capital, Closing Date Cash and the Closing Adjustment, as
applicable. Each party shall provide a copy of any written materials submitted
to the Accounting Firm to the other party. In making such calculation, the
Accounting Firm shall consider only those items or amounts in the Closing
Statement and Purchasers calculation of Net Working Capital, Closing Date
Cash and the Closing Adjustment, as applicable, that the parties indicate
as remaining in dispute. The Accounting Firm shall deliver to Seller and
Purchaser, as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than 30 days)
after the date of engagement of the Accounting Firm, a written report setting
forth its decision resolving the matters in dispute; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Accounting Firm shall resolve the unresolved disputes by adopting a
position that is either equal to Purchasers position as set forth in or
accompanying the Closing Statement, Sellers position as set forth in any
Dispute Notice delivered in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.03(c)_ or
between such respective positions proposed by Purchaser and Seller. Such
report shall be set forth in a written statement and be final and binding
upon, and non-appealable (except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.03(c)(v)_)
by, Seller and Purchaser, and each party shall bear its own expenses and the
fees and expenses of its own Representatives, including its independent
accountants, in connection with the review, dispute (if any) and final
determination of the Closing Statement and the components thereof. The costs
and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be allocated to and borne by
Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, based on the
inverse of the percentage that the Accounting Firms determination (before
such allocation) bears to the total amount of the items in dispute as
originally submitted to the Accounting Firm. For example, should the items in
dispute total in amount to $1,000 and the Accounting Firm award $600 in favor
of Sellers position, then 60% of the costs and expenses of the Accounting
Firm would be allocated to and borne by Purchaser and 40% of such costs and
expenses would be allocated to and borne by Seller.

 

(iv) The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm shall be
limited to (A) whether the Closing Statement was prepared in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, including the Stated Accounting Principles, as
applicable, with respect to the matters that were submitted for resolution to
the Accounting Firm pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.03(c)(iii)_ and (B)
whether there were mathematical errors in the Closing Statement. The
Accounting Firm is not authorized to, and shall not, make any other
determination, including (A) any determination with respect to any matter
included in the Closing Statement or in any Dispute Notice that was not
submitted for resolution to the Accounting Firm pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.03(c)(iii)_, (B) any determination as to the accuracy of any representation
or warranty in this Agreement or (C) any determination as to compliance by
Purchaser or Seller with any of its covenants in this Agreement.

 



4 (v) The dispute resolution by the Accounting Firm under this  _Section_ __ _
2.03(c)_ shall constitute an expert determination under New York CPLR Article
76 and shall not constitute an arbitration. The determinations of the
Accounting Firm as to any issue of fact shall be final and binding, absent
fraud, bad faith or manifest error. Judgment may be entered upon the
determination of the Accounting Firm in New York State Supreme Court or any
other court having jurisdiction over the party against which such
determination is to be enforced.

(d) The calculation of the Closing Adjustment (as adjusted, if a proper
Dispute Notice is received in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.03(c)_, by
written agreement of Purchaser and Seller and/or the written determination of
the Accounting Firm in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.03(c)_) is referred
to in this Agreement as the " _Final Closing Adjustment_ ".

(e) _Final Settlement and Adjustment to Purchase Price; Payment_.

 

(i) If the Estimated Closing Adjustment is greater than the Final Closing
Adjustment (such excess, the " _Final Purchase Price Recoupment Amount_ "),
then within five Business Days after the Final Closing Adjustment is finally
determined pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.03_, Seller shall pay an amount
equal to the Final Purchase Price Recoupment Amount to Purchaser by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the bank account designated in
writing by Purchaser at least two Business Days prior to the date of the
required payment.

 

(ii) If the Final Closing Adjustment is greater than the Estimated Closing
Adjustment (such excess, the " _Purchaser Adjustment Payment_ "), then within
five Business Days after the Final Closing Adjustment is finally determined
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.03_, Purchaser shall pay an amount equal to
the Purchaser Adjustment Payment to Seller by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the bank account designated in writing by Seller at least
two Business Days prior to the date of the required payment.

 

(iii) Any payments made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.03(e)_ shall be
treated as an adjustment to the purchase price for all Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law.

(f) _Property Tax Refunds and Credits_. To the extent that Property Tax
refunds or credits with respect to the Owned Real Property relating to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period or the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date are received, or allowed or applied, after the date hereof,
Seller hereby assigns to Purchaser any and all rights of Seller to such Tax
credits or refunds. To the extent such amounts are paid to Seller, Seller
shall remit such amounts to Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the bank account designated in writing by Purchaser.

SECTION 2.04 _Withholding Rights for Taxes_. Purchaser shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any payment made hereunder such amounts as may be
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "),
or under any provision of Federal, state, local or foreign Law relating to
Taxes. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Taxing Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of
which Purchaser made such deduction or withholding. Purchaser shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, cooperate in good faith to minimize any withholding
that may apply to any payments described in this _Section_ __ _ 2.04_.

SECTION 2.05 _Insurance Policy Expenses_. No more than seven Business Days
and not less than three Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date,
Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Seller a statement setting forth the
premiums payable by Purchaser for (i) the Representation and Warranty
Policy and (ii) the Environmental Policy, as well as Purchasers calculation
of the Insurance Policy Expenses.

 



5 SECTION 2.06 _Purchase Price Remainder_. (a) On or before the first
anniversary of the Closing Date (or if such date is not a Business Day, on
the next Business Day thereafter), Purchaser shall pay to Seller by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the bank account designated in
writing by Seller at least two (2) Business Days prior to such date, an
amount equal to the Remainder Payment.

(b) If Purchaser fails to pay Seller any portion of the Remainder Payment by
the first anniversary of the Closing Date, simple interest shall thereafter
accrue on the unpaid portion of the Remainder Payment until the date of
payment at the per annum rate of 675 basis points over prevailing three-month
LIBOR. Additionally, Purchaser shall pay all fees and expenses incurred by
Seller in collecting the unpaid portion of the Remainder Payment and accrued
interest.

 

SECTION 2.07 _No Indebtedness_. On the Closing Date, Seller agrees to deliver
the Company with no Indebtedness, and shall provide to Purchaser reasonably
satisfactory evidence of (a) the termination of the Line of Credit Facility
Agreement, dated December 2, 2014, among Axeon Refining LLC, as Borrower,
Axeon Specialty Products LLC, and LG Asphalt L.P., as Lender (as amended or
supplemented from time to time), and the release of all liens in connection
therewith and (b) any other Indebtednesses outstanding after the date hereof
(such evidence, the " _Payoff Letters_ ").

 

SECTION 2.08 _Additional Consideration_. (a) _General_. As additional
consideration for the acquisition of the Membership Interests, Company,
Purchaser shall pay to Seller amounts calculated in accordance with this
Section 2.08.

(b)  _Earn-Out Statement_.

(i) Within 60 days following the end of each Contract Year, Purchaser shall
prepare and deliver to Seller a statement (each, an " _Earn-Out Statement_")
setting forth Purchasers determination of Earn-Out Consideration, including
the Total Processing Revenue, Net Energy Cost, Other Variable Costs, Fixed
Costs and the components thereof, for such Contract Year.

 

(ii) Upon receipt of an Earn-Out Statement, Seller may accept such Earn-Out
Statement or initiate a review of such Earn-Out Statement and shall provide
written notice of its decision to Purchaser no later than ten Business Days
following receipt of such Earn-Out Statement. If Seller does not provide such
written notice to Purchaser within such ten-Business Day period, Seller shall
be deemed to have accepted such Earn-Out Statement. If Seller accepts such
Earn-Out Statement (or is deemed to have accepted Earn-Out
Statement), Purchaser shall pay Seller the Earn-Out Consideration shown as
due on such Earn-Out Statement within five Business Days of the acceptance (or
deemed acceptance) thereof by Seller in cash by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by Seller.

(c) _Review_.

 

(i) If Seller delivers written notice pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.08(b)(ii)_
of its intent to initiate a review of such Earn-Out Statement, during the
60-day period following Purchasers receipt of such notice Purchaser shall
provide reasonable access during normal business hours to and otherwise make
available to Seller and its advisors, to the extent within the control of
Purchaser, its independent auditors, the relevant personnel and relevant books
and records of the Business and other documents that may be reasonably
requested by Seller and its advisors to determine whether the calculation of
any Earn-Out Consideration in any Earn-Out Statement that is the subject of
the review was made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 



6 (ii) Prior to the expiration of such 60-day period, Seller may challenge any
Earn-Out Statement that is the subject of the review by written notice to
Purchaser (an " _Earn-Out Dispute Notice_"). If Seller fails to deliver an
Earn-Out Dispute Notice prior to the expiration of such 60-day period, the
Earn-Out Statement subject to review shall be deemed final, and Purchaser
shall pay Seller the Earn-Out Consideration shown as due on such Earn-Out
Statement within five Business Days after the expiration of such 60-day period
in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by Seller.

(iii) Any Earn-Out Dispute Notice shall (A) specify in reasonable detail the
reason for any disagreement so asserted and (B) only include disagreements
based on mathematical errors or based on Earn-Out Consideration not being
calculated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. During the 45-day
period following the delivery of an Earn-Out Dispute Notice, Seller and
Purchaser shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing the disputed items
or amounts specified in the Earn-Out Dispute Notice. During such period,
Purchaser and its auditors shall have access to the work papers, schedules
and calculations of Seller and Sellers advisors, if any, subject to execution
by Purchaser (and such other parties as Sellers advisors may require) of any
documentation as Sellers advisors may require. If Purchaser and Seller are
able to resolve their disagreements during the 45-day period, the parties
shall accordingly set the terms of any payment required pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.08_ (if any), and Purchaser shall pay Seller the Earn-Out
Consideration agreed to by the parties within five Business Days after the
resolution of their disagreements in cash by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by Seller.

(iv) At the end of such 45-day period, if Seller and Purchaser are unable to
reach such agreement with respect to any dispute set forth in the Earn-Out
Dispute Notice, they shall promptly thereafter submit to the Accounting Firm
for review the relevant portions of this Agreement, the relevant Earn-Out
Statement and the disputed items or amounts set forth in the Earn-Out Dispute
Notice that remain in dispute and which were properly included in the Earn-
Out Dispute Notice, in the form of a written brief. Each party shall provide a
copy of any written materials submitted to the Accounting Firm to the
other party. In making such calculation, the Accounting Firm shall consider
only those items or amounts from the Earn-Out Dispute Notice that the parties
indicate as remaining in dispute. The Accounting Firm shall deliver to Seller
and Purchaser, as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than 30 days)
after the date of engagement of the Accounting Firm, a written report setting
forth its decision resolving the matters in dispute; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that the Accounting Firm shall resolve such unresolved disputes by adopting
a position that is either equal to Purchasers position as set forth in its
brief, Sellers position as set forth in its brief or between such respective
positions proposed by Purchaser and Seller. Such report shall be final and
binding upon, and non-appealable by, Seller and Purchaser, and each party
shall bear its own expenses and the fees and expenses of its own
Representatives, including its independent accountants, in connection with the
review, dispute (if any) and final determination of any Earn-Out Statement at
issue and the components thereof. The costs and expenses of the Accounting
Firm shall be allocated to and borne by Purchaser, on the one hand, and
Seller, on the other hand, based on the inverse of the percentage that the
Accounting Firms determination (before such allocation) bears to the total
amount of the items in dispute as originally submitted to the Accounting Firm.
For example, should the items in dispute total in amount to $1,000 and the
Accounting Firm award $600 in favor of Sellers position, then 60% of the
costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm would be allocated to and borne by
Purchaser and 40% of such costs and expenses would be allocated to and borne
by Seller.

 



7 (v) The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm shall
be limited to (A) whether a challenged Earn-Out Statement was prepared in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement with respect to the matters that
were submitted for resolution to the Accounting Firm pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.08(c)_ and (B) whether there were mathematical errors in
such Earn-Out Statement. The Accounting Firm is not authorized to, and shall
not, make any other determination, including (A) any determination with
respect to any matter included in any Earn-Out Statement or in any Earn-Out
Dispute Notice that was not properly submitted for resolution to the
Accounting Firm pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.08(c)_ or (B) any
determination as to compliance by Purchaser or Seller with any of its
covenants in this Agreement.

 

(vi) The dispute resolution by the Accounting Firm under this _Section_ __ _
2.08_ shall constitute an expert determination under New York CPLR Article 76
and shall not constitute an arbitration. The determinations of the Accounting
Firm as to any issue of fact shall be final and binding, absent fraud, bad
faith or manifest error. Judgment may be entered upon the determination of
the Accounting Firm in New York State Supreme Court or any other court having
jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is to be
enforced.

 

(vii) Purchaser shall pay the amount of the Earn-Out Payment as determined by
the Accounting Firm to Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the bank account designated in writing by Seller within five Business Days
of the date the disputed matters are finally resolved by the Accounting Firm.

 

(viii) If the amount of the Earn-Out Payment paid by Purchaser under 
_Section_ __ _ 2.08(c)(iii)_ or _2.08(c)(vii)_ is greater than the amount of
the Earn-Out Payment set forth on the Earn-Out Statement delivered
by Purchaser under _Section_ __ _ 2.08(b)(i)_, the amount of such difference
shall bear interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of such Earn-Out
Statement to the date of payment.

 

(d) _Buy Out Option_. If, on or before the termination of the Earn-Out Period,
(i) the term of the Processing Agreement is extended beyond the Earn-Out
Period or (ii) the Company enters into any successor or replacement agreement
with Customer A or any third party that extends beyond the Earn-Out Period,
Purchaser shall (A) immediately notify Seller in writing and (B) upon
termination of the Earn-Out Period pay to Seller $5 million in cash.

 

(e) _Post-Closing Activity_. During the period from the Closing to the
termination of the Earn-Out Period, as long as Seller has not failed to make
timely payments in accordance with this Section 2.08, without the consent of
Seller, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause the Company not to, take any
action or refrain from taking any action, in either case, with the specific
intent of reducing the Earn-Out Consideration. In addition, as long as Seller
has not failed to make timely payments in accordance with this Section 2.08,
during the period from the Closing to the termination of the Earn-Out Period,
without the consent of Seller, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause the
Company not to: (i) amend or waive any provision under the
Processing Agreement if the specific intent of such amendment or waiver is to
(A) defer the recognition of a material amount of revenue under the Processing
Agreement from the Earn-Out Period to a later period except as required by
Law or (B) accelerate the incurrence of a material amount of discretionary
capital costs into the Earn-Out Period from a later period; (ii) reduce or
defer recognition of any material amount of revenue with the specific intent
to reduce the amount of Earn-Out Consideration for a particular period, except
as required by Law or GAAP; (iii) enter into any agreement, arrangement 

 



8  or other transaction, the specific intent of which is to reduce the
aggregate amount of Earn-Out Consideration; or (iv) amend or waive any
provision of the Processing Agreement, or exercise any right under the
Processing Agreement, to materially reduce the volumes processed under the
Processing Agreement during the Earn-Out Period with the specific intent of
recovering or recouping the revenue foregone after the expiration of the Earn-
Out Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) subject to the foregoing,
nothing in this Agreement shall restrict or prohibit Purchaser or the Company
from exercising reasonable business judgment in the conduct of the operations
of the Company, including with respect to the timing of capital expenditures
or the exercise by the Company of any termination right under the Processing
Agreement, and (y) the foregoing shall not require Purchaser or the Company to
make any capital investments.

 

(f) _One Time Costs_.

 

(i) Seller shall keep a record of all One-Time Costs paid by the Company prior
to the Measurement Time (the " _Seller One-Time Costs_") and shall present
Purchaser with a statement that sets forth all of such Seller One-Time Costs
(the " _Seller One-Time Cost Statement_") no later than 10 days following
Closing.

 

(ii) Purchaser shall keep a record of all One-Time Costs incurred by the
Company on or after the Closing Date and prior to commencement of the Earn-
Out Period (the " _Purchaser One-Time Costs_"). No later than 30 days
following the end of each fiscal quarter, beginning with the first complete
quarter following the Closing and concluding with the first complete fiscal
quarter following the fiscal quarter during which the Earn-Out
Period terminates, Purchaser shall present Seller with a statement that sets
forth all of the Purchaser One-Time Costs paid by Purchaser during such
quarter (or, in the case the first complete quarter following the Closing,
during the period from and including the Closing Date through the end of such
quarter) (each, a " _Purchaser One-Time Cost Statement_"). Purchaser shall
cause the Company to pay all of such Purchaser One-Time Costs until the
aggregate amount of Purchaser One-Time Costs paid is equal to the aggregate
amount of Seller One-Time Costs. Thereafter, Purchaser shall continue to
cause the Company to pay any additional Purchaser One-Time Costs in excess of
the aggregate amount of Seller One-Time Costs (such excess Purchaser One-Time
Costs, the " _Excess Purchaser One-Time Costs_"); _provided_ that within five
Business Days following presentation of each Purchaser One-Time Costs
Statement, Seller will pay to the Company an amount equal to one-half of the
amount of the Excess Purchaser One-Time Costs paid by the Company during the
period covered by such Purchaser One-Time Cost Statement, which amount shall
be set forth therein, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
bank account designated in writing by Purchaser.

(iii) Within 30 days following the presentation by Purchaser of the One-Time
Cost Statement that covers One-Time Costs paid by the Company in the first
complete fiscal quarter following the fiscal quarter during which the Earn-
Out Period terminates, Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, may submit
written notice to the other party of its disagreement with the categorization
and calculation of One-Time Costs (a " _One-Time Cost Dispute Notice_") in any
of (or all) the One-Time Cost Statements. The One-Time Cost Dispute Notice
shall specify in reasonable detail the reason for any disagreement so asserted
and (ii) only include disagreements based on mathematical errors or based on
the One-Time Costs not being calculated in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. During the 20-day period following the delivery of a One-Time Cost
Dispute Notice, Seller and Purchaser shall seek in good faith to resolve in
writing the disputed items or

 



9  amounts specified in the One-Time Cost Dispute Notice. During such period,
the disputing party and its auditors shall have access to the work
papers, schedules and calculations of the other party and its auditors, if
any, subject to execution by the disputing party (and such other persons as
the other partys auditors may require) of any documentation as such other
partys auditors may require.

(iv) At the end of such 20-day period, if Seller and Purchaser are not able
to settle their disagreement, then the parties shall follow the settlement and
dispute resolution procedures outlined in _Sections 2.08(c)(iv)_ ,
_2.08(c)(v)_ and _2.08(c)(vi)_ , with all references to "Earn-Out Statement"
replaced with references to the "One-Time Cost Statement", and the 30-day
period for the Accounting Firm to reach its decision replaced with a 20-day
period.

(v) If a dispute regarding a One-Time Cost Statement is resolved by the
parties pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.08(f)(iii)_ or by the Accounting Firm
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.08(f)(iv)_, (i) such One-Time Cost Statement,
shall be deemed to be amended, as necessary, to reflect any change to the
amount of One-Time Costs set forth therein and (ii) if as a result of all
such deemed amendments, taken as a whole, (A) Seller has overpaid Purchaser
under _Section_ __ _ 2.08(f)(ii)_, then Purchaser shall promptly repay the
amount of the overpayment to Seller or (B) Seller has underpaid Purchaser
under _Section_ __ _ 2.08(f)(ii)_, Seller shall promptly pay the amount of
the underpayment to Purchaser.

 

(g) _Shut-Down Costs_.

 

(i) This _Section_ __ _ 2.08(g)_ shall apply following termination of the
Processing Agreement. The date on which such termination occurs is referred
to as the " _PAT Date_ ".

(ii) Purchaser shall keep a record of all Shut-Down Costs incurred by the
Company after the PAT Date (the " _Shut-Down Cost Statement_ "). Purchaser
shall present Seller the Shut-Down Cost Statement no later than six months
after the PAT Date. If Seller does not challenge the Shut-Down Cost
Statement, then Seller shall promptly pay Purchaser 50% of the Shut-Down Costs
by wire transfer to the bank account designated in writing by Purchaser.

 

(iii) Upon receipt of the Shut-Down Cost Statement, Seller may submit written
notice of its disagreement with the categorization and calculation of Shut-
Down Costs (a " _Shut-Down Cost Dispute Notice_ ") to Purchaser. The Shut-Down
Cost Dispute Notice shall (i) specify in reasonable detail the reason for any
disagreement so asserted and (ii) only include disagreements based on
mathematical errors or based on the Shut-Down Costs not being calculated in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. During the 20-day period
following the delivery of a Shut-Down Cost Dispute Notice, Seller and
Purchaser shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing the disputed items or
amounts specified in the Shut-Down Cost Dispute Notice. During such period,
Seller and its auditors shall have access to the work papers, schedules and
calculations of Purchaser and Purchasers auditors, if any, subject to
execution by Seller (and such other parties as Purchasers auditors may
require) of any documentation as Purchasers auditors may require. If
Purchaser and Seller are able to resolve their disagreements during the 20-day
period, then Seller shall promptly pay Purchaser 50% of the agreed-upon amount
(if any) by wire transfer to the bank account designated in writing by
Purchaser.

 



10 (iv) At the end of such 20-day period, if Seller and Purchaser are not able
to settle their disagreement, then the parties shall follow the settlement and
dispute resolution procedures outlined in _Sections 2.08(c)(iv)_ ,
_2.08(c)(v)_ and _2.08(c)(vi)_ , with all references to "Earn-Out Statement"
replaced with references to the "Shut-Down Cost Statement", and the 30-day
period for the Accounting Firm to reach its decision replaced with a 20-day
period. Seller shall promptly pay Purchaser 50% of the revised Shut-Down Cost
Statement amount by wire transfer to the bank account designated in writing by
Purchaser (adding or subtracting any fees required to be paid, according to
the Accounting Firms ruling, as described in _Section_ __ _ 2.08(c)(iv)_).

 

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 2.08(g)_,
if, on or before the termination of the Earn-Out Period, either (i) the term
of the Processing Agreement is extended beyond the Earn-Out Period or (ii) the
Company enters into any successor or replacement agreement with Customer A or
any third party that extends beyond the Earn-Out Period, Seller shall not be
required to pay any Shut-Down Costs and the provisions of this  _Section_ __
_ 2.08(g)_ shall not apply.

(h) _Termination Fees_. All termination fees received by Purchaser pursuant
to the Processing Agreement shall be shared equally between Purchaser and
Seller. Purchaser shall promptly pay to Seller 50% of any termination fee
received pursuant to the Processing Agreement by wire transfer to the bank
account designated in writing by Seller. If, at the time Purchaser receives
any termination fees pursuant to the Processing Agreement, Seller owes any
amount to Purchaser under _Section_ __ _ 2.08(f)(v)_ or _2.08(g)(iv)_ ,
Purchaser may withhold such amount from any payment under this Section
2.08(h) in partial or full satisfaction of Sellers obligations under
_Section_ __ _ 2.08(f)(v)_ or _2.08(g)(iv)_ , as applicable.

 

(i) _Processing Agreement_. Purchaser acknowledges that (A) Seller and the
Company are in discussions with a third party known to Purchaser and Seller
(" _Customer_ __ _ A_") with respect to a potential contract between the
Company and Customer A for the Company to process crude oil for Customer A
using Crude Unit #1 and the other related assets and equipment at the Owned
Real Property and (B) in connection therewith Seller and the Company may take
action following execution of the Processing Agreement in preparation for
commencement of performance under the Processing Agreement, including
incurrence of One-Time Costs. Seller agrees that it shall not cause the
Company to enter into any such contract without Purchasers written consent.

 

(j) _No Set-Off_. The parties acknowledge that this _Section_ __ _
2.08_ contemplates various payments between the parties. Except as
specifically set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.08(h)_, no party shall (and
Purchaser shall cause the Company not to) set off against any amount otherwise
due under this  _Section_ __ _ 2.08_ any amount due or claimed as due under
this _Section_ __ _ 2.08_ or any other provision of this Agreement.

 



11 SECTION 2.09 _Cobalt Lease_. Except as provided in this  _Section_ __ _
2.09_, Seller shall pay Purchaser the Cobalt Lease Payment as part of the
Closing Date Payment and following the Closing, Purchaser shall cause the
Company to perform all of the Companys obligations, as tenant, under the
Cobalt Lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, after the date of this
Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, the Company, as assignor, assigns the
Cobalt Lease to a Related Entity (including Seller), as such term is defined
in the Cobalt Lease, as assignee, then the Cobalt Lease Payment shall be
removed from the calculation of the Closing Date Payment and Purchaser shall
be relieved of its obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 2.09_.

which would jeopardize any attorneyclient or other privilege available to
Seller or its Affiliates. In connection with receiving such access and
information, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and
Representatives to, cooperate with Seller and its Affiliates to ensure that
such access does not unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the
businesses conducted by Seller or its Affiliates or with their respective
employee relations. Purchaser shall promptly reimburse Seller and its
Affiliates for reasonable, documented out-of-pocket fees, costs or expenses
(including reasonable fees, costs and expenses of outside counsel, accountants
and other advisors) incurred in connection with such access.

(d) Except as required by applicable Law or legal process, for a period of two
years from and after the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives to, hold in confidence
any and all non-public information, whether written or oral, to the extent
relating to the conduct of the Companys Business and the assets and
liabilities of the Company (" _Business Information_ "), except to the extent
that such information (i) is or becomes generally available to the public
other than through an action or failure to act by Seller, any of its
Affiliates or its or their respective Representatives in breach of the terms
of this Agreement, (ii) is lawfully acquired by Seller, any of its Affiliates
or its or their respective Representatives from and after the Closing from
sources other than Purchaser and its Affiliates that are not prohibited from
disclosing such information by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation or
(iii) was independently developed by Seller, its Affiliates or its or their
respective Representatives without reference to or use of Business
Information. Except as required by applicable Law or legal process and except
in connection with Sellers exercise of its rights under this Agreement,
Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, reproduce, distribute,
divulge, disclose or otherwise disseminate such information, other than to
Purchaser and its Representatives or such Representatives of Seller who need
to know such information for the preparation of Tax Returns, financial
statements and other documents and reports that Seller or its Affiliates
(including the LG Group) are required to file with Governmental Authorities (
_provided_ that such Representatives of Seller agree to keep such information
confidential).

necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the Transactions. Notwithstanding anything in
this _Section_ __ _ 7.02(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 7.02(b)_ or _7.02(c)_ , (A)
Purchaser shall not be required to sell, divest, dispose of, or hold separate
any assets, properties or businesses (or propose, offer or commit to any of

this clause (A), the refining operations of the Company) to resolve
any objections to the Transactions under the anti-trust laws, (B) Seller, the
Company and Purchaser shall not be required to (x) sell, divest, dispose of,
or hold separate any assets, properties or businesses (or propose, offer or
commit to any of the foregoing) or change or modify any course of conduct
regarding future operations of the Company to resolve any objections to the
Transactions under the anti-trust laws if such sale, divestiture, disposal,
holding separate, change or modification would constitute a material change
to the conduct of the Business as currently conducted or (y) breach any
material Contract to which the Company is a party and (C) Seller and the
Company shall not have any obligation to take any action that would bind
Seller or the Company prior to the Closing.

shall cause the Company, at the Companys sole cost and expense, to comply
with all requirements of ISRA prior to the Closing that are necessary to
consummate the Transactions, including any requirement to (x) submit or
obtain, prior to the Closing Date, to or from the New Jersey Department of

the Closing Date, for conducting and completing any environmental
investigation, remediation, monitoring or other responsive or corrective
action required to comply with ISRA or any requirement of the NJDEP, including
making any related filings, notices, submissions or guarantees;  _provided_

such notice, certification, workplan or other submission.

(b) Each of Purchaser and Seller shall, as promptly as practicable but in any
event not more than 10 Business Days after the date hereof, file, or cause to
be filed, all required Notification and Report Forms under the HSR Act (" _HSR
Filings_ ") with the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and
the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (the "
_Antitrust Division_ ") in connection with the Transactions. Each of Purchaser
and Seller shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to, (i) respond
as promptly as practicable to (x) all inquiries received from the FTC or the
Antitrust Division in respect of the filings referred to in the immediately
preceding sentence and (y) any request for information or documentary
materials following such filings (a " _Second Request_ ") and (ii) cause the
waiting period under the HSR Act to terminate or expire at the earliest
possible date. Purchaser and Seller will furnish to the other such information
and assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with
preparation of the HSR Filings. Purchaser and Seller shall each be responsible
for 50% of the filing fees associated with the filing of the HSR Act
notification and report form.

 

(c) Purchaser and Seller shall each keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to the filings, notices and requests contemplated or
required by this _Section_ __ _ 7.02_. In that regard, prior to the Closing,
each of Seller and Purchaser shall promptly consult with the other with
respect to, provide any necessary information with respect to (and, in the
case of correspondence, provide the other (or its

 



33  counsel) copies of), all filings, notices, requests for approval or consent
made by it with any Governmental Authority pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.02_ or any other information supplied by it to, or correspondence with, a
Governmental Authority in connection with its obligations described above in
this _Section_ __ _ 7.02_. In respect of any such filings, notices or
requests, each of Seller and Purchaser shall promptly inform the other, or if
in writing, furnish the other with copies, or, in the case of material oral
communications, advise the other orally, of any communication from any
Governmental Authority regarding any of such filings, notices or requests,
and permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good
faith the views of the other in connection with, any proposed written (or any
material proposed oral) communication with any such Governmental Authority in
respect of any such filing, notice or request. Except when communicating with
a Governmental Authority in response to a telephone call from such
Governmental Authority, neither Seller nor Purchaser shall participate in any
meeting or communication with any Governmental Authority in connection with
any such filing, notice or request (or make oral submissions at meetings or in
telephone or other conversations in respect thereto) unless it consults with
the other in advance and to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority gives the other the opportunity to attend and participate thereat.
Each of Seller and Purchaser shall furnish the other with copies of all
correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth the
substance thereof) between it and any such Governmental Authority with respect
to such filings, notices and requests, and furnish the other with such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may
reasonably request in connection with its preparation of such filings,
notices or requests.

(d) During the period from the date of this Agreement and continuing until
the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the Closing, except as
required by this Agreement, Purchaser and its Affiliates will not, without the
prior written consent of Seller, engage in any action or enter into
any transaction or permit any action to be taken or transaction to be entered
into, that impairs or delays or would be reasonably likely to impair or delay
Purchasers ability to consummate the Transactions or perform its obligations
hereunder. Without limiting the generality of the immediately preceding
sentence, Purchaser will not, directly or indirectly acquire (whether via
merger, consolidation, stock or asset purchase or otherwise), or agree to so
acquire, any amounts of assets of or any equity in any other person or any
business or division thereof, unless that acquisition or agreement would not
reasonably be likely to (i) increase the risk of not obtaining any
authorizations, consents, orders, declarations or approvals of any
Governmental Authority described above in this _Section_ __ _ 7.02_ or the
expiration or termination of any waiting period in connection with any
requisite approval of any Governmental Authority; or (ii) increase the
risk of any Governmental Authority entering an order that enjoins, prohibits,
prevents or restricts the ability of the parties to obtain any authorization,
approval, consent or waiver contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 7.02_,
or increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or
otherwise.

(e) Seller shall give prompt notice to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall give
prompt notice to Seller, of (i) the breach or failure to be true and correct
of any representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement,
which breach or failure to be true and correct would give rise to the failure
of a condition in _Section_ __ _ 8.02(a)_ or _8.03(a)_ , as applicable, or
(ii) the failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement, which failure would give rise to the failure of a condition in
_Section_ __ _ 8.02(b)_ or _8.03(b)_.

 

(f) Upon the knowledge of Seller or the Company of (i) any pending Action or
Action threatened in writing not disclosed in the Seller Disclosure Letter or
(ii) a material event or development in any Action or matter disclosed in the
Seller Disclosure Letter, including with respect to the matters addressed in
_Section_ __ _ 7.11_ thereof, Seller shall promptly (and in any event within
two Business Days and no later than immediately prior to the Closing) provide
written notice to Purchaser of such Action or matter and the material details
relating thereto and update the Seller Disclosure Letter. Any pending Action
disclosed under this _Section_ __ _ 7.02(f)_ shall constitute a Retained
Liability.

 



34 SECTION 7.03 _Public Announcements_. Any public announcement or similar
publicity with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions will be issued,
if at all, at such time and in such manner as mutually agreed to by Purchaser
and Seller; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit any party
from making, issuing or releasing any announcements, statements, or
acknowledgments that such party is required to make, issue or release by
applicable Law or by any listing agreement with or listing rules of a
securities exchange or trading market or inter-dealer quotation system
(provided that such party has used reasonable efforts to give the other party
prior notice thereof and an opportunity to review such disclosure). Except as
otherwise agreed to by Purchaser and Seller or required by Law or
this Agreement, prior to the Closing, each party will, and will cause its
Representatives to, keep this Agreement, its terms and any information about
the Transactions strictly confidential and shall not make any disclosure of
this Agreement to any other person. Purchaser and Seller will consult with
each other concerning the means by which the Company and employees, customers,
and suppliers and others having dealings with the Company will be informed of
the Membership Interest Purchase. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall in any way prohibit or limit
Goldberg Lindsay or its respective Affiliates from disclosing the terms of
this Agreement or Goldberg Lindsays or any of its respective Affiliates
investment in the Company in connection with Goldberg Lindsays or its
respective Affiliates reporting (including reporting to their respective
shareholders, limited partners, partners or members), marketing or
fundraising activities or obligations.

SECTION 7.04 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall transfer, or shall cause the transfer
of, the employment of each individual listed in  _Section_ __ _ 7.04(a)_ of
the Seller Disclosure Letter (which schedule shall be updated prior to the
Closing as necessary to reflect any terminations or resignations or as may be
otherwise mutually agreed upon by Seller and Purchaser) (each such employee,
an " _Excluded Employee_ ") to Seller or one of its Affiliates (other than the
Company). For the period commencing after the Closing Date and ending on
December 31, 2018 (or the period required by applicable Law, if longer) (such
period, the " _Continuation Period_ "), Purchaser either shall, with respect
to each employee of the Company immediately prior to the Closing who is not an
Excluded Employee (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") whose terms and
conditions of employment are not governed by a CBA (each such Continuing
Employee, a " _Non-Union Continuing Employee_"), (1) assume and maintain, or
cause its subsidiaries (including the Company) to assume and maintain, for
the benefit of each Non-Union Continuing Employee, the Benefit Plans and the
Benefit Agreements at the compensation and benefit levels in
effect immediately prior to the Closing or (2) provide or cause its
subsidiaries (including the Company) to provide (A) a base salary or wage
rate, as applicable, to each Non-Union Continuing Employee that is no less
favorable than that provided by Purchaser to its similarly situated employees,
(B) incentive opportunities, including bonuses (excluding value attributable
to equity-based compensation) to each Non-Union Continuing Employee that are
substantially comparable to incentive opportunities provided by Purchaser to
its similarly situated employees and (C) benefits to each Non-Union
Continuing Employee that, in the aggregate, are substantially comparable to
the benefits provided by Purchaser to its similarly situated employees.
Purchaser shall provide or cause its subsidiaries (including the Company) to
provide each Non-Union Continuing Employee whose employment is terminated
during the Continuation Period other than for cause with severance payments
and benefits that are no less favorable than the more favorable of (x) those
provided to such Non-Union Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Closing and (y) those provided to similarly situated employees of Purchaser
and its subsidiaries (excluding, after the Closing, the Company) under
severance plans, agreements or arrangements in effect at the time of such
termination of employment.

 



35 (b) With respect to any "employee benefit plan", as defined in Section 3(3)
of ERISA, maintained by Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries (including the
Company) (including any vacation, paid time-off and severance plans), for all
purposes, including determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits
and vesting (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding benefit accrual under any
defined benefit pension plan), each Continuing Employees service with the
Company (as well as service with any predecessor employer of the Company, to
the extent service with such predecessor employer is recognized by the
Company) shall be treated as service with Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries
(including the Company); _provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not
be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any
duplication of benefits.

(c) Purchaser shall waive, or Purchaser shall cause its subsidiaries
(including the Company) to waive or cause to be waived, any pre-existing
condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting
periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Purchaser or any of its
subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees (and their eligible dependents)
will be eligible to participate from and after the Closing, except to the
extent that such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-
work requirements and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived
under the comparable Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing. Purchaser
shall, or shall cause its subsidiaries (including the Company) to, recognize,
or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles
and similar expenses incurred by each Continuing Employee (and his or her
eligible dependents) during the calendar year in which the Closing occurs for
purposes of satisfying such years deductible and co-payment limitations under
the relevant welfare benefit plans in which such Continuing Employee (and his
or her eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the
Closing.

(d) [Intentionally Deleted].

(e) Seller will promptly notify Purchaser if Seller or the Company receives
written notice from any employee of the Company listed on _Section_ __ _
7.04(e)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter of his or her resignation from
employment with the Company.

 

(f) Seller shall provide an accurate and complete list upon the Closing of all
employees of the Company (other than any Excluded Employee) whose employment
terminated within the ninety (90) days prior to the Closing Date, stating for
each such employee the date of termination, the employees position and work
location, and whether such termination was voluntary or involuntary, and if
involuntary, whether or not for cause.

(g) In the case of each Excluded Employee, the Company shall be responsible
for paying the payroll amount due to such individual for the payroll period
(or portion thereof) ending on the date of the Excluded Employees transfer to
Seller or one of its Affiliates (other than the Company) (the "
_Transfer Date_ "), unless otherwise agreed to by Seller and Purchaser.
Pursuant to the "Standard Procedure" provided in section 4 of Revenue
Procedure 2004-53, 2004-2 C.B. 320, (i) Seller (or its applicable Affiliate
(other than the Company)) and the Company shall report on a
predecessor/successor basis as set forth therein, (ii) the Company will not be
relieved from filing a Form W-2 with respect to any Excluded Employee, and
(iii) Seller (or its applicable Affiliate (other than the Company)) will
undertake to file (or cause to be filed) a Form W-2 for each such Excluded
Employee with respect to the partial year following the Transfer Date.

(h) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 7.04_ or any other provision of
this Agreement shall be construed to (i) create (x) any third-party
beneficiary rights in any employee or former employee (including any
dependent thereof) of the Company or any of their Affiliates or any person
other than the parties or (y) any right to employment or continued employment
for any specified period or to a particular term or condition of employment
with Purchaser, the Company or any of their subsidiaries or Affiliates, (ii)
limit the ability of Purchaser, the Company or any of their subsidiaries or
Affiliates to terminate the

 



36  employment of any employee (including any Continuing Employee) at any time
and for any reason or (iii) establish, amend or modify any benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement or alter or limit Purchasers, the
Companys or any of their subsidiaries ability to amend, modify or terminate
any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement.

 

SECTION 7.05 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) All stock transfer, real estate transfer, documentary, filing, stamp,
recording, registration and other similar Taxes (including
interest, penalties and additions to any such Taxes, but, for the avoidance
of doubt, not including any income or capital gains Taxes or similar Taxes)
incurred in connection with the Transactions (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be
borne fifty percent by Purchaser and fifty percent by Seller. Seller and
Purchaser further agree, upon request, to use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain any certificate or other document from any Taxing Authority as may
be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
in connection with the Transactions. Purchaser shall be exclusively
responsible for preparing, executing and filing any Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to such Transfer Taxes. Seller shall pay to
Purchaser, at least five days before any such Tax Return is due, an amount
equal to Sellers share of such Transfer Taxes. If either Seller or Purchaser
receives any refund, credit or recovery of any Transfer Tax that was shared by
the parties in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 7.05(a)_, such party
shall promptly pay to the other party such other partys share of such refund,
credit or recovery, net of any reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses.

(b) Seller shall cause the Company to prepare and file or cause to be
prepared and filed, when due (taking into account all applicable extensions)
all Tax Returns that are filed by or with respect to the Company on or before
the Closing Date. Seller shall cause the Company to timely pay, or cause to be
paid, to the applicable Taxing Authority, all Taxes due with respect to such
Tax Returns.

(c) Purchaser shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, when
due (taking into account all applicable extensions) all Tax Returns (i) for
any taxable period that ends on or before the Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing
Tax Period_") and (ii) for any taxable period that includes (but does not end
on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), in each case that are filed by
or with respect to the Company after the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall
be prepared in a manner that is consistent with the past practice of the
Company, except as otherwise required by applicable Law. Purchaser shall
present such Tax Returns to Seller for review and comment at least 30 days
prior to the date on which such Tax Returns are required to be filed and such
Tax Returns shall be subject to Sellers written consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld; _provided_ that Purchaser and Seller shall act
reasonably and in good faith to resolve any objection properly and timely
raised by Seller with respect to such Tax Returns. If Seller and Purchaser are
unable to resolve any issue within 10 days after the date of receipt by
Purchaser of the request for changes, then Seller and Purchaser jointly shall
engage the Accounting Firm to determine the correct treatment of the item or
items in dispute. Each of Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the
other, shall bear and pay one half of the fees and other costs charged by the
Accounting Firm for such determination. Such determination of the Accounting
Firm shall be final and binding on the parties hereto. Seller shall pay to
Purchaser, at least five days before any such Tax Return is due, the amount,
if any, owed by Seller pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.01(c)_ with respect to
the taxable periods covered by such Tax Returns. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 7.05(c)_, this  _Section_ __ _ 7.05(c)_
shall not apply to income Tax Returns of Seller for any taxable period, and
Purchaser shall have no rights or obligations with respect to such Tax
Returns.

 

(d) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.05(c)_, neither Purchaser nor any of its
Affiliates shall (or shall cause or permit the Company to) file, amend or
refile any Tax Return of the Company for any taxable period beginning prior to
the Closing Date without the prior written consent of Seller.

 



37 (e) Except as described in _Section_ __ _ 2.03(f)_, any refund or credit
of Taxes of the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and the portion of any
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be paid to Seller. All other
refunds or credits of Taxes of the Company shall belong to Purchaser. Any
refund or credit of Taxes of the Company for a Straddle Period shall be
apportioned in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.05(m)_. Purchaser, on the one
hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall, or shall cause their Affiliates
to, pay to the other party the portion of any such refund or credit of Taxes
to which such other party is entitled under this _Section_ __ _ 7.05(e)_, in
the case of a refund, within ten days after such refund is received or in the
case of a credit, within ten days after such credit is allowed or applied
against other Tax liabilities; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any portion of
such refund or credit is subsequently disallowed by any Taxing Authority, the
amounts previously paid in respect thereof under this _Section_ __ _ 7.05(e)_
shall be promptly reimbursed by the payee to the payor.

 

(f) Purchaser and Seller shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their
Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and representatives to
reasonably cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns and in resolving
all disputes and audits relating to Taxes with respect to all taxable periods,
including by maintaining and making available to each other all
records reasonably necessary for the filing of any Tax Return or the conduct
of any Tax dispute or audit. Purchaser agrees to retain or cause to be
retained all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the
Company and the Companys assets and activities relating to taxable periods
beginning prior to the Closing Date until the expiration of the applicable
period for assessment under applicable Law (giving effect to any and all
extensions or waivers) and to abide by or cause the abidance with all record
retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority.

(g) All Tax sharing agreements, arrangements and practices between the
Company, on the one hand, and Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (other than
the Company), on the other hand, shall be terminated before the Closing. After
the Closing, neither Seller nor any Affiliate of Seller shall have any rights
or obligations under any such Tax sharing agreement, arrangement or practice.

(h) If Purchaser or any of its Affiliates receives notice of a Tax audit,
examination, claim, dispute, investigation or other proceeding, in each case
that relates to the Company (a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, then Purchaser shall notify Seller
within ten days after receipt of such notice. Purchasers notification to
Seller shall contain factual information describing the Tax Proceeding in
reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notice or other document
received from any Taxing Authority in respect of any such Tax Proceeding.

(i) In the case of a Tax Proceeding that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period,
Seller shall have the right to control the conduct of the Tax Proceeding. To
the extent Seller elects to control the Tax Proceeding, Seller shall
notify Purchaser of its intent to do so within 30 days of receipt of notice
of the Tax Proceeding, and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate, and shall
cause the Company to reasonably cooperate, in each phase of such Tax
Proceeding. If Seller elects not to control the Tax Proceeding, Purchaser
shall assume control of such Tax Proceeding. In such event, Seller shall have
the following rights (the " _Tax Proceeding Rights_ "): (i) Purchaser shall
keep Seller informed on a prompt basis regarding the progress and substantive
aspects of such Tax Proceeding, including by providing Seller with all written
materials relating to the Tax Proceeding submitted to and received from the
relevant Taxing Authority, (ii) Seller shall be entitled to participate in
the Tax Proceeding, including by having an opportunity to comment on any
written materials prepared in connection with such Tax Proceeding and
attending any conferences relating thereto, and (iii) Purchaser shall
not compromise, settle or resolve the Tax Proceeding without obtaining
Sellers prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.
In the case of a Tax Proceeding that relates to a Straddle Period (a "
_Straddle Period Contest_ "), Purchaser shall have the right to control such
Straddle Period Contest subject to the Tax Proceeding Rights.

 



38 (j) Neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall waive any statute of
limitations or agree to any extensions thereof in respect of any Pre-Closing
Tax Period or Straddle Period of the Company without the prior written consent
of Seller.

 

(k) For U.S. Federal income Tax purposes, the parties shall treat the
Membership Interest Purchase as a purchase by Purchaser of the assets owned
by the Company as of the Closing, and an assumption by Purchaser of any
liabilities of the Company as of the Closing.

(l) The purchase price and the amount of liabilities treated as having been
assumed by Purchaser as a result of the Membership Interest Purchase for U.S.
Federal income Tax purposes, shall be allocated among the assets owned as of
the Closing by the Company (such allocation, the " _Purchase Price
Allocation_ ") in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
regulations promulgated thereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
allocation to the Owned Real Property shall not exceed, in the aggregate, $50
million (unless either party determines, based on the advice of its
independent advisor, that such an allocation is not in accordance with Section
1060 of the Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder). The
Purchase Price Allocation shall be delivered by Purchaser to Seller within 90
days after the Closing Date for Sellers approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld. Seller and Purchaser shall work in good faith to
resolve any disputes relating to the Purchase Price Allocation within 30 days.
If Seller and Purchaser are unable to resolve any such dispute, such dispute
shall be resolved promptly by the Accounting Firm in accordance with the
procedures set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.03(c)_. If the purchase price is
adjusted pursuant to this Agreement, the Purchase Price Allocation shall be
adjusted as mutually agreed by Purchaser and Seller. Purchaser and Seller
shall file all Tax Returns (including, but not limited to, Internal Revenue
Service Form 8594) consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation, and neither
Purchaser nor Seller shall take any Tax position inconsistent with such
Purchase Price Allocation unless such position is mutually agreed by the
parties or required to be taken pursuant to a final determination under
Section 1313 of the Code. Purchaser and Seller agree to promptly advise the
other regarding the existence of any Tax audit or controversy regarding the
correctness of the Purchase Price Allocation or any adjustment thereto.

(m) In the case of any Straddle Period: (A) Property Taxes for the portion of
the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date shall be equal to
the amount of such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by
a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during the portion
of the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period; and
(B) Taxes (other than Property Taxes) for the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on and including the Closing Date shall be computed as if such taxable
period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date and, in the case
of any such Taxes attributable to the ownership of any equity interest in a
partnership or other "flowthrough" entity, as if the taxable period of that
entity ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date.

 

SECTION 7.06 _Financial Statements_. Upon the written request of Purchaser, at
Purchasers sole cost and expense and only to the extent necessary to comply
with the disclosure obligations of Purchaser or its Affiliates under Rule 3-05
of Regulation S-X (" _Rule 3-05_"), Seller shall provide Purchaser and its
representatives (including its legal counsel and independent auditors)
historical financial statements for (i) the latest fiscal year period prior to
the Closing Date, audited in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), (ii) any additional
audited fiscal year periods for prior periods should Purchasers auditors
determine that such additional periods would be required in order to comply
with Rule 3-05 and (iii) the latest fiscal year interim period financial

 



39  statements prior to the Closing Date as required by Rule 3-05 and deliver
them to Purchaser for its comment and review no less than fifteen (15) days
prior to the filing deadline stipulated by Rule 3-05 (and in any event no
later than 60 days following Purchasers request). The obligations of Seller
to disclose or provide reasonable access to any such historical financial
information shall terminate six months after the Closing Date. Purchaser shall
reimburse Seller for its and its Affiliates reasonable internal costs and
out-of-pocket costs associated with this _Section_ __ _ 7.06_. Purchaser
agrees that it shall consult with Seller in advance of requesting any such
access with a view towards establishing a mutually agreeable plan for such
access that shall not unreasonably interfere with the normal operation of
Seller. In addition, upon the written request of Purchaser, Seller shall, at
Purchasers sole cost and expense, prepare historical financial statements
for the interim period beginning the first day of the fiscal quarter in which
the Closing Date occurs through the Closing Date and deliver them to Purchaser
no less than 30 days after the Closing Date, provided such

auditor.

SECTION 7.07 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this

SECTION 7.08 _Termination of Transactions with Affiliates_. Seller
shall ensure that all transactions between the Company, on the one hand, and

other than the Company) or any Company Related Person, on the other hand, are
terminated and fully and completely discharged prior to the Close of Business
on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date.

SECTION 7.09 _Insurance_. From the date hereof until the Closing, Seller
shall, and shall cause the other members of the Seller Group to, promptly
notify each insurance carrier of any Insurance Policy of any claim relating to
the Company or the Business that reasonably could be expected to be covered
under such Insurance Policies (without giving effect to the $250,000
deductible) and, to the extent that Seller does not use the proceeds of any
insurance claim to repair the affected property of the Company, Seller
shall include the amount of the insurance proceeds in the Net Working Capital
Statement, or if received by Seller or any of its Affiliates after the
delivery of the Closing Statement, shall promptly remit all such proceeds to
the Company. Following the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause the other
members of the Seller Group to, use commercially reasonable efforts to enable,
after the Closing, the Seller Group, on behalf of Purchaser and the Company
to, at Purchasers sole cost and expense, file, notice and otherwise continue
to pursue any claims (including commercially reasonable efforts to assert and
maintain such claims), and recover proceeds under the terms of any Insurance
Policies which provide coverage with respect to the Company for any covered
loss, liability or damage under such Insurance Policies arising out of an
occurrence prior to the Closing Date or arising out of an act, error or
omission that forms the basis of a claim made against the Company prior
to the Closing Date. To the extent Seller or any of its Affiliates receives a
cash payment following the Closing from any insurance carrier for any such
insurance claims, then Seller shall promptly remit any such cash payment to
Purchaser;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such cash payment shall be (x)
reduced by the amount of any applicable deductibles and copayment provisions
or any payment or reimbursement obligations of Seller or any other member of
the Seller Group, as applicable, in respect thereof and (y) net of the amount
of any related Tax costs. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Seller and each other member of the Seller Group shall have no obligation to
keep the Insurance Policies in effect beyond the period for which premiums
have been paid as of the Closing.

that such person came into direct contact with in connection with the
Transactions who is (or was at any time during such two (2) year period) an
employee of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or subsidiaries, excluding in
either case any such employees that were terminated. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller shall not be precluded from soliciting or hiring any
employee who (a) responds to an advertisement or other general solicitation
not targeted to employees of a party (or its Affiliates) or (b) is referred by
a search firm, employment agency or similar entity so long as such entities
have not been directly or indirectly instructed by the hiring party to

and take such other actions as may reasonably be necessary, proper or
advisable, to the extent permitted by Law, to fulfill its or their obligations
under this Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

SECTION 7.13 _Real Property Matters_. Purchaser may obtain a commitment or
commitments for title insurance (individually or collectively, the " _Title

connection with Purchasers title policy. If Purchaser elects to obtain a
Title Commitment, purchase a title policy (inclusive of any endorsements
thereto) or order a Survey, in each case as provided herein, Purchaser shall
be responsible for all costs and expenses in connection therewith. Sellers
obligations with respect to this  _Section_ __ _ 7.13_ shall be exclusively
limited to (i) providing a reasonable and customary owners affidavit executed
and delivered by the Company in favor of the Title Company in order to permit
the Title Company to delete from the title policy such general exceptions to

practices liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance policies that

to matters existing or arising on or before the Closing Date.

 

SECTION 7.15 _Parent Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this

arise from transactions that occur on the Closing Date after the
Closing (including the sale or disposition of any assets); or

(d) any Retained Liabilities.

 

For the purposes of the indemnity provided in this _Section_ __ _ 10.01_, any
Losses hereunder (including Losses related to Taxes, for which
indemnification provisions are set forth in _Section 10.01(c)_) shall be
determined on the basis of the net effect after giving effect to any actual
cash payments or setoffs in each case as actually received or retained by the
Purchaser Indemnified Persons as a result of the event giving rise to a claim
for such indemnification.

SECTION 10.02  _Equityholders_ __ _Indemnification_. From and after the
Closing, Seller and its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees,
stockholders, agents and other Representatives (collectively, the "

SECTION 10.03 _Defense of Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) If any legal proceedings shall be instituted or any claim is asserted by
any third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") in respect of which any
Indemnifying Party may have an obligation to indemnify an Indemnified Party,
then the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party written notice
thereof within 10 Business Days after receipt by such Indemnified Party
of notice of the Third Party Claim, but any failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to
the Indemnified Party other than to the extent the Indemnifying Party is
actually prejudiced thereby. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver
to the Indemnifying Party, within five Business Days time after the
Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all material notices and
documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating
to the Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
agree to keep each other reasonably apprised of any additional information
concerning such Third Party Claim.

 



47 (b) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, subject to _Section_ __ _ 10.03(c)_, if it so chooses, upon written
notice to the Indemnified Party within 10 Business Days after having received
the applicable claim notice with respect to such Third Party Claim, to assume
the defense thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party;
_provided_ that such counsel is not reasonably objected to by the Indemnified
Party. Should the Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the defense of a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in
such defense but the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified
Party for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party
in connection with such participation; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for such legal expenses if the Indemnified
Party determines in good faith that the incurrence of the same is appropriate
in light of defenses not available to the Indemnifying Party, conflicts of
interest or other similar circumstances.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in _Section_ __ _ 10.03(b)_ to the contrary, in
no event shall the Indemnifying Party have the right to assume, or continue,
the defense of a Third Party Claim if (i) such Third Party Claim relates to or
arises in connection with any criminal Action, (ii) such Third Party Claim
seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against any Indemnified Party or
any of its Affiliates, (iii) the Indemnifying Party has an interest, other
than any interest under this Agreement, with respect to such Third Party
Claim, which interest conflicts (as reasonably determined by counsel for the
Indemnified Party) with the interests of the Indemnified Party, (iv) the
Indemnifying Party fails to diligently defend such Third Party Claim, or (v)
Seller is the Indemnifying Party and the Third Party Claim is covered under or

(d) Each party shall cooperate, and cause its Affiliates to cooperate in the

such party of records and information that are reasonably relevant to such
Third Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide testimony or additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder.

(e) In the event the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of a
Third Party Claim in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 10.03(b)_, the
Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written approval of the Indemnified
Party before entering into any settlement of such claim or ceasing to defend
against such claim (with such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Indemnifying
Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim in accordance with 
_Section_ __ _ 10.03(b)_, the Indemnified Party shall agree to any
settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third Party Claim that the
Indemnifying Party may recommend and that by its terms obligates the
Indemnifying Party to pay the full amount of the liability in connection with
such Third Party Claim, which unconditionally releases the Indemnified Party
and its Affiliates completely in connection with such Third Party Claim and
does not impose or purport to impose any obligation or restriction on such
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates (including any injunctive or other
equitable relief against any Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates or any
action or restriction upon the conduct of any business by any Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates).

(f) Whether or not the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to,
or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the
Indemnifying Partys prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



48 (g) If the Indemnifying Party does not assume control of the defense of such
claim in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 10.03(b)_, or the Indemnifying Party
does not have the right to assume, or continue, the defense of such claim
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.03(c)_, then the Indemnified Party (i)
shall have the right to defend such Third Party Claim as if such Indemnified
Party were not entitled to indemnification under this _Article_ __ _ X_, with
counsel selected by the Indemnified Party, in all proceedings and (ii)
shall keep the Indemnifying Party informed of the progress of the Third Party
Claim and shall as promptly as practicable provide such Indemnifying Party
with copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by
the Indemnified Party relating to such Third Party Claim.

SECTION 10.04 _Other Claims_. A claim for indemnification for any matter not
involving a Third Party Claim shall be asserted by the Indemnified Party to
the Indemnifying Party in writing with reasonable promptness, setting forth
specifically the obligation with respect to which the claim is made, the
facts giving rise to and the alleged basis for such claim and, if known or
reasonably ascertainable, the amount of the liability asserted or which may be
asserted by reason thereof, but any failure to so notify the Indemnifying
Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may
have to the Indemnified Party other than to the extent the Indemnifying Party
is actually prejudiced thereby. In the event the Indemnifying Party disputes
its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party under this _Article_ __ _
X_, the Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days after receipt of notice under
this _Section_ __ _ 10.04_ to give written notice of such objection, and the
grounds therefor, and the Indemnified Party shall thereafter have 30 days to
respond in writing to the objection of the Indemnifying Party. If after such
30-day period there remains a dispute as to any obligation, the parties shall
attempt in good faith for 30 days to agree upon the rights of the respective
parties with respect to such indemnification obligation. If (i) at the end of
such 30-day period or (ii) as a result of the Indemnifying Party not
responding to the notice of objection in the time period provided, the parties
are unable to resolve any remaining disputes, the Indemnified Party may
initiate a court proceeding with respect to such claim in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 11.10_. For the avoidance of doubt, the dispute resolution
procedures set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 10.04_ shall only apply to a
determination of whether a claim for indemnification not involving a Third
Party Claim is indemnifiable by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 10.01_ or _Section_ __ _ 10.02_, as applicable, and not with respect to
the determination of the actual amount payable by the Indemnifying Party to
the Indemnified Party in respect of such claim pursuant to this _Article_ __
X, which such actual indemnifiable amount may not be known by the Indemnified
Party at the time notice of such claim is provided to the Indemnifying Party

are attempting to resolve any dispute with respect to such claim in accordance
with this  _Section_ __ _ 10.04_.

Purchaser Indemnified Person shall be entitled to indemnification under this

reflected in the Final Closing Adjustment and arise out of or are based upon
the breach or failure to be true and correct of any representation or
warranty set forth in _Article_ __ _ III_ or _Article_ __ _ IV_ or (ii) in
respect of any liability or obligation of the Company (other than the
liabilities and obligations set forth in clause (iii) of the definition of
Retained Liabilities), whether arising prior to, on or after the Closing, that

otherwise to Hazardous Materials, as it is the parties express agreement and
intent that the sole and exclusive remedy for any and all such liabilities and
obligations shall be pursuant to the Representation and Warranty Policy and

(f) Upon making any indemnity payment hereunder, the Indemnifying Party will,
to the extent of such payment or amount, be subrogated to all rights of the
Indemnified Party against any third party in respect of the Loss to which such

Indemnifying Party will duly execute upon request all instruments reasonably
necessary to evidence and perfect the above-described subrogation
and subordination rights;

duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such
liability constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement or more than one right to indemnification; and

_ III_ and _Article_ __ _ IV_, (A) Seller and the Company have not made any
representation or warranty, expressed or implied, as to Seller or the Company,

upon, and specifically disclaims reliance on, any representation or warranty

Seller or the Company that is not set forth in  _Article_ __ _ III_ or
_Article_ __ _ IV_ and (C) except in the case of a breach of the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, none of Seller or

of, or in connection with, the Transactions.

(i) The representations, warranties, covenants and agreement of the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Partys right to indemnification with
respect thereto, shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of any
investigation made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party (including any of
its Representative) or by reason of the fact that the Indemnified Party or any
of its Representatives knew or should have known that any such representation
or warranty is, was or might be inaccurate or by reason of the Indemnified
Partys waiver of any condition set forth in _Article_ __ _ VII_ or _Article_

with respect to any rights of contribution or recovery otherwise available to
such party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act or other Environmental Laws) except pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this  _Article_ __ _ X_, other than
claims based on fraud or willful misconduct. For the avoidance of doubt,

SECTION 11.03 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
an Article, Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article or
Section of, or an Exhibit to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. All
Exhibits and schedules annexed hereto or referred to herein and the Seller
Disclosure Letter are hereby incorporated in and made a part of this
Agreement as if set forth in full herein and are an integral part of this
Agreement. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation". The words "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
All references herein to "dollars", "U.S. dollars" or "$" shall be deemed to
be references to the lawful money of the United States. All provisions herein
qualified by the term "domestic" or "foreign" shall be construed on the basis
that the United States is the relevant domestic country. The definitions
contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the
plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and
neuter genders of such terms. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or
referred to herein or in any

 



67  agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement,
instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented,
including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and
(in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and
references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein.
References to a person are also to such persons permitted successors and
assigns (except in the case of Associated Asphalt Marketing, LLC unless
expressly provided). References to the knowledge of the Company shall include
the knowledge of Seller. Unless otherwise qualified, any reference to
an ability to withhold consent shall be understood to mean that the
withholding party may withhold such consent in its sole and absolute
discretion.

 

SECTION 11.04 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
to the end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

SECTION 11.05  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when signed by each of the parties and the Company and
delivered to each party and the Company. Delivery of an executed signature
page of this Agreement by facsimile or e-mail transmission of a .pdf has the
same legal effect as delivery of an original signed copy of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 11.06 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement, together with the attached exhibits and schedule, the Seller
Disclosure Letter, the Non-Disclosure Agreement, the Joint Defense and
Confidentiality Agreement between Seller and Purchaser, dated as of May 15,
2018 and the Clean Team Confidentiality Agreement between Seller and
Purchaser, dated as of May 15, 2018 constitute the entire agreement, and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties and the Company with respect to the Transactions,
and except for _Section_ __ _ 7.02(a)(2)_, _Section_ __ _ 7.14_, _Article_
__ _ X_ and _Section_ __ _ 11.13_, is not intended to confer upon any person
other than the parties any rights or remedies.

SECTION 11.07 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless
of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of
conflicts of laws thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that any dispute
resolution by the Accounting Firm in accordance with  _Section_ __ _
2.03(c)(iii)_ and _Sections 2.08(c)(iv)-(vii)_ shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of laws thereof.

SECTION 11.08 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be delegated or assigned,
in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties or
the Company without the prior written consent of the other parties or the
Company, except that Purchaser may delegate or assign, in its sole
discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under this
Agreement to any Affiliate of Purchaser, but no such assignment shall relieve
Purchaser of any of its obligations under this Agreement. Any purported
assignment without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the
immediately preceding two sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their
respective successors and assigns.

 



68 SECTION 11.09 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The parties and the Company agree that irreparable damage for which
monetary damages, even if available, are not an adequate remedy would occur
in the event that the parties and the Company do not perform their obligations
under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions
as are required of them hereunder to consummate the Transactions) in
accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions.
Subject to the immediately following sentence, the parties and the Company
acknowledge and agree that (i) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in the courts described in _Section_ __ _ 11.10_ without
proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled under this Agreement, and (ii) the right of specific
enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions and without that right,
neither Seller, the Company nor Purchaser would have entered into this
Agreement.

(b) Each of the parties and the Company agree that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in
equity. The parties and the Company acknowledge and agree that any party
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 11.09_ shall not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction,
and the party or the Company opposing such injunction or injunctions hereby
agrees that it shall not contest the amount or absence of any such bond or
other security requested or offered by the party seeking such injunction or
injunctions. If, prior to the Outside Date, any party brings any Action, in
each case in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 11.10_, to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof,
the Outside Date shall automatically be extended by (A) the amount of time
during which such Action is pending _plus_ 10 Business Days, or (B) such
other time period established by the court presiding over such suit, action or
proceeding, as the case may be; _provided_ that in no event shall the Outside
Date be extended longer than sixty days pursuant to clause (A) or (B).

SECTION 11.10 _Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process_ _; Jury Trial
Waiver_.

 

(a) All Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard
and determined in the state courts of Delaware sitting in New Castle County,
or solely if none of those courts have jurisdiction, a federal court sitting
in the State of Delaware. In addition, each of the parties and the Company
hereby irrevocably (i) submits to the jurisdiction of such courts (and,
in the case of appeals, appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such
Action and irrevocably waives the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any such action or proceeding, (ii) agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court, and (iii) agrees that it will not bring
any action relating to this Agreement or the Transactions in any court other
than the state courts of Delaware sitting in New Castle County, or solely if
none of those courts have jurisdiction, a federal court sitting in the State
of Delaware. The consents to jurisdiction set forth in this paragraph shall
not constitute general consents to service of process in the State of
Delaware. The parties and the Company agree that service of process by
certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address for notices set out
in _Section_ __ _ 11.01_ shall be sufficient to satisfy all
legal requirements for service of process. The parties and the Company agree
that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by applicable Law.

 



69 (b) EACH OF THE PARTIES AND THE COMPANY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY AND THE
COMPANY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY
WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION RELATED TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE COMPANY CERTIFIES
AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY PARTY OR THE COMPANY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT ANY OTHER PARTY OR THE COMPANY
WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF AN ACTION,
(II) SUCH PARTY AND THE COMPANY HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS
WAIVER, (III) SUCH PARTY AND THE COMPANY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND
(IV) SUCH PARTY AND THE COMPANY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _S
ECTION_ __ __ _ 11.10(_ _b_ _)_.

 

SECTION 11.11 _Provision with Respect to Legal Representation_. Each of the
parties hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its directors,
members, partners, officers, employees and Affiliates, that Cravath, Swaine and
Moore LLP may serve as counsel to Goldberg Lindsay and its Affiliates (the "
_LG Group_ "), on the one hand, and Seller and the other members of the
Seller Group, on the other hand, in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of
the Transactions, and that, following consummation of the Transactions,
Cravath, Swaine _ and _Moore LLP may serve as counsel to any member of the LG
Group or any director, member, partner, officer, employee or Affiliate of the
LG Group, in connection with any litigation, claim or obligation arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, notwithstanding such
representation and each of the parties hereby consents thereto and waives any
conflict of interest arising therefrom, and each of such parties shall cause
any Affiliate thereof to consent to waive any conflict of interest arising
from such representation. In connection with any dispute that may arise
between the LG Group and Purchaser or the Company, the individual members of
the LG Group involved in such dispute (and not Purchaser or the Company) will
have the right to decide whether or not to waive any attorney-client privilege
that may apply to any communications between Seller and Cravath, Swaine and
Moore LLP that occurred before the Closing.

 

SECTION 11.12 _Purchaser and Seller Acknowledgement_ _s_.

 

(a) Purchaser is knowledgeable about the Business engaged in by the Company.

 

(b) Purchaser, Seller and the Company each acknowledge that they are
sophisticated parties and have been represented by sophisticated counsel of
their choosing. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that any financial forecasts
or projections relating to the Company or the Business prepared by or on
behalf of Seller have been provided to Purchaser with the understanding and
agreement that, except for the representations and warranties set forth in
this Agreement, Seller is not making any representation or warranty with
respect to such forecasts or projections and that actual future results may
vary from such forecasts or projections based upon numerous factors.

SECTION 11.13 _Affiliate Liability_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth
in this Agreement, (a) no person other than the parties, the Company and
their respective successors and permitted assigns shall have any Liability
under this Agreement or in connection with the Transactions and (b)
notwithstanding that any party, the Company or any of their successors or
permitted assigns may be a partnership or limited liability company, no person
has any rights of recovery against, and no recourse under this Agreement or
under any documents or instruments delivered in connection herewith or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith or therewith shall be had against, any person who is not a party,
including (i) any past, present or future, direct or indirect, 

 



70  director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, general or limited
partner, manager, management company, stockholder, equityholder, controlling
person, Affiliate, subsidiary, portfolio company, agent, attorney,
Representative or assignee of, and any financial advisor, financing source or

executors, administrators, successors or assigns, (iii) any past, present or
future, direct or indirect, director, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
general or limited partner, manager, management company, stockholder,
equityholder, controlling person, Affiliate, subsidiary, portfolio company,
agent, attorney, Representative or assignee of, and any financial advisor,
financing source or lender to, any of the foregoing persons set forth in
clauses (i) and (ii), and (iv) any of the heirs, executors, administrators,
successors or assigns of the foregoing persons set forth in clauses (i) 
(iii) (collectively, the persons set forth in clauses (i) through (iv) that
are not parties, " _Related Parties_ ") in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, whether by or through attempted
piercing of the corporate veil, by or through a claim (whether at law or
equity in tort, contract or otherwise) by or on behalf of any party or the
Company against any Related Party of any party or the Company, by the
enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or by
virtue of any applicable Law, or otherwise, it being agreed and acknowledged
that no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on
or otherwise be incurred by any Related Party of any party or the Company for
any obligations of a party or the Company to this Agreement or any document or
instrument delivered in connection herewith or any of such partys or the
Companys successors or permitted assigns or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith
or for any claim (whether at law or equity or in tort, contract or otherwise)
based on, in respect of, or by reason of such obligations or their creation
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Each party and the Company
hereby covenants and agrees that, except to the extent any Related Party of
any party or the Company has any express obligations under this Agreement, it
shall not institute, and shall cause its Affiliates not to institute, any
legal proceeding or bring any other claim (whether at law or equity in tort,
contract or otherwise) arising under, or in connection with, this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith, against any Related Party of any party or the Company. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted by
Law, except to the extent otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement,
each party and the Company disclaims any reliance upon any Related Party of
any party with respect to the performance of this Agreement, this Agreement
or any representation or warranty made in, in connection with or as an
inducement to this Agreement. This _Section_ __ _ 11.13_ is intended to
benefit and may be enforced by any Related Party. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 11.13_ shall in any way limit or
modify the rights and obligations of the parties or the Company under this
Agreement.
