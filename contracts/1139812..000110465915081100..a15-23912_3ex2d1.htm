AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 



 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of November 20, 2015 (this "
_Agreement_ "), by and between MB Financial, Inc., a Maryland corporation ("
_Parent_ "), and American Chartered Bancorp, Inc., an Illinois corporation ("
_Company_ ").

 



 

W I T N E S S E T H:

 



 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent and Company have determined that it
is in the best interests of their respective companies and shareholders to
consummate the business combination transaction provided for herein, pursuant
to which Company will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
merge with and into Parent (the " _Merger_ "), so that Parent is the surviving
corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred to in such capacity as the "
_Surviving Corporation_ ") in the Merger;

 



 

WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and it is intended
that this Agreement be and be adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for
purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code;

 



 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and as a condition
and inducement to Parents willingness to enter into this Agreement, all of
the director shareholders of Company and certain other shareholders of Company
have entered into Voting and Support Agreements in connection with the Merger,
in substantially the form of Annex A-1 hereto;

 



 

WHEREAS, the holders of the Series F Preferred Stock have simultaneously
herewith entered into agreements with Company, in substantially the form of
Annex A-2 hereto, requiring that, among other things, such holders take all
necessary actions to cause their shares of Preferred Stock to be converted to
Company Common Stock pursuant to Companys Charter or to elect to receive the
Merger Consideration payable in the Merger in respect of shares of Company
Common Stock, effective as of immediately prior to the Merger; and

 



 

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

accordance with the Maryland General Corporation Law, as amended (the " _MGCL_
") and the Illinois Business Corporation Act, as amended (the " _IBCA_ "), at
the Effective Time, Company shall merge with and into Parent. Parent shall be
the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, and

      
 

 



 

shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of
Maryland. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of
Company shall terminate.

 



 

1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m.,

date which shall be no later than three (3) business days after the
satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the latest to occur of
the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by
their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver thereof), unless another date, time or place is agreed
to in writing by Parent and Company. The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."

 



 

1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
on or before the Closing Date, Parent and Company, respectively, shall cause
to be filed articles of merger with the Department of Assessments and Taxation
of the State of Maryland (the " _Maryland Department_ ") and a certificate of
merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Illinois (the " _Illinois
Secretary_ ") (such articles and such certificate, collectively, the "
_Certificates of Merger_ "). The Merger shall become effective as of the date
and time specified in the Certificates of Merger (such date and time, the "
_Effective Time_ ").

 



 

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the IBCA and MGCL.

 



 

1.5 _Articles of Incorporation of Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective
Time, the Articles of Incorporation of Parent, as amended (the " _Parent

Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with their terms and applicable law.

 



 

1.6 _Bylaws of Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective Time, the Amended and
Restated Bylaws of Parent (the " _Parent Bylaws_ "), as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended in accordance with their terms and applicable law.

 



 

1.7 _Directors_. The directors of Parent immediately prior to the Effective
Time, together with the individual set forth in Section 6.11, shall be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death,

Effective Time, taken as a whole (" _Series D Merger Consideration_").

 



 

(d) _Series F Preferred Stock._ In the event that each share of the Non-

Agreement to the contrary, at the Effective Time, all shares of capital stock

2.2 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, each option granted by Company to purchase shares
of Company Common Stock under a Company Stock Plan (as defined below) that is
outstanding, vested and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (a
" _Company Stock Option_ ") shall be cancelled and converted automatically
into the right to receive, in respect of each Net Option Share, at the
election of the holder thereof as provided in, and subject to the provisions
of Section 2.5, either (i) the Cash Consideration or (ii) the Stock
Consideration, treating each such Net Option Share in the same manner as all
other Exchangeable Shares for such purposes, including with respect to the
proration described in Section 2.6. Any vested Company Stock Option that has
an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock that is greater than or
equal to the Per Share Cash Consideration shall be cancelled for no
consideration.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option that is outstanding and
unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, without any action on
the part of Parent, the Company, or the holder thereof, cease to represent a
right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be assumed and
converted automatically into an option (each, an " _Adjusted Option_ ") to
purchase the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to the Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time,
by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares
of Parent Common Stock. Each Adjusted Option shall have an exercise price per
share of Parent Common Stock equal to (x) the per share exercise price of such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided by (y)
the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Each Adjusted Option
shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to the
corresponding Company Stock Option under the applicable Company Stock Plan and
the agreements evidencing grants thereunder, including vesting terms. The
parties intend that the assumption of the unvested Company Stock Options shall
be effected in a manner that satisfies the

 



      
 

 



 

requirements of Section 409A and 424(a) of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, and this Section 2.2(b) shall be construed
consistent with this intent.

 



 

(c) At the Effective Time, each award in respect of a share of Company Common
Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction granted under
a Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (a " _Company Restricted Stock Award_ ") shall, without any action on the
part of Parent, the Company, or the holder thereof, be assumed and converted
automatically into a restricted stock award (each, an " _Adjusted Restricted
Stock Award_ ") with respect to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to the Company Restricted Stock Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time, by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the
nearest whole share of Parent Common Stock. Each Adjusted Restricted Stock
Award shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions applicable
to the corresponding Company Restricted Stock Award under the applicable
Company Stock Plan and the agreements evidencing grants thereunder, including
vesting terms.

 



 

(d) At or prior to the Effective Time, Company, the Board of Directors of
Company and its compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this Section 2.2.

 



 

(e) Parent shall file with the SEC, no later than the Closing Date, a post-
effective amendment to Form S-4 or a registration statement on Form S-8 (or
other applicable form), to the extent such form is available, relating to the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to Adjusted Options and
Adjusted Restricted Stock Awards.

 



 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms have the following
meanings:

 



 

(i) " _Company Stock Plans_ " means, collectively, the Amended and Restated
2005 Stock Incentive Plan and the Nonqualified Stock Option Plan, as amended
and restated February 3, 2009.

 



 

(ii) _"Net Option Share_ " means, with respect to a Company Stock Option, the
quotient obtained by dividing (A) (x) the excess, if any, of the Per Share
Cash Consideration over the per share exercise price of such Company Stock
Option, multiplied by (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company Stock Option, by (B) the Per Share Cash Consideration.

 



 

2.3 _Certain Adjustments_. In the event that prior to the Effective Time,
solely as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse
stock split), combination or exchange of shares, stock dividend or stock
distribution that in any such event is made on a pro rata basis to all holders
of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock or Parent Common Stock, there
is a change in the number of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred
Stock or Parent Common Stock outstanding or issuable upon the conversion,
exchange or exercise of securities or rights convertible or exchangeable or
exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred or Parent
Common Stock, then the Merger

 



      
 

 



 

Consideration or Preferred Merger Consideration (as applicable) payable with
respect to each share of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock and
each Company Equity Award shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such event.

 



 

2.4 _Dissenting Shares_. Holders of shares of Company Common Stock who have
not voted in favor of the Merger and otherwise have complied with requirements
for perfecting appraisal rights under Sections 11.65 and 11.70 of the IBCA
will be entitled to exercise such rights with respect to the shares as to
which such rights have been perfected (" _Dissenting Shares_ "), to the extent
available under the IBCA. Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration but shall only be entitled to
receive such consideration as will be determined under the IBCA. Each share of
Company Common Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and with respect to which appraisal rights under the IBCA may be, but
have not yet been, perfected, will, if and when such appraisal rights can no
longer be legally perfected or exercised under the IBCA, be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, and will no longer be a Dissenting
Share. Prior to the Closing Date, Company shall from time to time give prompt
notice to Parent of any notifications, demands, attempted withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the IBCA received by
Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock. Parent shall have the
right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, make any payment with respect to, settle, offer to
settle, any such demands.

 



 

2.5 _Election Procedures_. Each holder of record of shares of Exchangeable
Shares and Net Option Shares to be converted into the right to receive the
Cash Consideration and/or the Stock Consideration in accordance with, and
subject to, Sections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.5 (a " _Holder_ ") shall have the right,
subject to the limitations set forth in this Article II, to submit an election
in accordance with the following procedures:

 



 

(a) Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 2.5 (an " _Election_ ") (i) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock or Net Option Shares owned by such Holder with respect to
which such Holder desires to make a Stock Election and (ii) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock or Net Option Shares owned by such Holder with
respect to which such Holder desires to make a Cash Election. A share or Net
Option Share in respect of which the holder has validly elected to make a
Stock Election is referred to as a " _Stock Election Share_ " and a share or
Net Option Share in respect of which the holder has validly elected to make a
Cash Election is referred to as a " _Cash Election Share_."

 



 

(b) Parent shall prepare a form reasonably acceptable to Company, including
appropriate and customary transmittal materials in such form as prepared by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to Company (together with such instruments
prepared by Parent and reasonably acceptable to Company to permit holders of
Company Preferred Stock to elect to receive the Merger Consideration or
convert to shares of Company Common Stock, in each case pursuant to the
Companys Charter and as applicable, the " _Form of Election_"), so as to
permit Holders to exercise their right to make an Election.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The holder of each Company Stock Option shall be permitted to elect, by
delivery of a written instruction to Parent not later than the Election
Deadline (the " _Withholding Election_ "), that any withholding of amounts
required to be withheld or deducted under the Code with respect to the payment
of the Merger Consideration to be made in connection with the cancellation of
such Company Stock Option shall be (x) applied to first reduce the portion of
the Merger Consideration that is payable to such holder in cash, (y) applied
to first reduce the portion of the Merger Consideration that is payable to
such holder in shares of Parent Common Stock (with the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock to be withheld to be determined based on the closing price
of a share of Parent Common Stock on the Closing Date) (such election
described in this clause (y), a " _Stock Withholding Election_ ") or (z)
applied in the manner described in each of the foregoing clauses (x) and (y)
to first reduce the Merger Consideration in the respective proportions
specified by such holder in the Withholding Election. In the event that the
holder of any Company Stock Options fails to make a Withholding Election prior
to the Election Deadline, such holder shall be deemed to have made a Stock
Withholding Election.

 



 

(d) Parent (i) shall initially make available and mail the Form of Election
not less than twenty (20) business days prior to the anticipated Election
Deadline to Holders of record as of the business day prior to such mailing
date (including for the avoidance of doubt holders of Series D Preferred Stock
and Series F Preferred Stock as of such date), and (ii) following such mailing
date, shall use all reasonable efforts to make available as promptly as
possible a Form of Election to any stockholder or holder of Company Stock
Options who requests such Form of Election prior to the Election Deadline. The
time period between such mailing date and the Election Deadline is referred to
herein as the " _Election Period_ ".

 



 

(e) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the Exchange Agent
shall have received, during the Election Period, (i) a Form of Election
properly completed and signed (including duly executed transmittal materials
included in the Form of Election) and accompanied by any Old Certificates
representing all certificated shares to which such Form of Election relates or
by an appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such Old Certificates, as
set forth in such Form of Election, from a member of any registered national
securities exchange or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States
and (ii) in the case of an Election by a holder of Company Preferred Stock, an
irrevocable commitment by such holder in a form reasonably satisfactory to
Parent to elect pursuant to the Companys Charter to receive the Merger
Consideration payable hereunder to holders of Company Common Stock on an as-
converted basis (as applicable) or an instrument reasonably acceptable to
Parent pursuant to which such holder irrevocably elects to convert the
applicable shares of Company Preferred Stock to shares of Company Common Stock
(as applicable), effective at or prior to the Closing. As used herein, unless
otherwise agreed in advance by the parties, " _Election Deadline_ " means 5:00
p.m. local time (in the city in which the principal office of the Exchange
Agent is located) on the date which the parties shall agree is as near as
practicable to three (3) business days preceding the Closing Date. The Parties
shall cooperate to issue a press release reasonably satisfactory to each of
them announcing the date of the Election Deadline not more than fifteen (15)
business days before, and at least five (5) business days prior to, the
Election Deadline.

 



 

(f) Any Holder may, at any time during the Election Period, change or revoke
his or her Election by written notice to the Exchange Agent prior to the
Election Deadline

 



      
 

 



 

accompanied by a properly completed and signed revised Form of Election. If
any Election is not properly made with respect to any shares of Company Common
Stock or Net Option Shares (none of Parent, Company nor the Exchange Agent
being under any duty to notify any Holder of any such defect), such Election
shall be deemed to be not in effect, and the shares of Company Common Stock or
Net Option Shares covered by such Election shall, for purposes hereof, be
deemed to be Non-Election Shares, unless a proper Election is thereafter
timely made.

 



 

(g) Any Holder may, at any time during the Election Period, revoke his or her
Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the
Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline of his or
her Old Certificates, or of the guarantee of delivery of such Old
Certificates, previously deposited with the Exchange Agent, in which case the
shares or Net Option Shares covered thereby shall, for purposes hereof, be
deemed to be Non-Election Shares, unless a proper Election is thereafter
timely made. All Elections shall be automatically deemed revoked upon receipt
by the Exchange Agent of written notification from the parties that this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with the terms hereof.

 



 

(h) Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Form of Election, Parent,
in the exercise of its reasonable, good faith discretion, shall have the right
to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement,
governing (i) the validity of the Forms of Election and compliance by any
Holder with the Election procedures set forth herein, (ii) the method of
issuance and delivery of New Certificates representing the whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock into which Exchangeable Shares and Net Option
Shares are converted to Stock Consideration in the Merger and (iii) the method
of payment of cash for shares of Exchangeable Shares and Net Option Shares
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.

 



 

2.6 _Proration_. Within five (5) business days after the Election Deadline,
unless the Effective Time has not yet occurred, in which case as soon
thereafter as practicable, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect the
allocation among the holders of Exchangeable Shares of rights to receive
Parent Common Stock and/or cash in the Merger in accordance with the Elections
follows:

 



 

(a) _Excess Cash Election._ If the aggregate cash amount that would be paid
upon the conversion in the Merger of the Cash Election Shares and the

(iii) all Dissenting Shares shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Section

(iv) the Exchange Agent shall then select from among the Cash Election Shares,
by a pro rata selection process, a sufficient number of shares and Net

 



      
 

 



 

Option Shares, as applicable, (" _Stock Designated Shares_ ") such that the
aggregate cash amount that will be paid in the Merger equals as closely as
practicable $100,000,000 (the " _Total Cash Amount_ "), and all Stock
Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration; and

 



 

(v) the Cash Election Shares (other than Series D Cash Election Shares) that
are not Stock Designated Shares will be converted into the right to receive
the Cash Consideration.

 



 

(b) _Excess Stock Election. _If the aggregate cash amount that would be paid
upon conversion in the Merger of the Cash Election Shares and Dissenting
Shares is less than the Total Cash Amount, then:

 



 

(i) all Series D Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive the Cash Consideration;

 



 

(ii) all Cash Election Shares (other than Series D Cash Election Shares) and
Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash

(iii) all Dissenting Shares shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Section

Shares, by a pro rata selection process, a sufficient number of shares and Net
Option Shares, as applicable, (" _Cash Designated Shares_ ") such that the
aggregate cash amount that will be paid in the Merger equals as closely as
practicable the Total Cash Amount, and all Cash Designated Shares (other than
Series D Cash Election Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive
the Cash Consideration; and

 



 

(v) the Stock Election Shares and the Non-Election Shares that are not Cash
Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Stock Consideration.

 



 

(c) _Proportionate Election._ If the aggregate cash amount that would be paid
upon conversion in the Merger of the Cash Election Shares and Dissenting
Shares is equal or nearly equal (as determined by the Exchange Agent) to the
Total Cash Amount, then subparagraphs (a) and (b) above shall not apply, and:

 



 

(i) all Series D Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive the Cash Consideration;

 



 

(ii) all Dissenting Shares shall be converted in accordance with Section 2.4;

 



 

(iii) the Exchange Agent shall then select from among the Cash Election Shares
(other than the Series D Cash Election Shares), by a pro rata selection
process, a sufficient number of Stock Designated Shares such that the
aggregate cash

 



       
 

 



 

amount that will be paid in the Merger equals as closely as practicable the

right to receive the Stock Consideration; and

 



 

(iv) the Cash Election Shares that are not Stock Designated Shares will be
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration.

 



 

2.7 _Parent to Make Shares Available_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent

Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock (as applicable), and (b) cash

cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock (such cash and
New Certificates described in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), together with
any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent, provided that no
such investment or losses thereon shall affect the amount of Merger
Consideration payable to the holders of Old Certificates. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent.

 



 

2.8 _Exchange of Shares_.

 



 

(a) All of the shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock
converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration and Preferred Stock
Merger Consideration (as applicable), respectively, pursuant to this Article
II shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, an
" _Old Certificate_ ", it being understood that any reference herein to "Old
Certificate" shall be deemed to include reference to book-entry account
statements relating to the ownership of shares of capital stock of Company)
previously representing any such shares shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive (i) the applicable Merger Consideration or Preferred Stock
Merger Consideration, (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares which the shares
of capital stock of Company represented by such Old Certificate have been
converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Article II, without any
interest thereon and (iii) any dividends or distributions which the holder
thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.8(c). Old Certificates
previously representing shares of capital stock of Company shall be exchanged
for certificates or, at Parents option, evidence of shares in book entry form
(collectively referred to herein as " _New Certificates_ "), representing
whole shares of Parent Common Stock or preferred stock of Parent (as
applicable) and cash as set forth in this Article II (together with any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto and cash in lieu of fractional
shares issued in consideration therefor) upon the surrender of such Old
Certificates in accordance with Section 2.8(c), without any interest thereon.
If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock
or capital stock of Company shall have been increased, decreased, or changed
into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities, in
any such case as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other
similar change in capitalization, or there shall be any extraordinary dividend
or

 



      
 

 



 

distribution, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the
Exchange Ratio to give holders of capital stock of Company the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

 



 

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later
than ten (10) days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail
to each holder of record of one or more Old Certificates representing shares
of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock (as applicable)
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any such holder who
properly delivered its Old Certificates with its Form of Election) that have
been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration or Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, as applicable, pursuant
this Article II, a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Old Certificates shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Old Certificates to the Exchange Agent)
and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Old Certificates in
exchange for certificates representing the number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock, the number of whole shares of preferred stock of Parent (as
applicable), in the case of Company Common Stock only, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares and the Cash Consideration which the shares of Company
Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock (as applicable) represented by such
Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall have been converted into the right
to receive pursuant to this Agreement as well as any dividends or
distributions to be paid pursuant to Section 2.8(c). From and after the
Effective Time, upon proper surrender of an Old Certificate or Old
Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder
of such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a New Certificate representing that
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock or preferred stock of Parent (as
applicable) to which such holder of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred
Stock (as applicable) shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of
this Article II. (ii) in the case of surrender of an Old Certificate or Old
Certificates representing Company Common Stock, a check representing the
amount of (A) the Cash Consideration which such holder has the right to
receive in respect of the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II and (B) any cash in lieu of
fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the
Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of
this Article II, and (iii) any dividends or distributions which the holder
thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.8(c), and the Old
Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
No interest will be paid or accrued on the Cash Consideration or any cash in
lieu of fractional shares payable to holders of Old Certificates. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.8, each Old Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive, upon surrender, the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares, or the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, as applicable,
or in respect of dividends or distributions as contemplated by Section 2.8(c).

 



 

(c) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Parent Common
Stock or preferred stock of Parent issued as a result of the Merger shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate until the holder
thereof shall surrender such Old Certificate in accordance with this Article
II. After the surrender of an Old Certificate in accordance with this Article
II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such

 



      
 

 



 

dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time,
without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with
respect to the whole shares of Parent Common Stock or preferred stock of
Parent which the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock (as
applicable) represented by such Old Certificate have been converted into the
right to receive.

 



 

(d) If any New Certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock or
preferred stock of Parent is to be issued in a name other than that in which
the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or
are registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Old
Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or
accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper
form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to
the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by
reason of the issuance of a New Certificate representing shares of Parent
Common Stock or preferred stock of Parent in any name other than that of the
registered holder of the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered, or
required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



 

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Company of the shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Old Certificates representing
such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of
fractional shares or the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, as applicable,
and dividends or distributions that the holder presenting such Old
Certificates is entitled to, as provided in this Article II.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no New
Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Old Certificates, no
dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock or preferred
stock of Parent shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share,
and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to
vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the
issuance of any such fractional share, Parent shall pay to each former
shareholder of Company who otherwise would be entitled to receive such
fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by
multiplying (i) the average of the closing-sale prices of Parent Common Stock
on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (" _NASDAQ_ ") as reported by _The Wall
Street Journal_ for the five (5) full trading days ending on the day preceding
the Closing Date (the " _Parent Share Closing Price_ ") by (ii) the fraction
of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form)
of Parent Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 2.6.

 



 

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of Company for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former shareholders of Company who have
not theretofore exchanged their Old Certificates pursuant to this Article II
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the
Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of any fractional shares or the
Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, as applicable, and any unpaid dividends
and distributions

 



      
 

 



 

on the Parent Common Stock or preferred stock of Parent deliverable in respect
of each former share of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock such
shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case,
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent,
Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person
shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 



 

(h) Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange
Agent to deduct and withhold, from the Cash Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, cash dividends or distributions
payable pursuant to this Section 2.8 or any other cash amounts otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange
Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Entity, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect
of which the deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange
Agent, as the case may be.

 



 

(i) In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may
determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Old Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate the
Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares or Preferred
Stock Merger Consideration, as applicable, deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

ARTICLE III

 



 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY

 



 

Except as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by Company to Parent
concurrently herewith (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ "); _provided_ ,
that (a) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception to a
representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (b) the mere
inclusion of an item in Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by Company that
such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or
that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect and
(c) any disclosures made with respect to a section of this Article III shall
be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of this Article III specifically
referenced or cross-referenced and (2) other sections of this Article III to
the extent it is reasonably apparent (notwithstanding the absence of a
specific cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such
disclosure applies to such other sections, Company hereby represents and
warrants to Parent as follows:

 



      
 

 



 

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 



 

(a) Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Illinois and is a bank holding company
duly registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (" _BHC
Act_ "). Company has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company. As used
in this Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect
to Parent, Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, any
effect, change, event, circumstance, occurrence, condition or development that
has a material adverse effect on (i) the condition (financial or otherwise),
results of operations, business, properties, assets or liabilities of such
party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii) the ability of such party
to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, with respect to clause (i), Material Adverse Effect shall
not be deemed to include the impact of (A) changes, after the date hereof, in
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") or applicable
regulatory accounting requirements, (B) changes, after the date hereof, in
laws, rules or regulations of general applicability to companies in the
industries in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate, or
interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental Entities, (C) changes, after
the date hereof, in global, national or regional political conditions
(including the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism) or in economic or market
conditions affecting the financial services industry generally and not
specifically relating to such party or its Subsidiaries, (D) a decline in the
trading price of Parent Common Stock or the failure, in and of itself, of a
party to meet earnings projections or internal financial forecasts but not, in
either case, including the underlying causes thereof; (E) changes in the
credit markets, any downgrades in the credit markets, or adverse credit events
resulting in deterioration in the credit markets generally, (F) with respect
to Company, the identity of, or any facts or circumstances relating to, Parent
or its affiliates, or (G) the execution of this Agreement or the public
disclosure of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except,
with respect to subclauses (A), (B), (C) or (E), to the extent that the
effects of such change are materially disproportionately adverse to the
business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or condition
(financial or otherwise) of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
as compared to other companies in the industry in which such party and its
Subsidiaries operate (in which case only the incremental materially
disproportionate effect may be taken into account in determining whether or
not there has been or may be a Material Adverse Effect)). As used in this
Agreement, the word " _Subsidiary_ " when used with respect to any party,
means any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, bank or other
organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which is consolidated
with such party for financial reporting purposes. True and complete copies of
the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of Company (the " _Company
Articles_ ") and the Amended and Restated By-Laws of Company (the " _Company
Bylaws_ "), as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously
been made available by Company to Parent, are in full force and effect and
Company is not in material violation of any of the provisions thereof.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Each Subsidiary of Company (a " _Company Subsidiary_ ") (i) is duly
organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is
recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of
property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in
which the failure to be so qualified would reasonably be expected, either
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company
and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted. The
deposit accounts of each Subsidiary of Company that is an insured depository
institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "
_FDIC_ ") through the Deposit Insurance Fund (as defined in Section 3(y) of
the Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950) to the fullest extent permitted by
law, all premiums and assessments required to be paid in connection therewith
have been paid when due, and no proceedings for the termination of such
insurance are pending or, to Companys knowledge, threatened. Section 3.1(b)
of Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list, as of the
date hereof, of all Subsidiaries of Company and any joint ventures,
partnerships or similar arrangements in which Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has a limited liability, partnership or other equity or profit
interest (and the amount and percentage of any such interest). True and
complete copies of the organizational documents of each Company Subsidiary, as
in effect on the date of this Agreement, have previously been made available
by Company to Parent, are in full force and effect. Company Bank is not in
material violation of any of the provisions of its organizational documents.

capital stock or other voting securities of Company are issued, reserved for

Preferred Stock issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock of Company have been duly authorized and validly
issued and are fully paid and nonassessable. There are no bonds, debentures,
notes or other indebtedness that have the right to vote on any matters on
which shareholders of Company may vote issued or outstanding. There are no
obligations of Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to which Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is or could be required pursuant to the terms thereof to
register any of its securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Securities Act_
"). Except as set forth in Section 3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
as of the date of this Agreement, no trust preferred or subordinated debt
securities of Company are issued or outstanding. Other than Company Restricted
Stock Awards and Company Stock Options (collectively " _Company Equity Awards_
") and the Company Preferred Stock, in each case, issued prior to the date of
this Agreement, there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants,
puts, calls, rights, exchangeable or convertible securities or other
commitments or agreements of any character

 



      
 

 



 

relating to the issued or unissued Company Common Stock or other securities of

purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such securities.

 



 

(b) There are no voting trusts, shareholder agreements, proxies or other
agreements in effect pursuant to which Company or any of Companys
Subsidiaries has a contractual obligation with respect to the voting or
transfer of the Company Common Stock or other equity interests of Company.
Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true, correct
and complete list of all Company Equity Awards outstanding as of the date
hereof specifying, on a holder-by-holder basis, (i) the name of each holder,
(ii) the number of shares subject to each such Company Equity Award, (iii) the
grant date of each such Company Equity Award, (iv) the Company Stock Plan
under which such Company Equity Award was granted, (v) the exercise price for
each such Company Equity Award that is a Company Stock Option, and (vi) the
expiration date of each such Company Equity Award that is a Company Stock
Option. Other than the Company Equity Awards outstanding as of the date hereof
and any Company Equity Awards granted after the date of this Agreement and on
or prior to the Closing Date in compliance with this Agreement, no equity-
based awards (including any cash awards where the amount of payment is
determined in whole or in part based on the price of any capital stock of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries) are outstanding. Neither Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries is deferring interest payments with respect to any
preferred trust securities or related debentures issued by it or any of its
affiliates.

 



 

(c) Except for the trust preferred securities issued by a Company issuer
Subsidiary, Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests of
each of Companys Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens, pledges, charges,
encumbrances and security interests whatsoever (" _Liens_ "), and all of such
shares or equity ownership interests are duly authorized and validly issued
and are fully paid, nonassessable (except, with respect to Company
Subsidiaries that are insured depository institutions, as provided under 12
U.S.C. § 55 or any comparable provision of applicable state law) and free of
preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership
thereof. No Company Subsidiary has or is bound by any outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of
any character calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares of capital
stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary or any securities
representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital
stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary.

liability of Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity,
any participant in a Company Benefit Plan, or any other party.

on Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any material liability or obligation
arising under any Environmental Law, pending or, to Companys knowledge,

relating to the origination, sale and servicing of mortgage and consumer
loans. Each of Parents Subsidiaries that is an insured depository institution
has received a Community Reinvestment Act rating of "satisfactory" or better
on its most recently completed exam.

 



 

(b) Without limitation, since January 1, 2013, none of Parent, or its
Subsidiaries, or any director, officer, employee, agent or other person acting
on behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has, directly or indirectly,
(i) used any funds of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for unlawful
contributions, unlawful gifts, unlawful entertainment or other expenses
relating to political activity; (ii) made any unlawful payment to foreign or
domestic governmental officials or employees or to foreign or domestic
political parties or campaigns from funds of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries; (iii) violated any provision that would result in the violation

private or public, regardless of form, whether in money, property or services,

accounts for which it acts as a fiduciary, including accounts for which it
serves as a trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative, guardian,

governing documents and applicable law. None of Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries, or any director, officer or employee of Parent or of any of its
Subsidiaries, has committed any material breach of trust or fiduciary duty
with respect to any such fiduciary account. The accountings for each such
fiduciary account are true and correct and accurately reflect the assets of
such fiduciary account in all material respects. Since January 1, 2013, none

properly administer any accounts for which it acts as a fiduciary.

 



 

4.11 _Certain Contracts_.

 



 

(a) Each contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding (whether written
or oral) which is a "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item

Subsidiaries is a party or by which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is bound
as of the date hereof has been filed as an exhibit to the most recent Annual
Report on Form 10-K filed by Parent, or a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or
Current Report on Form 8-K subsequent thereto (each, a " _Parent Contract_ "),
and neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of, or has received
notice of, any violation of any Parent Contract by any of the other parties
thereto which would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

 



 

(b) In each case, except as would not reasonably be expected individually or
in the aggregate to be material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, (i) each Parent Contract is valid and binding on Parent or one of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, and in full force and effect, (ii) Parent and
each of its Subsidiaries has performed all obligations required to be
performed by it prior to the date hereof under each Parent Contract, (iii) to
Parents knowledge each third-party counterparty to each Parent Contract has
performed all obligations required to be performed by it to date under such
Parent Contract; and (iv) no event or condition exists which constitutes or,
after notice or lapse of time or both, will constitute, a default on the part
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under any such Parent Contract.

suggestion of any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that
currently restricts in any material respect the conduct of its business or

pay dividends, its credit or risk management policies, its management or its
business (each, whether

 



      
 

 



 

or not set forth in the Parent Disclosure Schedule, a " _Parent Regulatory
Agreement_ "), nor has Parent or any of its Subsidiaries been advised since
January 1, 2013 by any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that it
is considering issuing, initiating, ordering or requesting any such Parent
Regulatory Agreement.

 



 

4.13 _Related Party Transactions_. There are no transactions or series of
related transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings, nor are
there any currently proposed transactions or series of related transactions,
between Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any current or
former director or "executive officer" (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the
Exchange Act) of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any person who
beneficially owns (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 of the Exchange Act) 5%
or more of the outstanding Parent Common Stock (or any of such persons
immediate family members or affiliates) (other than Subsidiaries of Parent) on
the other hand, except loans, deposits and other ordinary course banking
relationships and those of a type that would be required to be reported
pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

4.14 _Reorganization_. Parent has not taken any action and is not aware of any
fact or circumstance that could reasonably be likely to prevent the Merger
from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code.

 



 

4.15 _Parent Information_. The information relating to Parent and its
Subsidiaries that is provided by Parent or its representatives for inclusion
in (a) the Proxy Statement, on the date it (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) is first mailed to holders of Company Common Stock or at the time of
the Company Meeting, (b) in the S-4, when it or any amendment thereto becomes

of Parent incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any
amendment or supplement thereto or (d) any other document filed with any other
Regulatory Agency in connection herewith, will not contain any untrue

make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are
made, not misleading. The portions of the Proxy Statement relating to Parent
and its Subsidiaries and other portions within the reasonable control of
Parent and its Subsidiaries will comply in all material respects with the
provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or warranty is made by Parent
with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information provided or supplied by or on behalf of Company or its
Subsidiaries for inclusion in the Proxy Statement or the S-4.

Article IV, neither Parent nor any other person makes any express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to Parent, its Subsidiaries, or their
respective businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, conditions (financial
or otherwise) or prospects, and Parent hereby disclaims any such other
representations or warranties.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Parent acknowledges and agrees that neither Company nor any other person
has made or is making any express or implied representation or warranty other
than those contained in Article III.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 



 

6.1 _Regulatory Matters_.

 



 

(a) The parties agree to jointly prepare as promptly as reasonably practical
after the date hereof the Proxy Statement and S-4. The parties agree to
cooperate in the preparation of the S-4 and Proxy Statement. Parent and
Company each agree to use all reasonable best efforts to cause the S-4 to be
filed with the SEC no later than forty-five (45) calendar days after the date
of this Agreement. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the
S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable
after such filing, and Company shall thereafter promptly mail or deliver the
Proxy Statement to its shareholders. Parent shall also use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and
approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and Company shall furnish all information concerning

 



      
 

 



 

Company and the holders of Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested
in connection with any such action.

 



 

(b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their
reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to
obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities which are
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Merger and Bank Merger), and to comply with the terms
and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of
all such third parties and Governmental Entities. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, as soon as practicable and in no event later than
fifty (50) calendar days after the date of this Agreement, Parent and Company
shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, each prepare and file
any applications, notices and filings required in order to obtain the
Requisite Regulatory Approvals. Parent and Company shall each use, and shall
each cause their applicable Subsidiaries to use, reasonable best efforts to
obtain each such Requisite Regulatory Approval as promptly as reasonably
practicable. The parties shall cooperate with each other in connection
therewith (including the furnishing of any information and any reasonable
undertaking or commitments that may be required to obtain the Requisite
Regulatory Approvals). Parent and Company shall have the right to review in
advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in
each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information,
all the information relating to Company or Parent, as the case may be, and any
of their respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising
the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as
promptly as practicable. Each party will provide the other with copies of any
applications (other than confidential portions thereof) and all non-
confidential correspondence relating thereto prior to filing. The parties
hereto agree that they will consult with each other with respect to the
obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated herein. Each party shall consult with the other in advance of any
meeting or conference with any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Entity, give the other party and/or its counsel the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 6.1 shall
be deemed to require Parent or its Subsidiaries to (and without the prior
written consent of the other party, neither party and its Subsidiaries shall)
take any action, or agree to any conditions or restrictions, in connection
with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals and authorizations
of Governmental Entities that would reasonably be expected to, individually or
in the aggregate, materially impair or materially adversely affect the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or their
operations, business or condition (financial or otherwise), after giving
effect to the Merger (measured on a scale relative to Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) (" _Materially Burdensome Condition_ ").

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Parent and Company shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent,
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each of Parent and Company agrees, as to itself and its
Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the S-4 will, at the time
the S-4 and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any, becomes effective
under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading and (ii) the Proxy Statement and
any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing to
shareholders and at the time of the Company Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which such statement was made, not misleading. Each of
Parent and Company further agrees that if it becomes aware that any
information furnished by it would cause any of the statements in the S-4 or
the Proxy Statement to be false or misleading with respect to any material
fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform the other party thereof
and to take appropriate steps to correct the S-4 or the Proxy Statement.

 



 

(e) Parent and Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that
any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of
any such approval will be materially delayed.

 



 

6.2 _Access to Information_.

 



 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws, each of Parent and
Company, for the purposes of verifying the representations and warranties of
the other and preparing for the Merger and the other matters contemplated by
this Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries
to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and
other representatives of the other party, access, during normal business hours
during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books,
contracts, personnel, information technology systems, and records, and each
shall cooperate with the other party in preparing to execute after the
Effective Time conversion or consolidation of systems and business operations
generally (including by entering into customary confidentiality, non-
disclosure and similar agreements with such service providers and/or the other
party), and, during such period, each of Parent and Company shall, and shall
cause its respective Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party such
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such party
may reasonably request. Each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to minimize any interference with the other partys regular business
operations during any such access. Neither Parent nor Company nor any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the
rights of Parents or Companys, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such

 



      
 

 



 

information (after giving due consideration to the existence of any common
interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the parties) or
contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty
or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The
parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 



 

(b) Each of Parent and Company shall hold all information furnished by or on
behalf of the other party or any of such partys Subsidiaries or
representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality
agreement, dated October 9, 2015, between Parent and Company (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 



 

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

 



 

6.3 _Company Shareholder Approval_. Company shall take, in accordance with
applicable law and the Company Articles and Company Bylaws, all action
necessary to convene a meeting of its shareholders (the " _Company Meeting_ ")
to be held as soon as reasonably practicable after the S-4 is declared
effective (but not later than 45 days after the S-4 is declared effective) for
the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, and, if so desired and
mutually agreed, upon other matters of the type customarily brought before an
annual or special meeting of shareholders to adopt a merger agreement. The
Board of Directors of Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
from the shareholders of Company the Requisite Company Vote, including
maintaining the Company Recommendation in all communications with shareholders
of the Company. However, if Company, after receiving the advice of its outside
counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors,
determines in good faith that there would be a substantial likelihood that
continuing to recommend this Agreement would result in a violation of its
fiduciary duties under applicable law, then in submitting this Agreement to
its shareholders, the Board of Directors of Company may withhold or withdraw
or modify in a manner adverse to Parent its recommendation that Companys
shareholders approve this Agreement or submit this Agreement to its
shareholders without recommendation (although the resolutions approving this
Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended) (any such
withholding, withdrawal or modification, an " _Adverse Change in Company
Recommendation_ "), in which event the Board of Directors of Company may
communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to its shareholders,
including in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement
thereto; _provided_ , that the Board of Directors of Company may not take any
actions under this sentence unless it gives Parent at least five (5) business
days prior written notice of its intention to take such action and a
reasonable description of the event or circumstances giving rise to its
determination to take such action and takes into account any amendment or
modification to this Agreement proposed by Parent during such five (5)
business day period. Company agrees that fluctuations or changes in the
trading price of Parent Common Stock shall not be taken into account or form
the basis, in whole or in part, for the determination of an Adverse Change in
Company Recommendation. Nothing in this Agreement shall be

 



       
 

 



 

interpreted to excuse Company or its Board of Directors from complying with
its obligation to submit this Agreement to its shareholders at the Company
Meeting and neither Company nor its Board of Directors shall submit to vote of
its shareholders any Acquisition Proposal, other than the Merger unless this
Agreement shall have first been terminated.

 



 

6.4 _No Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") not to (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or
knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to, (ii) engage or
participate in any negotiations with any person concerning or (iii) provide
any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have or participate
in any discussions with, any person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal;
provided, that, prior to receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, in the event
Company receives an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, it
may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries
Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information or
data and participate in such negotiations or discussions if that its Board of
Directors concludes in good faith that (x) such Acquisition Proposal could
result in a Superior Proposal or (y) there would be a reasonable likelihood
that failure to take such actions would result in a violation of its fiduciary
duties under applicable law; provided, further, that, prior to providing any
nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing
proviso, Company shall have provided such information to Parent, and shall
have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms
no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

(b) As used in this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean, other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any offer or proposal
relating to, or any third party indication of interest in, (i) any acquisition
or purchase, direct or indirect, of 25% or more of the consolidated assets of
Company and its Subsidiaries or 25% or more of any class of equity or voting
securities of Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the consolidated assets of Company,
(ii) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in
such third party beneficially owning more than 25% of any class of equity or
voting securities of Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or
in the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the consolidated assets of
Company, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange or other business
combination involving Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually
or in the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the consolidated assets of
Company, except, in each case, any sale of whole loans and securitizations in
the ordinary course of business and any bona fide internal reorganization.

 



 

(c) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any
Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of Company concludes in good
faith to be more favorable to its shareholders than the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, (i) after receiving the advice of its
financial advisors, (ii) after taking into account the likelihood of
consummation of such transaction on the terms set forth therein and (iii)
after taking into account all legal (with the advice of outside counsel),
financial (including the financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory and
other aspects of such proposal and any other relevant factors permitted under
applicable Law; provided that for purposes of the definition of "Superior

 



      
 

 



 

Proposal," the references to "25%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
shall be deemed to be references to "50%."

 



 

(d) Company will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities,
discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with
any persons other than Parent with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.
Company will promptly, following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal,
advise Parent of the material terms thereof (including the identity of the
person making such Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Parent reasonably
apprised of any related developments, discussions and negotiations and the
status and terms thereof on a current basis. Without limiting the foregoing,
Company shall promptly notify Parent after it enters into discussions or
negotiations with another person regarding an Acquisition Proposal, executes
and delivers a confidentiality agreement with another person in connection
with an Acquisition Proposal, or provides nonpublic information or data to
another person in connection with an Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

6.5 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject in all respects to Section 6.1 of
this Agreement, each of Parent and Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all
legal requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with
respect to the Merger and Bank Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth
in Article VII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain)
any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption
by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is required to be
obtained by Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

6.6 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall cause the shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NASDAQ,
subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

6.7 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiary to, provide each
employee of Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time while
employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries) (collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ ") with (i)
during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary thereof, (A) a base salary or base wage rate, as applicable, that
is no less favorable than the base salary or base wage rate, as applicable,
provided by Company or any such Subsidiary to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) any Company-provided car or
car expense allowance on the same terms and conditions as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) during the period commencing
at the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2016, (A) an annual or
quarterly bonus opportunity, as applicable, which is no less favorable than
that provided by Company or any such Subsidiary to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time (it being understood that Parent
shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiary to maintain, without
amendment, the annual and quarterly bonus plans and programs in effect with
respect to the

 



      
 

 



 

Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time through December
31, 2016 and that all determinations of the achievement of performance goals
under such plans and programs in respect of calendar year 2016 and any
calendar quarter in 2016 that ends after the Effective Time will be determined
in accordance with the terms of such plans and programs) and (B) all other
compensation and employee benefits to such Continuing Employee (but without
duplication) that are no less favorable than those provided by Parent and its
Subsidiaries to their similarly situated employees (it being understood that a
Continuing Employees continued participation in compensation and benefit
plans of the Company or applicable Subsidiary shall be deemed to satisfy this
clause (B)). During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on
the first anniversary thereof, Parent or its Subsidiaries shall provide
severance payments and benefits to each Continuing Employee whose employment
is terminated other than for Cause (as defined in Section 6.7(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule) or due to a Constructive Termination (as defined
in Section 6.7(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule) that are no less
favorable than the severance payments and benefits set forth in Section 6.7(a)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule without amendment following the Effective
Time (the " _Company Severance Policy_ "), based on such Continuing Employees
title with Company immediately prior to the Effective Time. The foregoing
severance provisions shall not apply to any Continuing Employee who has
received or is entitled to receive contractual severance payments or benefits
pursuant to a written agreement between such Continuing Employee and the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries
in which any Continuing Employees become eligible to participate on or after
the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), Parent shall or shall cause its
applicable Subsidiary to: (i) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions
and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to such employees and their eligible dependents under any New
Plans, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or
waiting periods would apply under the analogous Company Benefit Plan, (ii)
provide each such employee and their eligible dependents with credit for any
co-payments or coinsurance, deductibles or expenses incurred by such employee
or dependent prior to the Effective Time under a Company Benefit Plan (to the
same extent that such credit was given under the analogous Company Benefit
Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible, co-
payment, coinsurance or maximum out-of-pocket requirements under any New
Plans, and (iii) recognize all service of such employees with Company and its
Subsidiaries for all purposes in any New Plan to the same extent that such
service was taken into account under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior
to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the foregoing service recognition shall
not apply (A) to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits for the
same period of services, (B) for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined
benefit pension plan, or (C) to any benefit plan that is a frozen plan or
provides grandfathered benefits.

 



 

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiary to, assume and
honor all Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms (including with
respect to amendment and termination). Parent hereby acknowledges that a
"change in control" (or similar phrase) within the meaning of the Company
Benefit Plans will occur at the Effective Time. Parent shall take all
necessary actions to effectuate the provisions of Section 6.7(a) and Section
6.7(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director or consultant of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates any
right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving Corporation,
Company, or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall interfere with or
restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Corporation, Company, Parent
or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services
of any employee, officer, director or consultant of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or
without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish,
amend, or modify any Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or
employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the
ability of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates
to amend, modify or terminate any particular Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or
any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after
the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the final sentence of
Section 9.11, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any person, including any current or former employee,
officer, director or consultant of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement.

 



 

6.8 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 



 

(a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Company
Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any actions, suits, claims or proceedings, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining
to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including
matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent that Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
would have been permitted under their respective organizational documents in
effect on the date of this Agreement, subject to limitations imposed by
applicable law and Regulatory Agencies, to indemnify such Company Indemnified
Party (including the advancing of expenses as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law); _provided_ , the Company Indemnified Party to
whom such expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to the Surviving
Corporation to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Company Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification.

 



 

(b) Company shall purchase prior to the Closing, and following the Closing
Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect until the expiration thereof, a
six (6) year prepaid directors and officers liability insurance "tail
policy" that provides directors and officers liability insurance covering
those individuals who are currently covered by the Companys directors and
officers liability insurance policies (true, correct and complete copies of
which have been heretofore delivered to Parent) with coverage no less
favorable, as a whole, than the terms of such current insurance coverage with
respect to claims arising from or related to facts or events which occurred at
or prior to the Effective Time.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.8 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If the
Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns, consolidates with
or merges into any other entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity
of such consolidation or merger, transfers all or substantially all of its
assets or deposits to any other entity or engages in any similar transaction,
then in each case, the Surviving Corporation will cause proper provision to be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation will
expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.8. For the
avoidance of doubt, to the extent required by any agreement previously entered
into by Company in connection with a merger, acquisition or other business
combination, the provisions of this Section 6.8 shall apply to directors,
officers, employees and fiduciaries of predecessor entities previously
acquired by Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) The obligations of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Company under
this Section 6.8 shall not be terminated or modified in a manner so as to
adversely affect any Company Indemnified Party or any other person entitled to
the benefit of this Section 6.8 without the prior written consent of the
affected Company Indemnified Party.

 



 

6.9 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Bank with full
title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises
of any of the parties to the Merger or Bank Merger, as applicable, the proper
officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their respective
Subsidiaries shall take, or cause to be taken, all such necessary action as
may be reasonably requested by the other party, at the expense of the party
who makes any such request.

 



 

6.10 _Notice of Changes_

 



 

(a) Parent and Company shall each promptly advise the other party of any fact,
change, event or circumstance that has had or is reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on it or which it believes would or would be
reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained herein; provided that any
failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any
breach shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 6.10 or
the failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied,
or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to
give such notice, in each case unless the underlying breach would
independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2
or 7.3 to be satisfied.

 



 

(b) Parent and Company shall each promptly advise the other party of (i) any
notice or other communication from any person alleging that the consent of
such person is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) upon receiving any communication from
any Governmental Entity or third party whose consent or approval is required
for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that
causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any
such consent or approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such
consent or approval will be materially delayed. Company shall promptly notify
Parent of any notice or other communication

 



      
 

 



 

from any party to any Company Contract to the effect that such party has
terminated or intends to terminate or otherwise materially adversely modify
its relationship with Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

6.11 _Corporate Governance_. Parent shall take all appropriate action so that,
as of the Effective Time, the number of directors constituting the Board of
Directors of Parent shall be increased by one and Robert L. Riter shall be
appointed as a director of Parent.

 



 

6.12 _Public Announcements_. Except in respect of any announcement required by
(i) applicable law or regulation, (ii) a request by a Governmental Entity or
(iii) an obligation pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any
securities exchange, Company and Parent agree to consult with each other and
to obtain the advance approval of the other party (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before issuing any press
release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public statement
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

6.13 _Takeover Statutes_. Neither Parent nor Company shall take any action
that would cause any Takeover Statute to become applicable to this Agreement,
the Merger, or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, and each of
Parent and Company shall take all necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the
continued exemption of) the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute now or hereafter in effect. If any
Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the
transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent and Company will grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize
the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the validity or
applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

 



 

6.14 _Assumption of Company Debt_. Parent agrees to execute and deliver, or
cause to be executed and delivered, by or on behalf of the Surviving Company,
at or prior to the Effective Time, one or more supplemental indentures,
guarantees, and other instruments required for the due assumption of Companys
outstanding debt, guarantees, securities, and other agreements to the extent
required by the terms of such debt, guarantees, securities, and other
agreements.

 



 

6.15 _No Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the operations of Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Company, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of Parent or its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of
Parent and Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its
Subsidiaries respective operations.

 



 

6.16 _Transaction Litigation_. Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate, at Parents expense, in Companys defense or settlement of any
shareholder litigation

 



      
 

 



 

against Company and/or its directors or executive officers relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger.

of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final nonappealable order,
injunction or decree permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making
illegal the consummation of the Merger or Bank Merger, unless the failure to

and agreements of such party set forth herein;

 



 

(c) by either Parent or Company if the Merger shall not have been consummated
on or before the one (1) year anniversary of the date of this Agreement (the "

not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of the
covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties (or any
such representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in this
Agreement on the part of Company, in the case of a termination by Parent, or
Parent, in the case of a termination by Company, which breach or failure to be
true, either individually or in the aggregate with all other breaches by such
party (or failures of such representations or warranties to be true), would
constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a
condition set forth in Section 7.2 or Section 7.2(d), as the case may be, and
which is not cured within the earlier of the Termination Date and 45 days
following written notice to Company, in the case of a termination by Parent,
or Parent, in the case of a termination by Company, or by its nature or timing
cannot be cured during such period;

 



 

(e) by Parent, prior to such time as the Requisite Company Vote is obtained,
in the event of an Adverse Change in Company Recommendation or if Company
shall have materially breached its obligations under Section 6.3 or 6.4; or

 



 

(f) by either Parent or Company if the Requisite Company Vote shall not have
been obtained at the Company Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement
thereof at which a vote on the adoption of this Agreement was taken.

 



 

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (b), (c),
(d), (e) or (f) of this Section 8.1 shall give written notice of such
termination to the other party in accordance with

 



       
 

 



 

Section 9.5, specifying the provision or provisions hereof pursuant to which
such termination is effected.

 



 

8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or Company
as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
have no effect, and none of Parent, Company, any of their respective
Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them shall have any
liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) Sections 3.3(a), 3.7,
4.3(a), 4.7, 6.2(b), this Section 8.2 and Article IX shall survive any
termination of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, neither Parent nor Company shall be
relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its fraud
or willful and material breach of any provision of this Agreement occurring
prior to termination (in which case the aggrieved party shall be entitled to
all rights and remedies available at law or in equity).

 



 

(b) (i) In the event that (A) after the date of this Agreement a _bona fide_
Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to senior management of
Company or shall have been made directly to its shareholders generally or any
person shall have publicly announced (and not withdrawn) an Acquisition
Proposal with respect to Company and (B) thereafter this Agreement is
terminated (1) by either Parent or Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c) without
the Requisite Company Vote having been obtained or (2) by either Parent or
Company pursuant to Section 8.1(f), and (C) prior to the date that is twelve
(12) months after the date of such termination, Company enters into a
definitive agreement or consummates a transaction with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that
referred to above), then Company shall, on the earlier of the date it enters
into such definitive agreement and the date of consummation of such
transaction, pay Parent, by wire transfer of same day funds, a fee equal to
$16,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "); _provided_ , that for purposes of
this Section 8.2(b), all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
to "25%" shall instead refer to "50%".

 



 

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.1(e), then Company shall pay Parent, by wire transfer of same day
funds, the Termination Fee as promptly as reasonably practical after the date
of termination (and, in any event, within three (3) business days thereafter).

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the
right of any party to recover liabilities or damages, the maximum aggregate
amount of fees payable by Company under Section 8.2(b) shall be equal to the
Termination Fee.

 



 

(d) Each of Parent and Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in
Section 8.2(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if Company fails to timely pay the amount
due pursuant to Section 8.2(b), then (i) Company shall reimburse Parent for
all costs and expenses (including disbursements and reasonable attorneys
fees) incurred in the collection of said overdue amount and (ii) Company shall
pay Parent

 



      
 

 



 

interest on such overdue amount to but excluding the date of actual payment at
the prime rate set forth in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date the
payment was required to be made. The amounts payable by Company pursuant to
Section 8.2(b) constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and shall be
the sole monetary remedy of Parent in the event of a termination of this
Agreement specified in such section.

written consent of the other party. Any purported assignment in contravention
hereof shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties and their respective successors and assigns. Except as otherwise
specifically provided in Section 6.8, which is intended to benefit each
Company Indemnified Party and his or her heir and representatives, this

warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties
hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties. Any inaccuracies in such

accordance herewith without notice or liability to any other person. In some
instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent

matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.

representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date

 



      
 

 



 

of this Agreement or as of any other date. Except as provided in Section 6.8,
notwithstanding any other provision hereof to the contrary, no consent,
approval or agreement of any third party beneficiary will be required to

or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof
(including the parties obligation to consummate the Merger), in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any action for specific
performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement
under any law to post security or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief.

 



 

9.13 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction such
that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion thereof shall
be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

 



 

9.14 _Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission_. This Agreement and
any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this
Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent
signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of
a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an
original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument
shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment
hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation of a
contract and each party hereto forever waives any such defense.

Re: Transaction between MB Financial, Inc. and American Chartered Bancorp,
Inc.

 



 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 



 

As a holder of Company Common Stock, the undersigned, on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates (collectively, the " _Stockholder_ ") understands that MB
Financial, Inc. (" _Parent_ ") and American Chartered Bancorp, Inc. ("
_Company_ ") have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
November 20, 2015 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), pursuant to which, among other
things, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, (a) Company
will merge with and into Parent (the " _Merger_ "); and (b) the stockholders
of Company upon the effectiveness of the Merger will become entitled to
receive the consideration specified in the Merger Agreement. Terms used
without definition in this letter agreement shall have the meanings ascribed
thereto in the Merger Agreement.

 



 

The Stockholder acknowledges that, as an inducement for Parent and Company to
enter into the Merger Agreement, Parent and Company have required that the
Stockholder enter into this letter agreement with Parent and Company and the
Stockholder is willing to enter into this letter agreement.

 



 

The Stockholder confirms his or her agreement with Parent and Company, and
Parent and Company confirms their agreement with the Stockholder, as follows:

 



 

1. As used in this letter agreement, "Shares" means the shares of the Company Common Stock which the Stockholder owns of record or beneficially (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any shares underlying options exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock) as of the date of this letter agreement.

 



 

2. At every meeting of the stockholders of the Company called, and at every postponement, recess or adjournment thereof, and on every action or approval by written consent

 



 

Annex A-1-1     
 

 



 

of the stockholders of the Company, the Stockholder agrees to vote, or cause
to be voted (to the extent such shares are entitled to vote), the Shares (a)
in favor of (i) adoption of the Merger Agreement and (ii) any other matter
that is required to be approved by the stockholders of the Company to
facilitate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (b) against
(i) any proposal made in opposition to adoption of the Merger Agreement or in
competition with the Merger, (ii) any Acquisition Proposal and (iii) to the
extent that any of the following actions requires a stockholder vote pursuant
to applicable Law or any applicable stock exchange rules, any proposal,
transaction, agreement, amendment of the Companys certificate of
incorporation or by-laws or other action that is intended to or could
reasonably be expected to prevent, impede, interfere with, delay, postpone or
discourage consummation of the Merger and (c) as directed by Parent with
respect to any postponement, recess, adjournment or other procedural matter at
any meeting of the stockholders of the Company relating to any of the matters
set forth in the foregoing clauses (a) or (b). Any such vote shall be cast (or
consent shall be given) by the Stockholder in accordance with such procedures
relating thereto so as to ensure that it is duly counted, including for
purposes of determining that a quorum is present and for purposes of recording
the results of such vote (or consent). The Stockholder hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, and agrees not to exercise, any rights of appraisal,
any dissenters rights and any similar rights relating to the Merger that the
Stockholder may directly or indirectly have by virtue of the ownership of any
Shares if the Effective Time occurs.

 



 

3. The Stockholder hereby revokes any and all previous proxies granted with respect to the Shares. By entering into this letter agreement, subject to the last sentence of this paragraph 3, the Stockholder hereby grants, or agrees to cause the applicable record holder to grant, a revocable proxy appointing Company, Robert Riter, Dan Miller and Greg Lansdowne, and each of them, but each with full power of substitution, as the Stockholders attorney-in-fact and proxy, for and in the Stockholders name, to be counted as present, vote, express consent or dissent with respect to the Shares in the manner contemplated by paragraph 2 as such proxies or their proxies or substitutes shall, in their sole discretion, deem proper with respect to the Shares. The proxy granted by the Stockholder pursuant to this paragraph 3 is granted in consideration of Company entering into this letter agreement and the Merger Agreement and incurring the obligations therein. If the Stockholder fails for any reason to be counted as present, consent or vote the Shares in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 2 (or anticipatorily breaches such paragraph), then Company shall have the right to cause to be present, consent or vote the Shares in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2. The proxy granted by the Stockholder shall be automatically revoked upon termination of this letter agreement in accordance with its terms.

 



 

4. The Stockholder agrees not to (i) offer for sale, sell, transfer, tender, pledge, encumber, assign or otherwise dispose of (" _Transfer_ "), or enter into any contract, option or other arrangement or understanding with respect to, or consent to the offer for sale, sale, transfer, tender, pledge, encumbrance, assignment or other disposition of any of the Shares (provided that the Stockholder may Transfer any or all of its Shares to a member of his immediate family or for estate planning or philanthropic purposes so long as the transferee, on or prior to the date of Transfer, agrees in writing to be bound by and comply with the provisions of this Agreement) or (ii) except as set forth herein, enter into any voting arrangement, whether by proxy, voting agreement, voting trust or otherwise, with respect to any of the Shares, and shall not commit or agree to take any of the foregoing actions.

 



 

Annex A-1-2     
 

 



 

5. The Stockholder represents and warrants (a) that the Stockholder has duly executed and delivered this letter agreement and has all authority and full legal capacity to enter into this letter agreement; (b) that, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this letter agreement by the Company, this letter agreement is the Stockholders legal, valid and binding agreement and is enforceable against the Stockholder in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by the Enforceability Exceptions; (c) that the Shares are owned by the Stockholder free and clear of all encumbrances, voting arrangements and commitments of every kind, except as would not restrict the performance of the Stockholders obligations under this Agreement and (d) that the Stockholder has the sole or shared power to vote or direct the vote of all Shares (to the extent such shares are entitled to vote).

 



 

6. This letter agreement and all obligations of the parties hereunder shall automatically terminate upon the earlier of (a) the Effective Time and (b) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) this paragraph 6 and paragraphs 9, 10, 11 and 12 hereof shall survive any such termination and (ii) such termination shall not relieve any party of any liability or damages resulting from any willful and intentional breach of this letter agreement occurring prior to such termination.

 



 

7. The Stockholder is entering into this letter agreement solely in his or her capacity as a record or beneficial owner of the Shares and nothing herein is intended to or shall limit or affect any actions taken by the Stockholder, solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Company (or a Subsidiary of the Company).

 



 

8. The Stockholder agrees, without further consideration, to execute and deliver such additional documents and to take such further actions as necessary or reasonably requested by Parent or the Company to confirm and assure the rights and obligations set forth in this letter agreement.

 



 

9. THIS LETTER AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF. The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and the federal courts of the United States of America located in the State of Delaware solely in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this letter agreement and of the documents referred to in this letter agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such documents, that it, he or she is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this letter agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in such a Delaware State or federal court. The parties hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over the subject matter of such dispute.

 



 

Annex A-1-3      
 

 



 

10. The parties to this letter agreement acknowledge and agree that any controversy which may arise under this letter agreement and the other documents referred to in this letter agreement and in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues and, therefore, each such party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any legal action arising out of or relating to this letter agreement and the other documents referred to in this letter agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

 



 

11. The Stockholder recognizes and acknowledges that a breach of any covenants or agreements contained in this letter agreement will cause Company and Parent to sustain damages for which it would not have an adequate remedy at law for money damages, and therefore the Stockholder agrees that in the event of any such breach, Company and Parent shall be entitled to specific performance of such covenants and agreements and injunctive and other equitable relief in addition to any other remedy to which Company and Parent may be entitled, at law or in equity. It is accordingly agreed that Company and Parent shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this letter agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this letter agreement in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction.

 



 

12. In the event that any provision of this letter agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this letter agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this letter agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

Re: Transaction between MB Financial, Inc. and American Chartered Bancorp,
Inc.

 



 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 



 

As a holder of Company Common Stock and Series F Preferred Stock, the
undersigned on behalf of _[entity name]_ (collectively, the " _Stockholder_ ")
understands that MB Financial, Inc. (" _Parent_ ") and American Chartered
Bancorp, Inc. (" _Company_ ") have entered into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of November 20, 2015 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), pursuant
to which, among other things, and subject to the terms and conditions set
forth therein, (a) Company will merge with and into Parent (the " _Merger_ ");
and (b) the stockholders of Company upon the effectiveness of the Merger will
become entitled to receive the consideration specified in the Merger
Agreement. Terms used without definition in this letter agreement shall have
the meanings ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement.

 



 

The Stockholder acknowledges that, as an inducement for Parent and Company to
enter into the Merger Agreement, Parent and Company have required that the
Stockholder enter into this letter agreement with Parent and Company and the
Stockholder is willing to enter into this letter agreement.

 



 

The Stockholder confirms his or her agreement with Parent and Company, and
Parent and Company confirms their agreement with the Stockholder, as follows:

 



 

1. As used in this letter agreement, " _Shares_ " means the shares of the Company Common Stock and Series F Preferred Stock which the Stockholder owns of record or beneficially (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any shares underlying options exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock) as of the date of this letter agreement.

 



 

2. At every meeting of the stockholders of the Company called, and at every postponement, recess or adjournment thereof, and on every action or approval by written consent

 



 

Annex A-2-1     
 

 



 

of the stockholders of the Company, the Stockholder agrees to vote, or cause
to be voted (to the extent such shares are entitled to vote), the Shares (a)
in favor of (i) adoption of the Merger Agreement and (ii) any other matter
that is required to be approved by the stockholders of the Company to
facilitate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (b) against
(i) any proposal made in opposition to adoption of the Merger Agreement or in
competition with the Merger, (ii) any Acquisition Proposal and (iii) to the
extent that any of the following actions requires a stockholder vote pursuant
to applicable Law or any applicable stock exchange rules, any proposal,
transaction, agreement, amendment of the Companys certificate of
incorporation or by-laws or other action that is intended to or could
reasonably be expected to prevent, impede, interfere with, delay, postpone or
discourage consummation of the Merger and (c) as directed by Parent with
respect to any postponement, recess, adjournment or other procedural matter at
any meeting of the stockholders of the Company relating to any of the matters
set forth in the foregoing clauses (a) or (b). Any such vote shall be cast (or
consent shall be given) by the Stockholder in accordance with such procedures
relating thereto so as to ensure that it is duly counted, including for
purposes of determining that a quorum is present and for purposes of recording
the results of such vote (or consent). The Stockholder hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, and agrees not to exercise, any rights of appraisal,
any dissenters rights and any similar rights relating to the Merger that the
Stockholder may directly or indirectly have by virtue of the ownership of any
Shares if the Effective Time occurs.

 



 

3. The Stockholder hereby revokes any and all previous proxies granted with respect to the Shares. By entering into this letter agreement, subject to the last sentence of this paragraph 3, the Stockholder hereby grants, or agrees to cause the applicable record holder to grant, a revocable proxy appointing Company, Robert Riter, Dan Miller and Greg Lansdowne, and each of them, but each with full power of substitution, as the Stockholders attorney-in-fact and proxy, for and in the Stockholders name, to be counted as present, vote, express consent or dissent with respect to the Shares in the manner contemplated by paragraph 2 as such proxies or their proxies or substitutes shall, in their sole discretion, deem proper with respect to the Shares. The proxy granted by the Stockholder pursuant to this paragraph 3 is granted in consideration of Company entering into this letter agreement and the Merger Agreement and incurring the obligations therein. If the Stockholder fails for any reason to be counted as present, consent or vote the Shares in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 2 (or anticipatorily breaches such paragraph), then Company shall have the right to cause to be present, consent or vote the Shares in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2. The proxy granted by the Stockholder shall be automatically revoked upon termination of this letter agreement in accordance with its terms.

 



 

4. The Stockholder agrees not to (i) offer for sale, sell, transfer, tender, pledge, encumber, assign or otherwise dispose of (" _Transfer_ "), or enter into any contract, option or other arrangement or understanding with respect to, or consent to the offer for sale, sale, transfer, tender, pledge, encumbrance, assignment or other disposition of any of the Shares (provided that the Stockholder may Transfer any or all of its Shares to a member of his immediate family or for estate planning or philanthropic purposes so long as the transferee, on or prior to the date of Transfer, agrees in writing to be bound by and comply with the provisions of this Agreement) or (ii) except as set forth herein, enter into any voting arrangement, whether by proxy, voting agreement, voting trust or otherwise, with respect to any of the Shares, and shall not commit or agree to take any of the foregoing actions.

 



 

Annex A-2-2     
 

 



 

5. The Stockholder hereby irrevocably elects and agrees (i) that each share of Series F Preferred Stock held by the Stockholder shall be entitled to receive the same consideration, on a per-share-basis, as the Merger Consideration payable to holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement and (ii) that the Stockholder shall not receive, and hereby fully and irrevocably waives any right to receive, any Substitute Securities (as defined in the Articles of Incorporation of the Company, as amended) in the Merger pursuant to Section 11(b) of the Statement of Resolution Establishing Series of Non-Voting Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series F, contained in the Articles of Incorporation of Company, as amended), it being understood that the Stockholder will have the right in respect of each such Series F Preferred Share to elect to receive Cash Consideration and/or Stock Consideration in the Merger on the terms and subject to the conditions specified in the Merger Agreement.

 



 

6. The Stockholder represents and warrants (a) that the Stockholder has duly executed and delivered this letter agreement and has all authority and full legal capacity to enter into this letter agreement; (b) that, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this letter agreement by the Company, this letter agreement is the Stockholders legal, valid and binding agreement and is enforceable against the Stockholder in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by the Enforceability Exceptions; (c) that the Shares are owned by the Stockholder free and clear of all encumbrances, voting arrangements and commitments of every kind, except as would not restrict the performance of the Stockholders obligations under this Agreement and (d) that the Stockholder has the sole or shared power to vote or direct the vote of all Shares (to the extent such shares are entitled to vote).

 



 

7. This letter agreement and all obligations of the parties hereunder shall automatically terminate upon the earlier of (a) the Effective Time and (b) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) this paragraph 7 and paragraphs 10, 11, 12 and 13 hereof shall survive any such termination and (ii) such termination shall not relieve any party of any liability or damages resulting from any willful and intentional breach of this letter agreement occurring prior to such termination.

 



 

8. The Stockholder is entering into this letter agreement solely in his or her capacity as a record or beneficial owner of the Shares and nothing herein is intended to or shall limit or affect any actions taken by the Stockholder, solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Company (or a Subsidiary of the Company).

 



 

9. The Stockholder agrees, without further consideration, to execute and deliver such additional documents and to take such further actions as necessary or reasonably requested by Parent or the Company to confirm and assure the rights and obligations set forth in this letter agreement.

 



 

10. THIS LETTER AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF. The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and the federal courts of the United States of America located in the State of Delaware solely in respect of the

 



 

Annex A-2-3     
 

 



 

interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this letter agreement and
of the documents referred to in this letter agreement, and in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert,
as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or
enforcement hereof or of any such documents, that it, he or she is not subject
thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not
maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate
or that this letter agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or
by such courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with
respect to such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in such a
Delaware State or federal court. The parties hereby consent to and grant any
such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over the subject
matter of such dispute.

 



 

11. The parties to this letter agreement acknowledge and agree that any controversy which may arise under this letter agreement and the other documents referred to in this letter agreement and in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues and, therefore, each such party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any legal action arising out of or relating to this letter agreement and the other documents referred to in this letter agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

 



 

12. The Stockholder recognizes and acknowledges that a breach of any covenants or agreements contained in this letter agreement will cause Company and Parent to sustain damages for which it would not have an adequate remedy at law for money damages, and therefore the Stockholder agrees that in the event of any such breach, Company and Parent shall be entitled to specific performance of such covenants and agreements and injunctive and other equitable relief in addition to any other remedy to which Company and Parent may be entitled, at law or in equity. It is accordingly agreed that Company and Parent shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this letter agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this letter agreement in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction.

 



 

13. In the event that any provision of this letter agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this letter agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this letter agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.
