respect to the Purchased Assets or Industrial Wood Business for any Straddle Period shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing Period and Post-Closing Period such that: (i)&nbsp;Property Taxes for the Pre-Closing Period shall equal the amount of
such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire
Straddle Period, and (ii)&nbsp;Taxes (other than Property Taxes) for the Pre-Closing Period shall be computed as if such taxable period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date. In each of (i)&nbsp;and (ii), the remainder of such Taxes
shall be allocated to the Post-Closing Period. If one party after Closing remits to the appropriate Taxing Authority any payment for Taxes which are subject to proration under this Section&nbsp;6.3, and such payment includes the other party&#146;s
share of such Taxes, such other party shall reimburse the remitting party for its share of such Taxes within ten Business Days following receipt of written notice from the remitting party. If after Closing (i)&nbsp;Seller or Purchaser obtains a
refund of any Taxes imposed with respect to the Purchased Assets or Industrial Wood Business for any Straddle Period, within ten Business Days of receipt, the party in receipt of such refund shall pay the other party a proportion of the refund equal
to the proportion of the Taxes that such other party paid for such Straddle Period; (ii)&nbsp;Purchaser obtains a refund of Taxes imposed with respect to the Purchased Assets or Industrial Wood Business for any Tax period ending on or before the
Closing Date, within ten Business Days of receipt, the Purchaser shall pay the Seller the amount of such refund. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(b) Seller shall prepare

Law. Purchaser shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all non-income Tax Returns with respect to the Purchased Assets and Industrial Wood Business for any Straddle Period that it (or its Affiliate) is required to file under
applicable Law after the Closing Date. All Tax Returns required to be filed pursuant to this Section&nbsp;6.3(b) shall be filed in a manner consistent with past practices unless otherwise required by applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
either party will file a Tax Return that will give rise to an indemnity obligation for Taxes of the other party pursuant to this Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, other than income, franchise or similar Taxes), (i)&nbsp;the indemnifying party
shall have the right to review and provide comments with respect to such indemnifiable items on such Tax Return, and (ii)&nbsp;any disputes as to such Tax Returns for which Seller and Purchaser cannot resolve their differences shall be resolved by
an Independent Accounting Firm in the manner set forth in Section&nbsp;2.9(d). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(c) Except as required by applicable Law or as expressly
