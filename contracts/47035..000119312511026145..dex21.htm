ARTICLE II

 

 _THE OFFER_



     | 2.1 | _The Offer_. 
---|---|--- 

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with _Article IX_ and none of the events set forth in paragraphs (i), (ii),
(iii), (iv) and (v) of Annex A hereto shall have occurred, Merger Sub shall,
and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence (within the meaning of Rule
14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer as promptly as practicable following
the date hereof and in any event within thirteen (13) Business Days after the
date hereof. The obligation of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger
Sub to, accept for payment shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered
pursuant to the Offer and to pay the Offer Price for each such tendered and
not subsequently withdrawn share shall be subject only to the satisfaction or
waiver by Parent or Merger Sub of the conditions set forth in _Annex A_ (such
conditions, as they may be amended in accordance with this Agreement, the "
_Tender Offer Conditions_ "). Parent on behalf of Merger Sub expressly
reserves the right from time to time, subject to _Section 2.1(b)_, to waive
in whole or in part any such condition, to increase the Offer Price
payable in the Offer, and to make any other changes to the terms and
conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that without the prior
written consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not (i) amend or waive
satisfaction of the Minimum Condition (as defined in _Annex A_ ), (ii) change
the form of consideration to be paid pursuant to the Offer, (iii) decrease the
Offer Price payable in the Offer, (iv) decrease the number of shares of
Company Common Stock sought to be purchased in the Offer, (v) impose
conditions to the Offer that are in addition to those set forth in _Annex A_
hereto, (vi) make any change in the Offer that would require an extension or
delay of the then current Expiration Date; provided, however, that this
clause (vi) shall not limit the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to extend the
Expiration Date as required by _Section 2.1(b)_; (vii) amend or modify the
Tender Offer Conditions (other than to waive such Tender Offer Conditions,
except for the Minimum Condition), or (viii) amend or modify any other term of
the Offer in any manner materially adverse to the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock in their capacities as holders of shares of Company Common
Stock.

(b) The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be the twentieth (20th)
Business Day after the date that the Offer is commenced (determined pursuant
to Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) (such date, or such
subsequent date to which the expiration of the Offer is extended pursuant to
and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_
"). Merger Sub shall not terminate or withdraw the Offer other than in
connection with the effective termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article IX_ hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with _Article IX_ hereof, Merger Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, (i) extend the Expiration Date if, on any
then scheduled Expiration Date, any of the Tender Offer Conditions is not
satisfied or waived by Merger Sub, for such periods of up to five (5) Business
Days at a time (or such other longer period as shall be consented to in
writing by the Company) as Merger Sub may deem reasonably necessary, but,
except as required by any applicable Law, rule, regulation, interpretation or
position of the

 



10 EXECUTION COPY



 

 NASDAQ, the SEC or the staff of the SEC (the " _SEC Staff_ ") applicable to
the Offer (including in connection with an increase in the Offer Price), in no
event may the Expiration Date be extended pursuant to this clause (i) to a
date later than the Termination Date and (ii) extend the Expiration Date for
any period required by any applicable Law, rule, regulation, interpretation or
position of the NASDAQ, the SEC or the SEC Staff applicable to the Offer,
including in connection with an increase in the Offer Price. Except as
expressly provided in this _Section 2.1(b)_, Merger Sub shall not extend the
Offer if all of the Tender Offer Conditions are satisfied or waived and it is
permitted under applicable Law to accept for payment and pay for validly
tendered shares of Company Common Stock that are not validly withdrawn.
Nothing in this _Section 2.1(b)_ shall affect any termination rights
contained in _Article IX_ hereof.

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and to
the satisfaction or waiver of the Tender Offer Conditions, Merger Sub shall,
and Parent shall cause it to, (i) promptly after the Expiration Date, accept
for payment and pay for (after giving effect to any required withholding Tax
pursuant to  _Section 2.1(e)_) all shares of Company Common Stock that have
been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the
date of acceptance for payment, the " _Acceptance Date_ "), which acceptance
shall be by written notice to the Paying Agent, (ii) promptly after the
Acceptance Date, but no later than the close of business, New York City time,
on the third Business Day thereafter, deposit or cause to be deposited with
the Paying Agent, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate Offer
Price for such accepted shares of Company Common Stock, and (iii) as soon as
practicable following such deposit, cause the Paying Agent to pay for all
shares of Company Common Stock so accepted for payment. In the event that the
Acceptance Date occurs, but the number of shares of Company Common Stock that
have been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn in the Offer, together
with any shares of Company Common Stock then owned by Parent, assuming
exercise of the Top-Up Option in full, is less than ninety percent (90%) of
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock on a fully diluted basis,
Merger Sub may, in its sole discretion, commence a "subsequent
offering period" (in accordance with Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the
Exchange Act) for a number of days to be determined by Parent but not less
than three (3) nor more than twenty (20) Business Days to acquire additional
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. If Merger Sub shall commence a
subsequent offering period in connection with the Offer, Merger Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment and pay for (after giving
effect to any required withholding Tax) all additional shares of Company
Common Stock validly tendered during such subsequent offering period. Parent
shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely basis the
consideration necessary to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock that
Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment pursuant to the Offer and
shall cause Merger Sub to fulfill all of Merger Subs obligations under this
Agreement. Acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant
to and subject to the Tender Offer Conditions is referred to in this Agreement
as the " _Offer Closing_."

(d) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall file
with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together with all
amendments and supplements thereto, including the exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule TO_ ") with respect to the Offer, which shall contain or shall
incorporate by reference an

 



11 EXECUTION COPY



 

 offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ") and forms of the related
letter of transmittal and forms of notice of guaranteed delivery and any
related summary advertisement (the Schedule TO, the Offer to Purchase and
such other documents, together with all supplements and amendments thereto,
being referred to herein collectively as the " _Offer Documents_ "), and cause
the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common
Stock as and to the extent required by applicable Law. The Offer Documents
shall comply in all material respects with the requirements under applicable
Law. Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, agrees to correct promptly any information provided by it for use
in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and Parent and Merger Sub further
agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO, as so corrected,
to be filed with the SEC, and the other Offer Documents, as so corrected, to
be disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as
and to the extent required by applicable Law. The Company shall promptly
furnish to Parent and Merger Sub all information concerning the Company that
is required or reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with
the obligations relating to the Offer Documents contained in this _Section
2.1(d)_. Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents prior to
such documents (or amendments or supplements thereto) being filed with the
SEC or disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock. Parent and
Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel with any comments or
communications, whether written or oral, that Parent, Merger Sub or
their counsel may receive from the SEC or the SEC Staff with respect to the
Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments or communications
and shall provide the Company and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the response of Parent or Merger Sub to such comments or
communications. Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to suggestions of the Company or its counsel in response to such
comments or communications. In the event that Parent or Merger Sub receives
any comments from the SEC or the SEC Staff with respect to the Offer
Documents, each shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond promptly
to such comments and take all other actions necessary to resolve the issues
raised therein.

(e) Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer to
any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent, Merger
Sub or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over by
Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent to the appropriate Taxing Authority,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub
or the Paying Agent.

 



     | 2.2 | _Company Action_. 
---|---|--- 

(a) On the date of commencement of the Offer, the Company shall file with the
SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto, including the exhibits
thereto the " _Schedule 14D-9_ "),

 



12 EXECUTION COPY



 

 containing, subject to _Section 7.2_, the Company Board Recommendation, and
shall disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 as and to the extent required by Rule
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act and any other applicable Law. The
Schedule 14D-9 shall comply in all material respects with the requirements
under applicable Law. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees to
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9
if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect, and the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary
to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as and
to the extent required by applicable Law. The Company shall give Parent and
its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule
14D-9 prior to such document being filed with the SEC or disseminated to
holders of shares of Company Common Stock. The Company shall provide Parent
and its counsel with any comments or communications, written or oral, that the
Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or the SEC Staff with respect
to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments or
communications and shall provide Parent and its counsel with a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the response of the Company to such comments.
The Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to suggestions
of Parent or its counsel in response to such comments or communications. In
the event that the Company receives any comments from the SEC or the SEC
Staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, it shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to respond promptly to such comments and take all other
actions necessary to resolve the issues raised therein.

 

(b) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, and in any event within
four (4) Business Days, the Company shall instruct its transfer agent to
furnish Parent and Merger Sub with mailing labels containing the names and
addresses of all record holders of shares of Company Common Stock and with
security position listings of shares held in stock depositories, each as of
a recent date, together with all other available listings and computer files
containing names, addresses and security position listings of record holders
and beneficial owners of shares of Company Common Stock. The Company shall
instruct its transfer agent to furnish Parent and Merger Sub with such
additional available information, including, without limitation, updated
listings and computer files of stockholders, mailing labels and security
position listings, and such other assistance in disseminating the Offer
Documents to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, as Parent or Merger
Sub may reasonably request. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and
except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and
any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer or the Merger, such
information and materials shall be deemed "confidential information" under the
Confidentiality Agreement. The information contained in such labels, listings
and files shall be treated and held in confidence by Parent and Merger Sub in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence and shall be used only in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and, if
this Agreement shall be terminated in accordance with _Article IX_ , Parent
and Merger Sub shall deliver to the Company all copies of such information
then in their possession.

 



     | 2.3 | _Top-Up Option_. 
---|---|--- 
 



13 EXECUTION COPY



 

(a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option, for so long
as this Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to the provisions hereof
(the " _Top-Up Option_ "), to purchase (for cash or a note payable), that
number (but not less than that number) of shares of Company Common Stock (the
" _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the lesser of (i) the lowest number of
shares that, when added to the number of shares owned by Parent or Merger Sub
at the time of such exercise, will constitute one share more than ninety
percent (90%) of the total shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding on
a Fully-Diluted Basis (assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares) at a
price per share equal to the Offer Price, and (ii) the aggregate number of
shares held as treasury shares by the Company and the number of shares that
the Company is authorized to issue under its certificate of incorporation but
which (A) are not issued and outstanding, (B) are not reserved for issuance
pursuant to the Company Stock Plans and (C) are issuable without the approval
of the Companys stockholders.

(b) The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable only once, in whole and not in
part, on or prior to the fifth (5th) Business Day after the purchase of and
payment for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer by Merger
Sub, or if any subsequent offering period is provided, during the five
(5)-Business Day period following the expiration date of such subsequent
offering period, and only if Merger Sub shall beneficially own as of such time
at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. Merger
Sub will, concurrently with the exercise of the Top-Up Option, give written
notice to the Company that as promptly as practicable following such exercise,
Merger Sub intends to (and Merger Sub will, and Parent will cause Merger Sub
to, as promptly as practicable after such exercise) consummate the Merger in
accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL as contemplated by _Section 3.9_. The
Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable, and the Company shall not be obligated
to deliver the Top-Up Option Shares, if (i) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock issuable pursuant to the Top-Up Option exceeds the number of
authorized shares of Company Common Stock available for issuance and not
otherwise reserved for issuance for outstanding Company Options or other
obligations of the Company, (ii) the exercise of the Top-Up Option and the
issuance and delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares are prohibited by any
applicable Law, (iii) any judgment, injunction, order or decree shall be in
effect prohibiting the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the
Top-Up Option Shares in respect of such exercise (excluding any rule or
regulation of the NASDAQ), (iv) immediately upon exercise of the Top-Up
Option and the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares, the number of shares of
Company Common Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent and Merger Sub
(excluding shares of Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer pursuant to
guaranteed delivery procedures as to which delivery has not been completed as
of the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option) does not constitute one share
more than ninety percent (90%) of the number of shares of Company Common Stock
that will be outstanding on a fully diluted basis immediately after the
issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares, (v) the issuance of Top-Up Option Shares
pursuant to the Top-Up Option would require approval by the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law (other than pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the NASDAQ) or (vi) Merger Sub has not accepted for payment all
shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered in the Offer and not properly
withdrawn and has not deposited or caused to be deposited with the Paying
Agent cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Offer Price for all accepted shares
of Company Common Stock. The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the
issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares is accomplished consistent with all

 



14 EXECUTION COPY



 

 applicable Laws (other than pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
NASDAQ), including compliance with an applicable exemption from registration
of the Top-Up Option Shares under the Securities Act. The Top-Up Option shall
terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii)
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article IX_.

 

(c) In the event that Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option in
accordance with this _Section 2.3_, Merger Sub shall give the Company prior
written notice specifying in such notice: (i) the number of Shares that Merger
Sub intends to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option; (ii) the manner in
which Parent or Merger Sub intends to pay the applicable exercise price; and
(iii) the place and time at which the closing of the purchase of such Top-Up
Option Shares by Merger Sub is to take place, with the time for the closing
being not more than five (5) Business Days after the exercise of the Top-Up
Option. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such
notice, notify Merger Sub of the number of shares of Company Common Stock then
outstanding, the number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding on
a Fully-Diluted Basis and the number of Top-Up Option Shares. At the closing
of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, Merger Sub shall pay the Company
the aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up Option Shares pursuant to
this  _Section 2.3_, and the Company shall cause to be issued to Merger Sub
a certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) representing the Top-
Up Option Shares. The aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up Option
Shares may be paid either (i) entirely in cash or (ii) at the election of
Merger Sub or Parent, by paying in cash an amount equal to not less than the
aggregate par value of the Top-Up Option Shares and by Merger Sub executing
and delivering to the Company a full recourse promissory note having a
principal amount equal to the balance of the aggregate purchase price for the
Top-Up Option Shares. Any such promissory note shall bear interest at the rate
of five percent (5%) per annum, shall mature on the first (1st) anniversary
of the date of execution and delivery of such promissory note and may be
prepaid at any time and from time to time, in whole or in part, without
premium or penalty. Merger Subs obligations under any such promissory note
shall be guaranteed by Parent. Without the prior written consent of the
Company, the right to exercise the Top-Up Option granted pursuant to this
Agreement shall not be assigned by Merger Sub except to any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. Any attempted assignment in
violation of this _Section 2.3(c)_ shall be null and void.

(d) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the Top-Up Option Shares
that Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub represents and warrants to the Company that Merger Sub
is, and will be upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited
investor," as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the
Securities Act. Each of Parent and Merger Sub represents, warrants and agrees
that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired
upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Merger
Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in
connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the
Securities Act). Any certificates evidencing Top-Up Option Shares shall
include any legends required by applicable securities Laws.

pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL as contemplated by _Section 4.1(d)_.

 _CONVERSION OR CANCELLATION OF SHARES IN THE MERGER_

 



     | 4.1 | _Merger Consideration; Conversion or Cancellation of Shares
in the Merger_. 
---|---|--- 

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the 

 



17 EXECUTION COPY



 

 holders of any shares of Company Capital Stock or the holders of any capital
stock of Merger Sub, each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock
(other than Excluded Shares (as defined in _Section 4.1(b)_) and Dissenting
Shares (as defined in _Section 4.1(d)_) shall, by virtue of the Merger, be
converted into the right to receive, pursuant to _Section 4.2_, upon the
surrender of the certificates (or evidence of shares in book-entry form)
representing Company Common Stock, cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price
(the " _Merger Consideration_ "), without interest thereon. As a result of the
Merger, at the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except an entitlement to receive the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of such shares, all to be paid, without
interest, in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such shares of
Company Common Stock. Subject to _Section 7.1(c)_, if prior to the Effective
Time the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed
into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares, and, in each such case, the record date for such
transaction is between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, then
any number or amount contained herein (including, without limitation, the
Offer Price and the Merger Consideration) that is based upon the number of
shares of Company Common Stock will be appropriately adjusted to provide to
Parent and the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. At the Effective Time, each share of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding and owned by Parent, Merger Sub
or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or held in the treasury of the
Company or owned by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall
cease to be outstanding, and shall be automatically cancelled and retired
without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

 

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, each
share of Merger Sub capital stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain outstanding as one share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, which shall thereafter
constitute all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

(d) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly exercised
and perfected his or her demand for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, but the holders of such Dissenting Shares
shall be entitled to receive such consideration as shall be determined
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if any
such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively waived,
withdrawn or lost his or her right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL,
such holders shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to
have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive

 



18 EXECUTION COPY



 

 the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and such shares
shall not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. The Company shall serve prompt
written notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal, withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
received by the Company in respect of any shares of Company Common Stock, and
Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights under Section 262
of the DGCL. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, settle or
offer to settle or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand with
respect to, any such exercise of appraisal rights, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

4.2 _Exchange of Stock Certificates_. Certificates (or evidence of shares in
book-entry form) representing shares of Company Common Stock shall be
exchanged for the Merger Consideration in accordance with the following
procedures:

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank, trust company or
transfer agent reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent
under this Agreement (the " _Paying Agent_ ") who shall serve pursuant to an
agreement between Parent and the Paying Agent (the " _Paying Agent Agreement_
"), a copy of which Paying Agent Agreement shall be provided to the Company
and its counsel for its review and comment prior to its execution by Parent
and the Paying Agent and which comments shall be given good faith
consideration by Parent and its counsel. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deliver, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to an account
designated in writing by the Paying Agent, in trust for the benefit of the
holders of Company Common Stock, an amount in cash equal to the Merger
Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock to be
converted in the Merger (the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later
than five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Common Stock a
form of letter of transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the certificates to the Paying
Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions (including
customary provisions with respect to delivery of an "agents message" with
respect to shares held in book-entry form) as Parent may specify, subject to
the Companys reasonable approval), together with instructions thereto. Upon
(i) in the case of shares of Company Common Stock represented by a
certificate, the surrender of such certificate for cancellation to the Paying
Agent or (ii) in the case of shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry
form, the receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent, in each case
together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly, completely and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents
as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such shares
of Company Common Stock shall be entitled to receive (and the Paying Agent
shall deliver) an amount equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the
number of shares of Company Common Stock to be converted.

 



19 EXECUTION COPY



 

(c) The payment of any transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration,
value added and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) incurred by a holder of Company Common Stock in connection with the
Merger, and the filing of any related Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to such Taxes and fees, shall be the sole responsibility of such
holder.

(d) In no event shall the holder of any surrendered certificates (or evidence
of shares in book-entry form) representing Company Common Stock be entitled to
receive interest on any of the Merger Consideration.

(e) If the payment equal to the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered certificate (or evidence
of shares in book-entry form) formerly evidencing shares of Company Common
Stock is registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a
condition of payment that the certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry
form) so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid
all transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the certificate
(or evidence of shares in book-entry form) surrendered, or shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent and Parent that such taxes
either have been paid or are not applicable.

 

(f) At any time following the twelfth (12th) month after the Effective Time,
Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any
funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to
holders of shares of Company Common Stock (including, without limitation, all
interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of
all funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be
entitled to look to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other
similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to any Merger
Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the certificates (or
evidence of shares in book-entry form) held by them. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to
any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any Merger Consideration
delivered in respect of such shares to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or other similar law.

(g) If any certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Paying
Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such amount as Parent or the
Paying Agent may reasonably direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such certificate, Parent shall direct the
Paying Agent to pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such certificate, as contemplated by this
_Article IV_. 

(h) The Paying Agent shall invest any of the funds deposited with the Paying
Agent as directed by Parent; provided, however, that such investments shall
be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any
agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of
the United States of America, in commercial paper 

 



20 EXECUTION COPY



 

 obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of
such bank that are then publicly available). Any net profit resulting from, or
interest or income produced by, such investments shall be payable to Parent
or an affiliate of Parent as Parent directs; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
net loss resulting from such investments shall be promptly reimbursed by
Parent to the Exchange Fund upon demand by the Paying Agent. No investment of
the Merger Consideration funds shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent from making payments required by this _Article IV_. The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than as set forth in
_Section 4.2(a)_.

(i) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the
records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares except as
otherwise provided herein or by applicable Law.

 



     | 4.3 | _Stock Options; Restricted Stock_. 
---|---|--- 

(a) The Company shall take all such action as may be required to fully vest
each Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. If the
holder so elects in writing, each In-The-Money Company Option shall be
canceled at the Effective Time, in exchange for a payment by the Company, in
cash, within five (5) Business Days of the Effective Time, equal to the
product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Offer Price over the per
share exercise price of the In-The-Money Company Option, and (ii) the number
of shares subject to the Company Option, less applicable withholdings. To the
extent that a holder of an In-The-Money Company Option does not elect that a
particular Company Option may be treated in the manner described in the prior
sentence, that Company Option shall instead be treated as an "Out-Of-The-Money
Company Option" for all purposes.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, all rights with respect to Company Common Stock
under each Out-Of-The-Money Company Option shall be converted into and become
rights with respect to Parent Common Stock, and Parent shall assume each such
Out-Of-The-Money Company Option in accordance with the terms and conditions
(as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) of the stock option plan
under which it was issued, as amended, if applicable, and the terms and
conditions of the stock option agreement by which it is evidenced, as amended,
if applicable. From and after the Effective Time, (i) each Out-Of-The-Money
Company Option assumed by Parent may be exercised solely for shares of Parent
Common Stock, (ii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each
such Out-Of-The-Money Company Option shall be equal to the number of shares of
Company common stock subject to such Out-Of-

 



21 EXECUTION COPY



 

 The-Money Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied
by the Option Exchange Ratio, rounding down to the nearest whole share, (iii)
the per share exercise price under each such Out-Of-The-Money Company Option
shall be adjusted by dividing the per share exercise price under such Out-Of-
The-Money Company Option by the Option Exchange Ratio and rounding up to the
nearest cent, and (iv) any restriction on the exercise of any such Out-Of-
The-Money Company Option shall continue in full force and effect and the term,
exercisability, and other provisions of such Out-Of-The-Money Company Option
shall otherwise remain unchanged; provided, however, that each Out-Of-The-
Money Company Option assumed by Parent in accordance with this _Section
4.3(b)_ shall, in accordance with its terms, be subject to further adjustment
as appropriate to reflect any stock split, stock dividend, reverse
stock split, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction
effected subsequent to the Effective Time. The "Option Exchange Ratio" shall
be equal to the fraction obtained by dividing the Offer Price by the average
closing sales price for one share of Parent Common Stock on NASDAQ for the
ten (10) trading-day period ending on the first business day immediately
preceding the date hereof.

(c) Each restricted stock award granted under any compensation plan or
arrangement of the Company and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (" _Company Restricted Stock_ ") shall be cancelled at the Effective
Time in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such
stock.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
reasonably necessary to effect the measures contemplated by this _Section
4.3_, including but not limited to adoption of any plan amendments, offering
to enter into the elections contemplated by _Section 4.3(a)_, seeking
Company Board approval and/or seeking any consents, and to ensure that, on and
after the Effective Time, no holder of an In-The-Money Company Option or
Company Restricted Stock has any further rights with respect thereto (other
than to receive the payments provided for in this _Section 4.3_) and that no
holder of an Out-Of-The-Money Company Option has any further rights with
respect thereto (other than the rights provided for in this _Section 4.3_).

4.4 _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to
the contrary, each of the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation, Parent and
their respective agents shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
Merger Consideration, or the amounts described in _Section 4.3_, otherwise
payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of any federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law. If the
Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective
agents, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, and pays over such amounts
to the appropriate Taxing Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of
Company Common Stock in respect of which the Paying Agent, the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the agent, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding.

ARTICLE V

note, license, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries may be bound, except for such violations, breaches

Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub has relied solely upon its own
independent investigation and analysis of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
their respective businesses and the transactions contemplated hereby, and
each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that (i) except for the
representations and warranties of the Company expressly set forth in _Article
V_ , none of the Company or its Subsidiaries nor any of their
respective Representatives makes any representation or warranty (express or
implied) as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the information made
available to Parent or Merger Sub or any of their Representatives or any other
matter whatsoever; (ii) it is not relying, and has not relied, on any
representations, warranties or other statement by any Person on behalf of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the representations and
warranties of the Company expressly contained in _Article V_ of this
Agreement and that all other representations and warranties are specifically
disclaimed; and (iii) none of the Company and its Subsidiaries nor any other
Person will have or be subject to any liability or indemnification obligation
to Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person resulting from the distribution to

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, each of Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledges and agrees that (a) none of the Company or its Subsidiaries nor
any of their respective Representatives or any other Person is making any
representation or warranty, whatsoever, express or implied, beyond those
expressly given by the Company in _Article V_ hereof, the Company Disclosure
Schedule or any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement, and (b)
none of Parent or Merger Sub has been induced by, or relied upon, any
representations, warranties or statements (written or oral), whether express
or implied, made by any Person, that are not expressly set forth in _Article
V_ of this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger
Sub acknowledges that no representations or warranties are made with respect
to (a) any projections, forecasts, estimates, budgets or prospect information
for the Company or its Subsidiaries or (b) any material, documents or
information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries made available to each
of Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives.



     | 6.8 | _Sufficient Funds; Financing_. 
---|---|--- 

(a) Parent has, and shall have at the Acceptance Date, available to it
sufficient cash and cash equivalents to permit Merger Sub to perform all of
its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate all the transactions
contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, acquiring all the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer and the Merger. Parent
and Merger Sub expressly acknowledge and agree that their obligations
hereunder are not subject to any conditions, express or implied, regarding
their ability to obtain financing (or to obtain financing on acceptable terms)
for the consummation of the Offer or the Merger.

 

(b) None of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the
Merger, will require the consent from any lender or the holder or any notes,
bonds or other debt instruments pursuant to which Parent or Merger Sub, or any
of their respective Affiliates, are

 



42 EXECUTION COPY



 

 obligated or bound. To the extent that any such consents were required to be
obtained prior to the execution this Agreement, Parent has provided to the
Company true, correct and complete copies of such consents.

(c) Parent has received a commitment letter (the " _Commitment Letter_ ")
executed by the parties specified therein (the " _Lenders_ "), pursuant to
which the Lenders have committed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth therein, to provide debt financing in the amounts set forth therein
for the purpose of ( _inter alia_ ) funding the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby. A true, correct and complete copy of
the Commitment Letter has been provided to the Company. The obligations of the
Lenders to fund the commitments under the Commitment Letter are not subject
to any conditions, other than the conditions expressly set forth in the
Commitment Letter. The respective commitments of the Lenders set forth in the
Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn, modified or rescinded in any
respect. The Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent and the other parties thereto.
Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in 
_Article V_ , Parent knows of no facts or circumstances that are reasonably
likely to result in any of the conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter
not being satisfied. Parent has paid any and all fees which are due and
payable under the Commitment Letter. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent
expressly acknowledges that the consummation of the financing contemplated by
the Commitment Letter is not a condition to the obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

6.9 _Brokers and Finders_. Except for the fees and expenses payable to
Oppenheimer and Co., Inc., which fees and expenses are the sole responsibility
of Parent, Parent has not employed any investment banker, broker, finder,

the meaning of Section 13 of the Exchange Act or the rules or regulations
thereunder), directly or indirectly, any shares of Company Capital Stock, or
(b) is party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose
of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of, shares of Company Capital
Stock. Prior to the Company Board approving this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby for purposes of the applicable
provisions of the DGCL, neither Parent nor Merger Sub, alone or together with
any other Person, was at any time, or became, an "interested stockholder"
thereunder , or an "Interested Stockholder" as defined in Article 7 of the
Company Certificate, has taken any action that would cause any anti-takeover
statute under the DGCL to be applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

6.11 _Solvency_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into the
transactions contemplated hereby with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud
either present or future creditors. Immediately after giving effect to all of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including any arrangement by Parent of
any financing to be consummated prior to or contemporaneously with 

 



43 EXECUTION COPY



 

 the Closing in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
any alternative financing and the payment of the aggregate Offer Price and the
aggregate Merger Consideration, the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent.
For purposes of this _Section 6.11_, the term " _Solvent_ " with respect to
the Surviving Corporation means that, as of any date of determination, (x) the
amount of the fair saleable value of the assets of the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, exceeds, as of such date, the sum of
(i) the value of all liabilities of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, including contingent and other liabilities,
as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance
with the applicable federal Laws governing determinations of the solvency of
debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the probable
liabilities of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole on its existing debts (including contingent liabilities) as such debts
become absolute and matured; (y) the Surviving Corporation will not have,
as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of
the business in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged by Parent
following such date; and (z) the Surviving Corporation will be able to pay its
liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature.

6.12 _Certain Arrangements_. There are no Contracts between Parent, Holdco or
Merger Sub, on the one hand, and any member of the Companys management or
directors, on the other hand, as of the date hereof that relate in any way to
the Company or the transactions contemplated hereby.

(i) the Company Board has received an Acquisition Proposal that it determines

violated the terms of _Section 7.2_, (B) the Company shall have given Parent
at least three (3) Business Days prior written notice of its intention to
take such action (which notice shall specify the material terms and

and other material documents with the party making such Superior Proposal,

Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, (D) the Company
Board shall have considered in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal and financial advisors) any changes to this Agreement proposed by
Parent in a written offer capable of acceptance and determined that the
Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such

to the financial or other material terms of such Superior Proposal, the
Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent an additional notice and
copies of the relevant proposed transaction agreement and other material
documents and the three (3) Business Day notice period shall have
recommenced; or

was not known by the Company Board as of or at any time prior to the date of
this Agreement (other than, and not relating in any way to, an Acquisition
Proposal, it being understood and hereby agreed that the Company Board
may only effect a Board Recommendation Change in response to or in connection
with an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to and in accordance with _Section
7.2(e)(i)_) (such material fact, event, change, development or set of
circumstances, an " _Intervening Event_ ") shall have occurred and be
continuing; provided that (A) the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such
action in light of the Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be a
breach of its fiduciary duties, (B) the Company shall have given Parent at
least three (3) Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take
such action and, no later than the time of such notice, provided Parent with
a written explanation of the Company Boards basis and rationale for proposing
to effect such Board Recommendation Change, (C) if requested by Parent, the
Company shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent during such three (3)
Business Day notice period to enable Parent to propose changes to the terms of
this Agreement that would obviate the need for the Company Board to effect
such Board Recommendation Change, (D) the Company Board shall have considered
in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) any changes to
this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent and determined that the failure
to take such action would reasonably be expected to be a breach of its

of any material change to the facts and circumstances relating to such
Intervening Event, the Company shall have delivered to Parent an additional
notice and the three (3) Business Day notice period shall have recommenced.

Board or a Committee from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of
the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item

with applicable Law, (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders required
by applicable Law or by the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ, or (iii)
otherwise making such disclosure to the Companys stockholders or otherwise
that the Company Board or a Committee (after consultation with counsel)

of this Agreement with respect thereto, or any "stop, look and
listen" communication by the Company Board pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the
Exchange Act, or any similar communication to the stockholders of the Company,
shall not, in and of itself, constitute a Board Recommendation Change or a
withdrawal or modification, or proposal by the Company Board to withdraw or
modify, such Company Boards recommendation of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, or an approval or recommendation with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

 subject to _Section 7.5(c)_, Parent shall be entitled to designate up to
such number of directors, rounded up to the nearest whole number, constituting

Parent representation on the Company Board equal to the product of (i) the
total number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to the number of
directors designated by Parent and elected or appointed to the Company Board
pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by (ii) the percentage that such number
of shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their Affiliates (including, for purposes of such percentage, the
shares of Company Common Stock that are accepted for payment pursuant to the

total number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding, and
the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, upon Parents
request and subject to the terms of the Company Certificate and the Company
Bylaws, promptly, at Parents election, either increase the size of the
Company Board or seek and accept the resignation of such number of directors
as is necessary to enable Parents designees to be elected to the Company
Board and to cause Parents designees to be so elected. At such times, subject
to _Section 7.5(c)_, the Company will cause individuals designated by Parent

Company, and shall be solely responsible for, the information and consents
with respect to Parent and its designees, officers, directors and affiliates
required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder.

(c) In the event that Parents designees are elected or designated to the
Company Board, then, until the Effective Time, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company Board to have at least
three (3) directors who each are directors of the Company on the date hereof
or their successors (such directors, the " _Continuing Directors_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that, if any Continuing Director is unable to serve
due to resignation, death or disability or any other reason, the
remaining Continuing Directors shall be entitled to elect or designate
another individual (or individuals) ( _provided_ , that no such individual is
an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) to fill the vacancy,
and such director (or directors) shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director
for purposes of this Agreement. If no Continuing Director remains prior to the
Effective Time, a majority of the members of the Company Board at the time of
the execution of this Agreement shall be entitled to designate three persons
to fill such vacancies; _provided_ , that such individuals shall not be

on the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub and any of their affiliates (other
than the Company and any of its Subsidiaries), on the other hand, (ii)
amend or terminate this Agreement on behalf of the Company, (iii) use or
waive any of the Companys rights or remedies hereunder, (iv) extend the time

take any other action by the Company in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby required to be taken by the Company Board, or
(vii) take any other action adversely affecting the rights of the stockholders
of the Company (other than Parent or Merger Sub). The Continuing Directors
shall have the authority to retain such counsel (which may include current
counsel to the Company) and other advisors at the expense of the Company as

or any of its Subsidiaries is restricted in or prohibited from providing any
such access to any documents or data pursuant to any such contract or
agreement for the benefit of any third party under the preceding clause

in each case, whether or not the Companys insurance covers all such costs.
From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall

indemnification, advancement and exculpation obligations. Without limiting
the foregoing, Parent, from and after the Control Time until the later of (x)

adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties. In
addition, from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Company

was, or was or is deemed to have status as, a director or officer of the
Company or such Subsidiary or (B) acts or omissions by an Indemnified Party in
the Indemnified Partys capacity as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary

and Parent shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter and shall provide
access to properties and individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or
cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be

the right, but not the obligation, to assume and control the defense of any
litigation, claim or proceeding relating to any acts or omissions covered
under this _Section 7.9_ with counsel selected by the Indemnified Party,
which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent (i) shall be permitted to participate in the defense
of such claim at its own expense and (ii) shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without Parents written consent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In the event that any claim
for advancement or indemnification is asserted or made, all rights to
advancement or indemnification in respect of such claim shall continue until
the disposition of such claim. The Surviving Corporation and Parent shall pay
all reasonable expenses, including attorneys fees, that may be incurred by
the Indemnified Parties in successfully enforcing the indemnity and other

(c) Parent shall bear the full cost of and shall cause the Company to
maintain in effect, applicable on and after the Effective Time, for a period
equal to six (6) years immediately following the Effective Time (such period,
the " _D andO Tail Period_"), the current directors and officers liability
insurance policies (including, but not limited to, both primary and any and
all excess policies) maintained by the Company on the date hereof (the " _D andO
Policies_") covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time with respect to those persons who are currently (and any additional
persons who prior to the Effective Time become) covered by the Companys
directors and officers liability insurance policy on terms and scope with
respect to such coverage, and in amount, not less favorable to such
individuals than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof (
_provided_ , that the Company shall, at Parents or the Companys election,
substitute therefor one or more prepaid, fully-earned and non-cancellable tail
policies with respect to such directors and officers liability insurance

individuals or the Company covered under such insurance policy as the limits,
terms and conditions in the existing policies of the Company); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required
to expend pursuant to this _Section 7.9(c)_ more than an amount per year of

by the Company for such insurance and (ii) in the event of an expiration,
termination or cancellation of such current policies, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall be required to obtain as much coverage as is possible under
substantially similar policies for such maximum annual amount in aggregate
annual premiums. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall take, or
allow to be taken, any action to terminate, or which could reasonably be
expected to result in the termination of, the DandO Policies, during the DandO
Tail Period. 

(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall

 



59 EXECUTION COPY



 

 not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, shall assume the obligations thereof set forth in this
_Section 7.9_.

 

(e) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company as
provided in the Company Certificate or Company Bylaws shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. The provisions of this
_Section 7.9_ are intended to be in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights available by law, charter, statute, by-law, agreement or
otherwise, and shall operate for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their representatives. The
obligations set forth in this  _Section 7.9_ shall not be terminated,
amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any
Indemnified Party and their heirs and representatives, without the affected
Indemnified Party or other Person consenting in writing to such termination,
amendment or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified
Parties to whom this _Section 7.9_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries
of this _Section 7.9_).

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it
being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this
_Section 7.9_ is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under
such policies.

(g) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Surviving
Corporation shall, jointly and severally, provide to Indemnified Parties any
rights and benefits under any indemnification agreement with the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in effect as of the date hereof.

(h) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all of the
obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 7.9_.

benefit plans that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries sponsors, participates
in, is a party to or contributes to; _provided_ that nothing shall prohibit

Parent shall and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
its third party insurers to provide that such Continuing Employee shall
receive full credit for service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting, to the same extent
that such service was recognized as of the Closing Date under a comparable
plan of the Company and its Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employee
participated (but not for purposes of benefit accrual including, but not
limited to, under any defined benefit pension plans, special or early
retirement programs, window separation programs, or similar plans which may be
in effect from time to time), except where the provision of such prior service
credit would result in duplication of benefits.

 

(c) Parent shall (and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
its third party insurers to) (i) waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-
existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and
waiting periods under any health or welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employees (and
their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the
Closing Date, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
were not satisfied or waived under the comparable plan of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employee participated and (ii) if a
Continuing Employee commences participation in any health benefit plan of
Parent or its Subsidiaries during calendar year 2011, to the extent
practicable, cause any health benefit plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries in
which the Continuing Employee participates after the Closing Date to recognize
the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses
incurred by such Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible dependents)
during such calendar year for purposes of satisfying such calendar years
deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans
in which such Continuing Employee (and dependents) commences participation.

(d) Nothing in this _Section 7.10_ shall (i) be treated as an amendment of,
or undertaking to amend, any employee benefit plan, or (ii) confer any rights
or benefits on any person other than the parties to this Agreement.

representation or warranty made by Parent or Merger Sub, to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect and (B) in the case of any representation
or warranty made by Company, to be untrue or inaccurate such that the

temporary restraining order, executive order, decree, ruling, judgment or
injunction or other Order of a court or Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction (each a " _Restraint_ ") prohibiting the consummation of the

that prior to invoking this  _Section 8.1(b)_, each party shall have used
its commercially reasonable efforts to have such Restraint lifted.

proceeding by a Governmental Entity challenging or seeking to restrain or
prohibit the consummation of the Merger.

of this Agreement or the terms of the Offer, Merger Sub fails to purchase any
shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not properly withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer.

(a) if the Offer Closing shall not have occurred on or before June 30, 2011
(the " _Termination Date_ "), _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.2(a)_ shall not be available
to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has
been the primary cause of, or primarily resulted in, the failure of Merger Sub
or its permitted assignee to have purchased all such shares validly tendered
and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer on or before the Termination
Date; or 

(b) if any Restraint enjoining, restraining, preventing or prohibiting the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger shall be in effect and shall have
become final and non-appealable and has the effect of making consummation of
the Offer or the Merger illegal or otherwise restraining, preventing or
prohibiting consummation of the Offer or the Merger; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that the right to terminate this Agreement under Section 9.2(b) shall not be
available to a party if (i) the issuance of such final, non-appealable
Restraint was primarily due to or primarily resulted from the failure of such
party to perform its obligations under this Agreement or (ii) such party shall
not have used its commercially reasonable efforts to have such Restraint
lifted.

9.3 _Termination by Parent_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Offer
and Merger may be abandoned by Parent if:

(a) prior to the Offer Closing, there has occurred a material breach of or
material failure to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement, which
breach or failure to perform (x) would cause any of the conditions set forth
in _Annex A_ to not be satisfied, (y) shall have been notified by Parent in a
written notice delivered to the Company, and (z) cannot be cured by the
Termination Date or at least thirty (30) days shall have elapsed since the
date of delivery of a written notice of such breach to the Company from Parent
and such breach shall not have been cured in a manner such that such breach
no longer results in the applicable condition set forth in _Annex A_ not being
satisfied, _provided_ , that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.3(a)_ if the Companys breach or
failure to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement was primarily due to the failure of
Parent or Merger Sub to perform any of their obligations under this
Agreement; 

(b) a Board Recommendation Change shall have occurred;

 

(c) if the Company shall have materially breached any of its obligations under
_Section 7.2_ which resulted in an Acquisition Proposal being announced,
submitted or made; or

(d) since the date of this Agreement, there shall have occurred any
Company Material Adverse Effect.

9.4 _Termination by the Company_. This Agreement may be terminated by the
Company:

 

(a) if Parent or Merger Sub shall have (i) failed to commence the Offer within

 without having accepted all of the shares of Common Stock tendered for
payment thereunder, (iii) failed to timely accept for payment and purchase all
shares of Common Stock that have been validly tendered and not withdrawn

actions set forth in clauses (i) through (viii) of the last sentence of
_Section 2.1(a)_ without the prior written consent or waiver of the Company;

 

(b) if, at any time prior to the Acceptance Date, Parent or Merger Sub shall
have breached or failed to perform any of their respective representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, which
breach or failure to perform (x) would cause any of the conditions set forth
in _Annex A_ to not be satisfied, (y) shall have been notified by the Company
in a written notice delivered to Parent or Merger Sub and (z) cannot be cured
by the Termination Date or at least thirty (30) days shall have elapsed since
the date of delivery of a written notice of such breach from the Company to
Parent or Merger Sub and such breach shall not have been cured in a manner
such that such breach no longer results in the applicable condition set forth
in _Annex A_ not being satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.4(b)_ shall not be available
to the Company if Parents or Merger Subs breach or failure to perform any of
their respective representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
contained in this Agreement was primarily due to the failure of the Company to
perform any of its obligations under this Agreement; or

(c) in order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior
Proposal at any time prior to the Acceptance Date; _provided_ _that_ (i) the
Company has complied, in all material respects, with its obligations pursuant
to the terms of _Section 7.2_, (ii) the Company Board has effected a Board
Recommendation Change in compliance with the terms of Section 7.2(e) and (iii)
concurrently with the termination of this Agreement, the Company pays Parent

     | 9.5 | _Effect of Termination_. 
---|---|--- 
 

(a) Any termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to this _Article IX_
shall also constitute an effective termination by Merger Sub.

(b) In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to this
_Article IX_ , written notice thereof shall be given to the other party or
parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is
made, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void (other than the
provisions of _Section 7.7(d)_,  _Section 9.1_, _Section 9.2_, _Section
9.3_, _Section 9.4_, this _Section 9.5_, _Article X_ , and the
Confidentiality Agreement in accordance with its terms, all of which shall
survive termination of this Agreement), and there shall be no liability on
the part of any party hereto (or any directors, officers, employees, agents,
legal and financial advisors or other representatives and Affiliates of such
party except to the extent that the Company is required to pay the
Termination Fee pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (c) of this _Section
9.5_; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to the provisions of paragraph
(d) of this  _Section 9.5_, nothing contained in this _Section 9.5_ shall
relieve any party from liability or damages incurred or suffered by a party
for any fraud or any knowing or intentional breach of its covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement.

 



67 EXECUTION COPY



 

(c) In the event that:

 

(i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)_
(Board Recommendation Change);

 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.3(c)_
(Breach of No-Shop);

 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
9.4(c)_ (Acceptance of Superior Proposal); or 

(iv)(A) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed after the
date hereof and not withdrawn prior to the termination of this Agreement, and
(B) following the occurrence of an event described in the preceding clause
(A), this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to
_Section 9.2(a)_ (Termination Date) and (C) within twelve (12) months of the
date this Agreement is terminated, the Company enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to, or recommends to its stockholders, an Alternative
Transaction with a Third Party or an Alternative Transaction is consummated
with a Third Party;

then, in any such event under clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above, concurrently
with such termination, and, in the case of clause (iv) above, concurrently
with the earlier of the execution of such definitive agreement or the
consummation of such Alternative Transaction, the Company shall make payment
to Parent by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by
Parent a fee in an amount equal to $9,440,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ __");
it being understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion. For the purposes of the foregoing
_Section 9.5(c)_ above, the term " _Alternative Transaction_ " shall mean a
transaction of a type described in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal"
in  _Section 7.2_ except that the references to "20%" in the definition of
"Acquisition Proposal" in _Section 7.2_ shall be deemed to be references to
"50%."

 

(d) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this _Section 9.5_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to pay timely any amount due
to Parent pursuant to this _Section 9.5_, it shall also pay any documented
costs and expenses reasonably incurred by Parent or Merger Sub in connection
with a legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in a judgment
against the Company for such amount, together with interest on the amount of
any unpaid fee, cost or expense at the publicly announced prime rate
of Citibank, N.A. or any successor thereto in New York City from the date
such fee, cost or expense was required to be paid to (but excluding) the
payment date. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary
(including paragraph (b) of this _Section 9.5_), in the event that the
Termination Fee is paid in accordance with paragraph (c) of this _Section
9.5_, the payment of such Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of Parent, Merger Sub, and their respective subsidiaries,
shareholders, Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and Representatives
against the Company or any of its directors, officers, employees,
Representatives or Affiliates with respect to (i) any loss or
damage (including consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages)
suffered, directly or indirectly, as a result of the failure of any
transactions contemplated hereby, including the

 



68 EXECUTION COPY



 

 purchase of the shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and the Merger,
to be consummated, (ii) the termination of this Agreement, (iii) any
liabilities or obligations arising under this Agreement, or (iv) any claims
or actions arising out of or relating to any breach, termination or failure of
or under this Agreement.

(e) If this Agreement is terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby
are abandoned as provided herein, then: (i) each party will redeliver all
documents, work papers and other material of any other party relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby, whether so obtained before or after the
execution hereof, to the party furnishing the same; (ii) all confidential
information received by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates or
respective Representatives shall be treated in accordance with the provisions
of the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive the termination of this
Agreement; and (iii) all filings, applications and other submission made to
any Person, including any Governmental Entity, in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall, to the extent practicable,
be withdrawn from such Person.

 

9.6 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company (subject to  _Section 7.5_) may (i)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the other party, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other party contained herein or in any document,
certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto or (iii) waive compliance by
the other party with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein;
_provided_ , _however_ , that after any approval of this Agreement by the
Companys stockholders, there may not be any extension or waiver of this
Agreement which decreases the Merger Consideration or which adversely affects
the rights of the Companys stockholders hereunder without the approval of
such stockholders. Any agreement on the part of any party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party hereto to
assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights.

ARTICLE X

 

 _MISCELLANEOUS_

10.1 _Payment of Expenses_. Whether or not the Offer, the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be consummated, each party
hereto shall pay its own expenses incident to preparing for, entering into
and carrying out this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ that the Company and Parent shall share
equally all filing fees payable pursuant to the HSR Act. 

10.2 _Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements;
Survival of Confidentiality_. None of the representations, warranties,
covenants and other agreements in this Agreement or in any instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, including any rights arising out of any
breach of such representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements,
shall survive beyond the earlier of (i) termination of this Agreement, or (ii)
the Effective Time, except as provided in _Section 9.5_ and except for those
covenants and agreements contained herein and therein that by their terms
apply or are to be performed in whole or in part after the Effective Time
(including without limitation _Section 7.9)_ and/or the provisions of this

 



69 EXECUTION COPY



 

  _Article X_. The Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and any termination of this Agreement, and the
provisions of such Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to all information
and materials delivered by any party hereunder.

10.3 _Modification or Amendment_. Subject to _Section 7.5_ and to the
applicable provisions of the DGCL, at any time prior to the Effective Time,
the parties hereto may modify or amend this Agreement, by written agreement
executed and delivered by duly authorized officers of the respective parties;
provided, however, that (i) after Merger Sub purchases any Shares pursuant to
the Offer, no amendment will be made that decreases the Merger Consideration,
and (ii) after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, no amendment
shall be made which by applicable Law or any applicable rule or regulation of
any stock exchange requires further approval by the Companys stockholders,
without the approval of such stockholders. 

10.4 _Waiver_. Subject to _Section 7.5_, at any time prior to the Effective
Time, Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other
hand, may (1) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other, (2) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto, and (3) subject to the requirements of applicable Law, waive
compliance by the other parties with any of the agreements or conditions
contained herein, except that the Minimum Condition may only be waived by
Merger Sub with the prior written consent of the Company. No failure on the
part of any party to exercise any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, and no delay on the part of any party in exercising any
power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, shall operate as a
waiver of such power, right, privilege or remedy; and no single or partial
exercise of any such power, right, privilege or remedy shall preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right, privilege or
remedy. No party shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising out of this
Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement,
unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is
expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and delivered on
behalf of such party; and any such waiver shall not be applicable or have any
effect except in the specific instance in which it is given.

 

10.5 _Counterparts_. For the convenience of the parties hereto, this Agreement
may be executed in any number of counterparts (including by facsimile or
electronic transmission), each such counterpart being deemed to be an original
instrument, and all such counterparts shall together constitute the same
agreement. In the event that any signature to this Agreement is delivered by
facsimile transmission or by e-mail delivery of a portable document format
(.pdf or similar format) data file, such signature shall create a valid and
binding obligation of the party executing (or on whose behalf such signature
is executed) with the same force and effect as if such facsimile or ".pdf"
signature page were an original thereof.

 

10.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the
principles of conflict of laws (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware.

70 EXECUTION COPY



 

(a) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, its negotiation,
terms or performance, or the transactions contemplated hereby, or for
recognition and enforcement of any judgment entered in any such action or
proceeding shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court
of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of
Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within
the State of Delaware). Each of the parties hereby irrevocably submit, for
itself and in respect to its properties, generally and unconditionally, to the
exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of the aforesaid courts in respect
of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and
of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereby. The parties hereby consent to and grant any
such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and, to the extent
permitted by Law, over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that
mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or
proceeding in the manner provided in _Section 10.8_ or in such other manner
as may be permitted by any method permitted by Delaware Law or any other
jurisdiction in which a party is organized or has assets or operations shall
be, and shall conclusively be deemed to be, valid and effective service upon
each party thus served. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably waives, and
agrees not to attempt to assert or assert, by way of motion or other request
for leave from any such Delaware state or federal court, as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any action, suit or proceeding for the
interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such document, (i) the defense
of sovereign immunity, (ii) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure
to serve process in accordance with this _Section 10.7_, (iii) that it or its
property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any
legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iv) to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law that (A) the suit, action or proceeding in any such court
is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the suit, action or proceeding is not
maintainable in such court, (C) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding
is improper or inappropriate and (D) this Agreement, or the subject matter
hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each of the parties to this
Agreement irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such action or
proceeding shall be heard and determined in such Delaware state or federal
court. The parties agree that a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary expressed or implied in this
Agreement, each party acknowledges and agrees that: (i) an action or
proceeding to enforce or collect upon any order or judgment issued by any of
the courts specified in _Section 10.7(a)_ in any action or proceeding
contemplated by _Section 10.7(a)_ may be brought in any jurisdiction where
such party, or any direct or indirect subsidiary of such party, is located or
has assets; and (ii) each party irrevocably waives any objection to
registration, exequatur, execution, enforcement or collection of any order or
judgment within subclause (i) in any such enforcement or collection action or
proceeding.

(c) EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO

 



71 EXECUTION COPY



 

 INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED
BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO
REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR
PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (iv) EACH PARTY AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 10.7_.

(d) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the
parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached and that any defense in any action
for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate is hereby
waived. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware
Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any state or federal court within the State of Delaware), in addition to any
and all other rights and remedies at law or in equity, and all such rights and
remedies shall be cumulative. Any requirements for the securing or posting of
any bond with such remedy are waived. The parties further agree not to assert
that a remedy of specific performance is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to
Law or inequitable for any reason.

10.8 _Notices_. Unless otherwise set forth herein, any notice, request,
instruction or other document to be given hereunder by any party to the other
parties shall be in writing and shall be deemed duly given (i) upon delivery,
when delivered personally, (ii) one (1) Business Day after being sent by

10.9 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement (including the Annexes,
Exhibits, Company Disclosure Schedule, Parent Disclosure Schedule, and the
Confidentiality Agreement, and the other documents delivered pursuant hereto
and the Confidentiality Agreement) constitutes the entire agreement among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties
hereto, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. There are
no warranties, representations or other agreements between the parties in
connection with the subject matter of this Agreement, except as specifically
set forth in this Agreement. This Agreement and any rights, interests and
obligations hereunder may not be assigned by any of the parties hereto by
operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of each of the
other parties, and any attempted assignment without such consent shall be
void and of no effect, except that Parent may assign all or any of its rights
and obligations hereunder to any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such assignment will relieve Parent
from any of its obligations hereunder.

 



73 EXECUTION COPY



 

10.10 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any rights, benefits or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement;
provided, however, that the rights, benefits and remedies granted to
Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 7.9_ shall inure to the benefit of
and be enforceable by the Indemnified Parties. Notwithstanding the
immediately preceding sentence, following the Effective Time, the provisions
of _Article IV_ relating to the payment of the Merger Consideration shall be
enforceable by holders of certificates.

 

10.11 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in a
manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to
the fullest extent possible.

10.12 _Disclosure Schedules_. The parties hereto agree that any reference in a
particular Section of either the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable,
a disclosure for purposes of) (i) the representations and warranties (or
covenants, as applicable) of the relevant party that are contained in the
corresponding Section of this Agreement and (ii) any other representations
and warranties of such party that is contained in this Agreement (in either
case (i) or (ii), regardless of the absence of an express reference or cross-
reference in a particular Section of this Agreement or a particular
Section of either the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure
Schedule), but only if the relevance of that reference as an exception to (or
a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and warranties would be
reasonably apparent. The disclosure of any matter in any section of either
the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall not be
deemed to constitute an admission or indication by the disclosing party, or to
otherwise imply, that any such matter is material for the purposes of this
Agreement. No party shall use, either individually or in the aggregate, the
fact of the inclusion of any such item or information in any sections of the
Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule in any
disagreement, dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any
obligation, item, information or matter is or is not material, or may give
rise to a change or effect that could have a Company Material Adverse Effect
or a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Nor shall any disclosure on a section be
deemed to constitute an acknowledgment that any such matter is required to be
disclosed. No disclosure on any section relating to a possible breach or
violation of any contract or applicable Law shall be construed as an
admission or indication that any breach or violation exists or has actually
occurred. The disclosure of any matter in any section of either the Company
Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule is not to be treated as
constituting or implying any representation, warranty, assurance or
undertaking by the disclosing party not expressly set out in this Agreement,
nor to

 



74 EXECUTION COPY



 

 be treated as adding to or extending the scope of any of the disclosing
partys representations or warranties in this Agreement.

 

10.13 _Parent Guarantee_. Parent agrees to take all action necessary to cause
Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to comply in all
respects with each of the representations, warranties, covenants, obligations,
agreements and undertakings made or required to be performed by Merger Sub
under this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby. As a material inducement to the Companys willingness to
enter into this Agreement and perform its obligations hereunder, Parent hereby
unconditionally guarantees the due, prompt and faithful performance
and discharge by Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation of each of the
covenants, terms, obligations and undertakings that are required to be
performed by Merger Sub and/or the Surviving Corporation under this Agreement,
the Offer, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
including any such obligations, covenants, terms, conditions and undertakings
that are required to be performed discharged or complied with following the
Control Time and hereby represents, acknowledges and agrees that any breach
of, or other failure to perform, any such representation, warranty, covenant,
obligation, agreement or undertaking of Merger Sub or the Surviving

_ANNEX A_

 

 _Conditions to the Offer_

Capitalized terms used in this Annex A and not otherwise defined herein shall

which it is attached (the " _Agreement_ ").

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer, Merger Sub shall not be
required to accept for payment any shares of Company Common Stock tendered
pursuant to the Offer, and, to the extent permitted by this Agreement, may
amend or terminate the Offer if: (a) there shall not have been validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn immediately prior to the expiration of
the Offer that number of shares of Company Common Stock which represents at
least a majority of the total outstanding shares of Company Common Stock on a
Fully-Diluted Basis, but excluding shares of Company Common Stock tendered in
the Offer pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures as to which delivery has
not been completed as of the applicable time (" _Minimum Condition_ "); (b)
all applicable waiting periods under any applicable Competition Laws shall
not have expired or been earlier terminated prior to the expiration of the
Offer; (c) any other Necessary Consent shall not have been obtained; or (d) at
any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Expiration Date,
any of the following events shall occur and be continuing as of the Expiration
Date:

(i) There shall be pending or overtly threatened any action brought by any
Governmental Entity that is seeking to (A) impose material limitations on the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub to exercise effectively full rights of
ownership of any shares of Company Common Stock, including the right to vote
any shares of Company Common Stock acquired by Merger Sub pursuant to the
Offer or otherwise, on all matters properly presented to the Companys
stockholders, including, without limitation, the adoption of the Agreement
and the approval of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement; (B) obtain
material damages in connection with the Offer or the Merger; (C) impose
material limitations or damages on the operations of the Company or
its Subsidiaries, (D) impose material limitations on Parents ability to
exercise effectively full rights of ownership over the operation of all or a
material portion of Parents or the Companys businesses or assets (whether
held directly or through Subsidiaries), or to compel Parent or the Company to
dispose or hold separate any material portion of the business or assets of
Parent or the Company (whether held directly or through Subsidiaries), in
either instance measured against the Company and its operations, taken as a
whole, or (E) materially delay, restrain, enjoin or otherwise prohibit the
making or consummation of the Offer or the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by _Article II_  or _Article III_ of the Agreement;

(ii) There shall have been (A) any judgment, order or injunction entered
or issued by any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction or (B) any
applicable Law promulgated, enacted, entered, enforced, issued or amended by
any Governmental Entity that would, or is reasonably likely, directly or
indirectly, to result in any of the consequences referred to in clauses (A),
(B), (C), (D) or (E) of clause (i) above;

 



A-1  EXECUTION COPY



 

(iii)(A) the Company shall not have performed and complied in all material
respects with its obligations under this Agreement required to be performed
or complied with at or prior to the Expiration Date and such failure to so
perform and comply has not been cured prior to the scheduled expiration of the
Offer (including any extensions thereof), and (B)(1) the representations and
warranties of the Company contained in the Agreement (other than the
representations and warranties in _Section 5.2_) shall not be true and
correct as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Expiration Date with
the same effect as though made as of the Expiration Date, except (x) that the
accuracy of representations and warranties that by their terms speak as of the
date of the Agreement or some other date will be determined as of such date
and (y) where any such failure of the representations and warranties in the
aggregate to be true and correct would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect (without giving effect to any "materiality" or "Company Material
Adverse Effect" qualifications contained therein); and (2) the representations
and warranties of the Company set forth in _Section 5.2_ shall not be true
and correct in all respects (other than de minimis inaccuracies) as of the
date of this Agreement and as of the Expiration Date;

(iv) a Company Material Adverse Effect shall have occurred since the date of
the Agreement;

(v) a Board Recommendation Change shall have occurred; or

 

(vi) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms;
and

 

(vii) the Company shall not have furnished Parent with a certificate signed on
its behalf by its Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer (solely
in his or her capacity as officers of the Company without personal liability),
attesting as of the Expiration Date, to the absence of the conditions set
forth in items (iii), (iv) and (v) of this _Annex A_. 

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and applicable Law, the
foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub
(except for the Minimum Condition, which is also for the benefit of the
Company) and may, solely to the extent permitted by _Section 2.1_ of this
Agreement, be waived by Parent or Merger Sub, in whole or in part, at any
time and from time to time prior to the Expiration Date, at the sole
discretion of Parent or Merger Sub.
