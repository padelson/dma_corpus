**Closing Date** "). Closing signatures may be transmitted by facsimile.

  

## 

  

## 1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of
the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable
provisions of the CGCL, as applicable. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the property,

the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of
the Surviving Corporation.

  

## 

  

## 1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_. (a) At the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation of the Merger Sub shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation.

  

## 

  

### (b) Also at the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Merger Sub shall be the
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

  

### 

  

## 1.5 _Effect on Capital Stock_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and this
Agreement and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or
the holders of any of the following securities, the following shall occur:

  

## 

  

### (a) _Conversion of Company Capital Stock_. Each share of Company
Common Stock, each share of Company Preferred Stock (collectively, the "
**Company Capital Stock** ") and each vested Company Option (subject to the
provisions of Section 5.18) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (excluding shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.5(b)
and Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 1.13) will as of the Closing Date
be automatically converted into the right to receive that amount of cash
determined by multiplying the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration by
the number of shares of Company Capital Stock held by each
Company stockholder and holder of vested Company Options (subject to the

  



        
   

  



  

### provisions of Section 5.18), determined on an as-converted and as-
exercised basis, _provided, that,_ in all circumstances, the following
provisions shall apply:

  

### 

  

##### (A) " **Per Share Merger Consideration** " means an amount, expressed
in dollars and cents, equal to the Total Merger Consideration, divided by the
sum of (i) the total number of shares of Company Capital Stock and shares
underlying vested Company Options ((subject to the provisions of Section
5.18), determined on an as-converted and as-exercised basis, issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding shares to be
canceled pursuant to Section 1.5(b)), plus (ii) the number of shares of
Company Capital Stock issuable upon exercise of all unvested Company Options
and unexercised Company Warrants outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, determined using the Treasury Method, which, as of the date
hereof, is estimated to be Six Dollars ($6.00). If the Per Share
Merger Consideration determined as provided above _plus_ any pro-rata
amounts deducted for application to the Escrow Cash or the Representative
Account, is less than Six Dollars ($6.00), then the aggregate Per Share
Merger Consideration payable to the holders of the Companys Capital Stock
(other than holders of the Companys Series E Preferred Stock) and holders of
vested Company Options (subject to the provisions of Section 5.18) shall be
reduced by the minimum amount necessary and allocated to the Per Share
Merger Consideration payable to holders of the Companys Series E Preferred
Stock so that the Per Share Merger Consideration _plus_ any pro-rata
amounts deducted for application to the Escrow Cash or the Representative
Account, payable to the holders of the Companys Series E Preferred Stock
equals Six Dollars ($6.00), and the Per Share Merger Consideration payable to
holders of the Companys Capital Stock (other than holders of the Companys
Series E Preferred Stock) and holders of vested Company Options (subject to
the provisions of Section 5.18) shall be reduced accordingly.

  

##### 

  

##### (B) " **Treasury Method** " shall mean the treasury stock method which
assumes that all outstanding "in the money" Company Options and unexercised
Company Warrants to be assumed by Parent are exercised, with the proceeds
from such exercises being used to purchase as many shares of Company Capital
Stock as possible, at the estimated Per Share Merger Consideration
(including, for this purpose, the allocable share of cash deposited as part
of the Escrow Cash and in the Representative Account) of Six Dollars ($6.00).

  

##### 

  

##### (C) " **Statement of Expenses** " shall have the meaning ascribed to
such term in Section 5.22.

  



        
   

  



  

##### (D) " **Total Indebtedness** " shall mean $16,000,000.

  

##### 

  

##### (E) " **Total Merger Consideration** " shall mean $265,000,000 _less_
Total Indebtedness and the amount of the Company Third Party Expenses as
reflected on the Statement of Expenses.

  

##### 

  

### (b) _Cancellation of Treasury and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share
of Company Capital Stock held by the Company or owned by Merger Sub, Parent
or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company or of
Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
extinguished without any conversion or payment in respect thereof.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Stock Options_.

  

### 

  

#### (i) Each vested Company Stock Option then outstanding under the
Companys 1994 Stock Incentive Plan and 2001 Equity Incentive Plan (the
**"Company Stock Option Plans"** ) shall be converted into the right to
receive, with respect to each share of Company Capital Stock issuable
pursuant to such Company Stock Option, the applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration payable to holders of Common Stock, less any amounts that would
have been payable by the holder of such Company Stock Option to the Company,
or required to be withheld by the Company, upon the exercise of such Company
Stock Option with respect to such share of Company Capital Stock.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) All unvested options to purchase Company Common Stock outstanding
at the Effective Time under the Companys Stock Option Plans shall be
exchanged for options to purchase Parent Common Stock in accordance with
Section 5.18.

  

#### 

  

### (d) _Warrants_. All unexercised Company Warrants outstanding at the
Effective Time, provided they have been amended in a manner
reasonably acceptable to Parent, shall be assumed by Parent in accordance
with Section 5.18, and all holders of Company Warrants shall thereafter have
the right to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, no par
value, of Merger Sub (the " **Merger Sub Common Stock** ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock,
no par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.  Each certificate
evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall evidence
ownership of such shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

### 

  

## 1.6 _Surrender of Certificates_. (a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall designate a United States bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent (the "
**Exchange Agent** ") in the Merger.

  

## 

  

### (b) _Exchange Procedures_. At the later of (i) the Effective Time
and (ii) three (3) Business Days following the Closing, Parent shall cause to
be mailed to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates (the "
**Certificates** ") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock, (A) a letter of transmittal (the
" **Letter of Transmittal** ") which shall specify that delivery of
Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange

  



        
   

  



  

### Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent
may specify and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration.
Upon delivery of a Letter of Transmittal to the Exchange Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, together with
surrender of a Certificate (or Certificates) for cancellation, the holder of
Company Common Stock shall be entitled to receive in exchange cash
constituting the Per Share Merger Consideration to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 1.5 (less the cash to be deposited with the
Escrow Agent on such holders behalf) and the Certificate(s) so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, each
outstanding Certificate that, prior to the Effective Time, represented shares
of Company Capital Stock will be deemed from and after the Effective Time,
for all corporate purposes, to evidence only the right to receive the
applicable Per Share Merger Consideration provided for in this Article I.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Parent to Provide Parent Cash_. On the Closing Date, Parent shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this Section
1.6 the Total Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.5 in
exchange for all outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock, all shares
underlying vested Company Options (subject to the provisions of Section 5.18)
and shares issued pursuant to exercised Company Warrants pursuant to Section
6.3(g); provided, however, that, on behalf of the Companys stockholders,
Parent shall deposit a portion of the Total Merger Consideration otherwise
payable to each stockholder to (i) the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 1.10
and Article VII in an amount equal to $19,875,000 and (ii) to the
Representative Account pursuant to Section 1.11(b)(ii) in the amount of
$2,000,000.

  

### 

  

### (d) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 1.6, none of the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock
or Company Capital Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Required Withholding_. Each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or
former holder of Company Capital Stock such amounts as are required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " **Code** "),or under any provision of state, local or foreign
tax law or under any other applicable legal requirement. To the extent such
amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid.

  

### 

  

## 1.7 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. All cash issued
in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Capital
Stock and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records
of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Capital Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.  If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article
I.

  



        
   

  



  

## 1.8 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that
any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, that the shares of
Company Capital Stock formerly represented by such Certificates were
converted into the right to receive applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration; provided, however, that, as a condition precedent to the
issuance of such cash, the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates shall indemnify Parent against any claim that may be made
against Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to the Certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  

## 

  

## 1.9 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time
after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving
Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the
officers and directors of the Company and Merger Sub will take all such
lawful and necessary action.

  

## 

  

## 1.10 _Escrow_. As the sole remedy for the indemnity obligations set forth
in Article VII, at the Closing the parties shall deposit $19,875,000 in cash
(such cash, together with all earnings thereon is referred to as the "
**Escrow Cash** ") of the Total Merger Consideration, deducted from the Total
Merger Consideration otherwise payable to each of the Companys stockholders
on a pro-rata basis, to be held during the period ending one year from the
Effective Date (" **Escrow Period** "), all in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Escrow Agreement in the form annexed hereto as _Exhibit A_
(the " **Escrow Agreement** "), to be entered into at the Closing between
Parent, the Representative (as defined in Section 1.11(b)) (who shall be
designated by the Company in writing prior to the Effective Date, until
a successor is appointed pursuant to Section 1.11(b)) and Continental Stock
Transfer and Trust Company (" **Continental** "), as Escrow Agent. Subject
to Article VII, on the first business day following the conclusion of the
Escrow Period, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the Escrow Cash, less any such
amounts applied in satisfaction of a claim for indemnification and any
amounts reserved against pending claims related to the indemnification
obligations set forth in Article VII, to each of the Companys former
stockholders, after giving effect to the Merger (" **Former Stockholders** ")
in the same proportions as initially deposited in escrow. The remaining
Escrow Cash, to the extent not applied in satisfaction of a claim
for indemnification, or so reserved, will be distributed to such Persons
promptly upon resolution of the dispute or claim.  

  

## 

  

## 1.11 _Committee and Representative for Purposes of Escrow Agreement_. (a)
_Parent Committee_. Prior to the Closing, the Board of Directors of Parent
shall appoint a committee consisting of one of its then members to act on
behalf of Parent to take all necessary actions and make all
decisions pursuant to the Escrow Agreement regarding Parents right to
indemnification pursuant to Article VII hereof. In the event of a vacancy in
such committee, the Board of Directors of Parent shall appoint as a successor
a Person who was a director of Parent prior to the Closing Date or some other
Person who would qualify as an "independent" director of Parent and who has
not had any relationship with the Company prior to the Closing. Such
committee is intended to be the "Committee" referred to in Article VII hereof
and the Escrow Agreement.

  



        
   

  



  

### (b) _Stockholders  Representative_.

  

### 

  

#### (i) In order to administer efficiently (i) the implementation of the
Agreement on behalf of the Former Stockholders and (ii) the settlement of any
dispute with respect to the Agreement, the Company shall, prior to the
Effective Time, designate one to three Persons to act as a representative on
behalf of the Former Stockholders (collectively, the " **Representative** ").
By approving this Agreement, the Companys stockholders authorize and empower
the Company to make such designation, approve and ratify all of the rights,
powers and authorities provided to the Representative under the terms of this
Agreement, and agree to be bound by all decisions and other actions taken by
the Representative

  

#### 

  

#### (ii)  In order to reimburse the Representative for its fees and costs,
and to fund any costs of defense of any claims by the Parent Indemnitees
under Article VII at the Closing the Parent, at the direction of the
Company, shall deposit $2,000,000 in cash of the Total Merger
Consideration otherwise payable to each of the Companys stockholders on a
pro-rata basis with a financial institution identified by the Company to
Parent in writing prior to the Closing (the " **Representative Account**
"), to be held until the Escrow Period has terminated and no further claims
remain outstanding under Article VII or the Escrow Agreement. The funds in
the Representative Account shall bear interest, and such funds together with
any interest thereon, less the fees and costs of the Representative, and any
fees or costs incurred to fund costs of defense for any claims by the Parent
Indemnitees under Article VII, shall, following Closing, be returned to each
of the Former Stockholders in the same proportions as initially deposited in
the Representative Account. The Representative is hereby granted
the authority to seek reimbursement from the Representative Account for
its fees and costs, and to fund any costs of defense of any claims by the
Parent Indemnitees under Article VII. In no event shall Parent or any Parent
Indemnitees have any rights or recourse to the Representative Account, either
for claims under Article VII or otherwise. In no event shall the Parent or
Parent Indemnitees have any responsibility or obligation with respect to
the Representative Account other than to deposit the $2,000,000 referred to
above therein.

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) From and after the Effective Time, the Former Stockholders hereby
authorize the Representative (i) to take all action necessary in connection
with the implementation of the Agreement on behalf of the Former Stockholders
or the settlement of any dispute, including, without limitation, with regard
to matters pertaining to the indemnification provisions of this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement, (ii) to give and receive all notices required to be
given under the Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and (iii) to take any and
all additional action as is contemplated to be taken by or on behalf of the
Former Stockholders by the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) If no Representative is ever appointed or if any Representative
dies, becomes legally incapacitated or resigns from such position, another
Person designated by the remaining Representatives, or if none remain, by the
Former Stockholders holding the right to receive more than 50% in interest of
the Escrow Cash (the " **Requisite Former Stockholders** "), who shall be
identified to Parent as soon as practicable, shall fill such vacancy and
shall be deemed to be the Representative for all purposes of this Agreement;
provided, however, that no change in the Representative shall be effective
until Parent is given written notice of such change. If no Representative is
then currently serving, the Representative shall be deemed to be the
Requisite Former Stockholders.

  



        
   

  



  

#### (v) All decisions and actions by the Representative as provided in this
Section 1.11 or under the Escrow Agreement shall be binding upon all of the
Former Stockholders, and no Former Stockholder shall have the right to
object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.

  

#### 

  

#### (vi) By their execution and/or approval of this Agreement and the
Merger, the Company and its stockholders agree that:

  

#### 

  

##### (A) Parent shall be able to rely conclusively on the instructions and
decisions of the Representative as to any actions required or permitted to be
taken by the Representative hereunder and under the Escrow Agreement, and no
party hereunder shall have any cause of action against Parent for any action
taken by Parent in reliance upon the instructions or decisions of the
Representative;

  

##### 

  

##### (B) all actions, decisions and instructions of the Representative shall
be conclusive and binding upon all of the Former Stockholders and no Former
Stockholder shall have any cause of action against the Representative for any
action taken, decision made or instruction given by the Representative under
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, except for fraud or willful breach of
this Agreement by the Representative; and

  

##### 

  

##### (C) the provisions of this Section 1.11 are independent and severable,
shall constitute an irrevocable power of attorney, coupled with an interest
and surviving death, granted by the Former Stockholders to the Representative
and shall be binding upon the executors, heirs, legal representatives and
successors of each Former Stockholder.

  

##### 

  

##### (D) All fees and expenses, including, without limitation, all
attorneys fees and expenses incurred in connection with defending or
settling any claim by Parent under this Agreement, and any amounts under
subsection (E) below, incurred by the Representative shall be paid by the
Former Stockholders out of the Representative Account.

  

##### 

  

##### (E) In taking any action hereunder and under the Escrow Agreement, the
Representative shall be protected in relying upon any notice, paper or other
document reasonably believed by it to be genuine, or upon any evidence
reasonably deemed by it, in its good faith judgment, to be sufficient;
provided, however, that the Representative shall not waive any rights with
respect to any individual Former Stockholder(s) interest(s) if such waiver
would have the effect of disproportionately and adversely affecting such
individual Former Stockholders(s) as compared to the interests of the other
Former Stockholders, without the prior consent of the

  



        
   

  



  

##### affected Former Stockholder(s). The Representative shall not be liable
to Parent or the Former Stockholders for any act performed or omitted to be
performed by it in the good faith exercise of its duties and shall be liable
only in the case of fraud or willful breach of this Agreement by the
Representative. The Representative may consult with counsel in connection
with its duties hereunder and shall be fully protected in any act taken,
suffered or permitted by it in good faith in accordance with the advice of
counsel. The Representative shall not be responsible for determining or
verifying the authority of any person acting or purporting to act on behalf
of any party to this Agreement. If the Representative requires
liability errors and omissions insurance as a condition to accepting the role
of Representative, the premium cost shall be reimbursed from the
Representative Account. If the funds in the Representative Account have been
exhausted, Representative may resign without liability to the
Former Stockholders.

  

##### 

  

## 1.12 _Notice to Holders of Derivative Securities_. As promptly as
practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the Company, after
consultation with Parent, shall give the holders of Company Options and
Company Warrants any required notices pursuant to the terms thereof.

  

## 

  

## 1.13 _Shares Subject to Appraisal Rights_. (a)  Notwithstanding any
provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, Dissenting Shares (as
hereinafter defined) shall not be entitled to receive their Per Share Merger
Consideration and the holders thereof shall be entitled only to such rights
as are granted by the CGCL. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes
entitled to payment for such shares pursuant to the CGCL shall receive
payment therefor from the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the CGCL,
provided, however, that (i) if any stockholder of the Company who asserts
appraisal rights in connection with the Merger (a **"Dissenter** ") shall have
failed to establish his entitlement to such rights as provided in the CGCL,
or (ii) if any such Dissenter shall have effectively withdrawn his demand for
payment for such shares or waived or lost his right to payment for his shares
under the appraisal rights process under the CGCL, the shares of Company
Common Stock held by such Dissenter shall be treated as if they had been
converted, as of the Effective Time, into a right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration (net of the pro rata amounts deposited in the Escrow
Account and the Representative Account) as provided in Section 1.5, and the
right to participate pro rata in distributions of any remaining amounts of
Escrow Cash and amounts in the Representative Account. The Company shall give
Parent prompt notice of any demands for payment received by the Company from
a person asserting appraisal rights, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make
any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

  

## 

  

### (b) As used herein, " **Dissenting Shares** " means any shares of Company
Common Stock held by stockholders of the Company who are entitled to
appraisal rights under the CGCL, and who have properly exercised, perfected
and not subsequently withdrawn or lost or waived their rights to demand
payment with respect to their shares in accordance with the CGCL.

(i) liabilities provided for in or otherwise disclosed in Parent SEC Reports
filed prior to the date hereof, and (ii) liabilities incurred since January

## 

  

## 5.8 _Confidentiality; Access to Information_. (a) _Confidentiality_. Any
confidentiality agreement previously executed by the parties shall be
superseded in its entirety by the provisions of this Agreement. Each party
agrees to maintain in confidence any non-public information received from the

operations and personnel of the Company, as Parent may reasonably request. No
information or knowledge obtained by Parent in any investigation pursuant to
this Section 5.8 will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty contained herein or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
to consummate the Merger.

  

### 

  

#### (ii) Parent will afford the Company and its financial advisors,
underwriters, accountants, counsel and other representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the

(a) All rights to indemnification for acts or omissions occurring through the
Closing Date now existing in favor of the current directors and officers of
Parent as provided in the Charter Documents of Parent or in any
indemnification agreements shall survive the Merger and shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

  

## 

  

### (b) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, Parent shall
cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance maintained by Parent (or policies of at least

less advantageous) with respect to claims arising from facts and events that
occurred prior to the Closing Date.

  

### 

  

### (c) If Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with
or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
entity of such consolidation or

  



        
   

  



  

### merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such case, to the extent
necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of Parent assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.9.

  

### 

  

### (d) The provisions of this Section 5.9 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Person who will have been a director or
officer of Parent for all periods ending on or before the Closing Date and
may not be changed without the consent of Committee referred to in Section
1.11(a).

  

### 

  

## 5.10 _Public Disclosure_. From the date of this Agreement until Closing or
termination, the parties shall cooperate in good faith to jointly prepare all
press releases and public announcements pertaining to this Agreement and the
transactions governed by it, and no party shall issue or otherwise make
any public announcement or communication pertaining to this Agreement or
the transaction without the prior consent of Parent (in the case of the
Company) or the Company (in the case of Parent), except as required by any
legal requirement or by the rules and regulations of, or pursuant to any
agreement of a stock exchange or trading system. Each party will not
unreasonably withhold approval from the others with respect to any press
release or public announcement.  If any party determines with the advice of
counsel that it is required to make this Agreement and the terms of the
transaction public or otherwise issue a press release or make public
disclosure with respect thereto, it shall, at a reasonable time before making
any public disclosure, consult with the other party regarding such
disclosure, seek such confidential treatment for such terms or portions of
this Agreement or the transaction as may be reasonably requested by the other
party and disclose only such information as is legally compelled to be
disclosed. This provision will not apply to communications by any party to
its counsel, accountants and other professional advisors.  Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the parties hereto agree that promptly as practicable after
the execution of this Agreement, Parent will file with the SEC a Current
Report on Form 8-K pursuant to the Exchange Act to report the execution of
this Agreement, with respect to which Parent shall consult with the Company.
Parent shall provide to Company for review and comment a draft of the Current
Report on Form 8-K prior to filing with the SEC; provided that
unless objected to by the Company by written notice given to Parent within
two (2) days after delivery to the Company specifying the language to which
reasonable objection is taken, any language included in such Current Report
shall be deemed to have been approved by the Company and may be filed with
SEC and used in other filings made by Parent with the SEC.

  

## 

  

## 5.11 _Reasonable Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using
commercially reasonable efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the taking
of all reasonable acts necessary to cause the conditions precedent set forth
in Article VI to be satisfied, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions,
waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental
Entities and the making of all necessary registrations, declarations and
filings (including registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental
Entities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary
to avoid any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding by any
Governmental Entity, (iii) the

  



        
   

  



  

## obtaining of all consents, approvals or waivers from third parties
required as a result of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement,
including without limitation the consents referred to in the
Company Schedule, (iv) the defending of any suits, claims, actions,
investigations or proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including seeking to have any stay or temporary
restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated
or reversed and (v) the execution or delivery of any additional instruments
reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to
fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. In connection with and
without limiting the foregoing, Parent and its board of directors and the
Company and its board of directors shall, if any state takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Merger, this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to enable the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement.  Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to
require Parent or the Company to agree to any divestiture by itself or any of
its affiliates of shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or
property, or the imposition of any material limitation on the ability of any
of them to conduct their business or to own or exercise control of such
assets, properties and stock.

  

## 

  

## 5.12 _Certain Claims_. As additional consideration for the issuance of the
Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement, each of
the Company stockholders hereby releases and forever discharges, effective as
of the Closing Date, the Company and its directors, officers, employees
and agents, from any and all rights, claims, demands, judgments,
obligations, liabilities and damages, whether accrued or unaccrued, asserted
or unasserted, and whether known or unknown arising out of or resulting from
such stockholders (i) status as a holder of an equity interest in the
Company; and (ii) employment, service, consulting or other similar agreement
entered into with the Company prior to Closing, to the extent that the bases
for claims under any such agreement that survives the Closing arise prior to
the Closing, provided, however, the foregoing shall not release any
obligations of Parent set forth in this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.

  

## 

  

## 5.13 _No Securities Transactions_. Neither the Company nor any of
its affiliates, directly or indirectly, shall engage in any transactions
involving the securities of Parent prior to the time of the making of a
public announcement of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Company shall use its best efforts to require each of its officers,
directors, employees, agents, representatives and stockholders to comply with
the foregoing requirement.

  

##

to return to its stockholders the amounts being held in the Trust Fund.
Accordingly, the sole remedy for any claim by the Company against Parent or
the Merger Sub, or Parent or Merger Sub against the Company, for any monetary
claims or otherwise, for any reason whatsoever, including but not limited to
a breach of this Agreement by

  



        
   

  



  

## any party or any negotiations, agreements or understandings in connection
herewith (other than as a result of the Merger, pursuant to which the Company
and its stockholders will have the right to recover the Total Merger
Consideration from monies in the Trust Fund, from the Escrow Cash or
otherwise) shall be as set forth in Section 8.2.

  

## 

  

## 5.16 _Disclosure of Certain Matters_. Each of Parent and the Company will
provide the other with prompt written notice of any event, development or
condition that (a) would cause any of such partys representations and
warranties to become untrue or misleading or which may affect its ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) had it
existed or been known on the date hereof would have been required to be
disclosed under this Agreement, (c) gives such party any reason to believe
that any of the conditions set forth in Article VI will not be satisfied, (d)
is of a nature that is or may be materially adverse to the operations,
prospects or condition (financial or otherwise) of Parent or the Company, or
(e) would require any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement.  The
parties shall have the right and obligation to supplement or amend the
Company Schedule and Parent Schedule (the " **Disclosure Schedules** ") being
delivered pursuant to this Agreement with respect to any matter arising or
discovered after delivery thereof which, if existing or known at the date of
this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in the
Disclosure Schedules.  The obligations of the parties to amend or supplement
the Disclosure Schedules being delivered herewith shall terminate on the
Closing Date. Notwithstanding any such amendment or supplementation, for
purposes of Sections 2.2(a) and 2.3(a), and 3.1(c), the representations and
warranties of the parties shall be made with reference to the Disclosure
Schedules as they exist at the time of delivery of the Disclosure Schedules
in accordance with Section 5.23, subject to such anticipated changes as are
set forth in Schedule 4.1 or otherwise expressly contemplated by this
Agreement or which are set forth in the Disclosure Schedules as they exist on
the date of delivery thereof in accordance with Section 5.23.

  

## 

  

## 5.17 _No Solicitation_. (a)  The Company will not, and will cause its
affiliates, employees, agents and representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, solicit or enter into discussions or transactions with, or
encourage, or provide any information to, any corporation, partnership or
other entity or group (other than Parent and its designees) concerning any
merger, sale of ownership interests and/or assets of the Company,
recapitalization or similar transaction (an " **Acquisition Proposal** "),
provided that this Section 5.17 shall not prohibit (i) negotiations with, and
the provision of information to, any other person in connection with a
superior Acquisition Proposal by such other person or (ii) recommending any
superior Acquisition Proposal with such other person to the shareholders of
the Company (which shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement), if the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith after consultation
with counsel that failure to take such actions could reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with their fiduciary obligations under applicable law.

  

## 

  

### (b) Parent will not, and will cause its employees, agents and
representatives not to, directly or indirectly, solicit or enter into
discussions or transactions with, or encourage, or provide any information
to, any corporation, partnership or other entity or group (other than the
Company and its designees) concerning any merger, purchase of ownership
interests and/or assets, recapitalization or similar transaction.

  



        
   

  



  

### (c) The Company shall promptly advise Parent of the nature of any written
offer, proposal or indication of interest that is submitted to the Company
and the identity of the Person making such written offer, proposal or
indication of interest.

  

### 

  

## 5.18 _Stock Options and Warrants_. (a) At the Effective Time, the
Companys obligations with respect to each outstanding unvested Company
Option (and unexercised vested option, subject to the provisions of this
Section 5.18) and unexercised Company Warrant (if amended in a
manner reasonably acceptable to Parent) will be assumed by Parent, and Parent
shall thereafter be obligated to issue Parent Common Stock upon exercise
thereof. Each Company Warrant shall be exercisable on the terms, and into the
number of shares of the Parent Common Stock, as set forth in the Company
Warrant as so amended.  Each Company Option so assumed by Parent under this
Agreement shall be subject to the same terms and conditions set forth in
Companys Stock Option Plans as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and (i) such Company Option will be exercisable for that number of
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of Shares of
Company Common Stock that were purchasable under such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock,
and (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Option will be equal to the
quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock at which such Company Option was exercisable immediately prior
to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting
exercise price up to the nearest whole cent. Following the Effective Time,
Parent will send to each holder of an assumed Company Option a written notice
setting forth (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that are
subject to such assumed Company Option, and (ii) the exercise price per share
of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Option.
In addition, if Parent has not filed a registration statement on Form S-8
registering the exercise of any Company Options assumed by Parent pursuant to
this Section 5.18 prior to Closing, Parent shall file such registration
statement with the SEC on the 90th day following the Closing (to the extent
the exercise of such options is eligible to be registered using a Form S-8
registration statement). The " **Exchange Ratio** " shall be determined such
that (a) the aggregate intrinsic value of the new Parent Options is not
greater than the aggregate intrinsic value of the Company Options immediately
prior to the assumption and (b) the ratio of the exercise price per option to
market value per share is unchanged. The parties agree that Parent will
permit holders of vested Company Options to elect, on an individual basis, to
either exercise such Company Options and participate in the Merger or have
those Company Options assumed, on the same basis as the unvested Company
Options, by the Parent, unless there are, in the sole judgment and discretion
of Parent, significant tax, accounting or securities laws issues (including
any requirement of registering on a Form other than S-8) with treating
vested options identically to unvested options.  The parties will make such
determination on or before April 30, 2006.

  

## 

  

### (b) Parent will reserve sufficient shares of Parent Common Stock for
issuance under this Section 5.18.

  

### 

  

## 5.19 _Benefit Arrangements_. Parent agrees that all employees of
the Company who continue employment with Parent or any subsidiary of Parent
after the Effective Time (" **Continuing Employees** ") shall be eligible to
continue to participate in the Companys health,

  



        
   

  



  

## vacation, welfare and retirement benefit plans; provided, however, that
(i) nothing in this Section 5.19 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit
the right of Parent to amend or terminate any such benefit plan or
arrangement at any time, and (ii) if Parent terminates any such plan, then
(upon expiration of any appropriate transition period), the Continuing
Employees shall be eligible to participate in Parents benefit plans and
vacation policies, in each case to the same extent as employees of Parent in
similar positions and at compensation grade levels. Continuing Employees shall
receive credit for service time as an employee of the Company for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting, and eligibility to receive benefits
under any such Parent benefit plan and for purposes of vacation accrual for
service accrued or deemed accrued prior to the Effective Time.
 Additionally, any life, health and disability benefits available
to Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents under Parents benefit
plans shall not be subject to any insurability requirement or pre-existing
condition exclusion that would not apply to the corresponding benefit
provided under a plan maintained by the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Parent shall further provide each Continuing Employee with
credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time
for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs in satisfying any
applicable deductibles or out-of-pocket requirements under corresponding
Parent benefit plans. Nothing in this Section 5.19 or elsewhere in this
Agreement, shall be construed to create a right in any employee to continuing
employment.

  

## 

  

## 5.20 _Company Actions_. The Company shall use its best efforts to take
such actions as are necessary to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement
and to enable Parent and Merger Sub to fulfill its obligations hereunder.

  

## 

  

## 5.21 _Financing_. The Company agrees to provide, and will cause its
directors, officers and employees to provide, all cooperation reasonably
necessary in connection with the arrangement of financing to be consummated
contemporaneously with or at or after the expiration of the Effective Time in
respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
participation in meetings, due diligence sessions, road shows, the
preparation of offering memoranda, private placement memoranda, prospectuses
and similar documents, the execution and delivery of any commitment letters,
placement agreements, pledge and security documents, other definitive
financing documents, or other requested certificates or documents, audited
and unaudited financial statements, comfort letters of accountants and legal
opinions as may be reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub and taking
such other actions as are reasonably required to be taken by the Company in
connection with any financing, providing that such cooperation shall not
interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company and the
Company shall not be required to incur material incremental out-of-pocket
costs in respect of such cooperation unless Parent shall have undertaken to
reimburse the Company all such reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs.

  

## 

  

## 5.22 _Fees and Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated,
all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger including,
without limitation, all legal, accounting, financial advisory, consulting and
all other fees and expenses of third parties incurred by a party in
connection with the negotiation and effectuation of the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (" **Third Party
Expenses** "), shall be the obligation of the respective party incurring such
fees and expenses. The Company shall provide Parent with a statement of
estimated Third Party Expenses incurred by the Company (" **Company Third
Party Expenses** ") at least five (5) business days prior to the

  



        
   

  



  

## Closing Date in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent (the " **Statement
of Expenses** "). Any Company Third Party Expense in excess of the Company
Third Party Expenses reflected on the Statement of Expenses used to reduce
the Total Merger Consideration (" **Excess Third Party Expenses** "), shall
be subject to the indemnification provisions of Article VII and shall not be
subject to the Basket. Third Party Expenses shall not be incurred by the
Company after the Closing Date without the express prior written consent
of Parent

  

## 

  

## 5.23 _Company Schedule_. The Company shall deliver to Parent the Company
Schedule on or before the expiration of five (5) business days following the
date of this Agreement, which Company Schedule shall be satisfactory to
Parent in its reasonable discretion

  

## 

  

## 5.24 _Company Warrants_. Promptly following the date hereof, the Parent
and the Company shall meet and confer for the purpose of determining
the terms and conditions of the form of amendment to the Company Warrants
that will be reasonably acceptable to the Parent, and the Company will use
its reasonable best efforts on or before April 30, 2006 to obtain the
requisite approval of holders of the Company Warrants for approval of
amendment or their election to exercise the Company Warrants effective on or
before the Closing

 **ARTICLE VII**

  



  

 **INDEMNIFICATION**

  



  

## 7.1 _Indemnification_. (a)  Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Article VII (including, without limitation, the limitations set forth in
Section 7.4), Parent and the Surviving Corporation and their respective
representatives, successors and permitted assigns (the " **Parent
Indemnitees** ") shall have the right to recover from the Escrow Agent out of
the Escrow Cash, any and all Losses asserted against, resulting to, imposed
upon, or incurred by any Parent Indemnitee by reason of, arising out of or
resulting from:

  

## 

  

#### (i) the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty of
Company contained in Article II of this Agreement, or any certificate
delivered by the Company to Parent pursuant to this Agreement in connection
with the Closing;

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) the non-fulfillment or breach of any covenant or agreement of the
Company contained in this Agreement; and

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) any claim made by a Dissenter for an appraisal of the value
of such Dissenting Shares pursuant to, and in accordance with, the provisions
of the CGCL; provided, however, that in no event shall Parent be entitled
to recover Losses for Dissenter claims from more than five percent (5%) of
the shares of any class of securities of the Company outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

  

#### 

  

### (b) As used in this Article VII, the term " **Losses** " shall include
all losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, orders, penalties,
settlements, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, interest,
penalties, court costs and reasonable legal fees and expenses) including
those arising from any demands, claims, suits, actions, costs of
investigation, notices of violation or noncompliance, causes of action,
proceedings and assessments whether or not made by third parties or whether
or not ultimately determined to be valid. Solely for the purpose of
determining the amount of any Losses (and not for determining any breach) for
which any party may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Article VII,
any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement that is qualified
by a term or terms such as "material," "materially," or "Material Adverse
Effect" shall be deemed made or given without such qualification and without
giving effect to such words. Losses shall not be reduced by any

  



        
   

  



  

### Tax benefits recognized by Parent as a result of the Losses nor by any
insurance purchased by Parent to indemnify it for breaches of representations
and warranties under this Agreement.

  

### 

  

## 7.2 _Indemnification of Third Party Claims_. The
indemnification obligations and liabilities under this Article VII with
respect to actions, proceedings, lawsuits, investigations, demands or other
claims brought against Parent by a Person other than the Company (a " **Third
Party Claim** ") shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:

  

## 

  

### (a) _Notice of Claim_. Parent, acting through the Committee, will give
the Representative prompt written notice after receiving written notice
of any Third Party Claim or discovering the liability, obligation or facts
giving rise to such Third Party Claim (a " **Notice of Claim** ") which
Notice of Third Party Claim shall set forth (i) a brief description of the
nature of the Third Party Claim, (ii) the total amount of the actual out-of-
pocket Loss or the anticipated potential Loss (including any costs
or expenses which have been or may be reasonably incurred in
connection therewith), and (iii) whether such Loss may be covered (in whole
or in part) under any insurance and the estimated amount of such Loss which
may be covered under such insurance, and the Representative shall be entitled
to participate in the defense of Third Party Claim at its expense.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Defense_. The Representative shall have the right, at its option
(subject to the limitations set forth in subsection 7.2(c) below) at its own
expense, by written notice to Parent, to assume the entire control
of, subject to the right of Parent to participate (at its expense and with
counsel of its choice) in, the defense, compromise or settlement of the Third
Party Claim as to which such Notice of Claim has been given, and shall be
entitled to appoint a recognized and reputable counsel reasonably acceptable
to Parent to be the lead counsel in connection with such defense. If the
Representative elects to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim:

  

### 

  

#### (i) the Representative shall diligently and in good faith defend such
Third Party Claim and shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status of
such defense; provided, however, that in the case of any settlement providing
for remedies other than monetary damages for which indemnification is
provided, Parent shall have the right to approve the settlement, which
approval will not be unreasonably withheld; and

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) Parent shall cooperate fully in all respects with the
Representative in any such defense, compromise or settlement thereof,
including, without limitation, the selection of counsel, and Parent shall
make available to the Representative all pertinent information and documents
under its control.

  

#### 

  

### (c) _Limitations of Right to Assume Defense_. The Representative
shall not be entitled to assume control of such defense if (i) the Third
Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding,
action, indictment, allegation or investigation; (ii) the Third Party Claim
seeks an injunction or equitable relief against Parent; or (iii) there is a
reasonable probability that a Third Party Claim may materially and adversely
affect Parent other than as a result of money damages or other money
payments.

  



        
   

  



  

### (d) _Other Limitations_. Failure to give prompt Notice of Claim or
to provide copies of relevant available documents or to furnish relevant
available data shall not affect the Representatives duty or obligations
under this Article VII, except to the extent (and only to the extent that)
such failure shall have adversely affected the ability of the Representative
to defend against or reduce any liability or caused or increased such
liability or otherwise caused the damages claimed by Parent to be greater
than such damages would have been had Parent given the Representative prompt
notice hereunder. So long as the Representative is defending any such action
actively and in good faith, Parent shall not settle such action. Parent shall
make available to the Representative all relevant records and other
relevant materials required by them and in the possession or under the
control of Parent, for the use of the Representative and its representatives
in defending any such action, and shall in other respects give reasonable
cooperation in such defense.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Failure to Defend_. If the Representative, promptly after receiving
a Notice of Claim, fails to defend such Third Party Claim actively and in
good faith, Parent will (upon further written notice) have the right
to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim
as it may determine in its reasonable discretion, provided that the
Representative shall have the right to approve any settlement, which approval
will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

### 

  

### (f) _Parent s Rights_. Anything in this Section 7.2 to the
contrary notwithstanding, the Representative shall not, without the written
consent of Parent, settle or compromise any action or consent to the entry of
any judgment which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the
giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to Parent of a full and unconditional
release from all liability and obligation in respect of such action without
any payment by Parent.

  

### 

  

### (g) _Representative Consent_. Unless the Representative has consented to
a settlement of a Third Party Claim, the amount of the settlement shall not
be a binding determination of the amount of the Loss and such amount shall
be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow Agreement,
if applicable.

  

### 

  

## 7.3 _Insurance Effect_. To the extent that any Losses that are subject to
indemnification pursuant to this Article VII are covered by insurance other
than any insurance purchased by Parent to indemnify it for breaches of
representations and warranties under this Agreement, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the maximum recovery under
such insurance; provided that Parent shall nevertheless be entitled to bring
a claim for indemnification under this Article VII in respect of such Losses
and the time limitations set forth in Section 7.4 hereof for bringing a claim
of indemnification under this Agreement shall be tolled during the pendency
of such insurance claim. The existence of a claim by Parent for monies from
an insurer or against a third party in respect of any Loss shall not,
however, delay any payment pursuant to the indemnification provisions
contained herein and otherwise determined to be due and owing. If Parent has
received the payment required by this Agreement from the Representative in
respect of any Loss and later receives proceeds from insurance or other
amounts in respect of such Loss, then it shall hold such proceeds or other
amounts in trust for the benefit of the Former Stockholders and shall pay to
the Representative, as promptly as practicable after receipt, a sum equal to
the amount of such proceeds or other amount received,

  



         
  

  



  

## up to the aggregate amount of any payments received from the Escrow
Account, if applicable, pursuant to this Agreement in respect of such Loss.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, it is the intention
of the parties that no insurer or any other third party shall be (i) entitled
to a benefit it would not be entitled to receive in the absence of the
foregoing indemnification provisions, or (ii) relieved of the responsibility
to pay any claims for which it is obligated.

  

## 

  

## 7.4 _Limitations on Indemnification_. (a) _Survival: Time Limitation_. The
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement or in
any writing delivered by the Company to Parent in connection with this
Agreement (including the certificate required to be delivered by the Company
pursuant to Section 6.3(a)) shall survive the Closing until one year after
the Closing Date (the " **Survival Period** ").  The indemnification and
other obligations under this Article VII shall survive for the Survival
Period and shall terminate with the expiration of such Survival Period,
except that: (i) any claims for breach of representation or warranty made by
a party hereunder by filing a demand for arbitration under Section 10.12
shall be preserved until final resolution thereof despite the subsequent
expiration of the Survival Period and (ii) any claims set forth in a Notice
of Claim sent prior to the expiration of such Survival Period shall survive
until final resolution thereof. No claim for indemnification under this
Article VII shall be first asserted after the end of the applicable Survival
Period.

  

## 

  

### (b) _Basket_. No amount shall be payable under Article VII unless and
until the aggregate amount of all indemnifiable Losses otherwise payable
exceeds $2,000,000 in the aggregate (the " **Basket** "), in which event the
amount payable shall be for all such Losses (including all Losses included
within the Basket).  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, the Basket will not be applicable to (i) claims related to Excess
Third Party Expenses or (ii) claims arising from fraud, willful
misrepresentation or willful misconduct. Only Losses in excess of $25,000,
individually or in the aggregate incurred as part of a series of related
Losses (the " **Materiality Threshold** ") shall be included in determining
whether the Basket has been satisfied. Losses below the Materiality Threshold
shall in no event give rise to any indemnity rights in favor of Parent, even
if the Basket is otherwise satisfied.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Aggregate Amount Limitation_. The aggregate liability for Losses
pursuant to Section 7.1 shall not in any event exceed the Escrow Cash (the
**"Liability Cap** ") and Parent shall have no claim against any of the
Company stockholders other than for sole recourse to the Escrow
Cash (including any earnings thereon); provided that such limitations shall
not apply (i) in the case of claims arising from fraud, willful
misrepresentation or willful misconduct, or (ii) to any Excess Third Party
Expenses; provided further that in no event shall any such claim against any
Former Stockholder exceed the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration
received by such Former Stockholder.

  

### 

  

## 7.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that, from
and after the Closing, its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and
all claims, whether direct, third party or otherwise, for money
damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be pursuant and
subject to the requirements of the indemnification provisions set forth in
this Article VII.

  



        
   

  



  

## 7.6 _Damages; Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. Amounts paid
for indemnification under Article VII shall reduce the Total Merger
Consideration received by the Companys stockholders.

  

## 

  

## 7.7 _Representative Capacities; Application of Escrow Cash_.

  

## 

  

### (a) The parties acknowledge that the Representatives obligations under
this Article VII are solely as a representative of the Former Stockholders in
the manner set forth in the Escrow Agreement with respect to the obligations
to indemnify Parent under this Article VII and that the Representative shall
have no personal responsibility for any expenses incurred by the
Representative in such capacity and that all payments to Parent as a result
of such indemnification obligations shall be made solely from, and to the
extent of, the Escrow Cash. The parties further acknowledge that all actions
to be taken by Parent pursuant to this Article VII shall be taken on its
behalf by the Committee in accordance with the provisions of the
Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent, pursuant to the Escrow Agreement after
the Closing, may apply all or a portion of the Escrow Cash to satisfy any
claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article VII. The Escrow Agent will
hold the remaining portion of the Escrow Cash until final resolution of all
claims for indemnification or disputes relating thereto.

  

### 

  

### (b) Escrow Agent shall release the Escrow Cash, or the remaining balance
in the manner set forth in the Escrow Agreement, to the Former Stockholders
on a pro-rata basis, subject to any amounts reserved (in the manner provided
for in the following sentence) to address unresolved claims for
indemnification submitted prior to the expiration of the Survival Period. To
the extent that claims for indemnification submitted prior to the expiration
of the Survival Period remain unresolved as of such date, the Escrow Agent
shall reserve and not pay to the Former Stockholders an amount intended to
satisfy such claims when finally resolved, which amount shall be
determined in the following manner: (i) to the extent that the amount of the
claim is included in the notice provided pursuant to 7.1 or 7.2, as the case
may be, such amount plus an amount reasonably estimated by the Parent
Indemnitees to provide reimbursement for costs and expenses incurred in
resolving such claim shall be reserved until the final resolution and payment
of such claim, and (ii) to the extent that the amount of the claim remains
unknown, an amount reasonably estimated by the Parent Indemnitees as
providing adequate recourse for satisfaction of the final amount of the
claim, plus an amount reasonably estimated by the Parent Indemnitees to
provide reimbursement for costs and expenses incurred in resolving such claim
shall be reserved until the final resolution and satisfaction of such claim.
As outstanding claims are resolved, reserves in excess of the amounts
withheld with respect to all claims remaining unresolved shall be released to
the Former Stockholders as provided for in this Section 7.7(b).

  

###

## reference shall be to a Section or subsection of this Agreement. Unless
otherwise indicated the words "include," "includes" and "including" when used
herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement

Agreement:

  

## 

  

### (a) the term " **Material Adverse Effect** " when used in connection with
an entity means any change, event, violation, inaccuracy, circumstance or
effect, individually or when aggregated with other changes, events,
violations, inaccuracies, circumstances or effects, that is materially
adverse to the business, assets (including intangible assets), revenues,
financial condition or results of operations of such entity, it being
understood that none of the following alone or in combination shall be
deemed, in and of itself, to constitute a Material Adverse Effect: (i)
changes in general national or regional economic conditions, or (ii) any SEC
rulemaking requiring enhanced disclosure of reverse merger transactions with
a public shell.

  

### 

  

### (b) the term " **Legal Requirements** " means any federal, state, local,

### (g) all monetary amounts set forth herein are referenced in United States
dollars, unless otherwise noted.

  

### 

  

## 10.3 _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_. This Agreement may be executed
in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the
same agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have
been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being
understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.  Delivery by
facsimile to counsel for the other party of a counterpart executed by a party
shall be deemed to meet the requirements of the previous sentence.

  

## 

  

## 10.4 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties
hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Schedules
hereto (a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof; and (b) are not intended to confer upon any other
person any rights or remedies hereunder (except as specifically provided in
this Agreement).

  

## 

  

## 10.5 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so
as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with
a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

  

## 

  

## 10.6 _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred
hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.  The
parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.

  

## 

  

## 10.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the law of the State of Delaware regardless of the law that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of
law thereof.

  

## 

  

## 10.8 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have
been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation,
holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or
other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document.

  



        
   

  



  

## 10.9 _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other parties.  Subject to the first sentence of this Section
10.9, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of
the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

  

## 

  

## 10.10 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at
any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of
the parties.

  

## 

  

## 10.11 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, any
party hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on
the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.
Delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall not constitute a
waiver of such right.

  

## 

  

## 10.12 _Dispute Resolution_.

  

## 

  

### (a) In the event of a dispute hereunder or relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, including under or with respect to any of the agreements
to be executed and delivered pursuant hereto, arbitration will be the sole
and exclusive method of resolving the dispute, except that a party may seek a
preliminary injunction, temporary restraining order, or other preliminary
judicial relief if, in its judgment, the action is necessary to avoid
irreparable damage or harm.

  

### 

  

### (b) The arbitrator will consist of any person who is mutually acceptable
to the parties to the dispute. However, if the parties are unable to agree on
a single arbitrator, an arbitration panel of three arbitrators will
be selected as provided below. Each party (Parent and Merger Sub, on the one
hand, and Company and the Former Stockholders through the Representative, on
the other hand), shall select one arbitrator, within 10 days from the date
one party advises the other party that it cannot agree on a single
arbitrator, and the third arbitrator shall be selected by the two chosen by
the parties within 10 days of such two arbitrators being chosen.
Every arbitrator must be independent (not a party to this Agreement or a
lawyer or relative to a party to this Agreement or an agent, officer,
director, employee, shareholder or affiliate of a party to or a relative of
any of those persons) without any economic or financial interest of any kind
in the outcome of the arbitration. Each arbitrators conduct will be
governed by the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration
will be conducted in Wilmington, Delaware, in accordance with the rules of
the American Arbitration Association and the discovery rules of the Delaware
Rules of Civil Procedure. The arbitrator or arbitration panel will use
reasonable best efforts to cause the arbitration to be concluded as soon as
practicable. The arbitrators shall not be empowered to award punitive
damages. The arbitrators or arbitrators fees shall be shared equally by the
parties unless the arbitrator or arbitration panel shall determine that the
nonprevailing party in such arbitration shall pay the entire or a
disproportionate amount of such fees.

  



        
   

  



  

### (c) The arbitrator or a majority of the arbitration panel shall render
its decision in writing within thirty (30) days after the conclusion of the
hearing. The decision of the arbitrator arbitration panel will be final,
binding and conclusive as to all the parties and the decision of the
arbitrator or arbitration panel will not be subject to appeal, review or re-
examination, except for willful misconduct by an arbitrator that prejudices
the rights of any party to the arbitration. Any party may enforce the
arbitration award in any state or federal court located in the State of
Delaware.

  

### 

  

### (d) The prevailing party in any dispute shall be entitled to recover from
the other party all of its costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
enforcement of its rights hereunder or thereunder, including reasonable
attorneys and paralegals fees and costs incurred before and at arbitration,
at any other proceeding, at all tribunal levels and whether or not suit or
any other proceeding is brought.

  

### 

  

### (e) In the case of any dispute involving the holders of Company Capital
Stock and/or holders of any Company Stock Options after the Closing Date, the
Representative shall have all absolute and sole authority acting in its sole
and absolute discretion and judgment to act on behalf of and bind all of the
stockholders and/or holders of any Company Stock Options, on all matters
directly or indirectly related to or arising under this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement or any other agreement or matter related thereto. By
execution of this Agreement, the Representative agrees to be bound by and
comply with all of the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement as if
a signatory thereto.
