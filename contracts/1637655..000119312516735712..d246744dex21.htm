   2.4 | Closing Date. The date (exact time of day) immediately prior to

(on income and revenue) and depreciation and amortization of the Material
Target Group Entities in excess of EUR 4,500,000.00 (in words: Euro four
million five hundred thousand) during the current fiscal year, provided,
however, that any such adverse change or effect shall not be taken

Change if and to the extent it results from (i) general economic conditions
(including general developments of capital markets) or conditions or events
affecting companies generally in the industries in which the Target Group
Entities operate, (ii) changes in laws or regulations not known at the Signing
Date (iii) the announcement of the Transaction, (iv) any action or measure
permitted under the Agreement (v) the execution or consummation of the
Agreement. The Purchasers rights pursuant to this clause 2.5 are without
prejudice to any other rights that the Purchaser may have under this
Agreement, however, in no event may Purchaser or the Sellers raise any claims
based on an (alleged) occurrence of a Material Adverse Change after the
Closing Date. 
---|--- 
 



15 event that any Closing Action has not been taken or waived within two (2)
Business Days after the Scheduled Closing Date, the Sellers and/or
the Purchaser may withdraw from this Agreement by written notice to the other
Parties, unless the respective Closing Action is (i) within the control of any
or all Seller(s), if Sellers seek to withdraw, or (ii) within the control
of Purchaser, if Purchaser seeks to withdraw. Any purported withdrawal shall
be deemed void and shall not have any effect if, at the time when the notice
of withdrawal is received by the other Parties, all Closing Actions have been
taken or waived. The withdrawal shall not prejudice any claims of the
withdrawing Parties or Party that may arise from any circumstances related to
the Closing Actions not being taken. 
---|--- 
 



   2.7 | Closing Memorandum. On the Completion Date, the Parties shall
execute a "Closing Memorandum" substantially in the form as set out in _Annex

---|--- 



    2.8 | New List of Shareholders. Immediately after execution of the
Closing Memorandum the Parties shall provide the recording notary with a copy
thereof. The Parties and the notary are in agreement that such copy
shall constitute the evidence of the transfer of the shares in WHO as
required by section 40 (paragraph 1, sentence 2) of the German Limited
Liabilities Companies Act ( _GmbHG_ ). Upon receipt of the copy the notary is
obliged to submit in due course the new shareholders list to the competent
commercial register together with its certification pursuant to section 40
(paragraph 2 sentence 2) of the German Limited Liability Companies Act (
_GmbHG_ ). 
---|---

power of attorney, valid as from the Completion Date, authorising the
Purchaser to hold one or several shareholder meetings and exercise their
voting rights therein and to give instructions to the management, until
registration of the new shareholders list in the commercial register. 
---|--- 



   2.10 | No limitation. For the avoidance of doubt, the legal effect of
the Closing Memorandum shall not  unless specifically provided for  limit or
prejudice the rights of the Parties arising under this Agreement. 
---|--- 



   2.11 | Withdrawal based on Unability to Achieve Financing. Break-Up
Fee. Following the signing of this Agreement, in the event that the Purchaser
is unable to achieve the necessary financing for the Transaction,
the Purchaser may withdraw from this Agreement by providing a written notice
to the recording notary in the form contained in _Annex 2.11_ (the "Withdrawal
Notice"). Following the service of the Withdrawal Notice the Purchaser shall
pay to the Sellers a break-up fee of EUR 3,500,000.00 (in words: three million
five hundred thousand Euros) (the "Break-Up Fee"). The right of withdrawal
shall however only apply from the Signing Date until 7 October 2016 and the
Withdrawal Notice has to be received by the Recording notary on or prior to 7
October 2016. After the lapse of such period or after the occurrence of
Closing, the Purchaser shall have no right of withdrawal under this Clause
2.11. The provisions in relation to payment of the Break-Up Fee and Clauses
13, 14, 17 and 18 shall survive the Withdrawal Notice and remain applicable.
Upon occurrence of Closing the right of Sellers to the Break-Up Fee
shall automatically terminate. 
---|--- 



   2.12 |

Purchasers rights under Clause 2.11, provided that the Sellers have taken
all Closing Actions under their control and confirmed to the Purchaser that
they are prepared to undertake the Closing Actions which require actions from
the Sellers and the Purchaser, if on the Scheduled Closing Date the Purchaser
does not take all actions under its control or which require actions from the

costs, or (v) any internal costs and expenses, or (vi) Taxes as result of a
breach of any Representation of Sellers according to Clauses 4.20.6 or 4.27
incurred by a Target Group Entity or Purchaser (collectively the "Damages").
For the avoidance of doubt, Taxes as result of a breach of any Representation
of Sellers according to Clauses 4.20.6 or 4.27 incurred by a Target Group
Entity or Purchaser shall be exclusively governed by clause 6. Any loss or
damage shall not be based on any arguments that the Purchase Price were
calculated using incorrect assumptions in particular the Purchaser shall not
be entitled to claim for a multiple applied in Purchasers Purchase Price
calculation. The statutory regulations regarding the calculation of damages,
mitigation of damages and offsetting of losses by advantages due to the
damaging event ( _Schadensberechnung, Schadensminderung, Vorteilsausgleich_ )
according to Section 249 et seq. of the German Civil Code _(B urgerliches
Gesetzbuch, BGB_) shall apply. If and to the extent Damages are paid to
Purchaser, such payments shall be construed and deemed as a reduction of the
Purchase Price as between the Parties. 
---|--- 
 



32 suffered or incurred by Purchaser or a Target Group Entity as the result of a
Breach are duplicative, such Damages shall not be recoverable more than once.
If and to the extent that a set of facts ( _Lebenssachverhalt_ ) has been
addressed in and allows for recovery under clause 5, any related claims based
on other provisions of this Agreement shall be excluded. 
---|--- 
 



   5.5 | Exclusions. Without prejudice to clause 7, any liability of
Sellers hereunder shall be excluded if and to the extent that: 
---|--- 



     | (i) | claims of Purchaser or the underlying circumstances (a) are
actually compensated by recovering such damages against insurances in place at
signing of this Agreement by the Target Group Entities (excluding for
the avoidance of doubt any claims under the Warranty and Indemnity insurance
policy with AIG), (b) are actually compensated by recovering against third
parties or (c) are reflected as a specific liability or accrual with regard to
that specific Breach in the Consolidated Financial Statements; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | it directly relates to one of the items contained in _Annex
5.5(ii)_ or has been taken into account in determining the Effective Date Net
Working Capital pursuant to clause 3.3; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | the underlying facts or circumstances have been
specifically disclosed as an exception to the Representation by way of a
cross-reference in the Representation, by way of a specific reference in this
Agreement or an Annex thereto to a general section in the virtual data room
made available to the Purchaser, or as an Annex of this Agreement (it being
acknowledged by the Purchaser that a disclosure in one Representation or the
relevant Annex to such Representation shall be deemed a disclosure to another
Representation to the extent that a reasonable purchaser would understand such
disclosure as being relevant to the respective Representation). Section 442
paragraph 1 of the German Civil Code shall not apply; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | the Damages, or a portion thereof, are the result of a
failure by Purchaser or a Target Group Entity of their obligation to avoid or
mitigate damages after the Closing Date pursuant to Section 254 German Civil
Code ( _B urgerliches Gesetzbuch, BGB_) and for the avoidance of doubt the
Purchasers obligation to mitigate damage shall include the provisions of
clauses 5.6 and 5.7; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (v) | the asserted claim is based on laws or regulations enacted
or amended after the Signing Date. 
---|---|--- 



   5.6 | Court Actions. Sellers liability under this Agreement with
regard to court judgments, public orders or claims of third parties that are
asserted against Purchaser or a Target Group Entity shall be determined as
follows: 
---|--- 



     | (i) | In the event that such matter has or could have a material
adverse effect on the goodwill of the Purchaser or a Target Group Entity (for
example if it concerns material customer relationship(s) or reputational
issues), the Purchaser shall have conduct of such claim and shall be obliged
to provide Sellers with copies of all documents and all information that may
reasonably be considered important in that respect and shall reasonably
involve the Sellers Representative in the defense against such claim at the
Sellers own expense. For the avoidance of doubt, the Sellers Representative
shall not have the right to require the Purchaser or a Target Group Entity to
take any action which, in the Purchasers reasonable opinion, would be
detrimental to the claim. 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

In the event that such matter would not have a material adverse effect on the
goodwill of the Purchaser or a Target Group Entity, the Sellers
Representative shall have conduct of such claim and shall be obliged to
provide Purchaser with

33 reasonably be considered important in that respect and will take account of
any reasonable representation of the Purchaser in respect of the conduct of
such claim but the Sellers Representative shall not have the right to settle
any claim without the prior written consent of the Purchaser which the
Purchaser shall not unreasonably withhold. 
---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | Sellers (through Sellers Representative) and the
Purchaser shall each have the right to participate in the court actions
conducted by the other party in accordance with the above provisions at their
own cost.  
---|---|--- 



   5.7 | Breach Notice; Access to Information. If the Purchaser or any of
the Target Group Entities becomes aware of a Breach or potential Breach of any
Representation, Purchaser shall give, without undue delay after becoming
aware, the Sellers Representative written notice of such a (potential) Breach
(the "Breach Notice"). The Breach Notice shall state in reasonable detail the
nature of the Breach and the amount of Damages resulting therefrom if and to
the extent that such Damages can be determined at the time the Breach Notice
is given. To the extent reasonably required by the Sellers Representative to
assess the alleged Breach and the resulting Damages, and subject to Purchaser
and the Target Group Entity being paid their reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses by the Sellers Representative, Purchaser shall provide, and
shall procure that any Target Group Entity provides, to the
Sellers Representative and their professional advisors reasonable access
upon the giving of reasonable notice during normal business hours to their
relevant books, other records and copies of relevant documents and other
information regardless of whether kept in paper form, electronic form or
otherwise but subject always to an overriding duty of confidentiality as
evidenced by the written reasonable advice of the Purchasers legal advisor.
Purchaser shall ensure that the Target Group Entities books and all other
information mentioned in this clause 5.7 will be retained for a period of ten
(10) years after Closing Date.

---|---|--- 
 



     | (a) | all due Taxes to be paid by any of the Material Target Group
Entities relating to Tax periods (or portions thereof) ending before the

until the Effective Date, 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | German wage tax and social security contributions payable
for payments made to managers of the WHO Group Entities by the Sellers or
related parties (with the exception of the Target Group Entities) in
connection with the sale of the WHO Shares before, on or after the Effective

---|---|---

and shall be equal to (i) the amount that would be payable (for instance, for
Taxes based upon income sales, gross receipts, wages, capital expenditures or
a similar Tax base) if the Tax period ended on (including) the day preceding
the Effective Date, or (ii) if an allocation pursuant to (i) is not possible,
the amount of Taxes for the entire period multiplied by a fraction in which
the numerator is the

 



35  number of days in the portion of the Tax period that falls within the
indemnification period and the denominator is the number of days of the entire
Tax period.

 



     | (ii) | Purchaser shall not be entitled to any Tax indemnification
(or other payments in respect of a Tax) if and to the extent that 
---|---|--- 



     | (a) | the relevant Taxes are the result of (i) any change in the
accounting and taxation principles or practices of any of the Target Group
Entities (including the methods of submitting Tax Returns) introduced after
the Closing Date for any Tax period (or a portion thereof) ending prior to
the Effective Date unless required by any applicable laws, or (ii) any
transaction, action or omission (including the change in the exercise of any
Tax election right, the approval or implementation of any reorganization
measure or the sale of any asset) initiated or executed by Purchaser or any of

the extent Sellers are in breach of the Representations made in clauses 4.27
(iii) or 4.27 (viii) provided such breach is relevant for incurring the
relevant Tax (e.g. existence of holding periods or of a permanent
establishment not disclosed in Annex 4.27(viii)); or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Purchaser has failed to comply with its obligations under
this Agreement (in particular, this clause 6); or 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | a Material Target Group Entity, Purchaser or an Affiliate of
Purchaser (i) has actually recovered or been compensated or indemnified by a
third party or (ii) Sellers requested from Purchaser to cause a Material
Target Group Entity to sell and assign its actual or alleged claim for
recovery or compensation of Indemnifiable Taxes (or a portion thereof) against
the third party to the Sellers against indemnification from such Indemnifiable
Taxes in accordance with the provisions of this entire clause 6 and such
Material Target Group Entity has not entered into such sale and purchase
agreement within a reasonable period of time with the Sellers. The Material
Target Group Entity is not required to give any representations and
warranties and the terms and the sale of such claim shall be subject to the
statutory provisions under German law for the sale and purchase of claims
unless agreed otherwise in this Agreement and is only required to sell and
assign any claim for recovery or compensation of Indemnifiable Taxes (or a
portion thereof) against the third party to the extent that the face value of
the sold claim or a portion thereof is equal to the cash payment to be made by
Sellers to the selling Material Target Group Entity. In case the assignment
of such a claim is not legally possible, Sellers are, at their own costs,
entitled to enforce the claim in the name of the respective Material Target
Group Entity provided that Sellers indemnify the respective Material Target
Group entity from any third party claims. 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | If and to the extent that the Indemnifiable Tax or the
circumstances which caused the Indemnifiable Tax has/have a reversal effect (
_Umkehreffekt_ ) at the level of Purchaser, an Affiliate of Purchaser or any
of the Target Group Entities in a Tax period (or a portion thereof) after the
Effective Date (e.g., due to the lengthening of any amortization or
depreciation periods, higher amortization/depreciation allowances, a step-up
in Tax basis of assets, the transfer of items relevant for Taxes (e.g.,
turnover, income, expenses, VAT payable corresponding with a VAT refund etc.)
(the "Reversal Effect"), the Indemnifiable Tax shall be reduced. The amount of
the reduction shall be determined by 
---|---|--- 
 



36 the Tax reduction relates to other Taxes than income, profit or gain, i.e.
without any discounting effect, but minus any income tax thereon, if any,
and  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | the relevant net present value of the Tax reduction if and
to the extent the Tax reduction relates to Taxes on income, profit or gain
whereby the relevant net present value shall be calculated on the basis of  
---|---|--- 



     | (t) | an applied discount rate of 6 (six) per cent per annum, 
---|---|--- 



     | (x) | Tax reductions which could be realised within a period
beginning on the Effective Date and ending on 30 September 2021 assuming that
the respective Material Target Group entity is in a tax paying position, and  
---|---|--- 



     | (y) | a Tax rate applicable at the time when the respective Tax
indemnity claim is raised on the aggregate amount of the Tax base reductions
caused by the Reversal Effect. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iv) | However, no such discounting shall apply to the extent a
Reversal Effect has already led to an actual reduction in Taxes when Purchaser
raises the respective Indemnity claim pursuant to clause 6.2, in which
case the Indemnifiable Tax shall be reduced by the amount of the Tax
reduction caused by the Reversal Effect without any discounting. Any
indemnification payments under this clause 6.2 by Sellers shall be made at the
later of (i) fifteen (15) Business Days after the date at which Sellers have
been notified in writing by Purchaser about the payment obligation and have
been provided with a copy of the relevant Tax assessment notice (
_Steuerbescheid_ ) or other payment notice, or (ii) five (5) Business Days
before the Tax falls due. If at that time any Material Target Group Entity has
received a Tax Refund as set forth in clause 6.3(i) Sellers shall be entitled
to set-off their claim against Purchaser against their indemnification
obligation and Purchaser shall be entitled to set-off his claim for
indemnification against Sellers claim for payment of an amount equal to such
Tax Refund regardless of whether Sellers or Purchasers claim is due for
payment or not. 
---|---|--- 



     | (v) | If an Indemnifiable Tax is reduced after an indemnification
payment has been made, the difference between the higher indemnification
payment and the lower Tax amount shall be reimbursed by Purchaser to Sellers;
any respective payment to Sellers shall be due within fifteen (15) Business
Days after the date at which the relevant Target Group Entity has received the
respective amount from the Tax Authorities (including by way of set-off,
deduction or credit). 
---|---|--- 



   6.3 | Tax Refunds, Overprovisions and Tax Benefits. 
---|--- 



     | (i) | Purchaser shall pay to Sellers the amount of any refund of
Taxes which exceed the aggregate of all Tax receivables actually reflected in
the calculation of the Effective Date Net Working Capital including
interest thereon received by any of the Material Target Group Entities by
cash payment, set-off, deduction or otherwise, after the Effective Date
relating to any Tax period (or a portion thereof) ending before the Effective
Date ("Tax Refund") minus reasonable costs and expenses (including internal
costs) for any proceeding, litigation or other actions taken in order to
realize the Tax Refund on or after the Effective Date, provided, however, such
costs and expenses have not already to be borne by the Sellers pursuant to
Section 6.4 (i) (d). If no set-off pursuant to clause 6.2(iv) occurs any such
payment shall be due and payable within ten (10) Business Days after such Tax
Refund has been received by the recipient. 
---|---|---

respective Material Target Group Company and the Purchaser to be bound by
professional secrecy on all information obtained from such review. 
---|--- 



   6.4 | Cooperation on Tax matters. 
---|--- 



     | (i) | Purchaser shall, and shall cause ( _steht daf ur ein_) the
Material Target Group Entities to, fully cooperate with Sellers and Sellers
Representatives in connection with any Tax matter relating to a Tax period
(or portion thereof) ending before the Effective Date including, without
limitation, any inquiry, examination, audit, investigation, negotiation,
dispute, appeal or litigation with respect to such period. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (a) | Purchaser shall (and shall cause ( _steht daf ur ein_) that
the Material Target Group Entities do) keep and make available for inspection

Effective Date at the head office of a Material Target Group Entity and to

cause ( _steht daf ur ein_) that (i) any Relevant Tax Returns are filed when
due (taking into account any extension of the due date granted by a Tax
Authority) and in accordance with applicable laws and with past practice
provided and to the extent that past practice has been compliant with
applicable laws and interpretation of the tax laws by Tax courts and by
competent Tax Authorities (it being understood that interpretation by Tax
Authorities is not relevant with respect to deduction of interest pursuant to
the interest deduction ceiling rule ( _Zinsschranke_ ) if and to the extent
that such deduction is made in the same way as deductions which were reflected
in Tax Returns filed before the Effective Date, (ii) any Relevant Tax Returns
(except for Tax Returns to be filed on a monthly basis such as VAT advance
declarations or for periods which are shorter than a fiscal year; such Tax
Returns neednt be forwarded to Sellers) are forwarded at least twenty
five (25) Business Days prior to filing to Sellers for review and comments,
(iii) any Relevant Tax Returns (other than those Tax Returns which neednt be
forwarded to Sellers) are not filed without the prior written consent of
Sellers which shall not be unreasonably withheld and shall be deemed to be
given if Sellers do not object within twenty (20) Business Days in writing
describing the factual and legal reasons for their objection in reasonable
detail and shall be amended in accordance with Sellers instructions to be
given in writing (together with the factual background and the rationale of
their instruction) provided and to the extent, however, that such instructions
are

38 relevant laws by Tax courts and by competent Tax Authorities (it being
understood that interpretation by Tax Authorities is not relevant with
respect to deduction of interest pursuant to the interest deduction ceiling
rule ( _Zinsschranke_ ) if and to the extent that such deduction is made in

Target Group Entities to disclose, the diverting instructions of Sellers to
the Tax Authorities within the Relevant Tax Return if and to the extent that
such instructions are given by Sellers in writing and explain the factual and
legal circumstances on which Sellers base their view in reasonable detail. If
no such instructions are given then Sellers consent for filing such Relevant
Tax Return shall be deemed to be given. 
---|--- 
 



     | (c) | Purchaser shall notify Sellers of any announcement,
commencement or enforcement of any Tax Proceedings without undue delay which
shall be the earlier of 10 Banking Days before a legal deadline for taking any
action in such Tax Proceeding expires (unless the period between receipt of
such announcement, commencement or enforcement and the expiration of the legal
deadline is less than 15 Banking Days; then notification shall be made within
5 Banking Days from such receipt, commencement or enforcement and Purchaser
shall take legal remedy to avoid expiration of deadline) or 20 Banking Days
after Purchaser became aware of such event. The notification shall be made in
writing, and shall include copies of any assessment notice or other document
received from any Tax Authority. On request of Sellers, Purchaser shall
procure that Sellers obtain any additional document or information (including
any books and records) and description of the object of the Tax Proceeding
which Sellers reasonably require in this respect. Such additional documents
and information as well as books and records shall be made available for
inspection by the Sellers at the head office of a Material Target Group
Entity.

prior written consent of Sellers. Sellers shall confirm in advance and in
writing to the Purchaser that they will indemnify the Purchaser and/or  at
the Purchasers discretion  the relevant Material Target Group Entity for any
external expenses (including, for the avoidance of doubt, fees for tax

relevant Material Target Group Entity which shall not be limited to statutory
fees to the extent that such statutory fees exists) caused by the Tax
Proceeding including objections, protests or appeals against Tax assessments
or other decision taken by a Tax Authority or any other action taken that is
made due to a Sellers request or instruction, unless and to the extent such
expenses are (i) borne by the Tax Authorities or (ii) considerably exceed the
amount of external expenses regularly expectable based on Sellers´ written
request. Upon Purchasers request in writing Sellers shall make an advance
payment to Purchaser for court fees, retainer for or advance payments to

   6.6 | Adjustment of Purchase Price. Sellers and Purchaser agree that
regardless of clause 3.3 all payments made pursuant to this clause 6
constitute adjustments of the Purchase Price for the WHO-Share and TeIJs-
Shares, and to the extent permitted by applicable Tax law are also to be
treated as such adjustments for Tax purposes. 
---|--- 



   6.7 | Occurrence of Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, the
obligations of Sellers and Purchaser under this clause 6 shall be subject to
the occurrence of the Completion Date.

The Purchaser may request payment from the Escrow Account up to the
full amount of a claim it may have against one or several Sellers on a joint

Account is sufficient to cover claims of the Purchaser under this Agreement
such balance shall be the sole remedy excluding any direct claiming against
Sellers. Notwithstanding the above, with the exception of the Escrow Account

   8 | UNDERTAKING OF PURCHASER ON SHAREHOLDER LOANS 
---|--- 



   8.1 |

No Repayment. Purchaser and Guarantor shall not and shall procure that WHO (or
any affiliated entity within the meaning of section 15 et seq. of the German
Stock Corporation Act) shall not repay any of the Shareholder Loans (neither
partly nor in full) during a time period of 12 (twelve) months from the
Closing Date. The Purchaser shall be entitled to 

---|--- 
 



43 Closing Date provided always that any such restructuring does not qualify as a
repayment of the Shareholder Loans. 
---|--- 
 



   8.2 | Indemnifications. 
---|--- 



     | (i) | If on whatever ground, insolvency proceedings over any WHO
Group Entity are applied for or are opened and an insolvency administrator or
another competent person (e.g., trustee ( _Sachwalter_ )) or body claims
from one or more of the Sellers payments in connection with an alleged
repayment of the Shareholder Loans by the Purchaser after the Closing Date,
the Purchaser shall hold harmless and indemnify Sellers upon first demand (
_auf erstes Anfordern_ ) the respective Seller against all and any such
claims up to the amount of the alleged repayment plus accrued interest; as a
consequence, the indemnity shall also cover Sellers reasonable lawyers and
court fees. In the event that subsequently, after Purchaser having
indemnified the respective Seller in accordance with sentence 1, it is
determined that the claim from the insolvency administrator or other competent
person is wholly or partly invalid then the Sellers shall upon first demand (
_auf erstes Anfordern_ ) forward any amounts received from the insolvency
administrator or other competent person after deduction of Sellers own
payments and/or reasonable disbursements to the Purchaser. For the avoidance
of doubt, any repayment of Shareholder Loans or interest thereon made prior
to the Closing Date shall not trigger this indemnification obligation by the
Purchaser. In the latter case the Sellers shall hold harmless and indemnify
the Purchaser and any WHO Group Entity against all and any such claims up to
the amount of the repayment plus accrued interest; as a consequence, the
indemnity shall also cover the Purchasers or any WHO Group Entitys
reasonable lawyers and court fees.  
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | Any claims under this clause 8.2 shall not become time
barred prior to the expiration of six months after any payment claims, which
Purchaser shall hold harmless and indemnify Sellers against pursuant to this

Purchaser to indemnify Sellers shall be time-barred ten (10) years after
Closing.
