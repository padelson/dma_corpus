-vi-     AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF
MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of June 10, 2002, is by and among
SmartForce Public Limited Company, a public limited liability company
organized under the laws of the Republic of Ireland ("SmartForce"), Slate
Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of
SmartForce (the "Transitory Subsidiary"), and SkillSoft Corporation, a
Delaware corporation ("SkillSoft").   WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of
SmartForce (the "SmartForce Board") and the Board of Directors of SkillSoft
("SkillSoft Board") each deem it advisable and in the best interests of their
respective corporation and its stockholders that SmartForce and SkillSoft
combine in order to advance the long-term business interests of SmartForce
and SkillSoft;   WHEREAS, the combination of SmartForce and SkillSoft shall
be effected through a merger of the Transitory Subsidiary into SkillSoft in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL");   WHEREAS, concurrently with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and as a condition and inducement to
SmartForce\'s willingness to enter into this Agreement, the stockholders of
SkillSoft specified in Section 6.6(a) of this Agreement will be entering into
the Stockholder Voting Agreement, dated as of the date of this Agreement, in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit A-1 (the "SkillSoft Stockholder
Agreement"), pursuant to which such stockholders will, among other things,
agree to give SmartForce a proxy to vote all of the shares of capital stock
of SkillSoft that such stockholders own in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, and SkillSoft will grant to SmartForce
an option to purchase SkillSoft Common Stock pursuant to the Option Agreement
in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B-1 (the "SmartForce Option
Agreement");   WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and as a condition and inducement to SkillSoft\'s willingness to
enter into this Agreement, the shareholders of SmartForce specified in
Section 6.6(b) of this Agreement will be entering into the Shareholder Voting
Agreement, dated as of the date of this Agreement, in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit A-2 (the "SmartForce Shareholder Agreement"), pursuant to
which such shareholders will, among other things, agree to give SkillSoft a

SmartForce will grant to SkillSoft an option to purchase SmartForce ADSs
pursuant to the Option Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B-2
(the "SkillSoft Option Agreement");   WHEREAS, for United States federal
income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code");   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of
the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements set forth below, SmartForce, the Transitory Subsidiary and
SkillSoft agree as follows:     ARTICLE I   THE MERGER   1.1 The
Merger. Upon and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Transitory Subsidiary shall merge with and into SkillSoft (with such merger
referred to herein as the "Merger") at the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of the Transitory Subsidiary
shall cease and SkillSoft shall continue as the surviving corporation in the
Merger. SkillSoft following the Merger is sometimes referred to herein as the
"Surviving Corporation." The "Effective Time" shall be the time at
which SmartForce files a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger")
prepared and executed by the Surviving Corporation in accordance with Section
251(c) of the DGCL with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The
Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.   1.2
The Closing.   (a) The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take
place at 10:00 a.m., eastern time, on a date to be specified by SmartForce
and SkillSoft (the "Closing Date"), which shall be no later than the second
business day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VII (other than delivery of items to be delivered at the Closing and
other than satisfaction of those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, it being understood that the occurrence of the
Closing shall remain subject to the delivery of such items and the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), at the offices of
Hale and Dorr LLP, 60 State Street, Boston, Massachusetts, unless another
date, place or time is agreed to in writing by SmartForce and SkillSoft.  
(b) At the Closing:   (i) SkillSoft shall deliver to SmartForce the
various certificates, instruments and documents referred to in Section
7.2;   (ii) SmartForce shall deliver to SkillSoft the various certificates,
instruments and documents referred to in Section 7.3; and   (iii)
SmartForce, on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, shall file the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware.   1.3 Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the
Surviving Corporation.   (a) The Certificate of Incorporation of SkillSoft
shall be amended and restated, by means of the Certificate of Merger, to read
in its entirety the same as the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Transitory Subsidiary as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
(except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "SkillSoft
Corporation" or such other name as is mutually agreed to by SmartForce and
SkillSoft) and, as so amended, such Certificate of Incorporation shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until further
amended in accordance with the DGCL and such Certificate of
Incorporation.   -2-     (b) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Transitory Subsidiary and
SkillSoft, the Bylaws of Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated
to read the same as the Bylaws of the Transitory Subsidiary, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in
accordance with the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation and such Bylaws; provided; however, that all references in such
Bylaws to the Transitory Subsidiary shall be amended to refer to "SkillSoft
Corporation" or such other name as is mutually agreed to by SmartForce and
SkillSoft.   1.4 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation.  
(a) The directors of the Transitory Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.   (b) The officers
of SkillSoft immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with
the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.  
1.5 Tax Consequences. The parties hereto intend that the Merger
shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. The parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization"
within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the U.S. Income
Tax Regulations.   ARTICLE II   CONVERSION OF SECURITIES   2.1
Conversion of Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Transitory
Subsidiary, SkillSoft or the holder of any shares of the capital stock of
SkillSoft or the capital stock of the Transitory Subsidiary:   (a) Capital
Stock of the Transitory Subsidiary. Each share of the common stock of the
Transitory Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, $.001 par value per share, of
the Surviving Corporation.   (b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and
SmartForce-Owned Stock. All shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per
share, of SkillSoft ("SkillSoft Common Stock") that are owned by SkillSoft as
treasury stock or by any wholly owned Subsidiary of SkillSoft and any shares
of SkillSoft Common Stock owned by SmartForce, the Transitory Subsidiary or
any other wholly owned Subsidiary of SmartForce immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no shares of
SmartForce or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.   (c) Exchange Ratio for SkillSoft Common Stock. Subject to
Section 2.2, each share of SkillSoft Common Stock (other than shares to be
cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b)) shall be automatically converted
into the right to receive 2.3674 (the "Exchange   -3-    Ratio")
American Depository Shares of SmartForce ("SmartForce ADSs") evidenced by
American Depositary Receipts ("SmartForce ADRs"), each of which
represents one ordinary share, nominal value (euro)0.11 per share, of
SmartForce ("SmartForce Ordinary Shares"), upon surrender of the certificate
representing such share of SkillSoft Common Stock in the manner provided in
Section 2.2. As of the Effective Time, all such shares of SkillSoft Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such
shares of SkillSoft Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the SmartForce ADSs evidenced by
SmartForce ADRs pursuant to this Section 2.1(c) and any cash in lieu of
fractional SmartForce ADSs to be issued or paid in consideration therefor
upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.2,
without interest.   (d) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio. The Exchange Ratio
shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, share
or stock split, reverse split, share or stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into SmartForce ADSs,
SmartForce Ordinary Shares or SkillSoft Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to SmartForce ADSs,
SmartForce Ordinary Shares or SkillSoft Common Stock occurring (or for which
a record date is established) after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time.   2.2 Exchange of Certificates. The procedures for
exchanging outstanding shares of SkillSoft Common Stock for SmartForce ADSs
pursuant to the Merger are as follows:   (a) Exchange Agent. As of the
Effective Time, SmartForce shall deposit with The Bank of New York or another
bank or trust company designated by SmartForce and reasonably acceptable to
SkillSoft (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of
SkillSoft Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.2,
through the Exchange Agent, (i) SmartForce ADRs representing the SmartForce
ADSs (such SmartForce ADSs, together with any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto with a record date after the Effective Time, being
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund") issuable pursuant to Section
2.1 in exchange for outstanding shares of SkillSoft Common Stock, (ii) cash
in an amount sufficient to make payments for fractional shares required
pursuant to Section 2.2(c), and (iii) any dividends or distributions to which
holders of certificates which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding shares of SkillSoft Common Stock (the
"Certificates") may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(d).   (b) Exchange
Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or
Certificates whose shares were converted pursuant to Section 2.1 into the
right to receive SmartForce ADSs (i) a letter of transmittal in customary
form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for SmartForce ADRs
evidencing SmartForce ADSs (plus cash in lieu of fractional SmartForce ADSs,
if any, and any dividends or distributions as provided below). Upon surrender
of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other
agent or agents as may be appointed by SmartForce, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably
be required by the Exchange Agent, the   -4-    holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a SmartForce
ADR representing that number of whole SmartForce ADSs which such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.1 plus cash in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and any dividends or
distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(d), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. In the event of a valid transfer
of ownership of SkillSoft Common Stock which is not registered in the
transfer records of SkillSoft, a SmartForce ADR representing the proper
number of SmartForce ADSs plus cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.2(c) and any dividends or distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(d)
may be issued or paid to a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate is presented to
the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes
have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the SmartForce ADRs evidencing
SmartForce ADSs plus cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section
2.2(c) and any dividends or distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(d) as
contemplated by this Section 2.2.   (c) No Fractional Shares. No SmartForce
ADR or scrip representing fractional SmartForce ADSs shall be issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a
shareholder of SmartForce. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of shares of SkillSoft Common Stock converted pursuant
to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of
a SmartForce ADS (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by
such holder and the aggregate number of shares of SkillSoft Common Stock
represented thereby) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest)
in an amount equal to such fractional part of a SmartForce ADS multiplied by
the average of the last reported sales prices of SmartForce ADSs at the 4:00
p.m., Eastern time, end of regular trading hours on the Nasdaq National
Market ("Nasdaq") during the ten consecutive trading days ending on and
including the last trading day prior to the Effective Time.   (d)
Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect
to SmartForce ADSs with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder of record of
such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect
of applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall
be issued and paid to the record holder of the Certificate (i) the amount
of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time previously paid with respect to such whole SmartForce ADSs, without
interest, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends
or other distributions having a record date after the Effective Time but
prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender that are
payable with respect to such whole SmartForce ADSs.   (e) No Further
Ownership Rights in SkillSoft Common Stock. All SmartForce ADSs evidenced by
SmartForce ADRs issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in
accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash or dividends or other
distributions paid pursuant to Section 2.2(c) or 2.2(d)) shall be deemed to
have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of SkillSoft Common Stock, and from and after the Effective Time
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock  
-5-    transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of
SkillSoft Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.   (f) Termination
of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains
undistributed to the holders of SkillSoft Common Stock for 180 days after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to SmartForce, upon demand, and any holder
of SkillSoft Common Stock who has not previously complied with this Section
2.2 shall thereafter look only to SmartForce, as a general
unsecured creditor, for payment of its claim for SmartForce ADSs, any cash in
lieu of fractional SmartForce ADSs and any dividends or distributions with
respect to SmartForce ADSs.   (g) No Liability. To the extent permitted by
applicable law, none of SmartForce, the Transitory Subsidiary, SkillSoft, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of
shares of SkillSoft Common Stock, SmartForce ADSs or SmartForce Ordinary
Shares, as the case may be, for such shares (or dividends or distributions
with respect thereto) delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate
shall not have been surrendered prior to one year after the Effective Time
(or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any SmartForce ADSs, and
any cash payable to the holder of such Certificate or any dividends or
distributions payable to the holder of such Certificate pursuant to this
Article II would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity), any such SmartForce ADSs or cash, dividends or
distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto.   (h) Withholding Rights. Each of SmartForce and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of SkillSoft Common Stock such amounts as it reasonably determines
that it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any other applicable provision of law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or
SmartForce, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
shares of SkillSoft Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or SmartForce, as the case
may be.   (i) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by SmartForce, the posting by such person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as SmartForce may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
the SmartForce ADRs evidencing SmartForce ADSs and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares, and unpaid dividends and distributions on SmartForce ADSs
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.   2.3 SkillSoft
Stock Plans.   -6-     (a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding
option to purchase SkillSoft Common Stock ("SkillSoft Stock Options"),
whether vested or unvested, and all stock option plans or other stock or
equity-related plans of SkillSoft, all of which are listed in Section 3.2(c)
of the SkillSoft Disclosure Schedule (the "SkillSoft Stock Plans"), insofar
as they relate to outstanding SkillSoft Stock Options, shall be assumed by
SmartForce and shall be deemed to constitute an option to acquire, on the
same terms and conditions as were applicable under such SkillSoft Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, the same number of SmartForce
ADSs as the holder of such SkillSoft Stock Option would have been entitled to
receive pursuant to the Merger had such holder exercised such option in full
immediately prior to the Effective Time (rounded down to the nearest whole
number), at a price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to
the aggregate exercise price for the shares of SkillSoft Common Stock
purchasable pursuant to such SkillSoft Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time divided by (z) the aggregate number of SmartForce ADSs
deemed purchasable pursuant to such SkillSoft Stock Option in accordance with
the foregoing. Such SkillSoft Stock Options shall continue in effect on the
same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this
Section 2.3).   (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
SmartForce shall deliver to the participants in the SkillSoft Stock Plans an
appropriate notice setting forth such participants\' rights in the SkillSoft
Stock Options, as provided in this Section 2.3.   (c) SmartForce shall take
all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of
SmartForce ADSs for delivery upon exercise of SkillSoft Stock Options assumed
in accordance with this Section 2.3. Within 30 days after the Effective Time,
SmartForce shall file one or more registration statements on Form S-8 (or any
successor form) with respect to the SmartForce ADSs subject to such SkillSoft
Stock Options (to the extent a Form S-8 is available for such options) and
shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or
registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such options remain
outstanding.   (d) SkillSoft shall, prior to the Effective Time, terminate
its 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and its 2001 International Employee
Stock Purchase Plan and all rights of participants therein and all
obligations of SkillSoft thereunder in accordance with the terms thereof,
provided that SkillSoft shall permit all participants therein to purchase
SkillSoft Common Stock based on accrued payroll deductions as of the date of
termination, in accordance with the terms of such Plans.   2.4 Taking
Necessary and Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with the full right, title
and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of SkillSoft and the Transitory Subsidiary, the officers
and directors of SkillSoft and the Transitory Subsidiary will take all
such reasonable, lawful and necessary action.   ARTICLE III

otherwise) in any Subsidiary of SkillSoft or any other entity, other than
guarantees of bank obligations of Subsidiaries of SkillSoft entered into in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice (the "Ordinary
Course of Business").   3.4 Authority; No Conflict; Required Filings and
Consents.   (a) SkillSoft has all requisite corporate power and authority
to enter into this Agreement, and the SmartForce Option Agreement, subject

and the approval of the Merger (the "SkillSoft Voting Proposal") by
SkillSoft\'s stockholders under the DGCL (the "SkillSoft Stockholder
Approval"), to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the SmartForce Option Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the

recommend that the stockholders of SkillSoft vote in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement and the approval of the Merger. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the SmartForce Option Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated thereby by SkillSoft have been duly authorized
by all necessary corporate action on the part of SkillSoft, subject only (in
the case of the Merger Agreement) to the required receipt of the SkillSoft
Stockholder Approval. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
SkillSoft and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of SkillSoft,
enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors\' rights and to general
equity principles (the "Bankruptcy and Equity Exception"). The SmartForce
Option Agreement, upon its execution, will be duly executed and delivered by
SkillSoft and will constitute the valid and binding obligation of SkillSoft,
enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and
Equity Exception.   (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
SkillSoft do not, and the consummation by SkillSoft of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the SmartForce Option Agreement shall not,

the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of SkillSoft or of the charter,
by-laws, or other organizational document of any Subsidiary of SkillSoft,

obligation or loss of any material benefit) under, or require a consent
or waiver under, constitute a change in control under, require the payment of
a penalty under or result in the imposition of any mortgages, security
interests, pledges, liens, charges or encumbrances of any nature ("Liens") on
SkillSoft\'s or any of its Subsidiaries\' assets under any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease,
license, contract or other agreement, instrument or obligation to which
SkillSoft or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or
any of their properties or assets may be bound, or (iii) subject to obtaining
the SkillSoft Stockholder Approval and compliance with the requirements
specified in clauses (i) through (vi) of Section 3.4(c), conflict with or
violate any permit, concession, franchise, license, judgment, injunction,
order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to
SkillSoft or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their properties or
assets, except in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) of this Section 3.4(b)
for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, terminations,
cancellations, accelerations or losses which, individually or in the
aggregate, are not, reasonably likely to have a SkillSoft Material Adverse
Effect. Section 3.4(b) of the SkillSoft Disclosure Schedule lists all
consents, waivers and approvals under any of SkillSoft\'s or any of
its Subsidiaries\' agreements, licenses or leases required to be obtained
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
which, if individually or in the aggregate were not obtained, would result in
a material loss of benefits to SkillSoft, SmartForce or the Surviving
Corporation as a result of the Merger.   (c) No consent, approval, license,
permit, order or authorization of, or registration, declaration, notice or
filing with, any court, arbitrational tribunal, administrative agency or
commission or other governmental or regulatory authority, agency or
instrumentality (a "Governmental Entity") or any stock market or stock
exchange on which shares of SkillSoft Common Stock are listed for trading is
required by or with respect to SkillSoft or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the

notification requirements under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements
Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), (ii) any actions or filings required

directions or rulings of the Irish Takeover Panel, (vii) if required by The
Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., the filing of a Notification Form: Listing of
Additional Shares with The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. for the SkillSoft Common
Stock issuable under the   -12-    SmartForce Option Agreement and

adoption of the SkillSoft Voting Proposal by the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of SkillSoft Common Stock on the record date for the
meeting of SkillSoft\'s stockholders to consider the SkillSoft Voting
Proposal (the "SkillSoft Meeting") is the only vote of the holders of any
class or series of SkillSoft\'s capital stock or other securities necessary
to adopt this Agreement and for consummation by SkillSoft of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. There are no bonds, debentures,
notes or other indebtedness of SkillSoft having the right to vote (or

which are a party thereto or covered thereby at any time without liability to
SkillSoft or any of its Subsidiaries as a result thereof (other than for
benefits accrued through the date of termination or amendment and reasonable
administrative expenses related thereto) and no SkillSoft Employee Plan, plan
documentation or agreement, summary plan description or other written
communication distributed generally to employees by its terms prohibits
SkillSoft or any of its Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any such
SkillSoft Employee Plan. The investment vehicles used to fund SkillSoft
Employee Plans may be changed at any time without incurring a material sales
charge, surrender fee or other similar expense.   (h) Except as disclosed

without regard to Section 280G(b)(4); or (iii) agreement or plan binding
SkillSoft or any of its Subsidiaries, including any stock option plan, stock

SmartForce\'s operations or result in any liability for SmartForce or any of
its Subsidiaries. Neither SmartForce nor any of its Subsidiaries has received

relating to the right of any such employee to be employed by SmartForce or
any of its Subsidiaries because of the nature of the business conducted or
presently proposed to be conducted by SmartForce or any of its Subsidiaries

have a SmartForce Material Adverse Effect, nor is there pending or, to
the knowledge of SmartForce, threatened, any labor strike, dispute, walkout,
work stoppage, slow-down or lockout involving SmartForce or any of its
Subsidiaries.   4.15 Employee Benefit Plans.   (a) Section 4.15(a) of the
SmartForce Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate list of all
SmartForce Employee Plans in the United States or Canada that are material to
SmartForce (excluding any agreements with individual employees that are
covered by Section 4.15(h)). For purposes of this Agreement, "SmartForce
Employee Plans" shall mean all Employee Benefit Plans maintained, or
contributed to, by SmartForce, any of SmartForce\'s Subsidiaries or any of
their ERISA Affiliates (together, the "SmartForce Employee Plans").   (b)
SmartForce has made available to SkillSoft a complete and accurate copy of
each SmartForce Employee Plan and, for each such Plan in the United States or
Canada, (i) the three most recent annual reports (Form 5500) filed with the
IRS, (ii) each trust agreement, group annuity contract,
administrative service agreement, policy pertaining to fiduciary liability
insurance covering the fiduciaries of each such SmartForce Employee Plan, and
summary plan description, if any, relating to such SmartForce Employee Plan,
(iii) the most recent financial statements for each SmartForce Employee Plan
that is funded, and (iv) the three most recent reports regarding the
satisfaction of the nondiscrimination requirements applicable to each such
SmartForce Employee Plan including those of Sections 410(b), 401(k) and
401(m) of the Code.   (c) Each SmartForce Employee Plan has been
administered in all material respects in accordance with (as applicable)
ERISA, the Code, Irish Pensions Act of 1990 and all other applicable laws and
the regulations thereunder and in accordance with its terms and each of
SmartForce, SmartForce\'s Subsidiaries and their ERISA Affiliates has in all
material respects met its obligations with respect to such SmartForce
Employee Plan and has made all required contributions thereto (or reserved
such contributions which are required but not yet due on the SmartForce
Balance Sheet). All filings and reports as to each SmartForce Employee Plan
required to have been submitted to the IRS or to the United States Department
of Labor have been timely submitted. With respect to SmartForce Employee
Plans, no event has occurred and there exists no condition or set of
circumstances in connection with which SmartForce or any of its Subsidiaries
could be subject to any liability that is reasonably likely, individually or
in the aggregate, to have a SmartForce Material Adverse Effect under ERISA,
the Code or any other applicable law.   -38-     (d) With respect to
SmartForce Employee Plans, there are no benefit obligations for which
contributions have not been made or properly accrued and there are no benefit
obligations which have not been accounted for by reserves, or otherwise
properly footnoted in accordance with GAAP, on the financial statements of
SmartForce, which obligations are reasonably likely, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a SmartForce Material Adverse Effect. The assets of each
SmartForce Employee Plan which is funded are reported at their fair
market value on the books and records of such plan.   (e) All SmartForce
Employee Plans that are intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code have received determination letters from the IRS to the effect that such
SmartForce Employee Plans are qualified and the plans and trusts related
thereto are exempt from federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and
501(a), respectively, of the Code, no such determination letter has been
revoked and revocation has not been threatened, and no such Employee Benefit
Plan has been amended or operated since the date of its most recent
determination letter or application therefor in any respect, and no act or
omission has occurred, that would adversely affect its qualification
or materially increase its cost. Each SmartForce Employee Plan which is
required to satisfy Section 401(k)(3) or Section 401(m)(2) of the Code had
been tested for compliance with, and satisfies the requirements of Section
401(k)(3) and Section 401(m)(2) of the Code, as the case may be, for each
plan year ending prior to the Closing Date. All SmartForce Employee Plans
that are intended to be approved by the Irish Revenue Commissioners for the
purposes of Chapter 1 of Part 30 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 have
received approval letters from the Irish Revenue Commissioners and no such
approval letter has been revoked and, to SmartForce\'s knowledge, no event,
act or omission has occurred that would materially adversely affect such
approval.   (f) Neither SmartForce, any Subsidiary of SmartForce nor any of
their ERISA Affiliates (i) maintains, or has ever maintained, established,
sponsored, participated in or contributed to a SmartForce Employee Benefit
Plan which was ever subject to Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA
or (ii) is now, or has ever been, obligated to contribute to a "multiemployer
plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA). No SmartForce Employee
Plan is funded by, associated with or related to a "voluntary employee\'s
beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.
No SmartForce Employee Plan holds securities issued by SmartForce, any of
SmartForce\'s Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates.   (g) Each
SmartForce Employee Plan is amendable and terminable unilaterally by
SmartForce and any of SmartForce\'s Subsidiaries which are a party thereto or
covered thereby at any time without liability to SmartForce or any of its
Subsidiaries as a result thereof (other than for benefits accrued through the
date of termination or amendment and reasonable administrative expenses
related thereto) and no SmartForce Employee Plan, plan documentation
or agreement, summary plan description or other written communication
distributed generally to employees by its terms prohibits SmartForce or any
of its Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any such SmartForce Employee
Plan. The investment vehicles used to fund SmartForce Employee Plans may be
changed at any time without incurring a material sales charge, surrender fee
or other similar expense.   -39-     (h) Except as disclosed in
SmartForce SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, neither
SmartForce nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any oral or written (i)
agreement with any current or former shareholders, director, executive
officer or other key employee of SmartForce or any of its Subsidiaries (A)
the benefits of which are contingent, or the terms of which are materially
altered, upon the occurrence of a transaction involving SmartForce or any of
its Subsidiaries of the nature of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (B) providing any term of employment or compensation
guarantee or (C) providing severance benefits or other benefits after the
termination of employment of such director, executive officer or
key employee; (ii) agreement, plan or arrangement under which any person may
receive payments from SmartForce or any of its Subsidiaries that may be
subject to the tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or that constitute an
"excess parachute payment" for such person under Section 280G of the Code,
without regard to Section 280G(b)(4); or (iii) agreement or plan binding
SmartForce or any of its Subsidiaries, including any stock option plan, stock
appreciation right plan, restricted stock plan, stock purchase plan or
severance benefit plan, any of the benefits of which shall be increased, or
the vesting of the benefits of which shall be accelerated, by the occurrence
of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the value of any
of the benefits of which shall be calculated on the basis of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (i) None of the SmartForce
Employee Plans promises or provides retiree medical or other retiree welfare
benefits to any person, except as required by applicable law.   (j) None of
the SmartForce Benefit Plans is currently, nor has ever been, a "defined
benefit scheme" as defined in the Irish Pensions Act 1990.   4.16 Compliance
With Laws. SmartForce and each of its Subsidiaries has complied with, is not
in violation of, and has not received any notice alleging any violation with
respect to, any applicable provisions of any statute, law or regulation with
respect to the conduct of its business, or the ownership or operation of its
properties or assets, except for failures to comply or violations which,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had, and are not reasonably likely
to have, a SmartForce Material Adverse Effect.   4.17 Permits. SmartForce
and each of its Subsidiaries have all permits, licenses and franchises from
Governmental Entities required to conduct their businesses as now being
conducted or as presently contemplated to be conducted (the "SmartForce
Permits"), except for such permits, licenses and franchises the lack of
which, individually or in the aggregate, have not resulted in, and are not
reasonably likely to result in, a SmartForce Material Adverse
Effect. SmartForce and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of
the SmartForce Permits, except where the failure to so comply, individually
or in the aggregate, is not reasonably likely to have a SmartForce Material
Adverse Effect. No SmartForce Permit shall cease to be effective as a result
of the consummation of transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   4.18
Insurance. Each of SmartForce and its Subsidiaries maintains
insurance policies (the "SmartForce Insurance Policies") with reputable
insurance carriers against all risks of a character as are usually insured
against, and in such coverage amounts as are usually maintained, by similarly
situated companies in the same or similar businesses. Each SmartForce
Insurance Policy is in full force and effect. There is no material claim by
SmartForce or any of its   -40-    Subsidiaries pending under any
SmartForce Insurance Policy as to which coverage has been questioned, denied
or disputed by the underwriters thereof.   4.19 Opinion of Financial
Advisor. The financial advisor of SmartForce, Credit Suisse First Boston
Corporation, has delivered to SmartForce an opinion dated the date of this
Agreement to the effect, as of such date, that the Exchange Ratio is fair to
SmartForce from a financial point of view, a copy of which will be provided
to SkillSoft within one business day following the date of this
Agreement.   4.20 Rights Agreement. The entering into of this Agreement, the
SmartForce Shareholder Agreement or the SkillSoft Option Agreement does not
result in the ability of any person to exercise any of subscription rights
under the SmartForce Rights Plan or enable or require subscription rights
issued thereunder to separate from the shares of SmartForce to which they are
attached or to be triggered or become exercisable or cease to be redeemable.
SmartForce will take all necessary action to effect an amendment to the
SmartForce Rights Plan (the "SmartForce Rights Plan Amendment"), a signed
copy of which will be delivered to SkillSoft within five business days
following its execution (but in any event prior to the Effective Time) and
will take all other action necessary or appropriate so that the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the SmartForce
Shareholder Agreement and the SkillSoft Option Agreement do not result in the
ability of any person to exercise any of subscription rights under the
SmartForce Rights Plan or enable or require subscription rights issued
thereunder to separate from the shares of SmartForce to which they are
attached or to be triggered or become exercisable or cease to be
redeemable.   4.21 Brokers. No agent, broker, investment banker, financial
advisor or other firm or person is or shall be entitled, as a result of any
action, agreement or commitment of SmartForce or any of its Affiliates, to
any broker\'s, finder\'s, financial advisor\'s or other similar fee or
commission in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation, whose fees and

case of SkillSoft, the adoption of this Agreement at the SkillSoft Meeting
or, (2) in the case of SmartForce, the approval of the SmartForce Voting
Proposal at the SmartForce Meeting (in each case, the "Specified Time"),
SkillSoft or SmartForce may, to the extent required by their respective
fiduciary obligations, as determined in good faith by the SkillSoft Board or
the SmartForce Board, as the case may be, after consultation with outside
counsel, in response to a Superior Proposal (as defined in Section 6.1(f))
that did not result from a breach by SkillSoft or SmartForce, as the case may

any Representative of SkillSoft or SmartForce, as the case may be, or any of
their Subsidiaries, whether or not such person is purporting to act on behalf

or   (iii) adopt, approve or recommend, or propose to adopt, approve or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
SkillSoft Board or the SmartForce Board may, in response to a Superior
Proposal that did not result from a breach by SkillSoft or SmartForce, as the
case may be, of this Section 6.1, withdraw or modify its recommendation with
respect to the SkillSoft Voting Proposal or the SmartForce Voting Proposal,
as the case may be, if the SkillSoft Board or the SmartForce Board, as the
case may be, determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel) that its fiduciary obligations require it to do so, but only at a
time that is prior to the Specified Time and is after the fifth business day
following receipt by SmartForce (if SkillSoft has received a Superior
Proposal) or SkillSoft (if SmartForce has received a Superior Proposal) of
written notice advising it that the SkillSoft Board or the SmartForce
Board, as the case may be, desires to withdraw or modify the recommendation
due to the existence of a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms
and conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying the person making
such Superior Proposal. Nothing in this Section 6.1 shall be deemed to (A)
permit SkillSoft or SmartForce to take any action described in clauses (ii)
or (iii) of the first sentence of this Section 6.1(b), (B) affect any
obligation of SkillSoft or SmartForce under this Agreement or (C) limit
SkillSoft\'s or SmartForce\'s obligation to call, give notice of, convene and

regardless of whether the SkillSoft Board or the SmartForce Board, as the
case may be, has withdrawn or modified its recommendation.   (c) Notices;
Additional Negotiations. Each party shall immediately advise the other party
orally, with written confirmation to follow promptly (and in any event within

any Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and the identity of the person making any
such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. Neither party shall provide any
information to or participate in discussions or negotiations with the person
or entity making any Superior Proposal until two business days after such
party has first notified the other party of such Acquisition Proposal as
required by the preceding sentence. The party receiving an Acquisition
Proposal shall (i) keep the other party fully informed, on a current basis,
of the status and details (including any change to the terms) of any such
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, (ii) provide to the other party as soon as
practicable after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all correspondence
and other written material sent or provided to the party receiving an

with any Superior Proposal, and (iii) if the other party shall make a
counterproposal, consider and cause its financial and legal advisors to
negotiate on its behalf in good faith with respect to the terms of such
counterproposal. Contemporaneously with providing any information to a third
party in connection with any such Superior Proposal or inquiry, the

such information to the other party to the extent that such copy has not
previously been provided to the other party. In addition to the foregoing,

the definitive documentation relating to such Superior Proposal to the extent
that such copy has not previously been provided to the other party.   (d)

Section 6.5 shall be deemed to prohibit either party from taking
and disclosing to its stockholders a position with respect to a tender
offer contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or
the provisions of the Irish Takeover Panel Act of 1997 or any rules or
directions made by the Irish Takeover Panel thereunder or any direction or
ruling of the Irish Takeover Panel with regard to an Acquisition Proposal,
if, in the good faith judgment of the SkillSoft Board or the SmartForce
Board, as the case may be, based on the advice of outside counsel, failure to
so disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable
law.   (e) Cessation of Ongoing Discussions. Each party shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, cease

independent financial advisor), taking into account all the terms and
conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any proposal by
either   -50-    party to amend the terms of this Agreement) and (ii)
that is reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed, taking
into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such

shall give the other party the opportunity to participate in the defense or
settlement of any stockholder litigation relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall not settle any
such litigation without the other party\'s prior written consent, which will
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.   6.13 Indemnification.   (a)
From and after the Effective Time, SmartForce shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, cause the Surviving Corporation, for a period of six years
from the Effective Time, to, indemnify and hold harmless each present and
former director and officer of SkillSoft (the "Indemnified Parties"), against
any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or amounts paid in settlement
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent that SkillSoft would have been
permitted under Delaware law and its Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws
in effect on the date hereof to indemnify an Indemnified Party (and
SmartForce and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, provided the
Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified
Party is not entitled to indemnification). Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, SmartForce acknowledges and agrees that the litigation
described in SkillSoft\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended January 31, 2002 constitutes litigation to which the directors,
officers and employees of SkillSoft named as defendants therein are entitled
to indemnification in accordance with the terms of Delaware law
and/or SkillSoft\'s Certificate of Incorporation (provided they satisfy the
conditions for litigation set forth therein), and SmartForce agrees, subject
to the terms of Delaware law and/or SkillSoft\'s Certificate of
Incorporation, to cause the Surviving Corporation to continue to reimburse
such defendants for the cost of such litigation, including without limitation
the reasonable fees and expenses of the attorneys currently retained by such
defendants in connection with the defense of such litigation.   (b) For a
period of six years after the Effective Time, SmartForce shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain (to the extent available in the market) in
effect a directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy covering those
persons who are currently covered by SkillSoft\'s directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance policy (a copy of which has been heretofore delivered or
made available to SmartForce) with coverage in amount and scope at least
as   -56-    favorable to such persons as SkillSoft\'s existing
coverage; provided, that in no event shall SmartForce or the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend in excess of 150% of the annual premium
currently paid by SkillSoft for such coverage; provided, further, that if the
annual premium exceeds such amount, SmartForce will cause the Surviving
Corporation to obtain as much coverage as possible for such amount.   (c)
The provisions of this Section 6.13 are intended to be in addition to the
rights otherwise available to the current officers and directors of SkillSoft
by law, charter, statute, bylaw or agreement, and shall operate for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified
Parties, their heirs and their representatives.   6.14 Notification of
Certain Matters. SmartForce shall give prompt notice to SkillSoft, and
SkillSoft shall give prompt notice to SmartForce, of the occurrence, or
failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure to occur would be
reasonably likely to cause (a) (i) any representation or warranty of such
party contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality to be
untrue or inaccurate in any respect or (ii) any other representation
or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect, in each case at any time from and after
the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, or (b) any material
failure of SmartForce and the Transitory Subsidiary or SkillSoft, as the case
may be, or of any officer, director, employee or agent thereof, to comply
with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, the delivery
of any notice pursuant to this Section will not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the
conditions to such party\'s obligation to consummate the Merger.   6.15

a committee thereof consisting of non-employee directors (as such term is

SkillSoft Insiders (as defined below) of SmartForce securities in exchange
for shares of SkillSoft Common Stock, and of options to purchase SmartForce
securities upon assumption and conversion of SkillSoft Stock Options, in each
case pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby and to the extent such

securities, or options to purchase SmartForce securities, in each case, in

under any SmartForce Employee Plans, (ii) determination of benefits levels
under any SmartForce Employee Plan or policy relating to vacation or
severance and (iii) determination of "retiree" status under any SmartForce
Employee Plan, in each case for which the Continuing Employee is otherwise
eligible and in which the Continuing Employee is offered participation, but
except where such crediting would (A) result in a duplication of benefits or
(B) otherwise cause SmartForce or its Subsidiaries or any SmartForce Employee
Plan or trust relating thereto to accrue or pay for benefits that relate to
any time period prior to the Continuing Employee\'s participation in the
SmartForce Employee Plan. SmartForce agrees that each Continuing Employee
shall be eligible to either: (i) participate in SmartForce Employee Plans as
permitted by the terms of such SmartForce Employee Plans, (ii) participate in
SkillSoft Employee Plans that are continued by SmartForce, or (iii) a
combination of clauses (i) and (ii) so that each Continuing Employee is

any and all group severance, separation or salary continuation plans,
programs or arrangements and any and all plans intended to include a Code
Section 401(k) arrangement (unless SmartForce consents, as evidenced by
written notice to SkillSoft, to the continuation of any such plan, program or
arrangement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) (collectively,
"SkillSoft Terminating Plan(s)"). SmartForce agrees that the Continuing
Employees shall be eligible to participate, to the extent they were eligible
to participate in the SkillSoft Terminating Plan, in a comparable SmartForce
plan, program or arrangement, as promptly following the Effective Time as is
permitted by the terms of such SmartForce plan, program or arrangement.

three business days prior to   -58-    the Effective Time, SkillSoft
shall provide SmartForce with evidence that such SkillSoft Terminating
Plan(s) have been terminated (effective as of the day immediately preceding

Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits hereto
and the documents and instruments referred to herein that are to be delivered
at the Closing) constitutes the entire agreement among the parties to this
Agreement and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements
or representations by or among the parties hereto, or any of them, written or

Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its
terms.   9.4 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in Section
6.13, this Agreement is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to confer any
rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, to create any agreement of
employment with any person or to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary
hereto.   9.5 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated,
in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties
hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such
assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void. Subject
to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.   9.6 Severability. Any term or provision
of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any
jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining
terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the
offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other
jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable,
the   -68-    parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In
the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior
sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such invalid or unenforceable term.   9.7 Counterparts and Signature. This
Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original but all of which together shall be considered one and the
same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed
by each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties, it being
understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. This
Agreement may be executed and delivered by facsimile transmission.   9.8

other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws of any
jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware.   9.10 Remedies.
Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of
any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and
the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that   -69-    irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
