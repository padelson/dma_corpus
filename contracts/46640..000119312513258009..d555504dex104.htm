governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought
or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be
sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "
_Indemnified Person_ ") shall promptly notify the person against whom such
indemnification may be sought (the " _Indemnifying Person_ ") in writing;
_provided_ that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not
relieve it from any liability that it may have under paragraph (a) or (b)
above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the
forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and _provided_
, _further_ , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not
relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person
otherwise than under paragraph (a) or (b) above. If any such proceeding shall
be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have
notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not,
without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying
Person) to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Section 7 that the Indemnifying Person may
designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related

 



26  to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified
Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person
unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have
mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed
within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably
concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different
from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv)
the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties)
include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and the
Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that representation of both
parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential
differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the
Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related
proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of
more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all
Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed
as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Initial Purchaser,
its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such
Initial Purchaser shall be designated in writing by Wells Fargo Securities,
LLC and any such separate firm for Merger Sub, the Company, the Guarantors,
their respective directors and officers and any control persons of Merger
Sub, the Company and the Guarantors shall be designated in writing by the
Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any
proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such
consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying
Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss
or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying Person
shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any
settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any
Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could
have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement
(x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all
liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y)
does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or
a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.

 

(d) _Contribution._ If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and
(b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect
of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each
Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such
Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable
by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative
benefits received by Merger Sub, the Company and the Guarantors on the one
hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other from the offering of the
Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted
by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only
the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault
of Merger Sub, the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Initial
Purchasers on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that
resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by Merger
Sub, the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers
on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the
net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by Merger Sub from the sale
of the Securities and the total discounts and commissions received by the
Initial Purchasers in connection therewith, as provided in this Agreement,
bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of
Merger Sub, the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Initial
Purchasers on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other
things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or
the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to
information supplied by Merger Sub, the Company or any Guarantor or by the
Initial Purchasers and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
For

 



27  the avoidance of doubt, until the Company, the Guarantors or their
respective directors, officers and control persons are entitled to
indemnification from the Initial Purchasers under Section 7(b) above, they
are not entitled to contribution under this Section 7(d).

(e) _Limitation on Liability. _ Merger Sub, the Company, the Guarantors and
the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by _pro_ _rata_
allocation (even if the Initial Purchasers were treated as one entity for
such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account
of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount
paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims,
damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to
include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other
expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any
such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no
event shall an Initial Purchaser be required to contribute any amount in
excess of the amount by which the total discounts and commissions received by
such Initial Purchaser with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds
the amount of any damages that such Initial Purchaser has otherwise been
required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation. The Initial Purchasers obligations to
contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their
respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.

(f) _Non-Exclusive Remedies._ The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are
not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be
available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.

8\. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated in the absolute discretion
of the Representatives, by notice to Merger Sub, if after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and on or prior to the Closing Date (i) trading
generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on the New York
Stock Exchange or the over-the-counter market; (ii) trading of any securities
issued or guaranteed by the Company or any of the Guarantors shall have been
suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market; (iii) a general
moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by
federal or New York State authorities; or (iv) there shall have occurred any
outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or
any calamity or crisis, either within or outside the United States, that, in
the judgment of the Representatives is material and adverse and makes it
impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery,
of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this
Agreement, the Time of Sale Information and the Offering Memorandum.

9\. _Defaulting Initial Purchaser_. (a) If, on the Closing Date, any Initial
Purchaser defaults on its obligation to purchase the Securities that it has
agreed to purchase hereunder, the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers may in
their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Securities by other persons
satisfactory to Merger Sub on the terms contained in this Agreement. If,
within 36 hours after any such default by any Initial Purchaser, the non-
defaulting Initial Purchasers do not arrange for the purchase of
such Securities, then Merger Sub shall be entitled to a further period of 36
hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting
Initial Purchasers to purchase such Securities on such terms. If other persons
become obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Initial
Purchaser, either the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers or Merger Sub may
postpone the Closing Date for up to five full business days in order to effect
any changes that in the opinion of counsel for Merger Sub or counsel for the
Initial Purchasers may be necessary in the Time of Sale Information, the
Offering Memorandum or in any other document or arrangement, and Merger Sub
and the Company agree to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the
Time of Sale Information or the Offering Memorandum that

 



28  effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term "Initial
Purchaser" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context
otherwise requires, any person not listed in _Schedule 1_ hereto that,
pursuant to this Section 9, purchases Securities that a defaulting Initial
Purchaser agreed but failed to purchase.

(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the
Securities of a defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers by the non-
defaulting Initial Purchasers and Merger Sub as provided in paragraph (a)
above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains
unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of
all the Securities, then Merger Sub shall have the right to require each non-
defaulting Initial Purchaser to purchase the principal amount of Securities
that such Initial Purchaser agreed to purchase hereunder plus such Initial
Purchasers _pro_ _rata_ share (based on the principal amount of Securities
that such Initial Purchaser agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of
such defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers for which such
arrangements have not been made.

 

(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the
Securities of a defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers by the
non-defaulting Initial Purchasers and Merger Sub as provided in paragraph (a)
above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains
unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all
the Securities, or if Merger Sub shall not exercise the right described in
paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on
the part of the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers. Any termination of this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 9 shall be without liability on the part
of Merger Sub, the Company or the Guarantors, except that Merger Sub, the
Company and each of the Guarantors will continue to be liable for the payment
of expenses as set forth in Section 10 hereof and except that the provisions
of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.

 

(d) Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Initial Purchaser of
any liability it may have to Merger Sub, the Company, the Guarantors or any
non-defaulting Initial Purchaser for damages caused by its default.

10\. _Payment of Expenses_ __. (a) Whether or not the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is
terminated, each of Holdings and Merger Sub jointly and severally agrees and,
upon the execution and delivery of the Joinder Agreement, the Company and
each of the Guarantors jointly and severally agree to pay or cause to be paid
all costs and expenses incident to the performance of their respective
obligations hereunder, including without limitation, (i) the costs incident to
the authorization, issuance, sale, preparation and delivery of the Securities
and any transfer and other stamp, excise or similar taxes payable in that
connection; (ii) the costs incident to the preparation and printing of the
Preliminary Offering Memorandum, any other Time of Sale Information, any
Issuer Written Communication and the Offering Memorandum (including any
amendment or supplement thereto) and the distribution thereof; (iii) the costs
of reproducing and distributing each of the Transaction Documents and the
fees and expenses attributable to creating and perfecting the security
interest in the Escrowed Property as contemplated by the Escrow Agreement
(including the reasonable related fees and expenses of counsel for
the Initial Purchasers for all periods prior to and after the Closing Date);
(iv) the fees and expenses of Merger Subs, the Companys and the Guarantors
counsel and independent accountants; (v) the fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the registration or qualification and determination of
eligibility for investment of the Securities under the laws of such
jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate and the preparation,
printing and distribution of a "blue sky" memorandum (including the related
fees and expenses of counsel for the Initial Purchasers); (vi) any fees
charged by rating agencies for rating the Securities; (vii) the fees and
expenses of the Trustee, the Collateral Agent, any paying agent and the
Escrow Agent (including related fees and expenses of any counsel to such
parties); (viii) all

 



29  expenses and fees incurred in connection with the approval of the Securities
for book-entry transfer by DTC; (ix) all expenses incurred by Merger Sub and
the Company in connection with any "road show" presentation to potential
investors; and (x) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with creating,
documenting and perfecting the security interests in the Collateral as
contemplated by the Collateral Documents (including the reasonable related
fees and expenses of counsel for the Initial Purchasers for all periods prior
to and after the Closing Date).

(b) If (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8, (ii) Merger Sub
for any reason fails to tender the Securities for delivery to the Initial
Purchasers or (iii) the Initial Purchasers decline to purchase the Securities
for any reason permitted under this Agreement, each of Holdings and Merger Sub
jointly and severally agrees, and, upon execution and delivery of the Joinder
Agreement, the Company and each of the Guarantors jointly and severally agree
to reimburse the Initial Purchasers for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including the fees and expenses of their counsel) reasonably incurred by the
Initial Purchasers in connection with this Agreement and the offering
contemplated hereby.

11\. _Persons Entitled to Benefit of Agreement_. This Agreement shall inure to
the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective
successors and any controlling persons referred to herein, and the affiliates,
officers and directors of each Initial Purchaser referred to in Section 7
hereof. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give
any other person any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in
respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein. No purchaser of
Securities from any Initial Purchaser shall be deemed to be a successor
merely by reason of such purchase.

12\. _Survival_. The respective indemnities, rights of contribution,
representations, warranties and agreements of Merger Sub, the Company, the
Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers contained in this Agreement or made by
or on behalf of Merger Sub, the Company, the Guarantors or the
Initial Purchasers pursuant to this Agreement or any certificate delivered
pursuant hereto shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Securities
and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination of
this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of Merger Sub, the
Company, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers.

13\. _Certain Defined Terms_. For purposes of this Agreement, (a) except
where otherwise expressly provided, the term "affiliate" has the meaning set
forth in Rule 405 under the Securities Act; (b) the term "business day"
means any day other than a day on which banks are permitted or required to be
closed in New York City; (c) the term "subsidiary" has the meaning set forth

26, 2001)), the Initial Purchasers are required to obtain, verify and record
information that identifies their respective clients, including the Merger
Sub, the Company and the Guarantors, which information may include the name
and address of their respective clients, as well as other information that
will allow the Initial Purchasers to properly identify their respective
clients. 

15\. _Miscellaneous_. (a) _Authority of the Representatives._ Any action by
the Initial Purchasers hereunder may be taken by Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
on behalf of the Initial Purchasers, and any such action taken by Wells Fargo

Schedule 3-4  Schedule 4

_Post-Escrow Release Collateral Requirements_

Within 90 days of the Escrow Release Date, the Collateral Agent shall have
received each of the following, in each case, in form and substance as shall
be reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent and its counsel:

 

(i) with respect to each Mortgaged Property, a Mortgage granted by the owner
of the applicable Mortgaged Property in favor of the Collateral Agent for its
benefit and for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the Securities
encumbering each such partys fee interest in such Mortgaged Property, duly
executed and acknowledged by such party in form for recording in the
appropriate recording office of the political subdivision where such Mortgaged
Property is situated, together with such certificates, affidavits,
questionnaires or returns as shall be required in connection with the
recording or filing thereof and such financing statements and other similar
statements in respect of each such Mortgage, and any other instruments
necessary to grant the interests purported to be granted by each such Mortgage
(and to record such Mortgage in the appropriate recording offices) under the
laws of any applicable jurisdiction, which Mortgage, financing statements and
other instruments shall be in form and substance substantially similar to the
mortgages, financing statements and other instruments delivered to the
collateral agent under the New Credit Facilities and effective to create a
valid and enforceable second priority lien on such Mortgaged Property in favor
of the Collateral Agent for its benefit and for the benefit of the Trustee and
the holders of the Securities, subject to no liens other than Permitted
Liens, Permitted Exceptions, and the Enforceability Exceptions;

(ii) with respect to each Mortgage encumbering any Mortgaged Property, a
policy of title insurance (or irrevocable commitment to issue such a policy)
insuring (or irrevocably committing to insure) the lien of such Mortgage as a
valid and enforceable second priority mortgage or mortgage deed lien, as
applicable, on the real property and fixtures described therein, in favor of
the Collateral Agent for its benefit and for the benefit of the Trustee and
the holders of the Securities, securing the obligations of the Company and the
Guarantors under the Indenture, the Securities, the Collateral Documents and
the Intercreditor Agreement, in an amount equal to the proportionate amount
allocated to such Mortgaged Property in connection with the mortgagees
policy of title insurance covering the mortgage lien securing the obligations
under the New Credit Facilities and which policy (or irrevocable commitment)
shall (a) be issued by a title insurance company reasonably acceptable to the
Collateral Agent (the " _Title Company_ "), (b) be in form and substance
substantially similar to the applicable mortgaged policy delivered to the
collateral agent under the New Credit Facilities and (d) contain no defects,
liens or encumbrances other than Permitted Liens, Permitted Exceptions, and
the Enforceability Exceptions (individually, a " _Mortgaged Policy_ ", and,
collectively, " _Mortgaged Policies_ ");

(iii) with respect to each Mortgaged Property, (a) a survey of the Mortgaged
Property certified by the surveyor (in a manner reasonably acceptable to the
Collateral Agent) to the Collateral Agent and the Title Company or (b) an
existing survey with an "affidavit of no change" satisfactory to the Title
Company in order to obtain survey coverage under the applicable Mortgaged
Policy, in each case, in form and substance substantially similar to the
applicable survey delivered to the collateral agent under the New Credit
Facilities;

 

(iv) policies or certificates of insurance covering the Mortgaged Properties,
and any other assets of the Company and the Guarantors as required by the
Indenture and the Collateral Documents,

 



Exhibit A-1   which policies or certificates name the Collateral Agent, for its benefit
and the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the Securities, as
additional insured and loss payee and mortgagee, as applicable and
appropriate, and shall otherwise be in form and substance substantially
similar to the policies or certificates of insurance delivered to the
collateral agent under the New Credit Facilities;

 

(v) such affidavits, certificates and instruments of indemnification and other
items (including a so-called "gap" indemnification) as shall be reasonably
required to induce the Title Company to issue the Mortgaged Policies with
respect to each Mortgaged Property, provided that such affidavits,
certificates and instruments of indemnification and other items shall be in
form and substance substantially similar to those delivered to the collateral
agent under the New Credit Facilities;

(vi) checks or wire transfers to the Title Company in respect of amounts in
payment of required recording cost and taxes due in respect of the execution,
delivery or recording of the Mortgages, fixture filings and related
documents, together with a check or wire transfer for the Title Company in
payment of its premium, search and examination charges, applicable survey
costs and any other amounts then due in connection with the issuance of
the Mortgaged Policies;

(vii) with respect to each Mortgaged Property, opinions, addressed to the
Collateral Agent and the Trustee regarding the due execution and delivery and
enforceability of each such Mortgage, the corporate formation, existence and
good standing of the applicable mortgagor, and such other matters as may be
reasonably requested by the Collateral Agent, each in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, provided that such opinions
shall be in form and substance substantially similar to the opinions delivered
to the collateral agent under the New Credit Facilities; 

(viii) such further information, certificates and documents evidencing or
relating to the Collateral or required to effect the foregoing as the
Collateral Agent may reasonably request including, without limitation, such
information, certificates and documents substantially similar in form and
substance to those delivered to the collateral agent under the New
Credit Facilities.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is understood that, to the
extent any security interest in any Collateral is not or cannot be provided
and/or perfected on the Escrow Release Date (other than the pledge and
perfection of the security interest in the equity interests of the Issuer and
each of its direct wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries and other
assets pursuant to which a lien may be perfected by the filing of a financing
statement under the Uniform Commercial Code) after your use of commercially
reasonable efforts to do so or without undue burden or expense, then
the provision and/or perfection of a security interest in such Collateral
shall be required to be delivered after the Escrow Release Date pursuant to
arrangements and timing substantially similar in form and substance to that
mutually agreed to by the administrative agent under the New Credit
Facilities and the Issuer pursuant to the New Credit Facilities Documentation.
