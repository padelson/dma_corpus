for dollar, by which the Closing Net Cash Amount is less than the Preliminary
Net Cash Amount or (ii) increased by the amount, dollar for dollar, by which
the Closing Net Cash Amount is greater than the Preliminary Net Cash Amount.

 



16 (c) Without duplication of any adjustment made pursuant to _Sections 2.6(a)_

(e) The net amount of all sums that are an increase or decrease to the
Preliminary Purchase Price as contemplated by _Section 2.6(a)_, _Section
2.6(b)_, _Section 2.6(c)_ and _Section 2.6(d)_, as finally determined
pursuant to this _Section 2.6(e)_ and _Section 2.6(f)_ below, is referred
to herein as the " _Adjustment Amount_." Within ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, the Buyer shall cause to be prepared and delivered to the
Representative a statement (the " _Adjustment Statement_ ") setting forth in
reasonable detail its good faith calculation of (i) the Closing Net Working
Capital, (ii) the Closing Net Cash Amount, (iii) the Company Transaction
Expenses, if any, (iv) the Closing Company Indebtedness, if any, and (v) the
Adjustment Amount.

(f) After receipt of the Adjustment Statement, the Representative shall have
thirty (30) days to review the Adjustment Statement together with the work
papers used in its preparation. The Adjustment Statement shall become final,
conclusive and binding upon the Parties thirty (30) days following receipt
thereof by the Representative unless the Representative gives written notice
of its disagreement (the " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to the Buyer prior to
such date. The Buyer shall give the Representative, the Sellers and their
authorized representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours of
the Company, to personnel, books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and all work papers of the Company and its Subsidiaries prepared
in connection with the Adjustment Statement as reasonably requested by the
Representative to assist in the preparation of the Notice of Disagreement. The
Notice of Disagreement shall only include disagreements based on mathematical
errors or based on the items included therein not being calculated in
accordance with this Agreement. Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify in
reasonable detail (i) the nature and amount of any disagreement so asserted,
(ii) the Representatives calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital,
(iii) the Representatives calculation of the Closing Net Cash Amount, (iv)
the Representatives calculation of the amount of the Company Transaction
Expenses, (v) the Representatives calculation of the amount of the Closing

representatives of the Buyer and the Representative shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve any disagreements properly included in the Notice of
Disagreement. During such period, the Buyer shall have full access to the work
papers of the Representative prepared in connection with the Representatives
preparation of the Notice of Disagreement. At the end of such thirty (30) day
period, at the request of any Party, any and all matters which remain in 

 



17  dispute and which were properly included in the Notice of Disagreement shall
be submitted for binding resolution to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (the "
_Accounting Firm_ "), or, if such firm is unable or unwilling to act, such
other nationally recognized independent public accounting firm as shall be
agreed upon by the Parties in writing. The fees and expenses of the Accounting
Firm shall be borne by the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the
other hand, in the proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of items
submitted to the Accounting Firm that are unsuccessfully disputed by the Buyer
and the Representative, as applicable, bears to the aggregate dollar amount
of all items submitted to the Accounting Firm. In the event that the
Representative delivers a Notice of Disagreement to the Buyer within the
thirty (30) day period following receipt by the Representative of the
Adjustment Statement, then the Adjustment Statement shall become final,
conclusive and binding upon the Parties on the earlier of (A) the date such
Parties resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to any
matter included in the Notice of Disagreement or (B) the date any disputed
matters are finally resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm as set forth
herein.

(g) The Accounting Firm shall determine and report in writing to the Buyer
and the Representative as to the resolution of all disputed matters submitted
to the Accounting Firm and the effect of such determinations on the Adjustment
Statement within ten (10) Business Days after such submission or such longer
period as the Accounting Firm may reasonably require, and such determinations
shall be final, conclusive and binding as to the Parties. In resolving any
disputed item, the Accounting Firm, acting in the capacity of an expert and
not as an arbitrator: (i) shall limit its review to matters specifically set
forth in the Notice of Disagreement delivered pursuant to _Section 2.6(f)_
and submitted to the Accounting Firm as a disputed item (other than matters
thereafter resolved by mutual written agreement of the Buyer and the
Representative), (ii) shall further limit its review to whether the
calculation of any such disputed item is mathematically accurate and has been
calculated in accordance with this Agreement, and (iii) shall not assign a
value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by any
Party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by any other Party
in the Adjustment Statement or in the Notice of Disagreement delivered
pursuant to _Section 2.6(f)_. The Buyer and the Representative shall each
furnish to the Accounting Firm such work papers and other documents and
information relating to the disputed issues, and shall provide interviews and
answer questions, as the Accounting Firm may reasonably request in connection
with its determination of such disputed items.

(h) The Preliminary Purchase Price as adjusted by the Adjustment Amount, if at
all, as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.6_ shall be referred
to herein as the " _Final Purchase Price_."

(i) If upon determination of the Adjustment Amount, (i) the Final Company
Purchase Price is greater than the Preliminary Company Purchase Price, then
the Buyer shall pay to each Seller an amount in cash equal to such Sellers
_Pro Rata_ Share of such excess (or, if the Buyer elects to proceed with the
Alternative Transaction pursuant to _Section 6.22_, to Holdings LLC an
amount in cash equal to such excess), or (ii) the Final Company Purchase Price
is less than the Preliminary Company Purchase Price, then the Sellers shall,
on a joint and several basis, pay to the Buyer (or, if the Buyer elects to
proceed with the Alternative Transaction pursuant to _Section 6.22_, the
Sellers shall cause Holdings LLC to pay to the Buyer)

 



18  an aggregate amount in cash equal to the amount of such deficit. All
payments to be made pursuant to this _Section 2.6(i)_ shall be made on or
before the fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which the
Adjustment Amount is finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.6_. Any
payment required to be made by the Buyer or the Sellers (or Holdings LLC)
pursuant to this _Section 2.6(i)_ shall be payable together with interest
accruing from the Closing Date to the date of payment at the Applicable Rate
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated by the Party or Parties entitled to receive such funds at least
three (3) Business Days prior to the date on which such payment is due and
payable in accordance with this _Section 2.6(i)_.

Section 2.7. _Withholding_. The Buyer and the Company shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such consideration payments under the Code, or under
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent amounts are so
withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for the purposes of the
Agreement as having been paid.

owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it
makes such qualification or license necessary, except in such jurisdictions
where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed or be in good standing,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has provided to or otherwise made available to the Buyer

Effect.

Section 4.2. ___Authorization_ __. Such Seller has the requisite limited

not have a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Neither the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by such
Seller, nor the consummation by such Seller or by the Company and its
Subsidiaries of the transactions contemplated hereby, will give rise to any
right of first offer or notice or any other right in favor of Stichting

Subsidiaries as the policies set forth in _Section 3.14(a)_ of the Disclosure
Letter; and

during the Exclusivity Period, neither the Sellers, the Company nor any of
their respective Affiliates shall (whether directly or indirectly through any
officer, director, employee, agent, advisor, partner, representative,

principle or other commitment (whether or not legally binding) relating to any

significant portion of the assets of, or any material equity interest in, the
Company or any portion thereof or relating to any other similar transaction

otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist or participate in, facilitate
or encourage, any effort or attempt by any Person to effect a Competing
Transaction. The " _Exclusivity Period_ " shall be the period commencing on
the date hereof and ending on the earlier of the Closing Date or the date on
which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the provisions hereof.

Section 6.3. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) During the period prior to the Closing, subject to restrictions under
applicable Laws and such restrictions as the Sellers reasonably believe to be
required to preserve attorney-client privilege or attorney work product
privilege, the Company shall permit the Buyer and its lenders and its and
their accountants, counsel and other representatives to have reasonable access
to the properties, books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries
during normal business hours to review information and documentation relative
to the properties, books, contracts, commitments and other records of the
Company and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ that such investigation shall only be
upon reasonable notice and shall not unreasonably disrupt personnel and
operations of the business of the Company or its Subsidiaries and shall be at
the Buyers sole cost and expense, and a representative of the Company shall
have the right to be present when the Buyer or its agents or representatives
conduct its or their investigations on such property; _provided_ , _further_
, that the Buyer shall not conduct any environmental sampling with respect to
the Owned Real Property or the Leased Real Property without prior consultation
with and written approval of the Company (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). All requests for access to the
offices, properties, books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall be made to 

 



47  such representatives of the Company as the Company shall designate, who
shall be solely responsible for coordinating all such requests and all access
permitted hereunder. It is further agreed that during the period prior to the
Closing neither the Buyer nor any of its agents or representatives shall
contact any of the employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries other than the
representatives designated pursuant to the preceding sentence or officers and
employees that the Buyer has had contact with in the course of its due
diligence review of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or any of the customers
or suppliers of the Company listed in _Section 3.22_ of the
Disclosure Letter or other Persons the Buyer knows to be customers or
suppliers of the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, whether in person or by telephone, mail or other means of
communication specifically directed to such Persons, without the specific
prior authorization of such representatives of the Company, such
authorizations not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. For
the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in the preceding sentence
shall restrict the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, Affiliates, agents or
representatives from contacting their respective current, former or
prospective customers or suppliers or any other Persons regarding matters that
do not relate to the Company or the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) During the period prior to the Closing, the Buyer will, and will cause
its Affiliates, agents and representatives to, hold in confidence all
nonpublic information obtained from the Sellers, the Company, its Subsidiaries
or their respective officers, agents, representatives or employees, whether or
not relating to the business, in accordance with the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement which, notwithstanding anything contained therein,
shall remain in full force and effect following the execution of this
Agreement and shall survive any termination of this Agreement in accordance
with the terms thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section
6.3(b)_ or in the Confidentiality Agreement shall prohibit the disclosure or
use of such information as contemplated in  _Section 6.5_ in connection with
the Buyers and WNRs arrangement of any financing to be consummated prior to
or contemporaneously with the Closing in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Timber SPA.

(c) Following the Closing, the Sellers shall, and shall cause their
Affiliates, agents and representatives, and their respective officers and
directors to, keep all confidential or proprietary information relating to the
Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, " _Company Confidential
Information_ ") confidential, and the Sellers shall not, and shall cause
their Affiliates, agents and representatives, and their respective officers
and directors not to, use any of such Company Confidential Information to the
detriment of the Company or its Subsidiaries, except to the extent that (i)
a Seller or any of the Persons referenced above receives a request to
disclose such information to a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over
such Seller or other Person referenced above, (ii) any applicable Law requires
otherwise, (iii) such disclosure is necessary for the enforcement of a
Sellers rights or the defense of a Seller in any legal, administrative,
regulatory or other proceeding, or (iv) such duty as to confidentiality is
waived in writing by the Buyer; _provided_ , with respect to subclauses (i)
and (ii), that if the disclosing Person is requested or required (by oral
question or request for information or documents in any legal proceeding,
interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar process) to
disclose any Company Confidential Information, then such Person will notify
the Buyer and the Company promptly of the request or requirement so that the
Buyer or the Company may seek an 

 



48  appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this
_Section 6.3(c)_, and if a protective order or other remedy is not available,
unless the Buyer waives compliance with the provisions of this _Section
6.3(c)_, then such Person may disclose to the Governmental Authority requiring
disclosure only that portion of the Company Confidential Information which
such Person is advised by its counsel is legally required to be disclosed,
and shall exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain reliable
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such portion.

 

Section 6.4. _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and applicable Law, each of the Parties shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable
under Laws or otherwise to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Timber SPA as soon as
practicable, including such actions or things as any other Party may
reasonably request in order to cause any of the conditions to such other
Partys obligation to consummate such transactions specified in _Article
VII_ to be fully satisfied. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Parties shall (and shall cause their respective directors, officers and
any Subsidiaries, and use their reasonable best efforts to cause their
respective Affiliates, employees, agents, attorneys, accountants and
representatives, and in the case of the Sellers, they shall cause the Company
and its Affiliates, employees, agents, attorneys, accountants
and representatives to) consult and fully cooperate with and provide
reasonable assistance to each other in (a) attempting to obtain all necessary
Consents, including the Required Consents, or other permission or action by,
and giving all necessary notices to and making all necessary filings,
meetings or appearances with and applications and submissions to, any
Governmental Authority or other Person, (b) attempting to lift any permanent
or preliminary injunction or restraining order or other similar order issued
or entered by any Governmental Authority (an " _Injunction_ ") of any type
referred to in _Section 7.1(a)_ in general, with respect to the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Timber SPA.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall any Party be obligated to (i)
pay any money to any Person or to offer or grant any other financial
accommodations to any Person in connection with its obligations under this
_Section 6.4_, except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, or (ii)
take any action set forth in _Section 6.6(c)_.

Section 6.5. _Cooperation with Financing_. Prior to the Closing, the Sellers
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to, and shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their respective officers, employees, agents, attorneys, accountants and other
representatives to use their commercially reasonable efforts to, cooperate
with the Buyer, in each case, at the sole expense of the Buyer, in connection
with the Buyers and WNRs arrangement of any financing to be consummated
prior to or contemporaneously with the Closing in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Timber SPA, including (a) any
refinancing or replacement of any existing facility, or the arrangement of any
new facility, for Indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiaries (including
one or more bridge loans, term loans or note offerings), (b) the Company
or its Subsidiaries entering into customary agreements, including
underwriting agreements, purchase agreements and commitment letters, in
connection with any financing, (c) participating in meetings, due diligence
sessions, lender presentations, road shows and

 



49  similar presentations, if any, to and with, among others, prospective
lenders, investors and rating agencies, (d) assisting in the Buyers
preparation of offering memoranda, rating agency presentations, bank
information memoranda, private placement memoranda, prospectuses and similar
documents, and all materials, including financial statements, projections and
_pro forma_ presentations, reasonably necessary or desirable in connection
therewith, (e) using commercially reasonable efforts to provide and execute
necessary documents and certificates (including certificates of the chief
financial officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) and obtain
comfort letters of accountants (including customary "negative assurance"
comfort), legal opinions and one or more opinions from KPMG LLC (or other
accountants or tax counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer) in
substantially the form of the REIT Opinion, (f) otherwise making available
documents and financial and other pertinent information relating to the
Company and its Subsidiaries (including information under "know your customer"
and anti-money laundering rules and regulations), and undertaking such other
actions in connection with the arrangement of any such financing, in the case
of each of (a) through (e), as may be reasonably requested by the Buyer;
_provided_ that the foregoing clauses (a) through (f) do not (i) unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
(ii) cause any representation or warranty in this Agreement or the Timber SPA
to be breached, (iii) cause any condition to Closing set forth in _Article
VII_ to fail to be satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of this Agreement,

Subsidiaries is a party or (iv) involve any binding commitment by the Company
or its Subsidiaries which commitment is not conditioned on the Closing and
does not terminate without liability to the Company upon the termination of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Company
or any Seller be obligated to pay any money to any Person or to offer or grant
any other financial or other accommodations to any Person in connection with
its obligations under this _Section 6.5_, and nothing in this  _Section
6.5_ shall obligate any Party to take any action set forth in _Section
6.6(c)_.

 

Section 6.6. _HSR Act Compliance; Government Approvals_.

 

(a) The Buyer, the Company and the Sellers shall timely and promptly cause to
be made all filings which may be required by the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, or any other applicable
Governmental Authority (collectively, the " _Antitrust Authority_ ") for the
satisfaction of the closing conditions set forth in _Article VII_ by each of
them and their respective Affiliates in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Timber SPA. If the
Parties determine that it is required by applicable Law, each of the Parties
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to file Notification and Report
Forms and related material with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the
Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice under the HSR Act
promptly after the execution of this Agreement pursuant to specific timing
and procedures to be agreed upon by the Parties. The Parties shall file any
similar applications required by any other applicable Governmental Authority
whose approval is required in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Timber SPA as promptly as
practicable following the execution of this Agreement. The Parties agree to,
and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates to, cooperate
and promptly respond to any requests of any Antitrust Authority for
information, and to use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain any
Consent of any Antitrust Authority required for the Closing (including
through 

 



50  compliance with the HSR Act, to the extent applicable). Each Party shall
furnish to the other Party such necessary information and assistance as such
other Party may reasonably request in connection with the preparation of any
necessary filings or submissions by it to any Antitrust Authority.

(b) Each of the Parties shall notify and keep each other Party advised as to
(i) any material communication from any Antitrust Authority regarding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Timber SPA and (ii) any
Action pending and known to such Party, or, to its Knowledge, threatened,
which challenges the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Timber SPA. Subject to the provisions of _Article IX_ , none of the Company,
the Sellers or the Buyer shall take any action inconsistent with its
obligations under this Agreement or, without prejudice to their respective
rights under this Agreement, which would materially hinder or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Timber SPA. Without in any way limiting the foregoing, the Parties will
consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views
of one another, in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or
on behalf of any Party in connection with proceedings before any Antitrust
Authority. In addition, except as may be prohibited by any Antitrust Authority
or by any applicable Law, in connection with any legal proceeding under or
relating to proceedings before any Antitrust Authority, each of the Parties
will permit authorized representatives of the other Party to be present at
each meeting or conference relating to any such legal proceeding and to have
access to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or
proposal made or submitted to any Antitrust Authority in connection with any
such legal proceeding. The Parties shall use reasonable commercial efforts to
share information protected from disclosure under the attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other
privilege pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ so as to preserve any applicable
privilege.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any formal written
objections are asserted by any Antitrust Authority with respect to the
substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Timber
SPA, or if any Action is instituted (or threatened in writing to be
instituted) by any Antitrust Authority or any other Person challenging any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Timber SPA, no Party
shall be obligated to litigate or contest any such Action, and no Party shall
be obligated to assent to, proffer to or agree to any settlements,
undertakings, consent decrees, stipulations, or any other agreements that
require such Party to: (i) sell, divest, license or otherwise dispose of, or
hold separate and agree to sell, divest, license or otherwise dispose of,
assets, categories of assets, businesses or portions of businesses of the
Company, the Buyer or their respective Subsidiaries; (ii) terminate existing
relationships, contractual rights or obligations of the Company, the Buyer or

with any other applications filed with any other Antitrust Authority for whom
approval is required in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Timber SPA shall be borne 50% by the Buyer and 50% by
the Sellers.

 



51 Section 6.7. _Public Announcements_. Except to the extent otherwise required
by Law or applicable stock exchange rules (and then, if legally permitted,
only after consultation among the Parties), none of the Parties will issue any
press release or make any other public announcements concerning the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Timber SPA or the
contents of this Agreement or the Timber SPA without the prior written consent
of the other Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned; _provided_ , _however_ , that each Party may make internal
announcements to its employees that are consistent with the Parties prior
public disclosures regarding the transactions contemplated hereby after
reasonable prior notice to and consultation with the other Parties. 

Section 6.8. _Notification of Certain Matters_.

 

(a) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, each Party will give prompt
written notice to the other Parties after it becomes aware of: (i) any
information that indicates that any of the representations or warranties of
any Party contained herein or in the Timber SPA are not true and correct, (ii)
the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event with respect to any Party which
will result, or has a reasonable prospect of resulting, in the failure of any
condition, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or the Timber SPA
to be complied with or satisfied, (iii) any failure of any Party to comply
with or satisfy any condition, covenant or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it hereunder, (iv) any notice or other communication from any
third party alleging that the Consent of such third party is or may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Timber SPA or that such transactions otherwise may violate the rights
of or confer remedies upon such third party, or (v) any filing or threatened
filing of any Action related to this Agreement or the Timber SPA or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

(b) Subject to _Section 6.8(c)_, prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers and
the Company shall have the right (but not the obligation) from time to time to
supplement the Disclosure Letter (each such supplement, a " _Supplemental
Disclosure Letter_ ") for the purpose of updating disclosures made therein to
reflect any facts or matters identified or occurring after the date hereof ("
_Disclosed Additional Matters_ "). The Sellers and the Company shall deliver
to the Buyer any Supplemental Disclosure Letters, prepared in accordance with
this _Section 6.8(b)_, setting forth separately the Disclosed Additional
Matters, promptly after senior management of the Company or the Sellers
becomes aware of the Disclosed Additional Matters and in any event no later
than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, except in the circumstances described in _Section 6.8(c)_, no
Disclosed Additional Matter shall qualify any covenants, representations or
warranties of the Company or the Sellers for the purpose of determining the
satisfaction of the conditions to Closing under _Section 7.3_ or whether the
Buyer Group is entitled to indemnification for breach of a covenant,
representation or warranty of the Company or the Sellers pursuant to _Section
8.1(a)(i)_ or _8.1(a)(ii)_.

(c) The Sellers and the Company shall promptly notify the Buyer in writing,
and in any event no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, if the Disclosed Additional Matters contained in the Supplemental
Disclosure Letters, individually or in the

 



52  aggregate, have caused any of the conditions to the Buyers obligation to
close set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ to fail to be satisfied and whether such
failure can be cured. If the Sellers and the Company give any such notice and
such notice states that the failure cannot be cured, the Buyer shall have the
right, exercisable within ten (10) Business Days of such notice from Buyer, to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 9.1(d)_ by delivering written
notice thereof to the Company. In the event that the Buyer waives such
termination right and the Closing occurs, the Disclosed Additional Matters
contained in the Supplemental Disclosure Letters shall be treated as if they
had been included in the Disclosure Letter as of the Closing Date for the
purpose of determining whether the Buyer Group is entitled to indemnification
for breach of a representation and warranty of the Company or the
Sellers pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)(ii)_.

Section 6.9. _Post-Closing Access; Preservation of Records_. 

(a) On the Closing Date, the Sellers shall deliver or cause to be delivered to
the Buyer all contracts, books, records, Tax Returns, documents and files of
the Company and its Subsidiaries in the possession of the Sellers or their
Affiliates, including records and files stored on computer disks or tapes or
any other storage medium relating to the business and operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries. From and after the Closing, the Buyer will make
or cause to be made available to the Sellers all books, records, Tax Returns
and documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to the period prior
to the Closing (and the assistance of employees responsible for such books,
records and documents) during regular business hours as may be reasonably
necessary for (i) investigating, settling, preparing for the defense or
prosecution of, defending or prosecuting any Action, (ii) preparing reports
to Governmental Authorities or (iii) such other purposes for which access to
such documents is reasonably believed by the Sellers to be necessary,
including preparing and delivering any accounting or other statement provided
for under this Agreement or otherwise, preparing Tax Returns or responding to
or disputing any Tax audit; _provided_ , _however_ , that access to such
books, records, Tax Returns, documents and employees shall only be upon
reasonable notice and shall not unreasonably disrupt personnel and operations
of the business of the Company or its Subsidiaries and shall be at the
Sellers sole cost and expense. The Buyer will cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to maintain and preserve all such Tax Returns, books, records and
other documents for a period equal to the lesser of (A) the Buyers standard
retention period, but not less than three (3) years after the Closing Date,
and (B) any applicable statutory or regulatory retention period, as the same
may be extended and, in each case, shall offer to transfer such records to the
Sellers at the end of any such period by providing the Sellers with not less
than twenty (20) days written notice of the Buyers intention to destroy or
dispose of such records with the Sellers to exercise its rights to obtain such
records within such twenty-(20)-day period.

 

(b) From and after the Closing, the Sellers will make or cause to be made
available to the Buyer all books, records and documents of the Sellers
relating to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries (and the
assistance of employees responsible for such books, records and documents)
during regular business hours for the same purposes, to the extent applicable,
as set forth in  _Section 6.9(a)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that access to
such books, records, documents and employees shall only be upon reasonable
notice and shall not unreasonably disrupt personnel and operations of the
business of the Sellers and shall be at the Buyers sole

 



53  cost and expense. The Sellers will maintain and preserve all such Tax
Returns, books, records and other documents for a period equal to the lesser
of (A) the Sellers standard retention period, but not less than three (3)
years after the Closing Date, and (B) any applicable statutory or regulatory
retention period, as the same may be extended and, in each case, shall offer
to transfer such records to the Buyer at the end of any such period by
providing the Buyer with not less than twenty (20) days written notice of the
Sellers intention to destroy or dispose of such records, with the Buyer to
exercise its rights to obtain such records within that twenty (20)-day
period.

Section 6.10. _Further Assurances_. The Company, the Sellers and the Buyer
each agree that from time to time after the Closing Date, they will execute
and deliver or cause their respective Affiliates to execute and deliver such
further instruments, and take (or cause their respective Affiliates to take)
such other action, as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes
and intents of this Agreement and the Timber SPA, including, in the case of
the Sellers, executing and delivering to the Buyer such assignments, deeds,
bills of sale, consents and other instruments as the Buyer or its counsel may
reasonably request as necessary or desirable for such purpose.

Section 6.11.  _Resignations; Appointments; Director and Officer
Indemnification_.

(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall cause to be delivered
to the Buyer duly signed resignations, effective immediately after the
Closing, of all directors of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, shall
take such other action as is necessary to accomplish the foregoing and shall,
at the request of the Buyer, take all action necessary to appoint such Persons
as shall be named by the Buyer not later than five (5) Business Days prior to
the Closing as directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries
effective simultaneously with the Closing.

(b) For six (6) years from and after the Closing, the Buyer shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to maintain indemnification provisions in its
organizational documents that are no less favorable to the officers and
directors of the Company or its Subsidiaries who held any such position prior
to the Closing (collectively, " _Indemnified Officers/Directors_ ") than
those in effect with respect to the Company or the applicable Subsidiary of
the Company immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement. The Buyer
shall cause to be obtained and maintained in effect, for a period of six (6)
years after the Closing, policies of directors and officers liability
insurance protecting the Indemnified Officers/Directors with coverages and
terms and conditions (including with respect to deductible amount and payment
of attorneys fees) that are no less favorable than those in policies
applicable to directors and officers of the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each
of the Parties agrees that from and after the Closing Date each Indemnified
Officer/Director shall be a third party beneficiary under this Agreement for
purposes of enforcing this _Section 6.11_.

 

(c) If subsequent to the Closing, the Buyer, the Company, any Subsidiary or
any of their respective successors or assigns, (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity in such consolidation

 



54  or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of the Buyer, the Company or the
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, honor the obligations set forth in this
_Section 6.11_.

(d) The obligations of the Buyer, the Company and the Subsidiaries under this
_Section 6.11_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner so as to
adversely affect any Person to whom this _Section 6.11_ applies without the
prior written consent of such affected Person.

Section 6.12.  _Release and Waiver by Each Seller_. Effective as of the
Closing Date, each Seller, on behalf of itself and its officers, directors,
employees, members, stockholders, partners, agents, successors, assigns and
Affiliates, hereby releases and discharges the Company and its Subsidiaries
and their former or present officers, directors, employees, stockholders,
agents, successors and assigns from, and hereby waives, any and all claims,
rights and causes of action of any kind or nature whatsoever that such Seller
may have had or may now have against the Company and its Subsidiaries, whether
known or unknown and whether arising under contract, tort, statute or
otherwise, other than any such claims, rights and causes of action arising
out of this Agreement or the Timber SPA (it being understood and agreed that
the foregoing shall not in any way limit or otherwise restrict any claims,
rights and causes of actions that such Seller may have against the Buyer or
the Company following the Closing arising out of, relating to or in
connection with this Agreement or the Timber SPA or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby).

Section 6.13. _The Buyer s Obligations with Respect to Employee Benefits_.

(a) After the Closing Date, subject to the other provisions of this _Section
6.13_, the Buyer agrees that for a period of at least one (1) year after the
Closing Date or, if shorter, until an employee is no longer employed by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, it will (and the Buyer will cause the
Company to) (i) provide individuals who are employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing (" _Continuing Employees_ ")
participating in medical or other welfare benefits prior to the Closing Date
with medical and other welfare benefits substantially similar in the aggregate
to those provided to similarly situated employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing Date (the Company Plans
providing such medical and other welfare benefits are listed in _Section
3.16(a)_ of the Disclosure Letter); (ii) provide Continuing Employees with a
wage and salary program no less favorable in the aggregate than that in place
immediately prior to the Closing Date; and (iii) provide Continuing Employees
participating in other Company-sponsored or Subsidiary-sponsored benefits
prior to the Closing Date with benefits substantially similar in the aggregate
to the corresponding benefits provided to similarly situated employees
immediately prior to the Closing Date (the Company Plans providing such other
benefits are listed in _Section 3.16(a)_ of the Disclosure Letter). In
addition, the Buyer agrees to cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to give
Continuing Employees service credit for all periods of employment with the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, prior to the Closing
Date for purposes of vesting and eligibility under any plan adopted or
maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date in which
such employees participate, but only to the extent required by Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be recognized to the
extent that

 



55  such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits. With respect
to the plan year in which the Closing occurs, the Buyer agrees to cause the
Company to waive any limitations with respect to Continuing Employees
regarding preexisting conditions and to give full credit for any co-payments
made and deductibles fully or partially satisfied prior to the Closing Date
under any welfare or other employee benefit plans maintained by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date for the benefit of eligible
Company employees, but only to the extent that such limitations were waived
and credit was given under the terms of the analogous Company Plan prior to
the Closing Date.

(b) From and after the Closing Date, the Company shall be responsible for the
administration of and shall assume any and all obligations arising under the
continuation coverage requirements of Section 4980B of COBRA for those plan
participants in, and beneficiaries under, a Company Plan subject to COBRA.

 

(c) During the period commencing on the date hereof and ending at the Closing,
the Buyer and the Sellers shall consult with each other before issuing any
communications or making any public statements to employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries regarding the effect of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby on their continued employment, and the Buyer and
the Sellers shall cooperate in good faith to determine whether any notice may
be required under the WARN Act, any successor United States federal Law, or
any other applicable plant closing notification law with respect to a layoff
or plant closing relating to the business of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Buyer shall assume all
obligations and liabilities for the provision of notice or payment in lieu of
notice or any applicable penalties with respect to the Continuing Employees
under such worker notification laws arising as a result of actions taken by
the Buyer on or after the Closing Date. The Sellers shall retain or assume

of notice or any applicable penalties with respect to the employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries under such worker notification laws arising as a
result of actions taken by the Sellers or their respective Affiliates on or
prior to the Closing Date. The Sellers (or their applicable Affiliates) shall
promptly provide the Buyer with such information as is reasonably requested by
the Buyer in order to determine whether any actions taken by the Sellers or
their respective Affiliates prior to the Closing Date will, if aggregated with
actions that may be taken by the Buyer or its Affiliates after the Closing
Date, require the provision of notice or payment in lieu of notice to the
Continuing Employees.

(d) To the extent permitted under applicable Law, the Company will permit
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries to carry over and take accrued
or earned, but unused, vacation days or time off with pay in accordance with
the applicable policies as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.13_, to the
extent necessary to comply with any Laws in foreign jurisdictions which
safeguard the rights of employees in transfers of undertakings, businesses or
parts of businesses, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall comply with their
respective obligations under such Laws.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.13_, express or implied: (A) shall
be construed to establish, amend, or modify any benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement; (B) shall alter or limit the ability of the Company,
the Buyer or any of their Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any benefit
plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established,
sponsored or maintained by any of them, on a basis that is not inconsistent
with the provisions set forth in this _Section 6.13_; (C) is intended to
confer upon any Person any right to employment or continued employment for
any period of time by reason of this Agreement, or any right to a particular
term or condition of employment; or (D) is intended to confer upon any Person
any other rights as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement. 

 



56 Section 6.14. _Senior Credit Agreement_. Between the date hereof and the

commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a written waiver, in a form
reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer (the " _Waiver_ "), from Metropolitan
Life Insurance Company and, to the extent necessary or appropriate, the other
lenders under the Senior Credit Agreement, waiving any terms or provisions of
the Senior Credit Agreement to the extent that the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Timber SPA would result
in a breach of or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, or give rise to any notification or consent requirement or any right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation, or to loss of a
material benefit under, such terms or provisions, including the transfer
restrictions contained in Section 3.9 of the Senior Credit Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall any Party be obligated to pay
any money to any Person or to offer or grant any other financial
accommodations to any Person in connection with its obligations under this
_Section 6.14_, except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement. If prior
to the Closing the Buyer or its Affiliates enter into discussions with
Metropolitan Life Insurance Company or any other lender under the Senior
Credit Agreement relating to any amendment or modification of the Senior
Credit Agreement, the Buyer shall provide notice thereof to the Sellers and
shall keep the Sellers and the Company reasonably informed of the status of
such discussions until the Closing Date.

Section 6.15. _Related Person Agreements_.

(a) The Sellers and the Company shall cause the repayment in full in cash at
or prior to the close of business on the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date of all related party accounts payable and related party accounts
receivable of the Company and its Subsidiaries (or, if the Buyer elects to
proceed with the Alternative Transaction pursuant to _Section 6.22_, all
related party accounts payable and related party accounts receivable of Timber
LLC and its Subsidiaries), including any amounts payable or receivable
pursuant to the contracts set forth in _Sections 3.13(a)(xiii)_ and

obligations thereunder, in each case effective on or prior to the Closing,
and (iii) that certain Second Amended and Restated Management Agreement, dated

to _Section 6.22_, at or promptly following the Closing, the Buyer shall pay,
or cause to be paid, to the Company in cash the amount of the Related Party
Payable included in Closing Company Indebtedness, which shall satisfy the
Related Party Payable in full.

Section 6.16. _Transition_. Except as contemplated in  _Section 6.15_,
before and after the Closing, no Seller shall take any action that is designed
or intended to have the effect of discouraging any lessor, licensor, customer,
supplier, or other business associate of the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries from maintaining the same business relationships with the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing as it maintained with the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing.

 

Section 6.17. _Transfer Taxes_. With respect to this Agreement, the Timber
SPA, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Timber SPA or
the documents giving effect to such transactions, (i) the applicable real
estate excise and real estate transfer taxes, including the Washington Real
Estate Excise Tax, shall be reported and paid by the Sellers at the Closing,
and (ii) all other applicable Transfer Taxes shall be reported and paid by the
Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that the amount of such Transfer Taxes in
excess of the amount paid by the Sellers pursuant to clause (i) above, if
any, shall be borne 50% by the Buyer and 50% by the Sellers. Any other Tax
Returns for Transfer Taxes shall be executed and filed by the Party
responsible for filing such Tax Returns under applicable law, any Transfer
Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns shall be paid by such filing Party,
and such filing Party shall be reimbursed by each other Party for any portion
of such Transfer Taxes that each such other Party is required to bear pursuant
to the first sentence of this  _Section 6.17_.

Section 6.18. _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) The Buyer will prepare and timely file, or cause the Company to prepare
and timely file, in a manner consistent with prior years, all Tax Returns
required to be filed with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries for all
taxable periods beginning on or prior to the Closing Date (including any Pre-
Closing Tax Period and any Straddle Period) that are required to be filed
after the Closing Date. The Buyer shall permit the Sellers to review and
comment on each such Tax Return, and each such Tax Return for a taxable period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date, in whole or in part, shall be prepared
in a manner consistent with prior years and in accordance with the historic
practices of the Company and its Subsidiaries. To facilitate the Sellers
review, the Buyer will deliver drafts of all such Tax Returns, together with
_pro forma_ return calculations for all Straddle Period Tax Returns showing
the amount of Tax payable with respect to the Pre-Closing Tax Period portion
of such Straddle Period, to the Sellers no later than the time periods
specified in this Section 6.18. In the case of income Tax Returns, the Buyer
will deliver drafts of all such income Tax Returns twenty (20) Business Days
prior to the date on

 



58  which such income Tax Returns are required to be filed. If, within ten (10)
Business Days following their receipt of the draft income Tax Returns, the
Sellers do not dispute any provision of the draft income Tax Returns, then
the draft income Tax Returns shall be final. In the event that the Sellers
dispute any provision of the draft income Tax Returns relating to Pre-Closing
Tax Periods, or any provision of a Straddle Period Tax Return relating to a
period ending on the Closing Date, then the Buyer shall make such revisions to
such income Tax Returns as are requested by the Sellers to the extent such
requested revisions are consistent with the historic practices of the Company
and its Subsidiaries and not inconsistent with applicable Law. In the case of
Tax Returns that are not income Tax Returns (including Business and
Occupations Tax Returns for the State of Washington), the Buyer will deliver
drafts of such returns two (2) Business Days prior to the date on which such
Tax Returns are required to be filed. In the event that the Sellers dispute
any provision of a Straddle Period Tax Return relating to a period ending
after the Closing Date, and the Sellers and the Buyer cannot agree on the
treatment of such item, then such dispute shall be resolved in accordance with
the provisions for disputing the Adjustment Statement set forth in _Section
2.6(f)_ and _Section 2.6(g)_;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the relevant
time periods shall be adjusted to allow for completion and filing of the Tax
Returns on a timely basis. If any such dispute cannot be resolved prior to the
due date of the applicable Tax Return, then the Buyer may file or cause to be
filed the Tax Return in the manner that it determines to be appropriate, but
the dispute between the Parties nonetheless shall be resolved in accordance
with _Section 2.6(f)_ and  _Section 2.6(g)_, and that resolution shall
govern the rights of the Parties hereunder.

(b) In the case of any audit, examination or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes for which the Sellers are or may be liable pursuant to this Agreement,
the Buyer shall promptly inform the Sellers. The Buyer shall execute or cause
to be executed powers of attorney or other documents necessary to enable the
Sellers to take all actions desired by the Sellers with respect to such
proceedings to the extent such proceedings may affect the amount of Taxes for
which the Sellers may be liable pursuant to this Agreement. The Sellers shall
have the right, at the Sellers expense, to control any such proceedings and
to initiate any claim for refund, file any amended Tax Return or take any
other action that the Sellers deem appropriate with respect to such Taxes; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Sellers shall not initiate any claim for
refund, file any amended Tax Return or take any other action, including
entering into any settlements, without the prior written consent of the Buyer,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Any proceeding with respect to
Taxes for a Straddle Period shall be controlled by the Buyer, except that, to
the extent issues raised in such a proceeding relate to Taxes with respect to
a Pre-Closing Tax Period, the proceeding shall be controlled by the Sellers
pursuant to this _Section 6.18(b)_ (subject to the limitations contained in
this _Section 6.18(b)_, including the proviso in the immediately preceding
sentence).

 

(c) Without the prior written consent of the Sellers, neither the Buyer nor
the Company shall amend or allow to be amended any Tax Return filed with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any taxable period
beginning prior to the Closing Date.

(d) Each of the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand,
shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the other, upon request, as promptly
as practicable, such information and assistance relating to the Company and
its Subsidiaries as is reasonably

 



59  necessary for the preparation and filing of any Tax Return, for the
preparation for any audit, and for the prosecution or defense of any claim,
suit or proceeding relating to any proposed adjustment. The Buyer and the
Sellers agree to use their reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or
other document from any taxing authority, or customer of the Company or any
other Person, as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate a Tax that
would otherwise be imposed with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(e) Without the prior written consent of the Sellers, none of the Company,
its Subsidiaries or the Buyer shall make, revoke or change any election,
change an annual accounting period, adopt, revoke or change any accounting
method, file any amended Tax Return, enter into any closing agreement, settle
or compromise any Tax claim or assessment relating to the Company or its
Subsidiaries, surrender any right to claim a refund of Taxes, or take any
similar action relating to the filing of any Tax Return or the payment of any
Tax, if such election, revocation, adoption, change, amendment, agreement,
settlement, compromise, surrender, consent or other action would have the
effect of increasing the Tax Liability of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for any period beginning before the Closing Date or decreasing
any Tax attribute of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries existing on the
Closing Date; _provided_ that, notwithstanding anything else in this
Agreement, an election under Code section 754 may be made for each of Timber
LLC and Longview Timberlands LLC, effective for their respective taxable years
that include the Closing Date.

Section 6.19. _Excess Cash_. The Sellers and the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that (a) the Closing Net Cash Amount
is less than or equal to $30,602,025.00 and (b) the Closing Net Working
Capital is less than or equal to $10,672,600.00.

Section 6.20. _Longview GP Compliance with Timber SPA_. The Sellers shall
cause Longview GP to perform and comply with all of its covenants and
agreements under the Timber SPA, including its obligation to sell, transfer
and convey to WNR at the Closing (as defined in the Timber SPA) all of the
issued and outstanding Timber LLC Special Common Units and 15,150 of the
Timber LLC Common Units.

 

Section 6.21. _WNR Compliance with Timber SPA_. The Buyer shall cause WNR to
perform and comply with all of its covenants and agreements under the Timber
SPA, including its obligation to acquire from Longview GP at the Closing (as
defined in the Timber SPA) all of the issued and outstanding Timber LLC
Special Common Units and 15,150 of the Timber LLC Common Units. 

Section 6.22. _Alternative Transaction Structure_. The Buyer may elect, at its
sole discretion, to acquire all of the Timber LLC Common Units from Holdings
LLC in lieu of acquiring the Shares from the Sellers (the " _Alternative
Transaction_ ") by notifying the Sellers in writing of such election at least
five (5) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date; _provided_ ,
that if all of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.3_
shall have been satisfied, or are capable of being satisfied, by the Closing
Date, except that the REIT Opinion of KPMG LLC (or other accountants or tax
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer) proposed to be delivered to the
Buyer is not substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit C_ hereto, then
the Buyer shall elect to proceed with the Alternative Transaction. In the
event that the Buyer

 



60  notifies the Sellers of its election to proceed with the Alternative
Transaction, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
at the Closing the Sellers and the Company shall cause Holdings LLC to sell,
transfer and convey to the Buyer, and the Buyer shall purchase and acquire
from Holdings LLC, all Timber LLC Common Units owned by Holdings LLC, free and
clear of all Liens. In the event that the Buyer elects to proceed with the
Alternative Transaction pursuant to this _Section 6.22_, (i) all references
to "Shares" in _Sections 2.4_ , _4.4(b)_ , _5.8_ , _5.10_ , _7.1_ , _7.2_ ,
_7.3_ , _8.2_ and _10.17_  shall be deemed to refer to the Timber LLC Common
Units, (ii) all references to the "Company" in the definitions of "Closing
Company Indebtedness", "Company Indebtedness", "Company Transaction
Expenses", "Net Cash Amount" and "Net Working Capital" and in _Sections 5.7_
, _5.9(c)_ , _6.3(c)_ , _6.9_ , _6.11_ , _6.12_ , _6.13_ , _6.16_ , _6.18_ ,
_7.3(f)(i)-(iv)_ (but excluding the reference to the "Company" in the
introductory sentence of _Section 7.3(f)_), _8.6_ and _10.10_ shall be deemed
to refer to Timber LLC and (iii) all references to "stock powers",
"stock certificates" or similar documents in this Agreement shall be deemed
to refer to unit certificates representing the Timber LLC Common Units and
other assignment documents necessary to transfer the Timber LLC Common Units
owned by Holdings LLC. For the avoidance of doubt, all references to "the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement" in this Agreement include the
Alternative Transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the
Buyer elects to proceed with the Alternative Transaction pursuant to this
_Section 6.22_, the Shares will not be transferred to the Buyer at the
Closing, and from and after the Closing the Buyer and its Affiliates shall
have no liabilities or responsibilities in respect of the Company or Holdings
LLC, except for the Buyers indemnification obligations to the Company and
Holdings LLC, as part of the Seller Group, pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_.

to the terms and conditions of this _Article VIII_ , the Sellers will jointly
and severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buyer, its Affiliates
and each of their respective employees, directors, officers, stockholders,
agents and representatives (collectively, the " _Buyer Group_ ") from and
against any and all Damages actually incurred by the Buyer Group based upon or
arising out of (i) any breach of any Surviving Covenant of the Company or any
Seller contained in this Agreement, (ii) any breach of any of the Companys
or any Sellers representations and warranties contained in _Articles III_ or
_IV_ or in any certificate delivered by the Company or the Sellers hereunder
(collectively, the " _Surviving Seller Representations_ "), or (iii) all
Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period (" _Pre-Closing Taxes_ ").

(b) _General Indemnification by the Buyer_. Following the Closing, subject to
the terms and conditions of this _Article VIII_ , the Buyer will indemnify,
defend and hold harmless each of the Sellers, their respective Affiliates and
each of their respective employees, directors, officers, stockholders, agents

arising out of (i) any breach of any Surviving Covenant of the Buyer contained
in this Agreement or (ii) any breach of the Buyers representations and
warranties contained in _Article V_ or in any certificate delivered by the
Buyer hereunder (collectively, the " _Surviving Buyer Representations_ ").

(c)  _Determination of Loss and Amount of Damages_. For purposes of
determining whether any breach or Damage has occurred or calculating the
amount of any such Damage, the representation set forth in the first sentence
of _Section 3.24(c)_ (Transactions with Affiliates) will be considered
without regard to the "Knowledge" qualification set forth therein; and the
representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements of the Parties set
forth in this Agreement will be considered without regard to any materiality
or material adverse effect qualification set forth therein (and, in the case
of the representations and warranties contained in _Section 4.7_ and _Section
5.11_, without regard to any materiality or material adverse effect
qualification set forth with respect to the applicable representations and

Period will be computed as if such taxable period ended as of the Closing,
except that in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and
measured by the level of any item, the portion allocable to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire
period (or, in the case 

 



65  of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for
the immediately preceding period) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of calendar days in the period ending on the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire
period.

efforts to mitigate all Damages for which such Indemnified Parties are
entitled or may be entitled to indemnification under this _Article VIII_ , and

the extent directly caused by such Indemnified Partys failure to mitigate
such Damages.

Section 8.2. _Certain Limitations_.

(a) _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. The covenants
contained in _Sections 6.2_ , _6.4_ , _6.5_ , _6.6_ and _6.14_ shall expire
with the consummation of the sale of the Shares and shall not survive the
Closing, and none of the Sellers, the Company or the Buyer shall have any
Liability whatsoever with respect to any such covenant thereafter. Liability
with respect to breaches of the covenants contained in _Section 6.1_ shall
survive until June 15, 2014. Liability with respect to breaches of all other
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement (collectively with the
covenants contained in _Section 6.1_, the " _Surviving Covenants_ ") shall
survive the Closing Date, and will expire on the third anniversary of the
Closing Date or the date on which the applicable covenant expires in
accordance with its terms, whichever is later. With the exception of the
Surviving Seller Representations set forth in _Section 3.1_ (Organization of
the Company and its Subsidiaries), _Section 3.2_ (Authorization), _Section
3.3_ (Capitalization; Subsidiaries; Title to Timber LLC Common Units),
_Sections 3.20_ and  _4.6_ (Brokers Fees), _Section 3.27_ (No Company
Assets or Liabilities), _Section 4.1_ (Organization), _Section 4.2_
(Authorization), _Section 4.3_ (Title to Shares), _Section
4.4(b)_ (Noncontravention) and _Section 4.7(a)_ (Backstop of Longview GP
Representations) which shall survive indefinitely (collectively, the " _Seller
Fundamental Representations_ "), and the Surviving Seller Representations
set forth in _Section 3.9_ (Tax Matters), which shall survive for the full
period of all applicable statutes of limitations plus sixty (60) days, the
representations and warranties of the Company or any Seller contained in this
Agreement or in any agreement or document executed and delivered pursuant
hereto shall survive until February 15, 2015. With the exception of the
Surviving Buyer Representations set forth in _Section 5.1_ (Organization),
_Section 5.2_ (Authorization), _Section 5.7_ (Brokers Fees), and 5.11(a)
(Backstop of WNR Representations) which shall survive indefinitely
(collectively, the " _Buyer Fundamental Representations_ "), the
representations and warranties of the Buyer contained in this Agreement or in
any agreement or document executed and delivered pursuant hereto shall survive
until February 15, 2015. The obligations of each Party to indemnify and defend
the other Parties and other Persons pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)(i)_,
_8.1(a)(ii)_ , _8.1(b)(i)_ or _8.1(b)(ii)_ shall terminate upon the expiration
of the applicable survival periods as set forth above; _provided_ that to the
extent any claim for indemnification in respect of a breach of any such
covenant, representation or warranty is made on or before the date on which
such covenant, representation or warranty expires, then such covenant,
representation or warranty shall survive until the resolution of such claim.
The Sellers obligation to indemnify the Buyer Group pursuant to _Section
8.1(a)(iii)_ shall survive for the full period of all applicable statutes of

  



66  limitations plus sixty (60) days; _provided_ that to the extent any claim
for indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)(iii)_ is made on or before
the date on which such indemnification obligation expires, then such
indemnification obligation shall survive until the resolution of such claim.

 

(b) _Limitations on Indemnification Liability_.

 

(i) The following limitations shall apply to the indemnification Liability of
the Sellers:

 

A. Except as provided in _Section 8.2(b)(i)(D)_, the Sellers shall have no
indemnification Liability to the Buyer Group for Damages pursuant to _Section
8.1(a)(ii)_ resulting from any single or aggregated claims arising out of the
same facts, events or circumstances unless the aggregate amount of all Damages
resulting from such single or aggregated claims arising out of the same
facts, events or circumstances in each case exceeds two hundred thousand
dollars ($200,000.00).

B. Except as provided in _Section 8.2(b)(i)(D)_, the Sellers shall have no
indemnification Liability to the Buyer Group for Damages pursuant to _Section
8.1(a)(ii)_ unless and until the aggregate amount of all Damages for all
claims asserted by the Buyer Group exceeds twenty million dollars
($20,000,000.00) (the " _Basket_ "); _provided_ that if the aggregate amount
of all Damages for all claims asserted by the Buyer Group exceeds the Basket,
the Buyer Group shall be entitled to indemnification for all such Damages,
without regard to the Basket.

C. Except as provided in _Section 8.2(b)(i)(D)_, the indemnification
obligations of the Sellers to the Buyer Group shall in all events be limited
to an aggregate amount of one hundred and seventy-five million dollars
($175,000,000.00) (the " _Cap_ ").

D. The limitations on indemnification Liability set forth in this _Section
8.2(b)(i)_ with respect to the Sellers shall not apply to any payments by the
Sellers to the Buyer Group pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)(i)_ for breach of the
Sellers Surviving Covenants (excluding _Section 6.1_), pursuant to _Section
8.1(a)(ii)_ for breach of the Seller Fundamental Representations or _Section
3.9_ or pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)(iii)_, which shall be limited in the
aggregate to an amount equal to the Final Purchase Price.

(ii) The Buyers indemnification Liability for Damages for breaches of
representations and warranties pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ shall be
subject to the same limitations as set forth in _Section 8.2(b)(i)_, except
that the limitations on indemnification Liability shall not apply to any
payments by the Buyer to the Seller Group pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_
for breach of the Buyer Fundamental Representations, which shall be limited in
the aggregate to an amount equal to the Final Purchase Price.

(iii) The limitations on indemnification Liability set forth in this 
_Section 8.2(b)_ shall not apply to claims by any Party based on fraud or
willful misconduct.

 



67 (c) The Indemnifying Parties shall make any indemnification payments
determined to be payable to the Indemnified Parties hereunder without regard
to any expectation that the Indemnified Parties will recover insurance
proceeds as a result of the matter giving rise to the claim for which
indemnification payments are to be made. The Indemnified Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to recover insurance proceeds that may be
available to it as a result of the matter giving rise to any indemnification
claim of the Indemnified Party; _provided_ that such efforts shall not be a
condition precedent to the ability of the Indemnified Party to seek
indemnification hereunder. If the Indemnified Party receives any insurance
proceeds as a result of the matter giving rise to any indemnification claim of
such Indemnified Party prior to the date upon which the Indemnifying Party is
given notice of such claim, then the Indemnifying Partys indemnification
obligation with respect to such claim shall be reduced by the amount of any
such insurance proceeds actually received by the Indemnified Party (after
deducting from the amount of proceeds so received the amount of expenses, if
any, incurred by the Indemnified Party in procuring such proceeds). If the
Indemnified Party receives any insurance proceeds as a result of the matter
giving rise to any indemnification claim against the Indemnifying Party after
the Indemnifying Party has paid such indemnification claim to an Indemnified
Party, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly turn over any such insurance
proceeds received to the Indemnifying Party to the extent of the payments made
by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party on the claim (after
deducting from the amount of proceeds so received the amount of expenses, if
any, incurred by the Indemnified Party in procuring such proceeds).

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, any
amounts payable pursuant to the indemnification obligations under this
_Article VIII_ shall be paid without duplication, and in no event shall any
Party be indemnified under different provisions of this Agreement for the
same Damages.

(e) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Damages as used herein shall not include and in no event shall any
Indemnifying Party be liable to any Indemnified Party for, any incidental,
consequential, punitive, indirect or similar damages; it being understood and
agreed, however, that an Indemnifying Party shall be liable to an Indemnified
Party with respect to (i) any penalties actually incurred by such Indemnified
Party and (ii) any incidental, consequential, punitive, indirect or similar
damages arising from a Third Party Claim that such Indemnified Party is
required to pay to any Person who is not a Party (or an Affiliate thereof).

Section 8.3. _Manner of Indemnification Payment_.

(a) Any indemnification payments shall be made together with interest accruing
thereon from the date such payment is finally determined to be payable to the
date of payment at the Applicable Rate.

 



68 (b) Any indemnification owing to the Buyer Group pursuant to this _Article
VIII_ shall be effected by direct recourse to the Sellers, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds from the Sellers to an account designated in
writing by the Buyer Group within fifteen (15) days after the determination
thereof.

 

(c) Any indemnification owing to the Seller Group pursuant to this _Article
VIII_ shall be effected by direct recourse to the Buyer, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds from the Buyer to an account designated in writing
by the Sellers within fifteen (15) days after the determination thereof.

 

(d) All indemnification payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by
the Parties as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price for tax purposes,
unless otherwise required by Law.

Section 8.4. _Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) Any Party providing indemnification pursuant to this _Article VIII_ is
referred to herein as an " _Indemnifying Party_ ," and the Party seeking
indemnification pursuant to this _Article VIII_ is referred to herein as an "
_Indemnified Party_." In order for an Indemnified Party to be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this  _Article VIII_ , if any claim or demand is
made against such Indemnified Party with respect to any matter, or if such
Indemnified Party shall otherwise receive written notice of an assertion of a
potential claim, by any Person who is not a Party (or an Affiliate thereof)
(each a " _Third Party Claim_ ") which gives rise to a claim for
indemnification against an Indemnifying Party under this Agreement, then the
Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing and
in reasonable detail of the Third Party Claim (including, to the extent known,
the factual basis for the Third Party Claim and the amount of the Third Party
Claim); _provided_ , _however_ , that no delay on the part of the Indemnified
Party in notifying the Indemnifying Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party
from any obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent) the
Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced as a result thereof (except that
the Indemnifying Party will not be liable for any expenses incurred during
the period in which the Indemnified Party failed to give such notice); it
being understood and agreed that the failure of the Indemnified Party to so
notify the Indemnifying Party prior to settling a Third Party Claim (whether
by paying a claim or executing a binding settlement agreement with respect
thereto) or the entry of a judgment or issuance of an award with respect to a
Third Party Claim shall constitute actual prejudice to the Indemnifying
Partys ability to defend against such Third Party Claim. Thereafter, the
Indemnified Party will deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after the
Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received or transmitted by the Indemnified Party
relating to the Third Party Claim.

 

(b) The Indemnifying Party will have the right to participate in or to assume
the defense of the Third Party Claim (in either case at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party) with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party will be liable for the reasonable
fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any
period during which the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense
thereof (other than during any period in which the Indemnified Party shall
have failed to give written notice of the Third Party Claim as provided above
following a reasonable period

 



69  of time to provide such notice). Should the Indemnifying Party so elect to
assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be
liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses subsequently
incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, if the Parties reasonably agree that a conflict
of interest exists in respect of such claim, such Indemnified Party will have
the right to employ separate counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnifying Party to represent such Indemnified Party and in that event the
reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel (but not more than
one separate counsel for all Indemnified Parties) shall be paid by such
Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party is conducting the defense of the
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party, at its sole cost and expense, may
retain separate counsel, and participate in the defense of the Third Party
Claim, it being understood that the Indemnifying Party will control such
defense subject to the limitations set out in this _Article VIII_.

 

(c) No Indemnifying Party will consent to any settlement, compromise or
discharge (including the consent to entry of any judgment) of any Third Party
Claim without the Indemnified Partys prior written consent (which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); _provided_ that,
if the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim,
the Indemnified Party will agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge
of such Third Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party may recommend and which
by its terms obligates the Indemnifying Party to pay the full amount of
Damages in connection with such Third Party Claim and releases the
Indemnified Party completely from all Liability in connection with such Third
Party Claim and provided that such settlement does not impose any material
non-monetary restrictions or obligations on the Indemnified Party. Whether or
not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party will not admit any Liability, consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise with respect
to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not
be entitled to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim (and shall be
liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel incurred by the
Indemnified Party in defending such Third Party Claim) if the Third Party
Claim seeks an order, injunction or other equitable relief or relief for
other than money damages against the Indemnified Party that the Indemnified
Party reasonably determines, after conferring with its outside counsel, cannot
be separated from any related claim for money damages. If such equitable
relief or other relief portion of the Third Party Claim can be so separated
from that for money damages, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to
assume the defense of the portion relating to money damages.

 

(d) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party will keep the Indemnified Party informed of all
material developments relating to or in connection with such Third Party
Claim. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend a Third Party Claim, the
Parties will cooperate in the defense thereof (with the Indemnifying Party
being responsible for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the
Indemnified Party (other than for the fees and expenses of its separate
counsel unless provided otherwise in _Section 8.4(b)_) in connection with
such cooperation), which cooperation will include the provision to the
Indemnifying Party of records and information which are reasonably relevant to
such Third Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder.

(e) In the event of payment in full by an Indemnifying Party to
any Indemnified Party in connection with any Third Party Claim (each an "
_Indemnified Claim_ "), such Indemnifying Party will be subrogated to and will
stand in the place of such Indemnified Party as to any events or circumstances
in respect of which such Indemnified Party may have any right or claim
relating to such Indemnified Claim against any claimant or plaintiff asserting
such Indemnified Claim or against any other Person. Such Indemnified Party
will cooperate with such Indemnifying Party in a reasonable manner, and at
the cost and expense of such Indemnifying Party, in prosecuting any subrogated
right or claim.

 



70 Section 8.5. _Other Claims_. Any claim on account of Damages for
which indemnification is provided under this Agreement which does not involve
a Third Party Claim will be asserted by written notice within the relevant
period specified in _Section 8.2(a)_ given by the Indemnified Party to the
Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall include a reasonable description of the
factual basis for and the amount of such claim. If the Indemnifying Party does
not notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days following its receipt
of such notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the
Indemnified Party under _Section 8.1(a)_ or _Section 8.1(b)_, such claim
specified by the Indemnified Party in such notice shall be conclusively deemed
a liability of the Indemnifying Party under _Section 8.1(a)_ or _Section
8.1(b)_, as applicable, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of
such liability to the Indemnified Party on demand or, in the case of any
notice in which the amount of the claim (or any portion thereof) is
estimated, on such later date when the amount of such claim (or such portion
thereof) becomes finally determined.

Section 8.6. _Exclusive Remedy_. Following the Closing, the sole and exclusive
monetary remedy for any and all claims arising under, out of, or related to
this Agreement, or the sale and purchase of the Company, shall be the rights
of indemnification set forth in this _Article VIII_ only, and no Person will
have any other entitlement, remedy or recourse, whether in contract, tort or
otherwise, including claims under Environmental Laws, it being agreed that
all of such other remedies, entitlements and recourse are expressly waived and
released by the Parties hereto to the fullest extent permitted by law.

 

Section 8.7. _Availability of Funds_.

(a) Following the Closing, each Party agrees that it will maintain sufficient
liquidity reasonably necessary to fund such Partys indemnification
obligations under this _Article VIII_. In furtherance of the foregoing, each
Seller agrees that it shall either (i) maintain possession of sufficient
proceeds received by such Seller hereunder or other funds or assets or (ii)
maintain a binding and enforceable right to receive funds or assets (which
may include rights to call capital from limited partners or other investors,
rights to claw back distributions from limited partners or other investors, or
rights to contribution from the other Sellers), in each case in an amount
reasonably necessary to satisfy such Sellers remaining potential
indemnification obligations.

(b) If following the Closing, any Party or any of its successors or assigns,
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of such Party honor the obligations set forth in this
_Article VIII_.

 



71 ARTICLE IX

terminate this Agreement under this subsection (b) shall not be available to

failure of the Closing to occur on or before the Drop Dead Date;

(c) by either the Sellers or the Buyer by giving written notice to the other
Party if any Legal Restraint having the effect set forth in _Section 7.1(a)_

representations of the Parties under  _Sections 3.20_ , _4.6_ and _5.7_
(Brokers Fees), the obligations of the Buyer under _Section 6.3(b)_
(Confidentiality), the obligations of the Parties under _Section 6.7_ (Public
Announcements), and the terms of this _Section 9.2_, _Section 9.3_, and
_Article X_ (Miscellaneous) shall remain in full force and effect, (b) such
termination shall not relieve the Buyer of any Liability for fraud or any
breach of any material obligation or material covenant contained in this

such termination shall not relieve any Seller or the Company of any Liability
for fraud or any breach of any material obligation or material covenant

terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_, the Buyer shall
reimburse the Company 

 



72  promptly upon request for the fees and disbursements (i) of the Companys
accountants incurred by the Company in connection with the review of the
Unaudited Financial Statements and (ii) of KPMG LLC incurred by the Company
in connection with the preparation of the REIT Opinion.

Section 10.2. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. No Party may assign (by contract, stock sale, operation of Law or
otherwise) either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or

other Parties, and any attempted assignment, without such consent, shall be
null and void; _provided_ , that the Buyer may, without the written consent of

its Affiliates or its direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries. No
assignment shall relieve the assigning Party of any of its obligations

misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether

Section 10.5. _Exhibits and Disclosure Letter_.

 

(a) All Exhibits and Schedules referenced herein, and the Disclosure Letter,
are hereby incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof. Any
matter disclosed pursuant to any Section of or Schedule or Exhibit to this
Agreement or the Disclosure Letter (or any Section of any Schedule or Exhibit
to this Agreement or the Disclosure Letter) whose relevance or applicability
to any representation made elsewhere in this Agreement or to the information
called for by any other Section of or Schedule or Exhibit to this Agreement or
the Disclosure Letter (or any other Section of any Schedule or Exhibit to this
Agreement or the Disclosure Letter) is reasonably apparent from the text of
the disclosure shall be deemed to be an exception to such representations and
to be disclosed with respect to all such other Sections 

 



75  of and Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement and the Disclosure Letter
(and all Sections of all Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement and the
Disclosure Letter) where it is so apparent from the text of the disclosure,
notwithstanding the omission of a reference or cross-reference thereto.

(b) Neither the specification of any dollar amount in any representation or
warranty nor the mere inclusion of any item in a Schedule or in the Disclosure
Letter as an exception to a representation or warranty shall be deemed an
admission by a Party that such item represents an exception or material fact,
event or circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect or a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 10.6. _Headings_. The table of contents and section headings contained
in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not be deemed a
part of this Agreement or affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement.

 

Section 10.7. _Construction_. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement.

Section 10.8. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Disclosure
Letter, and the Schedules and Exhibits hereto), the Timber SPA and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the Parties
with respect to the sale and purchase of the Shares or the Timber LLC Common
Units and supersedes any prior understandings, negotiations, agreements,
discussions or representations among the Parties of any nature, whether
written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to the sale and purchase
of the Shares or the Timber LLC Common Units.

Section 10.9. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement (or any
portion thereof) or the application of any such provision (or any portion
thereof) to any Person or circumstance shall be declared by any court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable in any
respect, all other provisions of this Agreement (and the remaining portion
thereof), or the application of such provision to Persons or circumstances
other than those as to which it has been held invalid, illegal, void or
unenforceable, shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect and will in
no way be affected, impaired or invalidated thereby. Upon such determination
that any provision, or the application of any such provision, is invalid,
illegal, void or unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by Law in an acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to
the greatest extent possible. 

Section 10.10. _Expenses_. Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, all
costs and expenses incident to the process leading to the execution of this
Agreement, the negotiations and preparation of this Agreement and the
performance by a Party of its obligations hereunder, including the fees and
disbursements of counsel, accountants, financial advisors, 

 



76  experts and consultants employed by the respective Parties in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, shall be borne and paid by the
Party incurring such costs and expenses, whether or not the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated; _provided_ that any such
expenses incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be paid in
cash by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries prior to the close of business
on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date or, to the extent not so
paid, shall be deducted from the Final Purchase Price as Company Transaction
Expenses in accordance with _Article II_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the provisions and covenants of this _Section
10.10_ will survive the Closing and will remain in force indefinitely.

Section 10.11. _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all claims arising out of
or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be governed by the Laws of the State of Delaware without regard to the
conflicts of law principles that would result in the application of any Law
other than the Law of the State of Delaware.

Section 10.12. _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in King County,
Washington in any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement and
agrees that all claims in respect of the Action may be heard and determined in
any such court. Each Party also agrees not to bring any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other court. Each of the
Parties waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any
Action so brought and waives any bond, surety, or other security that might be
required of any other Party with respect thereto. Each of the Parties
hereby irrevocably consents to the service of process of any of the
aforementioned courts in any such Action by the mailing of copies thereof by
registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to its address set forth in
_Section 10.3_, such service to become effective ten (10) days after such
mailing. Nothing in this _Section 10.12_, however, shall affect the right of
any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law or at
equity. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any Action so brought
shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by law or at equity.

Section 10.13. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARTIES IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION,
PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

Section 10.14. _Specific Performance_. Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges
and agrees that, in the event of any breach of this Agreement, each
nonbreaching Party would be irreparably and immediately harmed and could not
be made whole by monetary damages. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties
hereto (a) will waive the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law in any action
for specific performance and (b) shall be entitled, in addition to any other
remedy to which they may be entitled at law or in equity, to compel specific
performance of this Agreement in any Action instituted in accordance with
_Section 10.12_.

 

Section 10.15. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together will constitute

 



77  one and the same instrument, and any such counterpart executed and delivered
via facsimile transmission or via email with scan or email attachment will be
deemed an original for all intents and purposes.

Section 10.16. _Time of Essence_. With regard to all dates and time periods
set forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

Section 10.17. _Seller Representative_.

 

(a) Each Seller hereby irrevocably makes, constitutes and appoints Reid Carter
as its agent and representative (the " _Representative_ ") for all purposes
under this Agreement. In the event of the death, resignation, discharge or
incapacity of the Representative, the Sellers shall promptly designate another
individual to act as their representative under this Agreement so that at all
times there will be a Representative with the authority provided in this
_Section 10.17_. Such successor Representative shall be designated by the
Sellers and Longview GP by an instrument in writing signed by each of the
Sellers and Longview GP (or their successors in interest), and such
appointment shall become effective as to the successor Representative when (i)
such instrument shall have been delivered to the successor Representative and
(ii) five (5) days prior written notice of such appointment, including a copy
of such instrument, shall have been provided to the Buyer.

(b) Each Seller hereby authorizes the Representative, on its behalf and in its
name, to:

(i) receive all notices or documents given or to be given to such Seller
pursuant hereto or in connection herewith and to receive and accept service of
legal process in connection with any suit or proceeding arising under this
Agreement. The Representative shall promptly forward a copy of such notice of
process to such Seller;

(ii) deliver at the Closing the certificates for the Shares in exchange for
such Sellers _Pro Rata_ Share of the consideration payable with respect to
all of the Shares;

 

(iii) upon confirmation of the receipt of wire transfers, sign and deliver to
the Buyer at the Closing a receipt for such Sellers _Pro Rata_ Share of the
consideration and forward such amount to each Seller;

(iv) deliver to the Buyer at the Closing all certificates and documents to be
delivered to the Buyer by such Seller pursuant to this Agreement, together
with any other certificates and documents executed by such Seller and
deposited with the Representative for such purpose;

(v) engage legal counsel, accountants and other advisors for the Sellers and
incur such other expenses on behalf of the Sellers in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby as the Representative may
deem appropriate; and

 



78 (vi) take such action on behalf of the Sellers as the Representative may deem
appropriate in respect of:

A. waiving any inaccuracies in the representations or warranties of the
Buyer contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered by the Buyer
pursuant hereto;

B. waiving the fulfillment of any of the conditions precedent to the Sellers
obligations hereunder, except with respect to payment of the consideration due
to the Sellers under _Section 2.2_;

 

C. taking such other action as the Representative is authorized to take under
this Agreement;

 

D. receiving all documents or certificates and making all determinations, on
behalf of the Sellers required under this Agreement;

E. all such other matters as the Representative may deem necessary or
appropriate to consummate this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby; and

F. taking all such action as may be necessary after the Closing Date to carry
out any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) The appointment of the Representative hereunder is irrevocable and any
action taken by the Representative pursuant to the authority granted in this
_Section 10.17_ shall be effective and absolutely binding on each Seller
notwithstanding any contrary action of, or direction from, a Seller, except
for actions taken by the Representative that constitute willful misconduct or
gross negligence. The death or incapacity of a Seller shall not terminate the
prior authority and agency of the Representative. 

(d) The Representative may resign at any time by giving written notice to each
Seller, and such resignation shall be effective upon the appointment and
qualification of a successor pursuant to _Section 10.17(a)_. The
Representative may be discharged, and replaced by another natural person to
act as his or her successor, by an instrument in writing signed by the
Sellers and Longview GP (or their successors in interest); _provided_ that no
such discharge or replacement shall be effective until a successor has been
appointed pursuant to _Section 10.17(a)_.

 

(e) In performing any duties as Representative under this Agreement, the
Representative shall not incur any liability to any Person, except for
liability caused by the Representatives willful misconduct or gross
negligence. Accordingly, the Representative shall not incur any such liability
for (i) any action taken or omitted in good faith regarding any
questions relating to the duties and responsibilities of the Representative
under this Agreement, or (ii) any action taken or omitted to be taken in
reliance upon any instrument that the Representative shall in good faith
believe to be genuine, to have been signed or delivered by a proper person or
persons, and to confirm with the provisions of this Agreement. The Sellers,
jointly and severally, shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Representative against, 

 



79  from and in respect of any liability or loss arising out of or resulting
from the performance of his or her duties hereunder or in connection with this
Agreement (except for liabilities or losses arising from the gross negligence
or willful misconduct of the Representative). The Buyer and WNR may rely on
the appointment and authority of the Representative hereunder, and shall not
be liable to the Sellers or any other Person for dealing with the
Representative, until the receipt by the Buyer of notice of the appointment of
a successor Representative pursuant to _Section 10.17(a)_.

Section 10.18. _Guaranty_.

(a) Subject to the conditions and limitations as set forth below, the
Guarantor hereby absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, as
principal and not as surety, to the Sellers and their successors, the due and
punctual payment and the full and complete performance of all monetary
obligations, as and when due, (i) of the Buyer to the Sellers pursuant to this
Agreement, including under _Section 2.2_, and the Buyers specific
performance obligations under _Section 10.14_, as the case may be, in the
event that the Closing is not consummated in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and (ii) of WNR to Longview GP pursuant to the Timber SPA, including
under Section 2.2 of the Timber SPA, and WNRs specific performance
obligations under Section 7.14 of the Timber SPA, as the case may be, in the
event that the Closing (as defined in the Timber SPA) is not consummated in
accordance with the terms of the Timber SPA (the guaranty obligations
under this _Section 10.18_, collectively, the " _Guarantied Obligations_ ").
The obligations of Guarantor under this _Section 10.18_ shall terminate and
be of no further force or effect contemporaneous with the Closing. 

(b) The Guarantor guarantees that the Guarantied Obligations will be duly and
punctually paid and fully and completely performed, as if the Guarantor were
the primary obligor in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If for any
reason the Buyer or WNR shall fail or be unable duly and punctually to pay or
fully and completely to perform any Guarantied Obligation as and when the
same shall become due or otherwise required, then the Guarantor shall, subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Timber SPA, forthwith
duly and punctually pay or fully and completely perform (or cause to be
performed) such Guarantied Obligation (in the case of performance, as if the
Guarantor was the primary obligor). The Guarantor further agrees that this
Agreement, to the extent it requires the payment of money, constitutes a
guaranty of payment when due and not of collection and is in no way
conditioned or contingent upon any attempt to collect from the Buyer or WNR.
The Guarantors liability under this Agreement shall be absolute,
unconditional, irrevocable and continuing irrespective, without limitation,
of:

(i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement or the Timber
SPA as a result of the application of any Remedies Exception to the Buyer or
WNR, respectively;

(ii) any modification, amendment, consent, extension, forbearance or waiver
of or any consent to departure from this Agreement or the Timber SPA that may
be agreed to by the Buyer or WNR, respectively;

 



80 (iii) any action or inaction by the Sellers or Longview GP under or
in respect of this Agreement or the Timber SPA, respectively, any failure,
lack of diligence, omission or delay on the part of any Seller or Longview GP
to enforce, assert or exercise any right, power or remedy conferred on any
Seller or Longview GP in this Agreement or in the Timber SPA, respectively;

(iv) any merger or consolidation of the Buyer, WNR or any other Person into
or with any Person, or any sale, lease or transfer of any of the assets of the
Buyer, WNR or any other Person to any other Person;

(v) any change in the ownership of the Buyer or WNR; or

(vi) any other occurrence, circumstance, happening or event, whether similar
or dissimilar to the foregoing and whether foreseen or unforeseen, which
otherwise might constitute a legal or equitable defense or discharge of the
liabilities of a guarantor or surety or which otherwise might limit recourse
against the Guarantor or any other Person.

(c) The Guarantor hereby unconditionally waives (i) any and all notices,
including promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance of this Agreement and
any other notice, with respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations and this
Agreement and the Timber SPA, (ii) any presentment, demand, performance,
protest, notice of non-payment as the same pertains to the Buyer and WNR, suit
or the taking of other action by any Seller or Longview GP against, and any
other notice to, the Buyer, WNR, the Guarantor or others with respect to any
of the Guarantied Obligations, (iii) any right to require any Seller or
Longview GP to proceed against the Buyer or WNR or to exhaust any security
held by any Seller or Longview GP or to pursue any other remedy with
respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations, (iv) any defense based upon an
election of remedies by the Sellers or Longview GP, unless the same would
excuse performance by the Buyer or WNR under this Agreement or the Timber SPA,
as the case may be, with respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations and (v)
any duty of the Sellers or Longview GP to advise the Guarantor of any
information known to the Sellers or Longview GP regarding the Buyer or WNR or
their respective abilities to perform under this Agreement and the Timber SPA
with respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations. Each Seller and Longview GP
may at any time and from time to time without notice to or consent of the
Guarantor and without impairing or releasing the obligations of the Guarantor
hereunder, with respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations, (A) agree with
the Buyer or WNR, respectively, to make any change in the terms of the
applicable Guarantied Obligations, (B) take or fail to take any action of any
kind in respect of any security for the Guarantied Obligations, (C) exercise
or refrain from exercising any rights against the Buyer, WNR or others, or (D)
compromise or subordinate the Guarantied Obligations, including any security
therefor. Any other suretyship defenses are hereby waived by the Guarantor
with respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 10.18_ shall continue to be effective or
be reinstated, as the case may be, if (i) at any time and to the extent that
any payment of any of the Guarantied Obligations is rescinded or must
otherwise be returned by the payee thereof upon the insolvency, bankruptcy,
reorganization or similar event of the Buyer, WNR or the Guarantor, all as
though such payment had not been made or (ii) the obligations of the

 



81  Guarantor under this _Section 10.18_, with respect to any of the Guarantied
Obligations, are released in consideration of a payment of money or transfer
of property by the Buyer, WNR or any other Person and to the extent that such
payment, transfer or grant is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the
recipient thereof upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar
event of the Buyer, WNR, the Guarantor or such other Person, all as though
such payment, transfer or grant had not been made. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Longview GP shall be a third
party beneficiary under this Agreement for purposes of enforcing this 
_Section 10.18_.

Section 10.19. _No Implied Representations_. It is the explicit intent of each
Party hereto that none of the Parties is making any representation or
warranty whatsoever, express or implied, beyond those expressly set forth in
_Article III_ , _Article IV_ and _Article V_ of this Agreement, Article III
and Article IV of the Timber SPA or any other provision of this Agreement or
the Timber SPA, including any implied warranty or representation as to the
value, condition, merchantability or suitability as to any of the properties
or assets of the Company.
