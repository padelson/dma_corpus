       | (a)  | USD$642,690,000 (the Bid Amount); 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (b)  | _less_ the Estimated Net Debt (if positive) or _plus_
the Estimated Net Debt (if negative, i.e. the Group Companies, as a whole, are
in a net cash position); 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (c)  | _plus_ (if positive) or _minus_ (if negative) the
Estimated Working Capital Adjustment; 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (d)  | _less_ the Estimated CY21 EBITDA Adjustment Amount, 
---|---|--- 
  

  



  

(the Estimated Purchase Price), subject to adjustment as provided in this
clause 3. The Estimated Purchase Price shall be allocated between the Target
Companies as agreed between the parties, each acting reasonably.

  



       | 3.2  | The Estimated Purchase Price shall be payable by the
Purchaser to the Seller at Completion in accordance with subclause 8.5(a)(i),
provided that if following the steps in subclauses 4.1(a) and 4.1(b): 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (a)  | the Purchaser disagrees with the Seller\'s calculation
of the Estimated CY21 EBITDA Adjustment Amount; and 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (b)  | the Seller\'s calculation and the Purchaser\'s
calculation of the Estimated CY21 EBITDA Adjustment Amount are each amounts of
A$60,000,000 or more but less than A$68,000,000, 
---|---|--- 
  



  

then the Estimated CY21 EBITDA Adjustment Amount will be the mid-point of the
differing calculations of the parties and Completion shall occur on the basis
of such mid-point calculation, with post-Completion resolution of such
calculation difference. The amount which is the difference between the
Seller\'s calculation and the Purchaser\'s calculation of the Estimated CY21
EBITDA Adjustment Amount multiplied by the amount of 12.5 shall be the
"Escrow Amount" and each party shall deposit one half of such Escrow Amount
with a mutually agreed independent third party financial institution acting
as escrow agent ("Escrow Agent") to be held in escrow by such Escrow Agent
pending resolution by the parties of such calculation Dispute in accordance
with clause 26, with such Escrow Amount to be released and dealt with between
the parties on the basis of the adjustment in either subclause 3.3(e) or
3.3(f). For the avoidance of doubt, the remaining balance (if any) of the
Escrow Amount that is not required to be released to a party in accordance
with the provision above must be released to the party that deposited that
amount.

  



       | 3.3  | The amount of the Estimated Purchase Price shall be
adjusted upon the Completion Statement being agreed or determined in
accordance with Schedule 11 as follows (the Estimated Purchase Price, as so
adjusted, being the Adjusted Purchase Price): 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (a)  | if the Actual Net Debt exceeds the Estimated Net Debt,
it shall be reduced by the amount by which the Actual Net Debt exceeds the
Estimated Net Debt; 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (b)  | if the Actual Net Debt is less than the Estimated Net
Debt, it shall be increased by the amount by which the Actual Net Debt is less
than the Estimated Net Debt; 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (c)  | if the Actual Working Capital is less than the
Estimated Working Capital, it shall be reduced by the amount by which the
Actual Working Capital is less than the Estimated Working Capital; 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 

\- 19 -

    



       | (d)  | if the Actual Working Capital exceeds the Estimated
Working Capital, it shall be increased by the amount by which the Actual
Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Working Capital; 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (e)  | if the Actual CY21 EBITDA Adjustment Amount exceeds the
Estimated CY21 EBITDA Adjustment Amount, it shall be reduced by the amount by
which the Actual CY21 EBITDA Adjustment Amount exceeds the Estimated CY21
EBITDA Adjustment Amount (the "EBITDA Difference"), provided at all times
that, unless otherwise agreed, the maximum of the EBITDA Difference will be
A$150,000,000; and 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (f)  | if the Actual CY21 EBITDA Adjustment Amount is less
than the Estimated CY21 EBITDA Adjustment Amount, it shall be increased by the
amount by which the Actual CY21 EBITDA Adjustment Amount is less than the
Estimated CY21 EBITDA Adjustment Amount. 
---|---|--- 
  



       | 3.4  | If: 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (a)  | the Adjusted Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated
Purchase Price, the Purchaser shall make a payment to the Seller of a sum
equal to that excess; or 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (b)  | the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds the Adjusted
Purchase Price, the Seller shall make a payment to the Purchaser of a sum
equal to that excess. 
---|---|--- 
  



       | 3.5  | Any such payment shall be made within five Business
Days following the day on which the Completion Statement is agreed or
determined in accordance with Schedule 11 and in accordance with the
allocation contemplated in clause 3.1. 
---|---|--- 
  



       | 4.  | Calculation concurrence

       | 4.1  | In connection with the Estimated CY21 EBITDA Amount (in
this clause 4.2, the EBITDA Calculation):

acting reasonably, must provide the Purchaser with the EBITDA Calculation and
all associated working papers in sufficient detail for the Purchaser to
reasonably assess the accuracy of the calculation (together, the EBITDA
Material); 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (b)  | by no later than four Business Day after the EBITDA
Delivery Date, the Purchaser must notify the Seller if it agrees or disagrees
with the EBITDA Calculation or if it believes, acting reasonably, the EBITDA
Calculation was not calculated consistently with subclause 2.15 of Schedule 11
or the EBITDA Material was not sufficient; 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (c)  | if the Purchaser has not notified the Seller by no
later than four Business Days after the EBITDA Delivery Date as to whether it
agrees or disagrees with the EBITDA Calculation or if it believes, acting
reasonably, the EBITDA Calculation was not calculated consistently with
subclause 2.15 of Schedule 11 or the EBITDA Material was not sufficient, then
the Purchaser will be deemed to have accepted the EBITDA Calculation provided
by the Seller on the EBITDA Delivery Date; and 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (d)  | if on the EBITDA Delivery Date the Purchaser and the
Seller, each acting reasonably, have not agreed on the EBITDA Calculation, the
Chief Executive Officer of each party\'s parent company must, as soon as
reasonably practicable, meet and use their best efforts to agree on the EBITDA
Calculation.

---|---|--- 
  



       | 4.3  | Subject to clause 4.4, if the parties, acting
reasonably, cannot agree on the EBITDA Calculation after following the process
set out in subclause 4.1 above, such EBITDA Calculation will be a Dispute for
the purposes of this Agreement and clause 26 shall apply. 
---|---|--- 
  



       | 4.4  | Notwithstanding clause 4.2, if the parties disagreement
on the EBITDA Calculation is in connection with the Seller\'s calculation or
the Purchaser\'s calculation of the Estimated CY21 EBITDA Adjustment Amount,

---|---|--- 
  



       | (b)  | the other party, acting reasonably, does not agree, 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Completion shall not take place unless and until:

  



       | (c)  | the parties have agreed in writing that the CY21 EBITDA
Amount is not less than A$60,000,000; or 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (d)  | the final outcome of the dispute resolution process in
clause 26 determines that the CY21 EBITDA Amount is not less than
A$60,000,000,

       | (d)  | there having been no Adverse Regulatory Event prior to
the satisfaction or waiver in accordance with this agreement of the Conditions
in subclauses 6.1(a) to 6.1(c) and 6.1(e) and there having been no Subsequent
Adverse Regulatory Event in the period commencing on the Condition

by a Regulatory Authority to satisfy a Condition. If any Condition has not
been satisfied or waived in accordance with this agreement on or before the
date that is 5 Business Days before the Long Stop Date, and the reason for
such Condition not being satisfied by the Long Stop Date is due to the
relevant Regulatory Authority or the Australian Treasurer not having completed
its review in relation to the relevant consent or approval sought, or a third
party consent or approval under subclause 6.1(e) has not been obtained, in

       | 6.4  | The Seller and the Purchaser may waive the Condition
imposed in subclause 6.1(c), either in whole or in part, by agreement in

agreement, are cumulative and not exclusive of rights and remedies provided by
law. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

A failure to exercise or a delay in exercising any right, power or remedy
under this agreement does not operate as a waiver. A single or partial
exercise or waiver of the exercise of any right, power or remedy does not
preclude any other or further exercise of that or any other right, power or
remedy. A waiver is not valid or binding on the party granting that waiver
unless made in writing and specifically.

  



       | 23.4  | To the extent that a representation, warranty,
indemnity, undertaking or acknowledgment given by a party in this agreement is
given to or for the benefit of any Related Body Corporate of the other party

(each referred to as a Third Party Beneficiary), the benefit of that
representation, warranty, indemnity, undertaking or acknowledgment is held by
the Recipient on trust for, and is enforceable by, each such Third Party

       | 23.5  | Any provision of this agreement that is prohibited or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction is ineffective as to that jurisdiction to
the extent of the prohibition or unenforceability. That does not invalidate
the remaining provisions of this agreement nor affect the validity or
enforceability of that provision in any other jurisdiction.

as required by statute, no terms shall be implied (whether by custom, usage or

       | 24.4  | Nothing in this agreement limits or excludes any
liability for fraud or limits any remedy which cannot be waived as a matter of
applicable law.

       | 24.5  | This agreement may only be amended in writing and
where such amendment is signed by all the parties.

     2.  | COVENANT 
---|--- 
  



     2.1  | The Seller covenants with the Purchaser that, subject to the
following provisions of this Schedule, the Seller will pay to the Purchaser,
to the extent possible by way of repayment of the purchase price for the
Shares (but not so as to limit the amount payable where not wholly possible),
an amount equal to: 
---|--- 
  



       | (a)  | any payment of Taxation made or to be made by a Group
Company the liability for which arises as a result of any Transaction or
Transactions occurring on or before Completion (other than Taxation arising in
respect of income, profits or gains earned after Completion as a result of any
such Transaction or Transactions) or in respect of any profits earned on or
before Completion; 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (b)  | any out-of-pocket costs or expenses reasonably and
properly incurred by the Purchaser or a Group Company solely and directly in
connection with any payment of Taxation as is referred to in the preceding
paragraphs or in connection with any action taken in avoiding, resisting or
settling any such payment of Taxation or such non-availability, loss,
reduction or cancellation of a right to a repayment of Taxation, 
---|---|--- 
  



  

whether or not a Group Company is or may be entitled to claim reimbursement
of the payment from any person.

  



     2.2  | If the Seller is liable to pay an amount to the Purchaser or
any other member of the Purchaser\'s Group pursuant to this Tax Covenant or
the Tax Warranties and: 
---|--- 
  



       | (a)  | that payment is subject to a deduction or withholding
for or on account of Tax; or 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (b)  | the receipt of that payment is subject to Tax, 
---|---|--- 
  



  

then the payment must be grossed up by such an amount as is necessary to
ensure that the net amount retained by the recipient after deduction or
withholding of Tax or payment of Tax equals the amount the recipient would
have retained had the deduction, withholding or Tax not been payable. A
recipient will be deemed to be subject to Tax (whether by way of assessment,
deduction, withholding or otherwise) if Tax arises or is imposed on the head
company of a consolidated group of which the recipient is a member.

     2.3  | For the purposes of this Schedule (other than paragraph 3),
all rights and liabilities of the parties shall be calculated on the
assumption (if not actually the case) that the date of Completion is the end
of an accounting period or a taxable period (as appropriate) and that the
Completion Statement is the consolidated balance sheet of the Group for an
accounting period or a taxable period (as appropriate) ending on that date. 
---|--- 
  



     3.  | PAYMENT 
---|--- 
  



  

A payment to be made by the Seller under paragraph 2 shall be made (i) within
forty five Business Days from the date on which notice setting out the amount
due is received by the Seller from the Purchaser or a Group Company in
accordance with paragraph 5 of Schedule 6 or (ii) if later:

  



       | (a)  | subject to subparagraph (d), in the case of a payment
of Taxation within subparagraph 2.1(a)(a), on the date which is two Business
Days prior to the last date on which that payment of Taxation may be made in
order to avoid incurring a liability to interest or penalties; 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (b)  | in the case of a deemed payment of Taxation referred to
in subparagraph 1.3, on the date which is one Business Day prior to the
earliest date on which Taxation becomes payable which would not have been
payable had the Relief not been used; and 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (c)  | if the payment relates to a liability to make a payment
of Tax which is disputed by the Seller or a Group Company (a Disputed
Liability) and the date on which payment of that Tax is required by law has
been postponed following an application to the relevant Taxation Authority,
court or tribunal, or the Tax does not in practice have to be paid until the
Disputed Liability is determined, five Business Days before the date on which
payment in respect of that Tax becomes required by law after that
postponement, or is in practice required to be made following determination of
the Disputed Liability, provided always that 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (i)  | if any action to be taken for the purposes of
resisting, appealing, disputing, compromising or defending that Disputed
Liability (including any such action to be taken at the request or direction
of the Seller in accordance with any provision of this Schedule) cannot be
taken prior to the Tax that is the subject matter of the Disputed Liability,
or a payment on account of that Tax, being paid, or if failure to pay the
Disputed Liability would have a material adverse effect on the business of the
Purchaser's Group, then the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser an amount equal
to that amount of Tax (a Disputed Tax Payment) within forty five Business Days
after receipt by the Seller of written notice from the Purchaser specifying
that amount and including evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Seller that
the action to be taken for the purposes of resisting, appealing, disputing,
compromising or defending that Disputed Liability cannot be taken prior to the
Tax that is the subject matter of the Disputed Liability, or a payment on
account of that Tax, being paid, or of the material adverse effect on the
business of the Purchaser's Group; and 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (ii)  | if the Seller makes a Disputed Tax Payment, and the
Disputed Liability is settled, compromised or determined at a lesser sum than
the amount of the Disputed Tax Payment, then the difference between the
Disputed Tax Payment and the amount for which the Disputed Liability is
settled, compromised or determined shall be repaid to the Seller within five
Business Days after, as applicable: (A) the receipt of a repayment in respect
thereof by a Group Company or any member of the Purchasers\' Group from the
relevant Taxation Authority; or (B) if such a repayment is set off against any
other amount payable to the relevant Taxation Authority, the date upon which
that other amount would otherwise have been due for payment.

       | (h)  | it arises as a result of the failure or omission of a

give any valid notice or consent or to do any other thing under the provisions

---|---|--- 
  



       | (j)  | it arises as a result of any change after Completion of
the date to which a Group Company makes up its accounts or in the bases,

is reported by the auditors for the time being of a Group Company to be
necessary in their opinion because such bases, methods or policies of
accounting as at the date of Completion are not in accordance with any
generally accepted accounting practice or principle then current; or 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (k)  | it would not have arisen (or would have been reduced)
but for a cessation, or any change in the nature or conduct, of any trade
carried on by a Group Company at Completion, being a cessation or change
occurring on or after Completion; or 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (l)  | it would not have arisen (or would have been reduced)

documents or any written requests for responses to any questions in respect of
a Potential Liability, the Purchaser shall, provided such requests are
reasonable, provide such documentation or answer such questions (which answers
shall be in written form), as the case may be, within 20 Business Days of
receipt of such request or question. 
---|--- 
  



     7.8  | If, within 15 Business Days (or such lesser time as is
reasonable if there is a statutory or administrative time limit for making
submissions to the relevant Taxation Authority) of receiving any draft
computation, return, ancillary information accounts or correspondence or
details of negotiations or proposed agreements or compromises referred to in
the subparagraphs above, the Seller makes any representations to the Purchaser
those representations shall, except to the extent that they are unreasonable,
be reflected in such tax computations, returns, ancillary information,
statements, reports, accounts; or correspondence, negotiations, agreements or
compromises. If the Seller does not make any representations in the
appropriate time as referred to above, or if it makes such representations
which are reflected in such revised drafts, the Seller shall be deemed to have
agreed the contents of such drafts and the Purchaser shall be free to make
such submissions to the relevant Taxation Authority. 
---|---

Completion Statement

  



       | 1.  | Preparation of the draft Completion Statement 
---|---|--- 
  



  

As soon as reasonably practicable and by no later than 40 Business Days
following Completion, the Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the Seller a
draft completion statement setting out the CY21 EBITDA Amount, the CY21
EBITDA Adjustment Amount, Net Debt and Working Capital of the Group
Companies as at Completion (the draft Completion Statement). The Completion
Statement (including the draft Completion Statement) shall be prepared in the
form shown in Part 2 of this Schedule and in accordance with the following:

  



       | (a)  | in accordance with the specific accounting policies,
principles, practices and rules set out in paragraph 2 of this Schedule; 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (b)  | to the extent not covered by paragraph (a) above, in
accordance with the same accounting policies, principles, practices, rules,
estimation techniques and procedures as were actually used in the preparation
of the Management Accounts, ; and 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (c)  | to the extent not covered by paragraph (a) or (b)
above, in accordance with US GAAP as at 31 December 2019. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

For the avoidance of doubt, paragraph (a) above shall take precedence over
paragraphs (b) and (c) above, and paragraphs (b) shall take precedence over
paragraph (c).

  



       | 2.  | Specific Accounting Principles 
---|---|--- 
  



       | 2.1  | Except as required by paragraphs 2.2 to 2.4 of this
Schedule, the following accounting treatments shall be applied in preparing
the Completion Statement: 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (a)  | the Completion Statement shall be prepared on a
consolidated basis by reference to the seven-digit general ledger of the Group
Companies as at the Effective Time and applying procedures that would
customarily be adopted at a financial year end, including eliminating intra-
group balances together with any intra-group profits. No item shall be
included more than once in the Completion Statement, or be included (or
excluded) solely on the grounds of immateriality, and no account shall be
taken of the funds flows arising at or as a consequence of Completion; 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (b)  | the Completion Statement shall be expressed in AUD and
all amounts expressed in any other currencies shall be translated into AUD at
the Exchange Rate; and 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (c)  | the Completion Statement shall take into account
information in respect of Adjusting Events as defined in ASC 855 (Subsequent
Events) up until the time the Purchaser delivers the draft Completion
Statement to the Seller (the Delivery Time). 
---|---|--- 
  



       | 2.2  | The Completion Statement shall exclude fixed and non-
current assets other than prepaid accreditation fees, deferred contract costs
and other security deposits (GL Account 1970100) and for these purposes, fixed
assets shall include capitalised course development costs, capitalised staff
costs, in each case whether or not recharged from the Seller's Group, and
intangible fixed assets. 
---|---|--- 
  



       | 2.3  | Cash shall comprise amounts which are freely available
to be lent, spent, or distributed by the Group Companies in the ordinary
course of business and shall exclude: (i) any cash held in China; and (ii) any
restricted or trapped cash as it relates to international student deposits
(including but not limited to GL Accounts 1008261, 1028202 and 1086570),
domestic tuition assurance deposits (including but not limited to GL Accounts
1087803, 1087820 and 1087830) and government grant funding (including but not
limited to GL Account 1018240) (together these amounts in sub-paragraph (ii)
shall form Restricted Cash). Restricted Cash shall be included in the
calculation of Working Capital and Estimated Working Capital. For the
avoidance of doubt if the between the date of this agreement and Completion,
(x) domestic tuition assurance deposits; and/or (y) security deposit amounts,
are released and replaced with bank guarantees or letters of credit, in each
case in accordance with all applicable laws, then such amounts of cash
released shall be excluded from the calculation of Working Capital and
Estimated Working Capital, and the Target Working Capital shall be reduced by
the same amount. In relation to subparagraph (y), to the extent such bank
guarantees or letters of credit do not remain on foot on and from Completion,
and as a result such bank guarantees or letters of credit must be replaced by
the Purchaser, any such amounts in connection with any replacement bank
guarantees or letters of credit are not to be included in the calculation of
Working Capital, Estimated Working Capital and Target Working Capital. 
---|---|---

       | 2.4  | Revenue shall be recognised in accordance with
paragraph 1.1(b) above, provided that: 
---|---|---

scholarships or discounts on a straight-line basis over the duration of the
academic session to which it relates; and 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (b)  | exam fee revenue shall be recognised on the later of
the fee being received and the exam being taken. 
---|---|--- 
  



       | 2.5  | A liability for deferred revenue shall be recognised in
Working Capital equal to any amounts received or receivable by the Group
Companies (including student deposits, grants, subsidies and sponsorship) in
advance of revenue recognition in accordance with paragraph 2.4 above. 
---|---|--- 
  



       | 2.6  | Prepayments in the Completion Statement shall comprise
amounts paid by the Group Companies on or prior to the Effective Time in
respect of goods and services receivable by the Group Companies after the
Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, prepayments shall exclude any
prepayments and other assets in relation to Seller's Group insurance policies
and any other contractual or other arrangements, in each case that cease to be
of benefit to the Group Companies following Completion. 
---|---|--- 
  



       | 2.7  | To the extent not provided for as deferred revenue,
full provision shall be made (without double counting) against the following
receivables (including accrued income) that remain unpaid at the Delivery
Time:- receivables in relation to students who are no longer enrolled and have
not attended courses within the preceding six months. 
---|---|--- 
  



       | 2.8  | Full provision (without double counting) shall also be
made against receivables to the extent they relate to revenue recognised on or
prior to the Effective Time and prior to the Delivery Time have been credit
noted or become refundable, including as a result of a Group Company having
cancelled participation in a course. 
---|---|--- 
  



       | 2.9  | To the extent not already included in Net Debt, an
accrual shall be made in Working Capital for goods and services provided to
the Group Companies on or before the Effective Time which have not been paid
for by the Effective Time and for any other liabilities which meet the
criteria for recognition as liabilities in accordance with US GAAP. Such
accrual shall include emoluments and outgoings in respect of employees and
contractors up to the Effective Time including all salaries, overtime payable,
payments for services, commissions, incentive plans, long service awards,
employee bonuses (including discretionary annual bonuses), pension
contributions, severance costs, insurance, and any post-retirement and / or
healthcare benefits and accrued vacation pay or holiday entitlement (including
tax and social security contributions on the foregoing), but excluding capital
expenditure. 
---|---|---

       | 2.10  | The liability to be included in Working Capital in
respect of the discretionary annual bonuses (including, for these purposes,
the corporate bonus plans and local bonus plans in the Management Accounts)
shall be the aggregate of unpaid bonuses, if any, in respect of periods ended
on or before 31 December 2019 plus an amount equal to (i) the number of days
from 1 January 2020 to the Completion Date (inclusive) divided by 365,
multiplied by the aggregate bonus awarded or budgeted to be awarded by the
Group Companies in respect of periods on or after 1 January 2020 (together, in
each case, with Taxes thereon but excluding transaction related bonuses which
shall be accrued in accordance with subparagraph 2.11(b) below), and less any
portion of such bonuses paid on or prior to the Effective Time.

the purposes of this Schedule, discretionary bonuses unless awarded by the
Seller), costs and advisory fees (including Taxes thereon) to the extent
payable by the Group Companies after the Effective Time; 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (c)  | any obligations of a Group Company to pay any amounts
in respect of phantom share schemes or other equity incentive arrangements
(including the full amount of any retention and/or transaction bonuses)
(including Taxes thereon) to the extent payable by a Group Company after the
Effective Time; 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (d)  | any liabilities in respect of derivative instruments
measured at the amount that would be required to settle these at Completion; 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (e)  | any break fees or prepayment penalties, premiums, fees,
costs or expenses which may be incurred by a Group Company in relation to the
repayment or termination of any of (a), (b), (c) and (d) above at Completion; 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (f)  | any accrued but unpaid income tax or withholding taxes
(including withholding taxes payable on Seller's Group royalties, network fees

Effective Time. For the purposes of the Completion Accounts, the Effective
Time will be treated as the end of a Tax accounting period;

       | (g)  | the current asset retirement obligations associated
with the Pyrmont Street leases;

       | (h)  | current accrued long service leave shall be included in
Completion Net Debt as at the Effective Time and calculated on a consistent
basis as the Accounts (including applicable tax and social security
contributions); and

       | (i)  | any shortfall in capital expenditure paid prior to the
Completion Date compared to the forecast capital expenditure for the
equivalent period as provided for in Schedule 17.

For the avoidance of doubt, any bank guarantees or letters of credits under
or in connection with the Key Contracts at items 1 and 2 of Schedule 15 shall
be excluded from Net Debt.

  



       | 2.12  | If any account could be included within more than one

of doubt, only be included within one of such definitions to avoid possible
double counting. 
---|---|--- 
  



       | 2.13  | Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities shall
be excluded from the Completion Accounts. 
---|---|--- 
  



       | 2.14  | Operating and capital lease liabilities shall be
