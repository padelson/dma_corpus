                        AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER


     THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the "Agreement") is entered into as
of the 8th day of December, 2000, by and among PBOC Holdings, Inc., a savings
institution holding company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware
(the "Holding Company"), FBOP Corporation, a bank and savings institution
holding company organized under the laws of the State of Illinois ("FBOP") and
FBOP Acquisition Company, a corporation organized under the laws of the State
of Delaware ("Acquisition").  Holding Company and Acquisition are sometimes
referred to herein as the "Constituent Corporations."

                           W I T N E S S E T H:

     WHEREAS, Acquisition is a wholly-owned subsidiary of FBOP; and

     WHEREAS, the parties desire that Holding Company be acquired by
Acquisition through the merger of Acquisition with and into Holding Company
upon the terms and conditions contained herein and in accordance with
applicable laws (the "Merger"); and

     WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Holding Company deems the Merger to
be advisable and in the best interests of Holding Company and its stockholders
and has adopted resolutions approving this Agreement and directing that this
Agreement be submitted for consideration at a meeting of its stockholders; and

     WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of FBOP and Acquisition deem the Merger
to be advisable and in the best interests of their respective stockholders and
each has adopted resolutions approving this Agreement; and

     WHEREAS, following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Peoples
Bank of California, a federally-chartered stock savings institution and
wholly-owned subsidiary of Holding Company (the "Savings Institution"), and
California National Bank, a national banking institution and wholly-owned
subsidiary of FBOP ("CNB," and sometimes referred to herein as the "Surviving
Bank"), may enter into a Bank Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Bank Merger
Agreement") providing for the merger (the "Bank Merger"), of Savings
Institution with and into CNB, with the Bank Merger to be consummated
following the consummation of the Merger (the Merger and the Bank Merger and
the transactions contemplated thereby are referred to herein as the
"Transaction");

     NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the premises and the mutual
agreements, representations, warranties and covenants herein contained and in
the Proxies, for the purpose of prescribing the terms and conditions of the
Merger, the manner of converting the common stock, $0.01 par value per share,
of Holding Company (the "Common Stock")


into cash, and such other details and provisions as are deemed desirable in
connection with the Merger, the parties, intending to be bound, hereby agree
as follows:

                                 ARTICLE I

                                   MERGER

     (a)  Merger.  In accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and
the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL"), at the Effective Time (as
herein defined), Acquisition shall be merged with and into Holding Company and
the separate existence of Acquisition thereupon shall cease.  Following the
Merger, Holding Company shall continue as the surviving corporation
("Surviving Corporation").  At Acquisition's option, subject to the filing of
all necessary applications and the receipt of all required regulatory
approvals, the Merger may be structured so that Holding Company merges into
another direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of FBOP (such entity, if
any, to be included in the definition of "Acquisition"); provided, however,
that (i) Acquisition shall assign to such entity, and such entity shall
assume, all rights and obligations of Acquisition under this Agreement, (ii)
the consideration to be paid to the holders of Holding Company Common Stock is
not thereby changed in kind or reduced in amount as a result of such
modification or the taxation of any amounts to be received by the holders of
Holding Company Common Stock is not altered and (iii) such modification will
not materially delay or jeopardize receipt of any required regulatory
approvals or any other condition to the obligations of FBOP and Acquisition
set forth herein.

     (b)  Effective Time.  As soon as practicable after the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article X, the parties hereto will
file a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary
of State of Delaware and make all other filings or recordings required by the
DGCL in connection with the Merger.  The Merger shall become effective at such
time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of
Delaware, or at such later time as is specified in the Certificate of Merger
(the "Effective Time").

     (c)  Effects of the Merger.  The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the DGCL.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights,
privileges, powers and franchise of the Constituent Corporations shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the
Constituent Corporations shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

     (d)  Prior Approvals.  The parties hereto acknowledge that the
requisite approvals for the Transaction must be received from or notices must
be given to certain federal governmental bodies and agencies including, but
not limited to: (i) the Office of Thrift Supervision of the Department of the
Treasury (the "OTS"); (ii) the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the
"FDIC"); (iii) the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

                                      2


("Federal Reserve Board"); and (iv) any other regulatory authorities having
jurisdiction, which approvals or notices (x) shall not contain conditions
that, individually or in the aggregate, could likely have or lead to a
Material Adverse Effect (as hereinafter defined) on FBOP, CNB or Acquisition
or (y) shall not, individually or in the aggregate, so materially reduce the
economic or business benefits of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to FBOP that had such condition or requirement been known, FBOP, in
its reasonable judgment, would not have entered into this Agreement.  The
governmental bodies and agencies referred to in items (i)-(iv) above are
referred to herein as the "Applicable Governmental Authorities".

     (e)  Certificate of Incorporation.  The Certificate of Incorporation
of Holding Company in effect at the time of the Merger shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter
amended as provided thereunder and in the DGCL.

     (f)  Bylaws.  The Bylaws of Acquisition in effect at the time of the
Merger shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until altered, amended
or repealed, as provided thereunder and in the Certificate of Incorporation
and the DGCL.

     (g)  Directors and Officers.  The directors and officers of
Acquisition at the time of the Merger shall be the directors and officers of
the Surviving Corporation, in each case to serve, in accordance with the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until
their successors shall have been elected and shall qualify.  If at the
Effective Time a vacancy shall exist on the Board of Directors or in any of
the offices of the Surviving Corporation, such vacancy may thereafter be
filled in the manner provided by the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

     (h)  Additional Actions.  If, at any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any further
assignments or assurances in law or any other acts are necessary or desirable
(a) to best perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving
Corporation, title to and possession of any property or right of Acquisition
acquired or to be acquired by reason of, or as a result of, the Merger, or (b)
otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, Holding Company and its

proper deeds, assignments and assurances in law and to do all acts necessary

shall be as follows:

               (i)    Each share of Common Stock of Holding Company which is
     issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other
     than Dissenting Shares

                                      3


     (as defined below) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
     on the part of the holder thereof, at and after the Effective Time be
     converted into the right to receive $10.00 (the "Per Share Merger
     Consideration") without interest thereon, after the date when such holder
     satisfies the procedures contemplated by subpart (k) below in accordance
     with the provisions of this Agreement.

               (ii)   At the Effective Time, Acquisition shall pay or cause to
     be paid to each of the persons listed on Schedule 1(q) hereto, with
     respect to the outstanding options for Holding Company Common Stock
     (without regard to the expiration date thereof) (collectively, the
     "Options") set forth opposite such person's name therein, an amount per
     share of Common Stock subject to an Option equal to the excess of the
     Per Share Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such
     Option, as set forth on Schedule 1(q) (the "Cash Consideration Per
     Option").  Concurrently with the payment of the Cash Consideration Per
     Option, each holder of an Option shall deliver to Acquisition evidence
     satisfactory to Acquisition of the cancellation of such Option.  At the
     Effective Time, each Option shall be canceled and retired and shall
     cease to exist and shall be deemed to represent only the right to
     receive the Cash Consideration Per Option.  Payment of the Cash
     Consideration Per Option in accordance with this Article I(i)(ii) shall
     be deemed to be full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
     Options.  All amounts payable under this Article I(i)(ii) shall be
     subject to any required withholding of taxes and shall be paid without
     interest.

               (iii)  Each share of Holding Company Common Stock, if any,
     which is issued and held in the treasury of Holding Company, shall, by
     virtue of the Merger, at the Effective Time, be retired and canceled,
     and no cash or other consideration shall be issued with respect thereto.

               (iv)   Each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share,
     of Acquisition issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
     Time shall be converted into and exchangeable for one share of common
     stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation
     ("Surviving Corporation Common Stock").

     (j)  Total Merger Consideration.  Notwithstanding the preceding
subparts of this Article, except to the extent payments made to holders of
Dissenting Shares exceed the Per Share Merger Consideration, in no event shall
the total cash consideration paid by Acquisition hereunder (the "Aggregate
Merger Consideration") exceed $198,762,050 plus the cash payment for the
Options as described in subpart (i)(ii) above.  To the extent that any of the
Options are exercised prior to the Closing, the $198,762,050 amount shall be
increased by an amount equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of
Holding Company Common Stock issued pursuant to the exercise of such Options
and (B) $10.00.

     (k)  Surrender of Shares.  As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, each holder of shares of Holding Company Common Stock shall,
upon presentation and surrender

                                      4


of the certificate or certificates therefor to the Paying Agent (as defined
below) for cancellation in accordance with the transmittal materials described
below, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check or checks payable
to such person representing the payment of cash into which such holder's shares
of Holding Company Common Stock have been converted at the Effective Time.
Each certificate which represented issued and outstanding shares of Holding
Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed
canceled at the Effective Time and shall represent only the right to receive
cash for each share represented by such certificate.  In no event shall the
holder of any such surrendered certificates be entitled to receive interest
on any of the funds to be received in the Merger.

     (l)  Designation of Paying Agent; Investment of Funds.  Registrar and
Transfer Company shall act as paying agent hereunder ("Paying Agent"), and
Acquisition and FBOP shall make available to Paying Agent at the Effective
Time (i) an amount in cash equal to the product of the Per Share Merger
Consideration times the number of shares of Holding Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, which shall not include
the number of shares of Holding Company Common Stock held in Holding Company's
treasury, less the number of Holding Company Dissenting Shares whose holders
have complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL as described in
subpart (n) below at or prior to the Effective Time and less any shares owned
by Acquisition or any other subsidiary or affiliate of Acquisition, and (ii)
an amount in cash equal to the aggregate Cash Consideration Per Option.  The
cash deposited with the Paying Agent shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by Acquisition.

     (m)  Transmittal Materials.  As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, but in any event within three business days following the
Effective Time, Acquisition shall send or cause to be sent to each former
holder of record of shares of Holding Company Common Stock transmittal
materials for use in surrendering their certificate or certificates in
exchange for cash.  The letter of transmittal will contain instructions with
respect to the surrender of such certificates.  Acquisition shall instruct
record date holders of Holding Company Common Stock who hold such shares for
the account of others to provide the respective beneficial holders of such
shares instructions with respect to the surrender of their shares.

     (n)  Dissenting Shares.  Each outstanding share of Holding Company
Common Stock as to which a proper written objection to the Merger is filed in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and which is not voted in favor of the
Merger shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive cash
hereunder unless and until the holder shall have failed to perfect or shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost his or her right to appraisal of and
payment for such shares of Common Stock under Section 262 of the DGCL, at
which time such shares of Common Stock shall be converted into a right to
receive cash in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as provided
for other outstanding shares of Common Stock in this Article.  All such shares
of Holding Company Common Stock as to which such a written objection is so
filed and which are not voted in favor of the Merger, except any such shares
of Holding Company Common Stock the holder of which shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost

                                      5


his or her right to appraisal of and payment for such shares of Common Stock
under the DGCL are herein called "Dissenting Shares" and each holder is
herein called a "Dissenting Shareholder."  Holding Company shall give
Acquisition prompt notice upon receipt by Holding Company of any such
written objection to the Merger.  Holding Company agrees that prior to the
Effective Time it will not, except with the prior written consent of
Acquisition, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer
to settle, any such objection.  Each Dissenting Shareholder who becomes
entitled, pursuant to the provisions of the DGCL, to payment for the fair cash
value of his or her shares of Holding Company Common Stock shall receive
payment therefor from Holding Company as the Surviving Corporation (but only
after the amount thereof shall have been agreed upon or finally determined
pursuant to such provisions), and such shares of Common Stock shall be retired
and canceled.

     (o)  Termination of Paying Agent's Duties.  Promptly following the date
which is twelve months after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall
deliver to FBOP all cash and other documents in its possession relating to the
transactions described in this Agreement, and the Paying Agent's duties shall
terminate.  Thereafter, each holder of a certificate formerly representing
shares of Holding Company Common Stock who has not previously surrendered such
certificate may surrender such certificate to FBOP and (subject to applicable
abandoned property, escheat and similar laws) receive in exchange therefore
the Per Share Merger Consideration for each share of Holding Company Common
Stock represented by such certificate.

     (p)  Closing of Holding Company's Transfer Books.  At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer records of Holding Company shall be closed and no
transfer of shares of Holding Company Common Stock shall thereafter be made.

     (q)  Employee Stock Options; Restricted Stock.  Schedule 1(q) hereto
contains an accurate and complete list of all outstanding options and
restricted stock awards, including the name of the grantee, date of grant,
number of shares and exercise price.

                                ARTICLE II

            REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF HOLDING COMPANY

          Holding Company represents and warrants to Acquisition and FBOP
with respect to Holding Company and the Subsidiaries (as defined below) as
follows (it being understood and acknowledged that no representations and
warranties are made with respect to BYL Bancorp, a California corporation, and
BYL Bank Group, a California commercial bank and wholly owned subsidiary of
BYL Bancorp):

     (a)  Organization and Standing of Holding Company.  Holding Company is
a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Delaware.  Holding Company has the corporate power and
authority to own or lease all of its

                                      6


properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it
makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure
to be so licensed or qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect
(as defined below) on Holding Company and the Subsidiaries (defined below),
taken as a whole.  Holding Company is duly registered as a savings and
loan holding company under the Home Owners' Loan Act, as amended ("HOLA"), and
the regulations issued thereunder.

As used in this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect" or "Material
Adverse Change" means with respect to any person, any effect or change that
(i) is material and adverse to the financial condition, results of operations
or business of such person or (ii) materially impairs the ability of such
person to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Bank Merger Agreement; provided, however, that Material Adverse Effect shall
not be deemed to include:  (x) the impact of changes in (a) laws, regulations
or policies of any Applicable Governmental Authority or interpretations
thereof, or (b) generally accepted accounting principles, that in each case
are generally applicable to the banking industry; or (y) in the case of
Holding Company, actions taken or to be taken by Holding Company upon the
written request of FBOP and/or Acquisition pursuant to this Agreement or the
Bank Merger Agreement.

     (b)  Organization and Standing of Savings Institution.  Savings
Institution is a federally-chartered stock savings and loan association, duly
organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the United
States of America, and Savings Institution has the requisite corporate power
and authority to enter into the Bank Merger.  Savings Institution is duly
authorized to conduct a savings and loan business, is a member of the Federal
Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, and is duly authorized to operate each of its
offices, including branch offices (collectively, the main office and each
branch location are referred to herein as the "Branches").  Savings
Institution is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holding Company.

     (c)  Holding Company Subsidiaries.  Schedule 2(c) hereto sets forth a
list of all of Holding Company's direct and indirect subsidiaries including
Savings Institution (hereinafter separately called a "Subsidiary" and
collectively called the "Subsidiaries").  The Schedule sets forth the
authorized capital stock, the number of shares duly issued and outstanding,
the number so owned by each shareholder of the Subsidiary and the jurisdiction
of incorporation of each Subsidiary.  The shares of capital stock of the
Subsidiaries are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable (subject to
statutory obligations of holders, if any), and are owned free and clear of any
liens, claims, charges or encumbrances.  Except as disclosed on such Schedule,
neither Holding Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has any investment in any
subsidiary or any investment in any partnership, joint venture, limited
liability company or similar entity, all of which investments are owned free
and clear of any liens, claims, charges or encumbrances except as disclosed
thereon.  Each of the Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation and has the

                                      7


corporate power to own or lease its properties and carry on its business as
now being conducted.  Each of the Subsidiaries is duly qualified or otherwise
authorized to transact business as a foreign corporation and is in good
standing in every jurisdiction in which such qualification or authorization
is required by law to carry on its business as now being conducted, except
where the failure so to qualify or to be authorized would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on the assets, properties, business or financial condition of
Holding Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.  Schedule 2(c) sets
forth a true and correct description of the activities of each of the
Subsidiaries.  No certificate of authority identified in such Schedule has
been revoked, restricted, suspended, limited or modified nor is any certificate
of authority the subject of, nor to the knowledge of Holding Company is there
a basis for, a proceeding for revocation, restriction, suspension, limitation
or modification.

     (d)  Capitalization.  The authorized capital stock of Holding Company
consists of 25,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share,
none of which has been issued, and 75,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of which 19,876,205 shares are issued and outstanding
as of the date hereof.  All of the issued and outstanding shares of Holding
Company Common Stock have been validly issued and are fully paid and non-

preemptive rights.  As of the date hereof, 2,012,212 shares of Holding Company
Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding Holding
Company stock options granted pursuant to Holding Company's 1999 Stock Option
Plan and 2000 Stock Incentive Plan.  Except for the options and shares
specified above and as reflected in Schedule 2(d), there is no contract,
understanding, restriction or agreement, including any voting trust or other
agreement or understanding with respect to the voting of any of the capital
stock of Holding Company, or any convertible, exchangeable or exercisable
security, option, warrant, call, or commitment on the part of Holding Company
of any character relating to issued or unissued shares of the capital stock of
Holding Company.

     (e)  Authorization.  The Board of Directors of Holding Company has
adopted resolutions approving the Agreement and the Transaction and has
authorized the execution and delivery of the Agreement and has directed by
resolution that the Agreement be submitted to a vote of the holders of shares
of Holding Company Common Stock taken at a meeting called for the purpose of

its stockholders in accordance with law, subject to obtaining all required

delivered to FBOP true and complete copies of its and each of the
Subsidiaries' Certificates of

                                      8

Incorporation (or similar organizational document) or Bylaws, or in default
under any indenture or under any material agreement or other material
instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties is
bound or to which it is subject.  Subject to the receipt of all consents and
approvals contemplated by this Agreement, neither the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, the consummation of the Transaction nor the fulfillment of

judicial, administrative or arbitral order, writ, award, judgment, injunction

the creation of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any of the assets of
Holding Company, Savings Institution or any other Subsidiary under any such
agreement or instrument, or (v) terminate or give any party thereto the right
to terminate any such indenture, agreement or instrument, except with respect
to (iii) or (iv) above, such as individually or in the aggregate could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Holding
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and which could not reasonably
be expected to jeopardize or delay consummation of the Transaction.  Except as
disclosed in Schedule 2(h) hereto, no consent of any third party to any
indenture or any material agreement or other material instrument to which
Holding Company, Savings Institution or any other Subsidiary is a party is
required in connection with the Transaction.  Holding Company agrees that
prior to the Effective Time it will use its best efforts to obtain all
required consents to the Transaction of parties to any such indenture,
agreement, or other instrument which is material to the business of Holding
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

     (i)  SEC Reports; Financial Statements.  Holding Company has filed all
required forms, reports, registration statements and documents with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), since December 31, 1995
(collectively, the "SEC Reports"), each of which, as of its respective date,
complied in all material respects with all applicable

                                      9


requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act")
and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").  As
of their respective dates, none of the SEC Reports, including, without
limitation, any financial statements or schedules included therein, contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.  The audited consolidated financial statements of Holding Company
included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31,
1997, 1998 and 1999, and the unaudited consolidated interim financial
statements included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarters
ended March 31, 2000, June 30, 2000, and September 30, 2000 fairly present in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a
consistent basis (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto),
the consolidated financial position of Holding Company and its Subsidiaries
as of the dates thereof and their consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the periods then ended (in the case
of any unaudited interim financial statements, subject to (i) normal year-end
adjustments and (ii) standard limitations on the application of generally
accepted accounting principles).

     Except as and to the extent reflected in the interim consolidated
statement of financial position of Holding Company and the Subsidiaries as of
September 30, 2000, and notes thereto (the "September 30, 2000 Balance Sheet")
or in Schedule 2(i) hereto, neither Holding Company nor any Subsidiary had, as
of September 30, 2000, any liability or obligation (absolute, contingent or
otherwise) except for contractual liabilities arising in the ordinary course
which are not required to be reflected in a balance sheet prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  Except as and to
the extent disclosed in Schedule 2(i) hereto, neither Holding Company nor any
Subsidiary has incurred any liability or obligation (absolute, contingent or
otherwise) since September 30, 2000 other than in the ordinary course of
business.

     (j)  Regulatory Reports and Filings.  Holding Company, Savings
Institution and each Subsidiary has filed all reports, notices and other
statements, together with any amendments required to be made with respect
thereto, if any, that it was required to file with the OTS, the FDIC, the
Federal Home Loan Bank, and any other governmental agency or authority with
jurisdiction over Holding Company, Savings Institution or such Subsidiary and
each such report, notice and other statement, including the financial
statements, exhibits and schedules thereto, complied in all material respects
with the relevant statutes, rules and regulations enforced or promulgated by
the regulatory authority with which it was filed. No material deficiencies
have been asserted by any such governmental or regulatory body with respect to
such registrations, filings and submissions that have not been satisfied.
Holding Company has furnished to FBOP or Acquisition copies of all regulatory
filings (and all related correspondence) for Holding Company and any
Subsidiary for and during the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997, 1998 and
1999 and the quarters ended March 31, 2000, June 30, 2000 and September 30,
2000 as filed with the OTS (the "Regulatory Reports").  The Regulatory
Reports, including, without limitation, the provisions made therein for
investments

                                     11


and the valuation thereof, and loan loss reserves, together with the notes
thereto, fairly present the financial position, assets, liabilities,
change in financial position, surplus and other funds of Holding Company and
Savings Institution as of the dates thereof and the results of its operations
for the periods indicated in conformity with regulatory accounting principles
prescribed or permitted by law or the rules and regulations of OTS, applied on
a consistent basis with prior periods, except as set forth therein.  Except
for liabilities and obligations disclosed or provided for in the Regulatory
Reports, Savings Institution did not have, as of the respective dates of each
such Regulatory Reports, any liabilities or obligations (whether absolute or
contingent and whether due or to become due) except for contractual
liabilities arising in the ordinary course which are not required to be
reflected in regulatory financial statements.  All books of account of Savings
Institution and each other Subsidiary fairly and accurately disclose in all
material respects all the transactions, properties, assets, investments,
liabilities and obligations of Savings Institution or the respective
Subsidiary and all such books of account are in the possession of Savings
Institution or the respective Subsidiary and are true and complete in all
material respects.

               (i)   Real Estate and Mortgages.  Schedule 2(l)(i) hereto sets
     forth a list and summary description of (a) all real property owned by

     for which deficiency notices have been issued or that are otherwise not

     and other investments owned by Holding Company or any Subsidiary as of
     the date hereof are evidenced by written instruments and certificates
     (except where in non-certificated form), and to the best knowledge of
     Holding Company after due inquiry, are valid and genuine in all material
     respects.  All such bonds, stocks, and other investments are permissible
     investments under applicable laws and regulations.  Except as disclosed

     Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.  All such real property
     complies with all applicable private agreements, zoning requirements,
     Environmental Laws (defined below), and other governmental laws and
     regulations relating thereto, except where the failure to do so could

     Company, threatened with respect to the Real Property.

is conducting its business in compliance with all applicable federal, state,
and local laws, regulations and requirements currently in force relating to

condition existing, with respect to the release, emission, discharge or
presence of hazardous substances in connection with the business of Holding
Company or any Subsidiary, which condition could subject Holding Company or
any Subsidiary to any proceeding or remediation under such Environmental Laws

Holding Company or any Subsidiary is bound involving in the aggregate an
amount in excess of $100,000.  Neither Holding Company nor any Subsidiary is

ordinances, judgments or decrees of all governmental authorities (federal,
state, local, foreign or otherwise) applicable to its businesses, including

complied would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Holding Company or any Subsidiary.  Except as disclosed in
Schedule 2(q) hereto, neither Holding Company nor any Subsidiary has received
any notification of any asserted failure by it to comply with any of such
laws.

     (r)  Taxes.

     with respect to any matter relating to Taxes which is currently in

               (iv)  The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
     Agreement will not give rise to any payments by Holding Company or any
     Subsidiary which payments will not be deductible (in whole or in part)
     by reason of Sections 280G or 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the
     "Code").

                                     15


     (t)  Employee Benefit Plans.

               (i)   Schedule 2(t)(i) hereto sets forth a true and complete
     list of each employee benefit plan, as defined in Section 3(3) of the
     Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")
     and each other plan, arrangement and agreement providing employee
     benefits (collectively the "Plans"), that covers current or former
     employees of Holding Company or any Subsidiary or affiliate and is
     presently maintained by Holding Company or any Subsidiary or any
     affiliate thereof or by any trade or business, whether or not
     incorporated (an "ERISA Affiliate"), which together with Holding Company
     would be deemed a "single employer" within the meaning of Section 4001
     of ERISA.  None of the Plans is a "multiemployer plan," as defined in
     Section 3(37) of ERISA.  Holding Company has delivered or made available
     to FBOP or Acquisition:  copies of all such Plans; any related trust
     agreements, group annuity contracts, insurance policies or other funding
     agreements or arrangements relating thereto; the most recent
     determination letter, if any, from the Internal Revenue Service with
     respect to each of the Plans which is subject to ERISA ("ERISA Plans");
     actuarial valuations, if applicable, for the most recent plan year for
     which such valuations are available; the current summary plan
     descriptions; and the annual return/report on Form 5500 and summary
     annual reports for each of the Plans for each of the last three years.

               (ii)  Each of the ERISA Plans is in compliance in all material
     respects with all applicable provisions of law, including the Code and
     ERISA.  Neither Holding Company nor any ERISA Affiliate currently
     maintains or sponsors a defined benefit pension plan as defined in
     Section 414(j) of the Code and neither Holding Company nor any ERISA
     Affiliate has ever maintained or sponsored any such plan that could give
     rise to a liability against Holding Company or any Subsidiary.

               (iii) The written terms of each of the Plans, and any related
     trust agreement, group annuity contract, insurance policy or other
     funding arrangement are in compliance with all applicable laws in all
     material respects including ERISA, the Code, and the Age Discrimination
     in Employment Act, as applicable, and each of such Plans has been
     administered in substantial compliance with such requirements.

               (iv)  Except with respect to income taxes on benefits paid or
     provided, no income, excise or other tax or penalty (federal or state)
     has been waived or excused, has been paid or is owed by any person
     (including, but not limited to, any Plan, any Plan fiduciary, Holding
     Company and ERISA Affiliates) with respect to the operations of, or any
     transactions with respect to, any Plan.  No action has been taken, nor
     has there been any failure to take any action, nor is any action or
     failure to take action contemplated, that would subject any person or
     entity to any material liability for any tax or penalty in connection
     with any Plan.  No reserve for any taxes or penalties has been
     established with respect to any Plan, nor has any advice been given to
     any person with respect to the need to establish such a reserve.

                                     16


               (v)   There are no (A) actions, suits, arbitrations or claims
     (other than routine claims for benefits), (B) legal, administrative or
     other proceedings or governmental investigations or audits, or (C)
     complaints to or by any governmental entity, which are pending,
     anticipated, or to the Holding Company's best knowledge, threatened,
     against the Plans or their assets.

               (vi)  The present value of the future cost to Holding Company
     and ERISA Affiliates of post-retirement medical benefits that Holding
     Company or any ERISA Affiliate is obligated to provide, calculated on
     the basis of actuarial assumptions Holding Company considers reasonable
     estimates of future experience and which have been provided to
     Acquisition, does not exceed the amount specified in Schedule 2(t)(vi)
     hereto.

               (vii) Neither Holding Company nor any ERISA Affiliate, nor any
     of the ERISA Plans, nor any trust created thereunder, nor any trustee or
     administrator thereof has engaged in a transaction in connection with
     which Holding Company or any ERISA Affiliate, any of the ERISA Plans,
     any such trust, or any trustee or administrator thereof, or any party
     dealing with the ERISA Plans or any such trust could be subject to
     either a civil penalty assessed pursuant to Section 409 or 502(i) of
     ERISA or a tax imposed pursuant to Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code.
     Neither Holding Company nor any ERISA Affiliate is, or, as a result of
     any actions, omissions, occurrences or state of facts existing prior to
     the Effective Time, may become liable for any tax imposed under Section
     4978 of the Code.

     (u)  Insurance.  All properties of Holding Company and each Subsidiary
are covered by valid and currently effective insurance policies issued in
favor of Holding Company or a Subsidiary and such insurance policies provide
Holding Company and its Subsidiaries with coverage and limits for its
operations consistent with past practices and reasonably believed by the
Holding Company to be adequate.  Schedule 2(u) hereto sets forth a true and
correct list of all insurance policies covering Holding Company and the
Subsidiaries.  Holding Company or a Subsidiary is included as an insured party
under such policies or has full rights as a loss payee.  No notice of
cancellation or termination has been received with respect to any such policy.
Such policies will not be terminable or cancelable by reason of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

     (v)  Intentionally Omitted.

     (w)  Deposits.  Schedule 2(w) hereto is a schedule of the aggregate
deposit accounts of Savings Institution, prepared as of the date indicated
thereon, listing by category and by Branch the amount of such deposits,
together with the amount of accrued but unpaid interest thereon (the
"Deposits").  All such Deposits are insured to the fullest permissible extent
by the Savings Association Insurance Fund ("SAIF") administered by the FDIC.
All related

                                     17


insurance premiums due and owing have been paid to the FDIC as of the
date hereof.  Savings Institution has, and will have at the Effective
Time, all rights and full authority to transfer the Deposits pursuant to the
Bank Merger without restriction to the extent customary for a SAIF-insured
institution (subject to any notification or similar requirements pursuant to
laws and regulations limiting deposit insurance to $100,000 per account).  As
of the date hereof, with respect to the Deposits, subject to immaterial
bookkeeping errors, Savings Institution has administered all of the Deposits
in accordance with good and sound financial practices and procedures, and has
properly made all appropriate credits and debits thereto.

     (x)  Loans.

     commitments extended by Savings Institution and any extensions, renewals
     or continuations of such Loans and loan commitments were made in
     accordance with applicable regulatory requirements in the ordinary
     course of business.  The Loans are evidenced by appropriate and
     sufficient documentation based upon customary and ordinary past
     practices for federal savings institutions.

               (ii)  All documents and instruments which evidence the Loans
     are in all material respects legal and enforceable in accordance with
     the terms thereof, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
     moratorium or other laws affecting creditors generally or by the
     exercise of judicial discretion, and authorized under applicable federal
     and state laws and regulations.  For purposes of the foregoing sentence,
     it is agreed and understood that the phrase "enforceable in accordance
     with the terms thereof" shall not mean that the borrower has the
     financial ability to pay a loan or that the collateral is sufficient in
     value to result in payment of the loan secured thereby.

               (iii) Except for loans pledged to the Federal Home Loan Bank or
     participations purchased or sold by the Savings Institution or loans
     held in custody and in each case as fully described at Schedule 2(x)
     hereto, the note evidencing each Loan and the collateral documents
     securing each Loan have not been assigned or pledged, the Savings
     Institution has good and marketable title thereto, and the Savings
     Institution is the sole owner and holder of each note evidencing a Loan
     and each collateral document securing such Loan, and except as fully
     described at Schedule 2(x), each Loan and each collateral document
     securing a Loan is free and clear of any and all prior liens, claims,
     encumbrances, participation interests, equities, pledges, charges or
     security interests of any nature.

     (y)  Reserves.  The loan loss reserves of Savings Institution, as set

accordance with generally accepted methods and principles consistently applied
and, in all cases, have been properly computed in all material respects and in
management's opinion are adequate under applicable

                                     18


requirements of law and generally accepted accounting standards to provide for
possible losses on Loans outstanding.

Schedule 2(z) hereto, neither Holding Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
subject to any cease-and-desist or other order issued by, or is a party to any
written agreement, consent agreement or memorandum of understanding (each a
"Regulatory Agreement"), with any regulatory agency or other government entity
that restricts in any respect the conduct of its business or that relates to
its capital adequacy, its credit policies or its management, nor has Holding
Company or any of its Subsidiaries been notified by any regulatory agency or

their respective obligations under this Agreement and in connection with the
Transaction.

     or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
     proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or

     investigation, shall promptly notify the appropriate Indemnifying Party
     thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying

     assume such defense or a conflict of interest exists or arises between
     the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Parties, the Indemnified
     Parties may retain counsel which is reasonably satisfactory to the
     Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay, promptly as
     statements therefor are received, the reasonable fees and expenses of
     such counsel for the Indemnified Parties (which may not exceed one firm
     in any jurisdiction); (ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the
     defense of any such matter; (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall not be
     liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent;
     and (iv) the Indemnifying Party shall have no obligation hereunder in
     the event that a federal or state banking agency or a court of competent
     jurisdiction shall determine that indemnification of an Indemnified
     Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable laws
     and regulations.

               (iii)     Holding Company shall be permitted to maintain up to
     $15,000,000 in aggregate directors' and officers' liability insurance
     coverage for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective time by
     persons who are currently covered by the directors' and officers'
