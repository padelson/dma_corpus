 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of February 19, 2007 (this "Agreement"), among Deere and Company, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Deere Merger Sub, Inc., an Ohio corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and LESCO, Inc., an Ohio corporation (the "Company"). 

   

 WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the "Board of Directors") has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement, and the Board of Directors has, as of the date of this Agreement, approved and adopted this Agreement and recommended its adoption by the shareholders of the Company; 

   

 WHEREAS, the board of directors of Parent has approved, and Parent, as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, has adopted, this Agreement, and the board of directors of Merger Sub has approved and adopted this Agreement; and 

   

 WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement. 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree as follows: 

   

ARTICLE I 

   

 _THE MERGER_  

   

 Section 1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Ohio General Corporation Law (the "OGCL"), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"), whereupon the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger. The Company in its capacity as the surviving corporation of the Merger is sometimes referred to herein as the "Surviving Corporation." 

  

 Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, 333 West Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60606 at 9:00 a.m., local time, on a date to be specified by the parties (the "Closing Date"), which shall be no later than the second business day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), or at such other place, date and time as the Company and Parent may agree in writing. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, immediately after the Closing, the parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by executing and filing a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio and make all other filings or recordings required under the OGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio, or at such later date as the parties shall agree and as shall be set forth in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective is referred to herein as the "Effective Time"). 

  

 Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The effects of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the OGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all the properties, assets, rights, privileges, immunities, powers, franchises and authority of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all obligations of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the obligations of the Surviving Corporation, all as provided in the OGCL and the other applicable Laws of the State of Ohio. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the properties, assets or rights of the Company. 

  

 Section 1.5 _Articles of Incorporation and Code of Regulations of the Surviving Corporation_. 

  

 (a) The articles of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect at the Effective Time shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and the provisions of this Agreement and applicable Law;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Article I of the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended in its entirety to read as follows: "The name of the corporation is LESCO, Inc." 

   

 (b) The code of regulations of Merger Sub as in effect at the Effective Time shall be the code of regulations of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and the provisions of this Agreement and applicable Law. 

   

 Section 1.6 _Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal. 

  

 Section 1.7 _Officers_. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal. 

   ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE II 

   

 _CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_  

   

 Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub: 

  

 (a) _Conversion of Common Shares_. Subject to Sections 2.1(b), 2.1(d) and 2.1(e), each common share, without par value, of the Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "Common Shares," and each, a "Common Share"), other than any Cancelled Shares (to the extent provided in Section 2.1(b)) and any Dissenting Shares (to the extent provided for in Section 2.1(e)), shall at the Effective Time be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive $14.50 in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). All Common Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2.1 shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Common Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Common Shares, other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such Common Shares in accordance with Section 2.2. 

   

 (b) _Parent and Merger Sub-Owned Shares_. Each Common Share that is owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time or held by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (in each case, other than any such Common Shares held on behalf of third parties) (the "Cancelled Shares") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in respect thereof. 

   

 (c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each common share, without par value, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable common share, without par value, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing common shares of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of common shares of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. 

   

 (d) _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company shall occur as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, share split (including a reverse share split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any share dividend 

  ##### 

  

    

or share distribution with a record date during such period (but for the
avoidance of doubt not as a result of the exercise of any outstanding Company
Stock Option), the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to
reflect such change; provided that nothing herein shall be construed
to permit the Company to take any action that is prohibited by the terms of
this Agreement. 

   

 (e) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent required by the OGCL, Common Shares which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by any shareholder who shall not have voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement at the Company Meeting and who files with the Company within ten (10) days after such vote at the Company Meeting a written demand to be paid the fair cash value for such Common Shares in accordance with Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(a), unless and until such shareholder fails to demand payment properly or otherwise loses such shareholders rights as a dissenting shareholder, if any, under the OGCL. If any such shareholder fails to perfect or loses any such rights as a dissenting shareholder, that shareholders Common Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into only the right to receive at the Effective Time the Merger Consideration, without interest. From and after the Effective Time, any shareholder who has asserted rights as a dissenting shareholder as provided in Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted under those provisions of the OGCL. The Company shall notify Parent of each shareholder who asserts rights as a dissenting shareholder, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the OGCL and received by the Company relating to purported dissenting shareholders. Parent shall have the right to participate in and to control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to purported dissenting shareholders. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any rights as a dissenting shareholder asserted under Section 1701.85 of the OGCL. 

   

 Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with National City Bank or other paying agent selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company) (the "Paying Agent"), for the benefit of holders of the Common Shares, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares), payable upon due surrender of the certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Common Shares ("Certificates") or non-certificated Common Shares represented by book-entry ("Book-Entry Shares") pursuant to the provisions of this Article II (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) _Payment Procedures_. 

    

 (i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the fifth business day following the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Common Shares whose Common Shares were converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify), and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (ii) Upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be required thereby or by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check in an amount equal to the product of (A) the number of Common Shares represented by such holders properly surrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares multiplied by (B) the Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Common Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate may be paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Common Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable share transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. 

   

 (iii) The Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement to any holder of Common Shares or holder of Company Stock Options or Company Share-Based Awards, such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any provision of U.S. state, local or foreign Law relating to Taxes with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Common Shares or the holder of the Company Stock Options or Company Share-Based Awards, in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the share transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the share transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Common Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for transfer, they shall be cancelled and exchanged pursuant and subject to this Article II. 

   

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof to the extent not previously paid to Parent) that remains undistributed to the former holders of Common Shares for three hundred sixty-five (365) days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any former holder of Common Shares who has not surrendered its Common Shares in accordance with this Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of any claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon due surrender of such Common Shares. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of any claims or interests of any person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of Common Shares, Company Stock Options or Company Share-Based Awards for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest all cash included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent; provided, however, that any investment of such cash shall be limited to direct, short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United States government.

 Except as disclosed (i) in the Company SEC Documents filed on or after December 31, 2005 and prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding the exhibits and schedules thereto, any disclosures set forth in any risk factor section thereof and any forward-looking statements contained therein) or (ii) in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall also be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section of this Article III to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent on its face, the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows: 

  

 Section 3.1 _Qualification, Organization, Subsidiaries, etc_. 

  

 (a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so organized, validly existing, qualified or in good standing, or to have such power or authority, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. As used in this Agreement, "Company Material Adverse Effect" means any fact, circumstance, event, change, effect, development or occurrence that, either individually or in the aggregate (i) materially hinders, impairs or delays the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement and consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, or (ii) is materially adverse to the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, but shall not include facts, circumstances, events, changes, effects, developments or occurrences (A) generally affecting the turf, lawn care or garden products industries in the United States, including as a result of weather or seasonality, or the economy (which fact, circumstance, event, change, effect, development or occurrence in each case does not disproportionately affect the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) or generally affecting the financial or securities markets; or (B) resulting from (I) any acts of terrorism or war (whether or not declared) or any escalation or worsening thereof (other than to the extent any of the foregoing causes any damage or destruction to or renders unusable any facility or property of, or materially impacts employees ability to perform their job duties for, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries); (II) the announcement of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including any loss of customers, suppliers or employees resulting from such announcement; (III) changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") or accounting standards; (IV) changes, in and of itself, in the market price or trading volume of the Common Shares (it being understood that the facts, circumstances, events, changes, effects, developments or occurrences giving rise or contributing to any such changes 

  ##### 

  

    

may be taken into account in determining whether there has been, or would
reasonably be expected to be, a Company Material Adverse Effect); or (V) the
failure, in and of itself, by the Company to meet any expected or projected
financial or operating performance target, whether internal or published for
any period ending on or after the date of this Agreement (it being understood
that the facts, circumstances, events, changes, effects, developments or
occurrences giving rise or contributing to such failure may be taken into
account in determining whether there has been, or would reasonably be expected
to be, a Company Material Adverse Effect). The Company has made available to
Parent prior to the date of this Agreement a true and complete copy of the
Companys Amended Articles of Incorporation and Amended Code of Regulations,
each as amended through  the date of this Agreement (such articles
of incorporation, the "Company Articles" and such code of regulations, the

Regulations, and no Subsidiary of the Company is in violation of any of the
provisions of its organizational or governing documents.

As of their respective dates, or, if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment, the Company SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and none of the Company SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 

   

 (b) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and schedules) of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof, and the consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and to any other adjustments described therein, including the notes thereto) in conformity with GAAP (except, in the case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto).

The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. The Companys disclosure 

   ##### 

  

    

controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and
communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
(the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"). The Companys management has completed assessment
of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2005, and such assessment concluded
that such controls were effective. The Company has disclosed, based on its
most recent evaluation prior to the date of this Agreement, to the Companys
auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors and Parent (A) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation
of internal controls over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect in any material respect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves executive officers or employees who
have a significant role in the Companys internal controls over
financial reporting. As of the date of this Agreement, the Company has not
identified any material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting. There are no outstanding loans made by the

    ##### 

  

     

 (i) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in combination with another event, (i) entitle any current or former employee or officer of the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate to severance pay or any other similar material payment, except as expressly provided in this Agreement, or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting of benefits under any Company Plan, or materially increase the amount of compensation due any such employee or officer, except as expressly provided in this Agreement.

 (c) The execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the provisions of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub will not (i) result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or impair Parents or Merger Subs rights or alter the rights or obligations of any third party under, or give rise to a right of termination, amendment, cancellation or acceleration of, or result in the creation of a Lien on any of the properties or assets of Parent or Merger Sub under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, license, contract, agreement, arrangement or understanding or other instrument or obligation to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party or by which any of them or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound, (ii) conflict with or result in any violation of any provision of the articles of incorporation or code of regulations or other equivalent organizational document, in each case as amended, of Parent or Merger Sub or (iii) conflict with or violate any applicable Laws, other than, in the case of clauses (i) and (iii), any such violation, impairment, right, conflict, default, termination, amendment, cancellation or acceleration that would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 Section 4.3 _Investigations; Litigation_. There is no investigation or review pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened by any Governmental Entity with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries which would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending (or, to Parents knowledge, 

    ##### 

 

  

threatened in writing) against or affecting Parent or its Subsidiaries, or
any of their respective properties at Law or in equity before, and there are
no orders, judgments or decrees of, or before, any Governmental Entity, in
each case, which would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. 

   

 Section 4.4 _Proxy Statement; Other Information_. None of the information provided by Parent or Merger Sub to be included in the Proxy Statement will (a) at the time of filing with the SEC, (b) at the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto, and (c) at the time of the Company Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor Merger Sub makes any representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied by the Company or any of its Representatives that is contained or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement. 

  

 Section 4.5 _Financing_. Parent has cash and cash equivalents and available amounts under existing credit facilities, and Parent and Merger Sub collectively will have at the Effective Time cash and cash equivalents and available amounts under existing credit facilities, that are sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration and the Option and Share-Based Consideration, to satisfy all indebtedness to be repaid by Parent (or the Company) at or following the Closing, to pay all related fees and expenses of Parent and the Company payable by them in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to make any payments that may be required to be made in respect of the Companys indebtedness at or following the Closing as a consequence of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to fund the ongoing operations of the Company. 

  

 Section 4.6 _Capitalization of Merger Sub_. As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 1,500 common shares, without par value, all of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent. Merger Sub has outstanding no option, warrant, right, or any other agreement pursuant to which any person other than Parent may acquire any equity security of Merger Sub. Merger Sub has not conducted any business prior to the date of this Agreement and has, and prior to the Effective Time will have, no assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 Section 4.7 _Finders or Brokers_. Except for Merrill Lynch and Co., neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has employed any investment banker, broker or finder in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement who is entitled to any investment banking, brokerage, finders or similar fee or any commission in connection with or upon consummation of the Merger. 

  

 Section 4.8 _Lack of Ownership of Common Shares_. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, any Common Shares or other securities convertible into, exchangeable into or exercisable for Common Shares. There are no voting trusts or other agreements, arrangements or understandings to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting of the capital stock or other equity interests of 

   ##### 

  

 

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries nor are there any agreements,
arrangements or understandings to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party with respect to the acquisition, divestiture, retention, purchase,
sale or tendering of the capital stock or other equity interest of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has beneficially
owned during the immediately preceding three (3) years a sufficient number of
Common Shares that would make it an "interested shareholder" (as such term is
defined in Section 1704.01(c)(8) of the Ohio Revised Code) of the Company. 

   

 Section 4.9 _No Additional Representations_. Parent acknowledges that neither the Company nor any person has made any representation or warranty, express or implied, arising by operation of Law or otherwise, with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects or as to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the Company furnished or made available to Parent and its Representatives except as expressly set forth in Article III (which includes the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Company SEC Documents). Neither the Company nor any of its affiliates shall be subject to any liability to Parent or any of its affiliates resulting from the Companys making available to Parent or Parents use of such information or any information, documents or material made available to Parent in the due diligence materials provided to Parent, including in the "data room," other management presentations (formal or informal) or in any other form in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company makes no representation or warranty to Parent with respect to any financial projection or forecast relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not included in any management presentation.

Subsidiaries, except that nothing herein shall require the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to disclose any information that would cause a violation of
any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party,
would cause a risk of a loss of privilege to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or would constitute a violation of any applicable Law (provided,
that in each case, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall reasonably
cooperate with Parent to provide access to such information to the fullest
extent practicable without risking loss of privilege or violation of Law,
including, for example, providing for such information to be reviewed by
counsel for Parent on terms reasonably acceptable to counsel for the
Company), nor shall Parent or any of its Representatives be permitted to
perform any onsite environmental study with respect to any property of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Any investigation pursuant to this
Section 5.2(a) shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company or
its Subsidiaries. No information or knowledge obtained by Parent or Merger
Sub in any investigation pursuant to this Section 5.2(a) shall affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the Company in

 Section 5.3 _No Solicitation_. 

  

 (a) The Company agrees that it shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions, negotiations and communications with any persons with respect to any Alternative Acquisition and shall request the return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished. Except as provided in Section 5.3(b), from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Termination Date or the Effective Time, the Company shall not and shall not authorize or permit its Representatives to directly or indirectly (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage, or take any action designed to, or which could be reasonably expected to, facilitate the making of any offer or proposal relating to any possible Alternative Acquisition or (ii) in the event of an unsolicited offer or proposal relating to a possible Alternative Acquisition, engage in discussions, negotiations or communications with, or provide any information or data concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, any person (other than Parent or its Representatives) relating to any possible Alternative Acquisition. The Company shall promptly, and in any event within one (1) business day, notify Parent of (i) any proposals, offers or inquiries received by, any information requested from, or any negotiations or discussions that are sought to be initiated or continued with the Company or its Representatives, in each case, in connection with a possible Alternative Acquisition, which notice shall identify the name of the person making such proposal, offer, inquiry or request or seeking such negotiations or discussions and the material terms and conditions of any offer, inquiry, request or proposal and (ii) any subsequent changes to such terms and conditions. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time after the date hereof and prior to the earlier of the Termination Date or obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, in the event that the Company receives a bona fide written proposal for an Alternative Acquisition on an unsolicited basis and without any violation of this Section 5.3 (an "Acquisition Proposal"), the Company may furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the person submitting such Acquisition Proposal, subject to execution of a confidentiality agreement with such person containing terms no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and may negotiate and participate in discussions and negotiations with such person concerning such Acquisition Proposal if, but only if, the Board of Directors has determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel and receiving advice from William Blair or other nationally recognized investment banking firm that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Company Superior Proposal (a "Potential Superior Proposal"). The Company shall promptly, and in any event within one (1) business day (and not less than two (2) business days prior to providing any such person with any information or entering into any such confidentiality agreement), notify Parent of (i) the receipt of a Company Superior Proposal or Potential Superior Proposal, as the case may be, which notice shall include the name of the person making such Company Superior Proposal or Potential Superior Proposal, as the case may be, and the material terms and conditions of the proposal, and (ii) any subsequent changes to such terms and conditions. The Company shall promptly provide to Parent any non-public information regarding the Company provided to any person making a Company Superior Proposal or Potential Superior Proposal which was not previously provided to Parent, such additional information to be provided no later than the date of provision of such information to such other person. 

   

 (c) Except as set forth herein, from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and the Termination Date, neither the Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the approval or recommendation by the Board of Directors of this Agreement or the Merger, (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Alternative Acquisition or (iii) enter into any agreement with respect to any Alternative Acquisition (other than a confidentiality agreement with respect to a Company Superior Proposal or Potential Superior Proposal entered into in compliance with Section 5.3(b)) (an "Acquisition Agreement"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time after the date hereof and prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Board of Directors may, if the Board of Directors has determined in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors exercise of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law, withdraw or modify its recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger, approve or recommend a Company Superior Proposal, or enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Company Superior Proposal, in each case at any time after the fifth business day following the Companys delivery to Parent of written notice advising Parent that the Company has received a Company Superior Proposal;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Company Superior Proposal unless the Company complies with Section 5.3(d). No withdrawal, modification or change of the recommendation of the Board of Directors, approval or recommendation or proposed approval or recommendation of any Company Superior Proposal or entry by the Company into any Acquisition Agreement shall change the approval of the Board of Directors 

  ##### 

  

  

for purposes of the OGCL or causing any state takeover statute or similar Law
to be inapplicable to the Merger or other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. 

   

 (d) Subject to compliance with this Section 5.3, at any time after the date hereof and prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company may terminate this Agreement and enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Company Superior Proposal if (i) the Company has provided Parent written notice that it intends to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.3(d), identifying the Company Superior Proposal then determined to be more favorable and including a copy of the definitive Acquisition Agreement for such Company Superior Proposal in the form to be entered into, (ii) within a period of five (5) business days following the delivery of the notice referred to in clause (i) above, Parent does not propose adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement which the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of William Blair or other nationally recognized investment banking firm) to be as favorable to the Companys shareholders from a financial point of view as such Company Superior Proposal (the Company having caused its financial and legal advisors to negotiate with Parent in good faith during such five (5) business day period any adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent), and (iii) at least five (5) business days after the Company has provided the notice referred to in clause (i) above, the Company simultaneously delivers to Parent (A) an irrevocable written notice of termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.3(d) and (B) a wire transfer of same day funds in the amount of the Termination Fee. 

   

 (e) Subject to Parents rights under Article VII, nothing contained in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit the Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to the shareholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any other disclosure to the shareholders, if in the good-faith judgment of the Board of Directors, after consultation with outside counsel, the failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with the directors exercise of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law. 

   

 (f) Any violation of this Section 5.3, including by any of the Companys Representatives, whether or not such Representative is so authorized and whether or not such Representative is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company. 

   

 (g) As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings: 

    

 (i) "Alternative Acquisition" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person relating to any (A) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, of a business or assets that constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, (B) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, of 

   ##### 

  

    

20% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company, (C) tender
offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person
beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity securities of the
Company or (D) merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, binding share exchange or similar
transaction involving the Company, other than the transactions contemplated

 Section 5.4 _Filings; Other Actions_. 

  

 (a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, but in no event later than fifteen (15) business days hereafter, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement relating to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond to the comments of the SEC and to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys shareholders as promptly as reasonably practicable; provided, however, that prior to the filing of the Proxy Statement, the Company shall consult with Parent with respect to such filing and shall afford Parent or its Representatives reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company with any information for inclusion in the Proxy Statement which may be required under applicable Law and/or which is reasonably requested by the Company.

If at any time prior to the Company Meeting any event should occur which is required by applicable Law to be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, the Company will promptly inform Parent. In such case, the Company, with the cooperation of Parent, will promptly prepare and file such amendment or supplement with the SEC to the extent required by applicable Law and will mail such amendment or supplement to the Companys shareholders to the extent required by applicable Law; provided, however, that prior to such filing, the Company   ##### 

  

  

  

shall consult with Parent with respect to such amendment or supplement
and shall afford Parent or its Representatives reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon. 

   

 (b) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall (i) take all action necessary in accordance with the OGCL and the Company Articles and Company Regulations to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders as promptly as reasonably practicable following the mailing of the Proxy Statement for the purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval (the "Company Meeting"), and (ii) use all reasonable efforts to solicit from its shareholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement. 

   

 Section 5.5 _Stock Options and Other Share-Based Awards; Employee Matters_.

Each option to purchase Common Shares (each, a "Company Stock Option") granted
under the Company Share Plans or outside the Company Share Plans as an
inducement to hire, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time,
become fully vested and be converted into the right to receive at the
Effective Time without interest an amount in cash in U.S. dollars equal to
the product of (x) the total number of Common Shares subject to such Company
Stock Option and (y) the excess, if any, of the amount of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Common Share subject to such
Company Stock Option, with the aggregate amount of such payment rounded to
the nearest cent (the aggregate amount of such cash amounts hereinafter
referred to as the "Option Consideration") less such amounts as are required
to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of U.S. state or
local Law relating to Taxes with respect to the making of such payment. Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall (A) use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain written consents from holders of the Company Stock Options to the
treatment of such Options as set forth in this Section 5.5(a) (which consent
shall include a release reasonably satisfactory to Parent); provided that,
except as expressly provided in this Section 5.5(a), the Company shall not
pay or commit to pay any consideration in connection with obtaining such
consents without the prior written consent of Parent and (B) use its
reasonable best efforts to terminate and/or amend as necessary, in a manner
reasonably acceptable to Parent, the terms of the Company Share Plans or any
other plans, programs, arrangements or other agreements providing for the
issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of or any equity securities
in the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case as is necessary to
give effect to the provisions of this Section 5.5(a). 

    

 (i) At the Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to receive Common Shares or benefits measured in whole or in part by the value of a number of Common Shares granted under the Company Share Plans or Company Benefit Plans (including restricted share units, phantom units, deferred share units and dividend equivalents), other than Restricted Shares and Company Stock Options (each, other than Restricted Shares and Company Stock Options, a "Company Share-Based Award"), whether 

   ##### 

  

    

vested or unvested, which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to represent a right or award with respect to Common Shares,
shall become fully vested and shall entitle the holder thereof to receive, at
the Effective Time without interest an amount in cash equal to the
Merger Consideration in respect of each Common Share underlying a particular
Company Share-Based Award (the aggregate amount of such cash amounts,
together with the Option Consideration, hereinafter referred to as the
"Option and Share-Based Consideration") less such amounts as are required to
be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of U.S. state or
local Law relating to Taxes with respect to the making of such payment. 

   

 (ii) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each award of restricted Common Shares (the "Restricted Shares") shall vest in full, and each such vested Common Share shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(a), less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of U.S. state or local Law relating to Taxes with respect to the making of such payment. 

   

 (iii) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and/or the Compensation, Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors shall (A) use reasonable best efforts to make such adjustments and amendments to or make such determinations with respect to Company Stock Options, Company Share-Based Awards and Restricted Shares as are necessary to implement the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.5(a) and (B) use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the treatment of Company Stock Options, Company Share-Based Awards and Restricted Shares as provided in this Section 5.5(a) extinguishes all rights of participants under the Company Share Plans and any other plans, programs, arrangements or other agreements providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of, or any equity securities in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and that following the Effective Time, no such participant shall have any right thereunder to acquire equity securities of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries; provided that, except as expressly provided in this Section 5.5(a), the Company shall not pay or commit to pay any consideration in connection therewith without the prior written consent of Parent. 

   

 (iv) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary steps to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) _Employee Matters_. 

    

 (i) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor all Company employee benefit plans and compensation arrangements and agreements, including employment, retention, severance and termination agreements, set forth on Section 3.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, in accordance with their terms and in the forms as previously provided to Parent, and in the case of the Companys severance policy, following its amendment as described on Section 3.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule; _provided_ , _however_ , nothing contained herein shall prevent Parent or the Surviving Corporation from terminating or amending such employee benefit plans and compensation arrangements and agreements in accordance with their respective terms, except that Parent and the Surviving Corporation will not terminate or amend the Companys severance policy, as contemplated to be amended, prior to December 31, 2007. In addition, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will honor such severance policy after such date with respect to such other employees of the Company as Parent and the Company mutually agree upon in writing. Until December 31, 2007, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who remains an employee of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries ("Company Employees") compensation and benefits that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the compensation and benefits provided to Company Employees immediately before the Effective Time. 

   

 (ii) For purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not for benefit accruals) under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective Time (the "New Plans"), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company employee benefit plan in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to a Company employee benefit plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the consummation of the Merger (such plans, collectively, the "Old Plans") and to the extent that similarly situated employees of Parent are not subject to any waiting time, and (B) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his 

   ##### 

  

    

or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived
under the comparable Old Plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which
such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time
and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Company
Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan
year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan. 

   

 (iii) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue (or resume) the employment of any specific person. Except as set forth in this Section 5.5(b), none of the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of the Surviving Corporations Subsidiaries shall have any obligation to continue any Company Benefit Plan as of or subsequent to the Effective Time; and each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan at or subsequent to the Effective Time. In addition, no provision of this Section 5.5(b) shall be construed as amendment to any benefit plan. 

   

 (iv) Without limiting the generality of Section 8.10, no provision of this Section 5.5(b) shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any employee, officer, current or former director or consultant of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or any beneficiary of such employee, officer, director or consultant under a Company Benefit Plan or otherwise. 

  

 Section 5.6 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use (and cause its affiliates to use) its reasonable best efforts (subject to, and in accordance with, applicable Law) to take promptly, or cause to be taken promptly, all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done promptly, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) obtaining all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals, including the Company Approvals, from Governmental Entities and making all necessary registrations and filings and taking all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) obtaining all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iv)   #####

 (b) Each of Parent and the Company shall make their respective filings under the HSR Act within ten (10) business days after the date of this Agreement. Concurrently with such filings or as soon as thereafter as reasonably practicable, Parent and the Company shall request early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act. 

   

 (c) Each party hereto shall promptly consult (which shall include a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any filings) with the other parties hereto with respect to, provide any necessary information with respect to, and provide the other (or its counsel) copies of, all filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity or any other information supplied by such party to a Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party hereto shall promptly inform the other of any material communication from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless otherwise prohibited by Law. If any party hereto or affiliate thereof receives a request for additional information or documentary material from any such Government Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such party shall endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in compliance with such request. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in connection with the receipt of any necessary approvals under the HSR Act or any other comparable Laws of foreign jurisdictions, neither Parent nor the Company shall be required to divest or hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits Parents or the Companys freedom of action with respect to, or their ability to retain, any of the businesses, product lines, properties or assets of the Company or Parent. 

   

 Section 5.7 _Takeover Statute_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other form of antitakeover statute or regulation shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company and Parent and the members of their respective boards of directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 5.8 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent will consult with and provide each other the reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon any press release or other public statement or comment prior to the issuance of such press release or other public statement or comment relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or other public statement or comment prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law or by the rules or regulations of any national securities exchange. Parent and the Company agree to issue a joint press release announcing this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 5.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, jointly and severally, honor all the Companys and its Subsidiaries obligations to indemnify (including any obligations to advance funds for expenses) the current and former directors and officers of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries (an "Indemnified Party") for acts or omissions by such Indemnified Parties occurring prior to the Effective Time to the extent that such obligations of the Company and such Subsidiaries exist on the date of this Agreement, whether pursuant to the Company Articles, the Company Regulations, individual indemnity agreements or otherwise, and such obligations shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with the terms of such Company Articles, Company Regulations and individual indemnity agreements from the Effective Time until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to any claims against such Indemnified Parties arising out of such acts or omissions. 

   

 (b) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may substitute therefor policies of a reputable and financially sound insurance company providing substantially equivalent coverage and amounts; provided further, that if such insurance expires or is terminated or cancelled during such period, then Parent shall use best efforts to obtain substantially similar insurance (including with respect to the financial strength of the insurance company providing such coverage, deductibles and exclusions); _provided_ _further_ , that in no event shall Parent be required to pay an annual premium for insurance under this Section 5.9(b) in excess of 200% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement for such insurance, but in such case shall purchase as much insurance as reasonably practicable for such amount. 

   

 (c) In the event that an Indemnified Party prevails in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 5.9, Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, incurred by the Indemnified Party in such enforcement. 

   

 (d) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the articles of incorporation or code of regulations or other organization documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any other indemnification arrangement, the OGCL or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 5.9 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (e) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.9. 

   

 Section 5.10 _Control of Operations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations. 

  

 Section 5.11 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a) any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or from any person alleging that the consent of such person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partys knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (c) the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would cause or result in any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VI not being satisfied or satisfaction of those conditions being materially delayed in violation of any provision of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.11 shall not (i) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or (ii) limit the remedies available to the party receiving such notice.

for all references to "20%" in the definition of "Alternative Acquisition"),
(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(h) or

Alternative Acquisition, (y) in the case of clause (ii) within two
