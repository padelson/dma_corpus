the extent required by the OGCL, Common Shares which are issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and which are held by any shareholder who shall not have voted in favor of
adoption of this Agreement at the Company Meeting and who files with the Company within ten (10)
days after such vote at the Company Meeting a written demand to be paid the fair cash value for
such Common Shares in accordance with Sections&nbsp;1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL (&#147;<B>Dissenting
Shares</B>&#148;) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
Section&nbsp;2.1(a), unless and until such shareholder fails to demand payment properly or otherwise
loses such shareholder&#146;s rights as a dissenting shareholder, if any, under the OGCL. If any such
shareholder fails to perfect or loses any such rights as a dissenting shareholder, that
shareholder&#146;s Common Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective
Time into only the right to receive at the Effective Time the Merger Consideration, without
interest. From and after the Effective Time, any shareholder who has asserted rights as a
dissenting shareholder as provided in Sections&nbsp;1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL shall be entitled
only to such rights as are granted under those provisions of the OGCL. The Company shall notify
Parent of each shareholder who asserts rights as a dissenting shareholder, attempted withdrawals of
such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the OGCL and received by the Company
relating to purported dissenting shareholders. Parent shall have the right to participate in and
to control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to purported dissenting shareholders.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any rights as a dissenting
shareholder asserted under Section&nbsp;1701.85 of the OGCL.

converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.1, (A)&nbsp;a letter of

and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificates or

a check in an amount equal to the product of (A)&nbsp;the number of Common Shares
represented by such holder&#146;s properly surrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
multiplied by (B)&nbsp;the Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid or accrued on
any amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Common Shares that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender
of the Certificate may be paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly
representing such Common Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable share transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.
