NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, intending to be legally
bound, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

  


 

  

ARTICLE I

  

 _The_ _Merger_

  


 

  

SECTION 1.1. _Transactions_ _to be Effected Prior to the_ _Merger_ _._
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Rollover Stockholders shall
contribute their Rollover Shares to Parent in exchange for equity securities
of Parent or one of its Affiliates in accordance with the terms of the
Rollover Agreements.

  


 

  

SECTION 1.2. _The_ _Merger_ _._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the
Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ "),
and the separate corporate existence of the Company, with all its rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected by
the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects specified in the DGCL and in
this Agreement.

  


 

  

SECTION 1.3. _Closing_ _._ Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between
the Company and Parent, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, 825 Eighth Avenue,
New York, New York, at 9:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the later of (a) the
second Business Day following the day on which the last to be satisfied or
waived of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) shall have been satisfied or waived
in accordance with this Agreement, and (b) (i) the second Business Day after
the final day of the Marketing Period or (ii) such earlier date as may be
specified by Parent on no less than two Business Days' prior notice to the
Company (it being understood and agreed that such notice under this subclause
(b)(ii) may be conditioned upon the simultaneous completion of the Debt
Financing, in which case if such Debt Financing is not completed for any
reason, such notice under this subclause (b)(ii) shall automatically be deemed
withdrawn; _provided_ that any such deemed withdrawal shall not modify
Parent's obligations under subclauses (a) and (b)(i) of this Section 1.3). The
date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to as the " _Closing
Date_ ".

  

  


 

  

 

2  

  

SECTION 1.4. _Effective Time_ _._ At the Closing, the Company and Parent will
cause a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be
executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective at the time when the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, at such later time as may be agreed by the parties in writing
and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

  


 

  

SECTION 1.5. _The_ _Certificate_ _of Incorporation._ The parties hereto shall
take all actions necessary so that the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety in
connection with the completion of the Merger to read as set forth in _Exhibit
A_ hereto (the " _Charter_ "), and as so amended and restated shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law (subject to Section 5.11(f)).

  


 

  

SECTION 1.6. _The_ _Bylaws_ _._ The parties hereto shall take all actions
necessary so that the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and
restated in their entirety in connection with the completion of the Merger to
read as set forth in _Exhibit B_ hereto (the " _Bylaws_ "), and as so amended
and restated shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law (subject to Section 5.11(f)).

  


 

  

SECTION 1.7. _Directors._ The parties hereto shall take, or cause to be taken,
all actions necessary so that the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors
of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the Charter and the Bylaws.

  


 

  

SECTION 1.8. _Officers._ The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of
the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or

in accordance with the Charter and the Bylaws.

ARTICLE II

  

 _Effect of the_ _Merger_ _on Capital Stock_

  


 

  

SECTION 2.1. _Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, as a result of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital
stock of the Company or the sole stockholder of Merger Sub:

  


 

  

(a) _Merger_ _Consideration._ Each share of the common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Company (a " _Share_ " or, collectively, the " _Shares_ ")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i)
Shares owned by Parent (including the Rollover Shares to be acquired by Parent
or one of its Affiliates immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
the Rollover Agreements), Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent and Shares owned by the Company or any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, and in each case not held on
behalf of third parties and (ii) Shares owned by stockholders (" _Dissenting
Stockholders_ ") who have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for, or lost
their right to, appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to
such Shares (the " _Dissenting Shares_ " and, together with the Shares
referred to in the immediately preceding clause (i), the " _Excluded Shares_
")), shall be converted into the right to receive $10.00 per Share in cash
(the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "), without interest. At the Effective
Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any of the Shares and all
of the Shares held in uncertificated book-entry form (the " _Book-Entry
Shares_ ") (in each case, other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration for
each such Share, without interest.

  


 

  

(b) _Cancelation of_ _Excluded Shares_ _._ Each Excluded Share shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of the
Excluded Share, cease to be outstanding, shall be canceled without payment of
any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist, subject to any rights the
holder thereof may have under Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(f).

  


 

  

(c) _Merger Sub_ _._ At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.2. _Exchange of_ _Shares_ _._ (a) _Paying Agent_ _._ At or
immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause
to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by the Company (the " _Paying
Agent_ "), for the benefit of the Record Holders of Shares of Shares entitled
to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration and pursuant to a paying agent
agreement in customary form, cash in immediately available funds in the
aggregate amount necessary for the Paying Agent to make the aggregate payments
contemplated by Section 2.1(a) (such cash amount being hereinafter referred to
as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). If, after the Effective Time, a Dissenting
Stockholder effectively withdraws its demand for, or loses its rights to,
appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any Dissenting
Shares, (i) such Shares shall cease to be Excluded Shares and (ii) upon
written notice from the Company, Parent shall make available or cause to be
made available to the Paying Agent additional funds in an amount equal to the
product of (x) the number of Dissenting Shares for which such Dissenting
Stockholder has withdrawn its demand for, or lost its rights to, appraisal
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and (y) the Per Share Merger
Consideration. The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by
Parent; _provided_ that such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America with maturities not exceeding three
months. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall
become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the aggregate
amount payable pursuant to Section 2.1(a) shall be returned to the Surviving
Corporation in accordance with Section 2.2(d). To the extent that there are
any losses with respect to any such investments, or the Exchange Fund
diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Paying Agent to
make prompt cash payment pursuant to Section 2.1(a), Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in
the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times until
its termination pursuant to section 2.2(d) maintained at a level sufficient
for the Paying Agent to make all such cash payments under Section 2.1(a). The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments
due pursuant to Section 2.1(a).

  

  


 

  

 

4  

  

(b) _Exchange Procedures._ Promptly (and in any event within three Business
Days) after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall instruct the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares immediately prior to
the Effective Time (each, a " _Record Holder of Shares_ ") (other than
Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal specifying that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or the Book-Entry
Shares shall pass, in the case of Shares represented by Certificates, only
upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 2.2(e)) to the Paying Agent, and, in the case of Book-
Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in such letter of
transmittal, such letter of transmittal to be in customary form and to have
such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of any Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.2(e)) (the "
_Instructions_ ") in exchange for the amount to which such Record Holder of
Shares is entitled as a result of the Merger pursuant to Section 2.1(a). If
any Excluded Shares cease to be Excluded Shares pursuant to Section 2.2(a),
the Surviving Corporation shall instruct the Paying Agent, promptly (and in
any event within three Business Days) after the date on which such Excluded
Shares cease to be Excluded Shares, to mail to the applicable Record Holder of
Shares the letter of transmittal and the Instructions, with respect to such
Shares. Upon delivery of the letter of transmittal duly executed by the
applicable Record Holder of Shares and the surrender of a Certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Shares (or affidavit
of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section 2.2(e)) to the
Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal and
the Instructions, in the case of Shares represented by Certificates, the
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount
by check or wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by such holder (less any required Tax withholdings as provided in
Section 2.2(g)) equal to the product of (x) the number of Shares that such
Certificate represented immediately prior to the Effective Time (or affidavit
of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.2(e)) or the number of Book-
Entry Shares held by such Record Holder of Shares immediately prior to the
Effective Time, as applicable, and (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and
any Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will
be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates or affidavits of loss, as the case may be, and no interest will
be paid or accrued on any amount payable to a Record Holder of Book-Entry
Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check or wire transfer
for any cash to be delivered upon due surrender of a Certificate, in the case
of Shares represented by a Certificate, may be issued or made to such
transferee if, in the case of Shares represented by a Certificate, the
Certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such
Shares is presented to the Paying Agent together with the applicable letter of
transmittal, accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent to evidence and effect such transfer and to
evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not
applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, any Record Holder of Shares of Book-
Entry Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time shall not be required to
surrender Certificates to the Paying Agent.

  

  


 

  

 

5  

  

(c) _Transfers._ From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the
Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be canceled and, subject to compliance
with the procedures set forth in Section 2.2(b), exchanged for the amount in
cash in immediately available funds to which the holder of the Certificate is
entitled pursuant to this Article II (less any required Tax withholdings as
provided in Section 2.2(g)), to be paid by check or wire transfer to an
account designated by such holder.

  


 

  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains
unclaimed by the Record Holder of Shares of Shares for 270 days after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any Record
Holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied
with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
for payment of the amount to which such Record Holder of Shares is entitled as
a result of the Merger pursuant to Section 2.1(a) (less any required Tax
withholdings as provided in Section 2.2(g)) upon due surrender of its
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
2.2(e)), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the
Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former Record Holder
of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by the Record Holder of Shares of Shares at such date as is
immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to
or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of any claims or interests of any such holders or their successors,
assignees or personal representatives previously entitled thereto.

  

  


 

  

 

6  

  

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates._ In the event that any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact, in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the
Paying Agent, by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount and upon such customary terms as may be reasonably required
by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will,
subject to such Person's compliance with the terms set forth in Section
2.2(b), issue a check in the amount (less any required Tax withholdings as
provided in Section 2.2(g)) equal to the product of (i) the number of Shares
that such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate represented immediately prior
to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

  


 

  

(f) _Dissenting Shares_ _._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, no Person who has prior to the Effective Time perfected a demand for
appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to such Dissenting
Shares unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn (in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL) its demand for, or lost its right to,
appraisal under the DGCL with respect to such Dissenting Shares. Unless and
until a Dissenting Stockholder shall have effectively so withdrawn its demand
for, or lost its right to, appraisal under the DGCL with respect to such
Dissenting Shares, each Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive
only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such
Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any written
demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to applicable Laws that are received by the
Company relating to stockholders' rights of appraisal and Parent shall have
the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect thereto. The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands
for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands, or agree or
commit to do any of the foregoing.

  


 

  

(g) _Withholding Rights._ Each of the Company, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld
amounts (i) shall be remitted by the Company, the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental
Entity and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as
the case may be.

SECTION 2.3. _Treatment of Equity Awards._ (a) _Stock Options_. At the
Effective Time, each stock option to purchase Shares (each, a " _Stock Option_
") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether then vested or
unvested, (i) shall be canceled without payment if such Stock Option has an
exercise price greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration and (ii) if the
exercise price is not greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration, shall
only entitle the holder thereof to receive from the Company, in full
settlement of such Stock Option, an amount in cash equal to the product of (x)
the total number of Shares subject to the Stock Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (y) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per Share under such Stock Option (less
any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.2(g)).

  


 

  

(b) _Stock Appreciation Rights_ _._ At the Effective Time, each stock
appreciation right in respect of Shares (each, a " _Stock Appreciation Right_
") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether then vested or
unvested, (i) shall be canceled without payment if such Stock Appreciation
Right has a reference price per Share greater than the Per Share Merger
Consideration and (ii) if the reference price is not greater than the Per
Share Merger Consideration, shall only entitle the holder thereof to receive
from the Company, in full settlement of such Stock Appreciation Right, an
amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total number of Shares subject
to such Stock Appreciation Right immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(y) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the
reference price per Share under such Stock Appreciation Right (less any
required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.2(g)).

  


 

  

(c) _RSUs_ _._ At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit or deferred
stock unit in respect of Shares (each, an " _RSU_ ") outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, whether then vested or unvested, shall be
canceled and shall only entitle the holder thereof to receive from the
Company, in full settlement of such RSU, an amount in cash equal to the
product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to such RSU immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration (less
any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.2(g)).

  


 

  

(d) _Cancelation and Vesting of Equity Awards_. At the Effective Time, all
Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and RSUs, whether or not vested or
exercisable, shall vest in full at the Effective Time and shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder thereof
shall cease to have any rights thereunder to acquire any securities of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, or to receive any payment or
benefit with respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration
specified in Sections 2.3(a), 2.3(b) and 2.3(c).

  


 

  

(e) _Corporate Actions._ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board
of Directors of the Company (acting upon the recommendation of the Special
Committee) and the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company, as applicable, shall adopt resolutions (which resolutions shall
promptly be provided to Parent) and will provide any required notices and take
such other actions as shall be necessary or appropriate to implement the
provisions of Sections 2.3(a), 2.3(b), 2.3(c) and 2.3(d) such that neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to deliver any Shares
or other Equity Interests of the Company to any Person pursuant to, or in
settlement of, any Stock Option, Stock Appreciation Right or RSU.

  

  


 

  

 

8  

  

SECTION 2.4. _Payments with Respect to Equity-Based Awards._ Promptly after
the Effective Time (but in any event, no later than the first payroll date
after the fifth Business Day after the Effective Time), the Surviving
Corporation shall pay through its payroll systems the amounts due pursuant to
Section 2.3; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of any such amounts
that constitute non-qualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the
Code, the Surviving Corporation shall pay such amounts at the earliest time
permitted under the terms of the applicable agreement, plan or arrangement
that will not trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.5. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution._ In the event that the Company
changes the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a
result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or
exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change and as so
adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Per Share Merger
Consideration.

Except as set forth in (a) reports filed with or furnished by the Company to

the heading "Risk Factors" and any disclosures that are predictive, cautionary
or forward-looking in nature) between January 1, 2013 and the date of this
Agreement (and then (i) only to the extent the relevance of any disclosed
event, item or occurrence in such report to a matter covered by a
representation or warranty set forth in this Article III is reasonably
apparent as to the matters and items which are the subject of such
representation or warranty, (ii) other than any matters required to be
disclosed for purposes of Sections 3.1 and 3.2, which matters shall only be
disclosed by specific disclosure in the corresponding section or subsection of
the Disclosure Letter delivered to Parent by the Company prior to or
simultaneously with entering into this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure
Letter_ "), and (iii) without giving effect to any amendment to such documents
filed on or after the date hereof) or (b) the corresponding sections or
subsections of the Company Disclosure Letter (it being agreed that disclosure
of any item in any section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter
shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection
only to the extent the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent on the
face of such disclosure), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent
and Merger Sub that:

  


 

  

SECTION 3.1. _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification._ _ _Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly

the concept of good standing) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties, assets and rights and to carry on its

where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets, properties, rights or
the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the
failure to be so organized, validly existing, qualified, in good standing or

reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has
made available to Parent complete and correct copies of the Company's
certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the certificates of incorporation
and bylaws or comparable organizational and governing documents of each of the
Company's Subsidiaries, each as amended to the date of this Agreement, and

securities of each of the Company's Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable and owned by the Company or by a direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of any
lien, charge, pledge, security interest, claim, option, right of first
refusal, voting restriction, or other encumbrance (each, a " _Lien_ "), except
for Liens of general applicability as may be provided under the Securities Act
or other applicable securities Laws (including any restriction on the right to

securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for,
or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any Equity Interests
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no securities or obligations
evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding. Since the
Capitalization Date through the date of this Agreement, no Shares or other
Equity Interests of the Company have been issued and no Stock Options, Stock
Appreciation Rights, RSUs or other Equity Interests have been granted by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

  


 

  

 

10  

  

(b) The Company does not have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or
other obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or convertible
into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the
stockholders of the Company on any matter.

  


 

  

(c) Section 3.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of each of the Company's Subsidiaries, together with the
jurisdiction of formation of such Subsidiary. Except for the wholly owned
Subsidiaries of the Company listed in Section 3.2(c) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Company does not own or control, directly or indirectly, any
Equity Interest in any Person, or have any obligation or commitment to acquire
any such Equity Interest.

  


 

  

(d) Except as set forth in Section 5.13 and the Cooperation Agreement, there
are no stockholder agreements, voting trusts or other agreements or
understandings to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or
by which it is bound relating to the voting or registration of any equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  


 

  

(e) Section 3.2(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, by director,
officer and employee, as of the Capitalization Date, the number of outstanding

Shares issuable with respect to each such award and the Stock Plan.

  


 

  

SECTION 3.3. _Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness._

  


 

  

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
and has taken all corporate action necessary to execute, deliver and perform
its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger
Transactions, subject only to the requisite vote of the stockholders of the
Company under the DGCL (the " _Company Requisite Vote_ ") and the filing of
the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
in accordance with the DGCL. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery hereof by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general applicability relating
to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles (the "
_Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_ ").

  

  


 

  

 

11  

  

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, the Special Committee and the Board of
Directors of the Company (acting upon the affirmative recommendation of the
Special Committee) have (A) determined that this Agreement and the Merger
Transactions are advisable and in the best interests of the Company's
stockholders (other than Parent, the Rollover Stockholders and their
respective affiliates), (B) approved the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the Merger
Transactions, (C) directed that the adoption of this Agreement be submitted to
a vote at the Stockholders' Meeting and (D) subject to Section 5.2, resolved
to recommend that the Company's stockholders entitled to vote thereon adopt
this Agreement at the Stockholders' Meeting (such recommendation, the "
_Company Recommendation_ "). The Special Committee has received the opinion of
its financial advisor, Greenhill and Co., Inc., dated the date hereof, to the
effect that, based upon and subject to the assumptions, qualifications and
limitations set forth in such opinion, the Per Share Merger Consideration is
fair, from a financial point of view, as of the date of such opinion, to the
holders of Shares (other than Parent, the Rollover Stockholders and their
respective affiliates). It is agreed and understood that such opinion is for
the benefit of the Board of Directors of the Company and the Special Committee
and may not be relied on by Parent or Merger Sub.

  


 

  

SECTION 3.4. _Governmental Filings; No Violations; Certain Contracts._

  


 

  

(a) Except for (A) compliance with, and filings under, the HSR Act; (B)
compliance with, and filings under, the Exchange Act and the Securities Act,
including the filing with the SEC of a proxy statement relating to the
Stockholders' Meeting to be held in connection with this Agreement and the
Merger Transactions (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the
" _Proxy Statement_ "); (C) compliance with, and filings under, the applicable
requirements of Antitrust Law, competition Law or other similar Laws, rules,

Letter (the items set forth above in clauses (A) through (F), the " _Company
Required Governmental Approvals_ "), no notices, reports or other filings are
required to be made by the Company with, nor are any consents, registrations,
approvals, permits or authorizations required to be obtained by the Company
from any Governmental Entity in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the
Merger Transactions, except those that the failure to make or obtain, as the
case may be, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to (i) have a Company Material Adverse Effect or (ii) prevent,
materially delay or materially impede the ability of the Company to consummate
the Merger Transactions.

  


 

  

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
does not, and the consummation of the Merger will not, constitute or result in
(A) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or (B) with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, a breach or violation of, a termination (or right of
termination) or default under, the creation, cancellation, acceleration, loss,
impairment or alteration or other change of any rights, benefits or
obligations under, result in the payment of any fee under, or the creation of
a Lien on any of the assets, properties or rights of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to, any Company Material Contract, or assuming (solely
with respect to performance of this Agreement and consummation of the Merger
Transactions) compliance with the matters referred to in Section 3.4(a), under
any Law or Permit to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject,
except, in the case of clause (B), for any such breach, violation,
termination, default, creation, cancellation, acceleration, loss, impairment,
alteration, change, fee or Lien that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to (i) have a Company Material Adverse
Effect or (ii) prevent, materially delay or materially impede the ability of
the Company to consummate the Merger Transactions.

  

  


 

  

 

12  

  

SECTION 3.5. _Company SEC Reports; Financial Statements._

  


 

  

(a) Since January 1, 2013 (the " _Applicable Date_ "), the Company has filed
or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis (taking into account all
applicable grace periods) all forms, certifications, reports, statements and
documents required to be filed with or furnished by it to the SEC pursuant to
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act (such forms, certifications, reports,
statements and documents filed or furnished since the Applicable Date and
those filed or furnished subsequent to the date of this Agreement, including
any exhibits, supplements and amendments thereto, the " _Company SEC Reports_
"). Each of the Company SEC Reports (including any financial statements or
other schedules included therein), at the time of its filing or being
furnished, complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of their respective filing dates (or, if amended prior
to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of such amendment), the Company
SEC Reports did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments received from the SEC with respect to any
of the Company SEC Reports.

  


 

  

(b) The Company has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act)
as required by Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that are
reasonably designed to ensure that material information required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
period specified in the SEC's rules and forms and is accumulated and
communicated to the Company's management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding disclosure. The Company has implemented and maintains a
system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable
assurance (i) that transactions are recorded as reasonably necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP in all material
respects and (ii) regarding prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that would materially

SECTION 3.8. _Employee Benefits._

  


 

  

(a) Section 3.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth each material
Company Plan (including for the avoidance of doubt each Company Plan that is
subject to ERISA or similar laws of any non-U.S. jurisdiction and each
Employment Agreement).

  


 

  

(b) With respect to each Company Plan and Employment Agreement required to be
set forth on Section 3.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company has
heretofore made available to Parent true and complete copies of (A) each of
such Company Plans and Employment Agreements as currently in effect with all

other financial statements prepared for such Company Plan; and (F) all filings
made by the Company within the past two (2) years under the Voluntary
Compliance Resolution or Closing Agreement Program or the Department of Labor
Delinquent Filer Program. Except as set forth in Section 3.8(b) of the Company

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their ERISA
Affiliates maintains, contributes to, or has any liabilities under, or has at

(d) Each Company Plan is and has been, in all material respects, established,
administered, funded and maintained (in form and operation) in compliance with
its terms and all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code. Each Company
Plan that is intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a)
of the Code is so qualified and has received a favorable determination letter
from the IRS or is entitled to rely upon a favorable opinion issued by the IRS
and each Company Plan which is required to be registered under applicable
non-U.S. Law has been registered and has been maintained in good standing with
applicable Governmental Entities. To the Knowledge of the Company, nothing has
occurred, whether by action or by failure to act, that could reasonably be
expected to cause the loss of such qualification or good standing. All
material payments required by each Company Plan, any collective bargaining
agreement or other agreement, or by Law (including all contributions,
insurance premiums or intercompany charges) have been timely made or, to the
extent not yet due, have been properly reflected on the most recent
consolidated balance sheet of the Company included in the Company SEC Reports,
in accordance with GAAP. No material claim, suit, investigation, hearing,
action, lien, arbitration, dispute or other proceeding has been asserted,
instituted or, to the Knowledge of the Company, is threatened with respect to
any of the Company Plans (other than routine claims for benefits and appeals
of such claims), and no Company Plan is under, and neither the Company nor its
Subsidiaries has received any written notice of, an audit or investigation by
the IRS, U.S. Department of Labor or any other Governmental Entity.

Affiliate made, or was required to make, contributions during the past six
years: (i) there does not now exist, nor to the Knowledge of the Company do
any circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected to result in, any
violation of the minimum funding standards under Section 412 of the Code or
Section 302 of ERISA, whether or not waived, or any liability under Section
4971 of the Code; (ii) no reportable event within the meaning of Section
4043(c) of ERISA for which the 30-day notice requirement has not been waived
has occurred, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, the consummation of the
Merger is not reasonably likely to result in the occurrence of any such
reportable event; (iii) all premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation have been timely paid in full; (iv) no material liability or
contingent liability (including liability pursuant to Section 4069 of ERISA
and under Title IV of ERISA) has been or is reasonably expected to be incurred
by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate; (v) the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has not instituted proceedings to
terminate any such plan and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no condition
exists that presents a risk that such proceedings will be instituted or which
would constitute grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of,
or the appointment of a trustee to administer, such plan; and (vi) no tax or
penalty resulting from a prohibited transaction as defined in Section 406 of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code has been incurred.

other than pursuant to Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or Section 4980B of the
Code, and/or any similar state or local Law or any foreign Law.

  

  


 

  

 

17

States or subject to the Laws of a jurisdiction outside of the United States
has been maintained and operated in all material respects in accordance with
all applicable plan documents and all applicable local Laws.

  


 

  

(h) Except as set forth on Section 3.8(h) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the Merger could, either alone or in combination with another event, (A)
result in any payment or benefit becoming due or payable, or required to be
provided, to any current or former employee, director or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or result in severance pay or any increase
in severance pay (other than severance pay required by any Law) to any current
or former employee, director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (B) accelerate the time of payment, vesting or funding, result
in any forgiveness of indebtedness or trigger any payment or funding (through
a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits, or materially
increase the amount or value of any benefit or compensation otherwise payable
or required to be provided to any such employee, director or officer or (C)
obligate the Company or any Subsidiary to make the payment of any amount or
provide any benefit that could, individually or in combination with any other

280G(b)(1) of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any indemnity obligation for any Taxes imposed under Section 4999 or 409A of
the Code. To the Knowledge of the Company, no amounts previously deducted

not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to be material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

  


 

  

(i) Each Company Plan that is subject to the requirements of Section 409A of
the Code has been administered, operated and maintained in compliance with
Section 409A of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, except as

taken as a whole.

to the date of this Agreement and, as of the date hereof, the Financing
Commitments are in full force and effect and are legal, valid, binding and
enforceable obligations of Parent, Merger Sub or the Affiliates of Parent and
Merger Sub, in each case to the extent party thereto, as applicable, and, to
the Knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, each of the other parties thereto,
subject, in each case, to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. There are no
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full
amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in or expressly
contemplated by the Financing Commitments. As of the date hereof, no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would
reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Affiliates of Parent or Merger Sub party thereto or,
to the Knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, any other party thereto under any
of the Financing Commitments. As of the date hereof, Parent has no reason to
believe that any of the conditions to the Financing contemplated by the
Financing Commitments will not be satisfied or the Financing will not be
available at the Closing, provided that Parent is not making any
representation regarding the effect of any inaccuracy of any representation
and warranty of the Company set forth in Article III or the failure of the
Company to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement. Assuming each
of the Financing Commitments are funded in accordance with their terms (after
giving effect to the flex provisions), Parent and Merger Sub will have at and
after the Closing funds sufficient to (i) pay the aggregate Per Share Merger
Consideration, (ii) pay any and all fees and expenses required to be paid by
Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation in connection with the Merger
and the Financing, (iii) pay for any refinancing of any outstanding
Indebtedness of the Company contemplated by this Agreement or the Financing
Commitments and (iv) satisfy all of the other payment obligations of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation contemplated hereunder.

  

  

(b) Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any of their Affiliates has (i) retained
any financial advisor on a basis exclusive to Parent and/or Merger Sub and/or
any such Affiliate, or (ii) entered into an exclusivity, lock-up or other
similar agreement, arrangement or understanding with any bank or investment
bank or other potential provider of debt or equity financing that would
prevent or hinder such provider from providing or seeking to provide such
financing to any third party in connection with a transaction relating to the
Company or its Subsidiaries, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), in
connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any of their Affiliates has
caused or induced any Person to take any action that, if taken by Parent
and/or Merger Sub, would be a breach of, or would cause to be untrue, any of
the representations in this Section 4.5(b).

SECTION 4.6. _Rollover Agreements_ _._ Parent has delivered to the Company a
true, complete and correct copy of the Rollover Agreement with the Initial
Rollover Stockholder. Such Rollover Agreement is in full force and effect and
is legal, valid, binding and enforceable, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception, obligations of Parent, Merger Sub or the Affiliates of Parent and
Merger Sub, in each case to the extent party thereto, as applicable, and, to
the Knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, the Initial Rollover Stockholder. As
of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default
or breach on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Affiliates of Parent or
Merger Sub party thereto or, to the Knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, the
Initial Rollover Stockholder under such Rollover Agreement. As of the date
hereof, Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
contribution and exchange of shares contemplated by such Rollover Agreement
will not be satisfied. There are no conditions precedent or other
contingencies related to the contribution by the Rollover Stockholders of
their Rollover Shares to Parent in exchange for common stock of Parent, other
than as expressly set forth in or expressly contemplated by the Rollover
Agreements.

  


 

  

SECTION 4.7. _Guarantee._ Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
each of American Securities Partners VI, L.P., American Securities Partners
VI(B), L.P., American Securities Partners VI(C), L.P., American Securities
Partners VI(D), L.P. and P2 Capital Master Fund I, L.P. (each, a " _Guarantor_
" and, together, the " _Guarantors_ ") has delivered to the Company the Equity
Financing Commitment, which contains a limited guarantee in favor of the
Company with respect to certain obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under
this Agreement (the " _Guarantee_ "), duly executed by the Guarantors in favor
of the Company. The Guarantee is in full force and effect and constitutes a
valid and binding obligation of each Guarantor, enforceable against each
Guarantor in accordance with its terms and no event has occurred, which, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on the
part of either Guarantor under the Equity Financing Commitment, including in
respect of the Guarantee.

  


 

  

SECTION 4.8. _Capitalization._ The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub
consists solely of 100 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, all
of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by
Parent free and clear of all Liens. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has
conducted any business prior to the date of this Agreement and neither Parent
nor Merger Sub has any, and prior to the Effective Time will not have any,
assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those as may be
incident to their formation and pursuant to this Agreement, the Merger and the
other Transactions. Merger Sub does not have outstanding any option, warrant,
right or any other agreement pursuant to which any Person other than Parent
may acquire any equity security of Merger Sub.

  

  


 

  

 

34  

  

SECTION 4.9. _Brokers._ No agent, broker, finder or investment banker is
entitled to any brokerage, finder's or other fee or commission in connection
with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent
or Merger Sub for which the Company could have any liability in a circumstance
where the Merger is not consummated.

  


 

  

SECTION 4.10. _Ownership of_ _Shares_ _._ None of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Initial Rollover Stockholder or any of their respective "affiliates" or
"associates" is an "interested stockholder" of the Company subject to the
restrictions on "business combinations" (in each case, as such quoted terms
are defined under Section 203 of the DGCL) set forth in Section 203(a) of the
DGCL.

  


 

  

SECTION 4.11. _Absence of Certain Agreements._ Except for the Rollover
Agreements (whether entered into prior to, on or after the date of this
Agreement), neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates has entered into any
agreement, arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether oral or
written), or authorized, committed or agreed to enter into any agreement,

Agreement), (y) contribute or rollover any portion of such employee's or
director's Shares, Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights or RSUs to the
Company or its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of their respective Affiliates or
(z) receive any capital stock or equity securities of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of their respective Affiliates.

  


 

  

SECTION 4.12. _Solvency._ Assuming (a) the satisfaction of the conditions to
Parent's obligation to consummate the Merger, (b) the representations and
warranties of the Company in Article III are true and correct in all material
respects and (c) after giving effect to the Transactions, including the
payment of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration, any other repayment
or refinancing of debt contemplated in this Agreement or the Financing
Commitments, payment of all amounts required to be paid in connection with the
consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions, and payment of all
related fees and expenses of the Parent and the Surviving Corporation relating
to the Transactions, each of Parent and the Company and the Company

materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the Merger or the
other Transactions.

  

  


 

  

 

40  

  

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to give Parent or Merger
Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Company's or

 _provided_ that any (x) non-public information or data relating to the
Company and its Subsidiaries provided to any such Person will be furnished
only pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (y) competitively
sensitive information or data provided to any such Person who is a direct
competitor, supplier or customer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
will be provided in a separate "clean data room" and subject to customary
"clean team" arrangements regarding access to such information or data, as
reasonably determined by the Company with advice of legal counsel; _provided_
_further_ that the Company shall promptly make available to Parent any non-

(A) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any
inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes an
Acquisition Proposal;

  


 

  

(B) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or provide any non-public information or data to any

Person of the existence of this Section 5.2;

  


 

  

(C) enter into any agreement or agreement in principle with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; or

  


 

  

(D) otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt by any Person to make

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company may
continue to take any of the actions described in this Section 5.2(b) above

Party until the earlier of (I) the date on which the Company Requisite Vote is
obtained and (II) the date on which the Company certifies to Parent that it is

from and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall, and shall cause its and its Subsidiaries' officers and directors to,
and shall instruct and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its

their consideration of any Acquisition Proposal be promptly returned or
destroyed by such Persons. The Company agrees that any breach of this Section
5.2 by any of its Representatives (other than immaterial or inadvertent
breaches not intended to result in an Acquisition Proposal) shall be deemed to
be a breach of this Agreement by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the parties hereto hereby
acknowledges and agrees that any provision included in a confidentiality
agreement between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and a Person (other
than Parent, Merger Sub, the Rollover Stockholders and their respective
Affiliates and Representatives) in effect on the date hereof that restricts
the ability of such Person to make any Acquisition Proposal to the Company
shall be deemed waived by the Company or such Subsidiary party thereto
effective upon execution of this Agreement.

  

  


 

  

 

42

advisable (publicly or otherwise) such an Acquisition Proposal, if and only to
the extent that, (x) in each such case referred to in clause (B) or (C) above
occurring after the No-Shop Period Start Date and except as may relate to an
Excluded Party thereafter, the Board of Directors of the Company (acting upon
the affirmative recommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special
Committee has determined in good faith after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel that such Acquisition Proposal either
constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Proposal, and (y) in the case referred to in clause (D) above, the
Board of Directors of the Company has complied with all of its obligations
under Section 5.2(d).

  


 

  

(d) _No_ _Change of Recommendation_ _or Alternative Acquisition Agreement._
Except as set forth in Section 5.2(e) and this Section 5.2(d), neither the
Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A)
withhold or withdraw (or qualify, change, amend or modify in a manner adverse
to Parent or Merger Sub), or publicly propose to withhold or withdraw (or
qualify, change, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub),
the Company Recommendation, or fail to include the Company Recommendation in
the Proxy Statement, (B) approve or adopt, or recommend the approval or
adoption of, or publicly propose to recommend, approve or adopt, any
Acquisition Proposal or (C) from and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, fail
to make or reaffirm the Company Recommendation within ten Business Days of
Parent's written request to do so following receipt of an Acquisition Proposal
(any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Change of
Recommendation_ ", it being understood that a customary "stop, look and
listen" communication by the Board of Directors of the Company (acting upon
the affirmative recommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special
Committee pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act shall
not constitute a Change of Recommendation) or (ii) authorize, cause or permit
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives to execute or enter
into any letter of intent (binding or non-binding) or similar agreement or
arrangement or enter into any agreement or agreement in principle with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal, other than any Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement (each, an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, if (x) an Intervening Event has occurred
or (y) the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal not solicited in violation
of this Section 5.2 that the Board of Directors of the Company (acting upon
the affirmative recommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special
Committee has determined in good faith after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel constitutes a Superior Proposal, then the
Board of Directors of the Company (acting upon the affirmative recommendation
of the Special Committee) and the Special Committee may (1) in the case of
either clause (x) or clause (y), make a Change of Recommendation if the Board
of Directors of the Company (acting upon the affirmative recommendation of the
Special Committee) or the Special Committee has determined in good faith after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (2) in the case of clause (y),
cause the Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal and terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.3(a); _provided_ that the Board of Directors of the Company shall
not make any Change of Recommendation under either clause (x) or (y) or cause
the Company to terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement
with respect to a Superior Proposal unless:

  

  


 

  

 

43  

  

(i) The Company shall have complied in all respects with its obligations under
this Section 5.2(d);

  


 

  

(ii) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
four (4) Business Days in advance of making such Change of Recommendation or
such termination (such period, the " _Negotiation Period_ "), advising Parent
of the intention to effect a Change of Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement, which notice shall specify in detail the basis for the Change of
Recommendation or termination and, in the case of a Superior Proposal, the
identity of the party making such Superior Proposal and the financial and
other material terms and conditions thereof and include copies of the final
forms of all relevant documents relating to such Superior Proposal; _provided_
, that in the event there is any material amendment to the terms of any such
Superior Proposal (including any revision in the amount, form or mix of
consideration proposed to be payable to the Company's stockholders pursuant to
such Superior Proposal), the Company shall have provided to Parent a notice of
such material amendment and there shall be a new two (2) Business Days period
following such notice during which the Company shall negotiate with Parent or
otherwise comply again with the requirements of this Section 5.2(d) and the
Company shall not make any Change of Recommendation prior to the end of any
such Negotiation Period as so extended;

  


 

  

(iii) during the Negotiation Period, the Company shall have, and shall have
caused its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith, for so
long as Parent continues to negotiate in good faith, with respect to changes
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby (or as to other proposals made by Parent);

  

  


 

  

 

44  

  

(iv) after so negotiating with Parent and Merger Sub during the Negotiation
Period, the Board of Directors of the Company (acting upon the affirmative
recommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special Committee shall have
considered in good faith any and all changes to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby offered by Parent (or other proposals made by
Parent), and shall have concluded, after consultation with its independent
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, (A) in the event the
determination by the Board of Directors of the Company or the Special
Committee pursuant to this Section 5.2(d) is in response to a Superior
Proposal, that such Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior
Proposal even if such changes or other proposals were to be given effect,
_provided_ that, if any material amendment or revision is made to the
Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company (acting upon
the affirmative recommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special
Committee has determined to be a Superior Proposal, the Company shall be
required to deliver a new written notice to Parent with respect to each such
successive amendment or revision and to comply with the requirements of this
Section 5.2 with respect to such new written notice and the Negotiation Period
shall recommence, or (B) in the event the determination by the Board of
Directors of the Company or the Special Committee pursuant to this Section
5.2(d) is in response to an Intervening Event, that such changes would not
obviate the need for a Change of Recommendation in response to such
Intervening Event; and

  


 

  

(v) in the event of a termination of this Agreement to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, the
Company shall have validly terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.3(a) (including paying the Termination Fee in accordance with Section 7.5(a)
prior to or concurrently with such termination).

  


 

  

(e) _Certain Permitted Disclosure._ Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Board of Directors of the Company (acting upon the affirmative
recommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special Committee from (i)
complying with its disclosure obligations under United States federal or state
Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to
its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, 14e-2(a) or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to stockholders), (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen"
communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the
stockholders of the Company) or (iii) making any disclosure to the Company's
stockholders that is required by Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Board
of Directors of the Company or the Special Committee shall not make a Change
of Recommendation except in accordance with Section 5.2(d).

  

  


 

  

 

45  

  

(f) _Notice._ The Company agrees that, from and after the No Shop Period Start
Date, it will promptly notify Parent orally (and in writing within 24 hours)

Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives. Such notice shall

all amendments to any terms or conditions thereof. The Company agrees that
neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries will enter into any confidentiality
agreement with any Person subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the
Company from providing such information to Parent.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.3. _Proxy Filings; Information Supplied._ The Company shall, as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, provided

preliminary form the Proxy Statement with the SEC (it being understood that
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to file the Proxy Statement
in preliminary form with the SEC within 15 Business Days after the date of
this Agreement). Subject to Section 5.2(d), the Board of Directors of the
Company (acting upon the affirmative recommendation of the Special Committee)
shall make the Company Recommendation to the Company's stockholders and shall
include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Subject to applicable Law,
prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement or filing any other required

holders of Shares (the " _Stockholders ' Meeting_") for the purpose of
obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, as soon as reasonably practicable after

after consultation with its outside legal counsel) is provided to the
stockholders of the Company a reasonable amount of time in advance of the
Stockholders' Meeting to permit such stockholders to review such supplement or
amendment prior to the Stockholders' Meeting; (c) if as of the time at which
the Stockholders' Meeting is to be held, (x) there is an absence of a quorum
(either in person or by proxy) necessary to conduct the business of the

permit any access, or to disclose (i) any information that, in the reasonable,
good faith judgment (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house
counsel) of the Company, is reasonably likely to result in any violation of
any Law or any Contract to which the Company or its Subsidiaries is a party or
cause any privilege (including attorney-client privilege) that the Company or
its Subsidiaries would be entitled to assert to be undermined with respect to
such information and such undermining of such privilege could in the Company's
good faith judgment (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house
counsel) adversely affect in any material respect the Company's position in
any pending or, what the Company believes in good faith (after consultation
with counsel, which may be in-house counsel) could be, future litigation, (ii)
if the Company or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent or any of
its Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties in a litigation, any
information that is reasonably pertinent thereto or (iii) any information that
in the reasonable judgment of the Company would result in the disclosure of
any trade secrets of third parties or violate any of its obligations with
respect to confidentiality if the Company shall have used commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such
disclosure; _provided_ that, in the case of clause (i), the parties hereto
shall cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such
information to the extent doing so (A) would not (in the good faith belief of
the Company (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel))
be reasonably likely to result in the violation of any such Law or Contract or
be reasonably likely to cause such privilege to be undermined with respect to
such information or (B) could reasonably (in the good faith belief of the
Company (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel)) be
managed through the use of customary "clean-room" arrangements pursuant to
which non-employee Representatives of Parent could be provided access to such
information.

listing agreement with or rules of any national securities exchange or
interdealer quotation service or by the request of any Governmental Entity.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.9. _Employee Benefits._ (a) Parent agrees that during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the date that is 12 months
following the Closing Date (or, in each case, until such person earlier ceases
to be employed), each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who
continues employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary
of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time (" _Affected Employees_
") will be provided with (A) base salary that is not less than the base salary
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, (B) incentive opportunities
that are substantially comparable to the incentive opportunities in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time (for the avoidance of doubt,
excluding, in each case, equity-based compensation, one time bonuses,
transaction-based bonus opportunities or other similar extraordinary
compensation arrangements under the Company Plans), (C) employee benefits
(other than defined benefit pension benefits, equity-based benefits, and as
otherwise provided in this Section 5.9) that are substantially comparable in
the aggregate to those provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to each
such Affected Employee under the Company Plans in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (D) severance benefits that are no less favorable than
the severance benefits that would have been provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries to each such Affected Employee under the applicable Company Plans
made available to Parent in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
except as Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, and such
Affected Employee may otherwise agree in writing.

  

  


 

  

 

52  

  

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plans maintained by Parent
(collectively, " _Parent Benefit Plans_ ") which the Affected Employees are
entitled to participate in as of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Parent Benefit Plans to take into account for all purposes including
determining eligibility to participate, vesting, vacation entitlements and
severance benefits, but excluding benefit accruals under any defined benefit
or post-employment health or welfare plan, service for the Company and its
Subsidiaries attributable to any period before the Effective Time as if such
service were with Parent, to the same extent such service was credited under a
comparable plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (except to the
extent it would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same
period of service). In the event of any change in the welfare benefits
provided to Affected Employee following the Effective Time, Parent shall, and
shall cause its direct and indirect Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation), to the extent permitted under applicable Law to (i) waive all
limitations as to preexisting conditions exclusions and all waiting periods
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to each
Affected Employee under any welfare benefit plan in which an Affected Employee

to the same extent as such amounts would have been credited under the
applicable Company Plan.

Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless,

directors' and officers' insurance policies, and (ii) the Company's existing
fiduciary and employment practices liability insurance policies, in each case
for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and

documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries between such Indemnified Party

SECTION 5.12. _Takeover Statutes_. Subject to the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in Sections
4.1, 4.10 and 4.11, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to take all action necessary so that no Takeover Statute is or becomes
applicable to the Merger or any of the other Transactions. If any Takeover
Statute is or may become applicable to the Merger or the other Transactions,
the Company, Parent and their respective Boards of Directors shall each use
their commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Merger may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise eliminate or minimize the effects of such Takeover
Statute on this Agreement.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.13. _Parent Vote._ (a) Parent shall vote (or consent with respect
to) or cause to be voted (or a consent to be given with respect to) any Shares
beneficially owned by Parent in favor of the adoption of this Agreement at any

(and shall be permitted to) take all steps reasonably necessary to cause any
dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including any Company equity
awards pursuant to _Section 2.3_) in connection with this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.15. _Financing_ _._ (a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things reasonably necessary to arrange and obtain the Financing on the terms
and conditions (including the flex provisions) no less favorable to Parent
than those described in the Financing Commitments, and shall not, without the
consent of the Company, take any action or permit any amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under,
the Financing Commitments if such action, amendment, modification or waiver
would (x) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing or (y) impose new
or additional conditions or otherwise amend, modify or expand any conditions
precedent to the receipt of the Debt Financing (or any portion thereof) in a
manner that would reasonably be expected to (I) delay or prevent the Closing,
(II) make the funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions
to obtaining the Debt Financing (or any portion thereof)) less likely to occur
or (III) adversely impact the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates to enforce its rights against the other parties to the
Debt Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements with respect thereto,
the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions or the
likelihood of consummation of the Transactions ( _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent and Merger Sub may replace, amend or modify the Debt Financing
Commitments to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
similar entities that have not executed the Debt Financing Commitments as of
the date of this Agreement, in each case in accordance with the Debt Financing
Commitments as of the date hereof). Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use
(a) reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the

  

  

  

 

56  

  

  

  

Debt Financing Commitments (including by consummating the financing pursuant
to the terms of the Equity Financing Commitment) until the Transactions are
consummated (subject to Parent's rights to amend, waive, supplement, modify or
replace the Debt Financing Commitments in accordance herewith), (ii) satisfy
(or obtain a waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions and covenants
applicable to Parent, Merger Sub and any of their respective Affiliates party
thereto in the Financing Commitments and otherwise comply with its obligations
thereunder, (iii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect
to the Financing on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions)
no less favorable to Parent than those contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitments and (iv) upon satisfaction of the conditions contained in the
Financing Commitments and satisfaction or waiver of all closing conditions
contained in Sections 6.1 and 6.2, use its reasonable best efforts to
consummate the Financing at Closing and (b) commercially reasonable efforts to
enforce its rights under the Debt Financing Commitments. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company
prompt notice (which shall in no event be more than two Business Days from
their knowledge thereof): (A) of any material breach or material default by
any party to any Financing Commitment or definitive document related to the
Financing; (B) of the receipt of any written notice or other written
communication from any Person with respect to any: (1) breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to any Financing Commitment or any
definitive document related to the Financing or any provisions of any
Financing Commitment or any definitive document related to the Financing or
(2) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any
Financing Commitment or any definitive document related to the Financing (but
excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any ordinary course negotiations with
respect to the terms of the Financing or any definitive agreement with respect
thereto); and (C) if Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates
party thereto will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing
on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing
Commitments or the definitive documents related to the Financing. As soon as
reasonably practicable, Parent or Merger Sub shall provide any information
reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to
in clause (A), (B) or (C) of the immediately preceding sentence; _provided_
that in no event will Parent or Merger Sub be under any obligation to disclose
any information that is subject to attorney-client or similar privilege. If
any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
(including the flex provisions contained in the Redacted Fee Letter)
contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitments for any reason (other than due
to the failure of a condition to the consummation of the Debt Financing
resulting from the failure of the condition set forth in Section 6.2(a)),
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative
financing from the same or alternative sources in an amount sufficient to
consummate the Transactions on terms not materially less favorable from the
standpoint of Parent, Merger Sub, the Affiliates of Parent and Merger Sub
party thereto and the Company than those in the Financing Commitments (taking
into account the flex provisions) as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event but no later than the Closing Date. Parent shall
promptly provide a true, correct and complete copy of each alternative
financing commitment (together with a redacted copy of any related fee letter)
to the Company.

  

  


 

  

 

57  

  

(b) Parent and Merger Sub shall not permit any amendment or modification to be
made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Equity Financing
Commitment and shall use their reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in
effect the Equity Financing Commitment until the Transactions are consummated
and (ii) subject to Section 8.5(c), enforce their rights under the Equity
Financing Commitment.

  


 

  

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause their respective
Representatives to, provide to Parent, at the Parent's sole expense, all
cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement
and consummation of the Financing (including the satisfaction of the
conditions precedent set forth therein) and any alternative financing as set
forth in Section 5.15(a), including (in each case, to the extent reasonably
requested):

Financing (including customary authorization and management representation
letters) and/or other customary marketing materials or memoranda for the Debt
Financing or any alternative Financing and providing such customary
documentation and other information required in connection with applicable (a)
"know your customer" rules and regulations (which documentation and
information shall be provided no later than 3 Business Days prior to the
Closing if requested in writing at least 10 days prior to the Closing) and (b)
anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the U.S.A. Patriot Act
of 2001;

respect to solvency of the Company on a consolidated basis (after giving
effect to the transactions contemplated hereby) in the form attached as Annex
I to Exhibit A of the Debt Financing Commitments; _provided_ that (1) failure
of the chief financial officer of the Company to deliver such a certificate
shall be deemed not to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company, if any of
the statements in such Annex I are not accurate, and (2) the Board of
Directors of the Company and any committee thereof (including the Special
Committee) are not required to pass any resolutions pursuant to this clause
(iv)(A) that are effective prior to the Effective Time, (B) assisting with

Regulation S-X under the Securities Act and (ii) separate financial statements
with respect to subsidiaries pursuant to Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X under the
Securities Act) (provided that Parent shall be responsible for the preparation

Company and its Subsidiaries and with the reasonable cooperation of the
Company and its Subsidiaries), and other pertinent information regarding the
Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested in writing by
Parent and identifying any portion of such information that constitutes
material non-public information; and (C) furnishing to Parent and the
Financing Sources projections and information required in connection with

customary and reasonable, including by granting the Financing Sources, at
reasonable times and on reasonable notice, access to the Company's properties,
asset, cash management and accounting records.

  


 

  

Nothing in this Section 5.15(c) shall require such cooperation to the extent
it would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company
or its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required pursuant to this Section 5.15(c) to enter into or perform under any
certificate, agreement, document or other instrument that is not contingent
upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to the Effective Time (other
than the authorization letters and representation letters referred to in
clauses (ii) and (iii) above, any Company SEC Filing or any customary payoff
letters with respect to the Credit Facility). None of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action pursuant to this Section
5.15(c) that would subject it to actual or potential liability for which it
would not be indemnified hereunder or to bear any cost or expense or to pay
any commitment or other similar fee or make any other payment (other than
reasonable out-of-pocket costs) or provide or agree to provide any indemnity
in connection with the Financing or any of the foregoing prior to the
Effective Time. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives from and against any and all
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the

this Section 5.15(c)) and any information utilized in connection therewith
(other than historical information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries
provided by the Company in writing specifically for use in the Financing
offering documents), except to the extent any of the foregoing arises from the
bad faith or willful misconduct of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives (as determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision).
Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for
all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries
in connection with this Section 5.15(c). The Company hereby consents to the
use of its and its Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the Debt Financing;
_provided_ that such logos shall be used solely in a manner that is not
intended or reasonably likely to harm, disparage or otherwise adversely affect
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

  


 

  

 

60  

  

(d) Not more than five days after the amount in Euros of the portion of the
"Term Facility" under the Debt Financing to be denominated in Euros (the "
_Euro Tranche_ ") is determined, which shall be the time at which the
Financing Sources allocate the Euro Tranche (including amounts added in
connection with the exercise of any "flex" rights) to third party syndicated
lenders (such time, the " _Determination Time_ "), Merger Sub shall enter into
forward foreign exchange contracts or similar hedging agreements that provide
that amounts borrowed under the Euro Tranche will be converted into an amount
of U.S. dollars based on the Euro/U.S. dollar spot exchange rate at the
Determination Time.

  


 

  

(e) The Company shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, supplement the
Required Financial Information or the Company SEC Filing on a reasonably
current basis to the extent that the Required Financial Information or Company
SEC Filing, as the case may be, to the Knowledge of the Company, contains any
material misstatement of fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to
make such information not materially misleading.

  


 

  

(f) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the
Financing, or any alternative financing, is not a condition to Closing and
reaffirm their obligation to consummate the Transactions irrespective and
independently of the availability of the Financing or any alternative
financing, subject to fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VI.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.16. _FIRPTA_ _Certificate_ _._ Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall deliver to Parent a certificate, signed under penalty of perjury and in
form and substance as required by Sections 1.897-2(h) and 1.1445-2(c)(3) of
the Treasury regulations promulgated under the Code certifying that an
interest in the Company is not a United States real property interest under
Section 897(c) of the Code.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.17. _Transaction Litigation_ _._ Each of the Company and Parent
shall promptly notify the other of any commenced or threatened stockholder
demands, litigations, arbitrations or other similar claims, actions, suits or
proceedings (including derivative claims) commenced against it and/or its
respective directors or officers relating to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions contemplated hereby or any matters relating thereto
(collectively, " _Transaction Litigation_ ") and shall keep the other party
informed on an on-going and current basis regarding any Transaction Litigation
(including by promptly providing copies of all pleadings with respect
thereto). Each of the Company and Parent shall (i) cooperate with the other in
the defense or settlement of any Transaction Litigation (subject to applicable
fiduciary duties), (ii) give the other party the opportunity to participate
(at such other party's cost and expense) the defense or settlement of such
Transaction Litigation and (iii) shall consult with the other with respect to
the defense or settlement of such Transaction Litigation. Prior to the
Effective Time, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall settle or
offer to settle any Transaction Litigation without the prior written consent
of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

  

  


 

  

 

61  

  

SECTION 5.18. _Certain Notifications_ _._ From the date hereof until the
Closing, the Company shall promptly notify Parent, and Parent shall promptly
notify the Company, in writing of (a) any circumstance, event or action the
existence, occurrence or taking of which would reasonably be expected to
result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Article VI to be
satisfied, (b) any written notice or other written communication received by
the Company from any Person alleging that any consent that would be required
to be disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(b), but was not so disclosed, is or
may be required to be obtained in connection with the Merger Transactions, and
(c) any litigation commenced against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
have been disclosed pursuant to Section 3.7. Parent's receipt of information
pursuant to this Section 5.18 shall not operate as a waiver or otherwise
affect any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement given or made by
the Company in this Agreement.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.19. _Certain Agreements_. Except with the written consent of the
Board of Directors of the Company or the Special Committee (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld), Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates
and "associates" (as defined under Section 203 of the DGCL) to not, enter into
any agreement, arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether oral or
written) or authorize, commit or agree to enter into any agreement,
arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether oral or written): (A)
pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company would be entitled to receive
value or consideration of a different amount or nature than the Per Share
Merger Consideration or agrees to vote to adopt the Merger Agreement or the
Merger or to vote against any Acquisition Proposal; or (B) with any employee
or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (i) remain as an
employee or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries following the
Effective Time (other than pursuant to any employment Contracts in effect as

of such employee's or director's Shares, Stock Options, Stock Appreciation

earlier date, in which case such representation and warranty shall be true and
correct in all respects as of such earlier date and (2) in the case of Section
3.2(a), for de minimis inaccuracies); (iii) all other representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall be true and
correct (without giving effect to any materiality or Company Material Adverse
Effect qualifications set forth therein) as of the Closing Date as though made
on and as of such date and time (except to the extent that any such
representation and warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which
case such representation and warranty shall be true and correct as of such
earlier date); _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, the condition set forth in this Section 6.2(a)(iii) shall be
deemed to have been satisfied even if any such representations and warranties
of the Company are not so true and correct unless the failure of such
representations and warranties of the Company to be so true and correct,
individually or in the aggregate, has had a Company Material Adverse Effect;
and (iv) Parent shall have received at the Closing a certificate signed on
behalf of the Company by a senior executive officer of the Company to the
effect that such officer has read this Section 6.2(a) and the conditions set
forth in this Section 6.2(a) have been satisfied.

  

  


 

  

 

63  

  

(b) _Performance of Obligations of the_ _Company_ _._ The Company shall have
performed in all material respects all obligations and covenants required to
be performed by it under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date, and
Parent shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of the Company by a
senior executive officer of the Company to such effect.

  


 

  

(c) _No_ _Company Material Adverse Effect_ _._ Since the date of this
Agreement, there shall not have occurred any Company Material Adverse Effect
that remains in effect.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.3. _Conditions to Obligation of the_ _Company_ _._ The obligation of
the Company to effect the Merger is also subject to the satisfaction or waiver
at or prior to the Effective Time of the following conditions:

  


 

  

(a) _Representations and Warranties._ (i) The representations and warranties
of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in Section 4.2 and Section 4.8 shall be
true and correct in all material respects as of the Closing Date as though
made on and as of such date and time (except to the extent that any such
representation and warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which
case such representation and warranty shall be true and correct in all
material respects as of such earlier date); (ii) the representations and
warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in Section 4.1 and Section 4.9
shall be true and correct in all respects as of the Closing Date as though
made on and as of such date and time (except (1) to the extent that any such
representation and warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which
case such representation and warranty shall be true and correct in all
respects as of such earlier date and (2) in the case of Section 4.9, for de
minimis inaccuracies); (iii) all other representations and warranties of
Parent and Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement shall be true and correct
(without giving effect to any materiality qualifications set forth therein) as
of the Closing Date as though made on and as of such date and time (except to
the extent that any such representation and warranty expressly speaks as of an
earlier date, in which case such representation and warranty shall be true and
correct as of such earlier date), except where the failure of such
representations and warranties to be so true and correct would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to prevent, materially
delay or materially impede the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate
the Merger and the other Transactions; and (iv) the Company shall have
received at the Closing a certificate signed on behalf of Parent and Merger
Sub by a senior executive officer of Parent to the effect that such officer
has read this Section 6.3(a) and the conditions set forth in this Section
6.3(a) have been satisfied.

  

  


 

  

 

64  

  

(b) _Performance of Obligations of_ _Parent_ _and_ _Merger Sub_ _._ Each of
Parent and Merger Sub shall have performed in all material respects all
obligations required to be performed by them under this Agreement at or prior
to the Closing Date, and the Company shall have received a certificate signed
on behalf of Parent and Merger Sub by a senior executive officer of Parent to
such effect.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.4. _Frustration of_ _Closing_ _Conditions._ None of the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in
Sections 6.2 or 6.3, as the case may be, to be satisfied to excuse such
party's obligation to effect the Merger if such failure was caused by such
party's failure to use the standard of efforts required from such party to
consummate the Merger and the other Transactions, including as required by and
subject to Sections 5.5 and 5.15 or other material breach by such party of any
covenant or agreement in this Agreement or any material breach of such party's
representations and warranties.

adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company referred to in
Section 6.1(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Parent shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.2(a) if the
Company has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.3(b)
and (ii) the Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 7.2(a) if Parent has the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.4(b);

  


 

  

(b) the Stockholders' Meeting shall have been held and completed and adoption
of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company referred to in Section

(c) any Order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
consummation of the Merger shall have become final and non-appealable (whether
before or after the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the
Company referred to in Section 6.1(a)), _provided_ that the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.2(c) shall not be available to any
party that has breached in any material respect its obligations under this
Agreement in any manner that shall have been the primary cause of or the
primary factor that resulted in the failure of a condition to the consummation
of the Merger to have been satisfied on or before the Termination Date.

  

  


 

  

 

65  

  

SECTION 7.3. _Termination by the_ _Company_ _._ This Agreement may be
terminated and the Merger may be abandoned by the Company:

  


 

  

(a) at any time prior to the time the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, if

upon the affirmative recommendation of the Special Committee) authorizes the
Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal; (ii) substantially concurrently with the termination of
this Agreement the Company enters into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with respect to a Superior Proposal; and (iii) the Company substantially
concurrently with such termination pays to American Securities LLC or its
designee and to P2 Capital Partners, LLC or its designee in immediately
available funds any fees required to be paid pursuant to Section 7.5;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be entitled to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.3(a) unless the Company has complied
with the applicable requirements of Section 5.2(d);

  


 

  

(b) at any time prior to the Effective Time, if there has been a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Parent or Merger Sub
in this Agreement, or any such representation and warranty shall have become
untrue after the date of this Agreement, such that the conditions set forth in
Sections 6.3(a) or 6.3(b) would not be satisfied, and such breach or condition
is not curable or, if curable, is not cured prior to the earlier of (i) the
30th day after written notice thereof is given by the Company to Parent and
(ii) the date that is two Business Days prior to the Termination Date (the
earlier of (i) and (ii), the " _Breach End Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company is not then in material breach of this Agreement so as to
cause any of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.2(a) or 6.2(b) not to be
capable of being satisfied; or

  


 

  

(c) at any time prior to the Effective Time, if all of the conditions set
forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 have been satisfied or waived and continue to be
satisfied (if applicable) (other than those conditions that by their nature
cannot be satisfied other than at the Closing) and the Company has indicated
in writing that the Company is ready, willing and able to consummate the
Merger, and Parent and Merger Sub fail to consummate the Merger within two
Business Days after the date the Closing should have occurred pursuant to
Section 1.3 and the Company stood ready, willing and able to consummate the
Merger during such two Business Day period.

  


 

  

SECTION 7.4. _Termination by_ _Parent_. This Agreement may be terminated and
the Merger may be abandoned by Parent:

  


 

  

(a) at any time prior to when the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, if the
Special Committee or the Board of Directors of the Company (acting upon the
affirmative recommendation of the Special Committee) (i) shall have made and
not withdrawn a Change of Recommendation or (ii) shall have failed (or the
Company shall have failed) to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement; or

  

  


 

  

 

66  

  

(b) at any time prior to the Effective Time, if there has been a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company in this
Agreement, or any such representation and warranty shall have become untrue
after the date of this Agreement, such that the conditions set forth in
Sections 6.2(a) or 6.2(b) would not be satisfied, and such breach or condition
is not curable or, if curable, is not cured prior to the earlier of (i) the
30th day after written notice thereof is given by Parent to the Company and
(ii) the date that is two Business Days prior to the Termination Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent is not then in material breach of this
Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) or
6.3(b) not to be capable of being satisfied.

  


 

  

SECTION 7.5. _Effect of Termination and Abandonment._

  


 

  

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the
Merger pursuant to this Article VII, this Agreement shall become void and of
no effect with no liability to any Person on the part of any party hereto (or
of any of its Representatives or Affiliates); _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, (i) (A) except as
otherwise provided herein, no such termination shall relieve any party hereto
of any liability to pay the Termination Fee, the Parent Termination Fee or the
expense and indemnification obligations pursuant to this Section 7.5 and
Section 5.15(c) and (B) the provisions set forth in this Section 7.5 and
Article VIII shall survive the termination of this Agreement and (ii) no such
termination shall relieve any party from liability for fraud or intentional
breach of this Agreement.

  


 

  

(b) _Termination Fee_. In the event that:

  


 

  

(i) (x) before obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, this Agreement is
terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to (1) Section 7.2(a) or (2)
Section 7.2(b), (y) any Person shall have made (and not subsequently withdrawn
prior to the event giving rise to such termination) a bona fide Acquisition
Proposal after the date of this Agreement but prior to such termination and
(z) within 12 months of such termination the Company shall have entered into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, or a
transaction contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal is otherwise consummated
within 12 months of such termination ( _provided_ that for purposes of this
clause (z) the references to "25% or more" in subsections (1) and (2) of the
definition of " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall be deemed to be references to
"more than 75%");

  


 

  

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.4(a); or

  


 

  

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.3(a);

  

  


 

  

 

67  

  

then the Company shall (A) in the case of clause (i) of this Section 7.5(b),
substantially concurrently with the entry into a definitive agreement with
respect to or consummation (as the case may be) of the Acquisition Proposal
referred to in sub-clause (i)(z) of this Section 7.5(b), (B) in the case of
clause (ii) of this Section 7.5(b), no later than two Business Days after the
date of such termination and (C) in the case of clause (iii) of this Section
7.5(b), substantially concurrently with such termination, pay the Termination
Fee to American Securities LLC and P2 Capital Partners, LLC (or their
respective designees) in such amounts as Parent notifies to the Company in
writing (which amounts collectively shall not, for the avoidance of doubt,
exceed the Termination Fee), by wire transfer of immediately available funds
(it being understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion).

  


 

  

(c) _Parent Termination Fee_ _._ In the event that this Agreement is
terminated by (i) the Company pursuant to Section 7.3(b) and the breach by
Parent or Merger Sub giving rise to such termination is the principal cause of
the failure of the Merger to be consummated, in such case, unless, prior to
such termination, (A) Parent and Merger Sub deliver written notice at least
two (2) Business Days in advance of the Breach End Date informing the Company
that Parent and Merger Sub would be ready, willing and able to consummate the
Merger in accordance with its terms no later than the Breach End Date and (B)
Parent and Merger Sub stood ready, willing and able to consummate the Merger
in accordance with its terms on the Breach End Date or (ii) the Company
pursuant to Section 7.3(c), then Parent shall, no later than two Business Days
after the date of such termination, pay or cause to be paid to the Company the
Parent Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds (it
being understood that in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent
Termination Fee on more than one occasion).

  


 

  

(d) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 7.5
are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without these agreements,
the parties would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company
fails to promptly pay the amounts due pursuant to Section 7.5(b) or Parent
fails to promptly pay the amounts due pursuant to Section 7.5(c), and, in
order to obtain such payment, Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the
Company, on the other hand, commences a suit that results in a judgment
against the Company for the amounts set forth in Section 7.5(b) or any portion
thereof or a judgment against Parent for the amounts set forth in Section
7.5(c) or any portion thereof, the Company shall reimburse Parent or Merger
Sub, or any of their respective designees, on the one hand, or Parent shall
reimburse or cause the Company to be reimbursed, on the other hand, such
party's costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on such amount or portion thereof at the prime
rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made through the date of payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, (i) the Company's receipt of the Parent Termination Fee
pursuant to this Section 7.5 (and its rights to enforce the Guarantee with
respect thereto and in the case the Parent Termination Fee is not timely paid
the amounts described in the first sentence of this Section 7.5(d)), any
reimbursement and indemnification obligations of Parent pursuant to Section
5.15(c) and the Company's right to specific performance of this Agreement
pursuant to Sections 8.5(c) and 8.5(d) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
of the Company and its Affiliates against Parent, Merger Sub, the Equity
Provider, the Initial Rollover Stockholder, the Financing Sources under the
Debt Financing Commitments, any of their respective Affiliates, and any of the
former, current, or future general or limited partners, stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, managers, members or agents of any of the
foregoing, for any loss suffered as a result of any breach of any covenant or
agreement in this Agreement or the Debt Financing Commitments or the failure
of the Merger to be consummated, and upon payment of such amounts, none of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Equity Provider, the Initial Rollover Stockholder, the
Financing Sources under the Debt Financing Commitments, any of their
respective Affiliates, or any of the former, current, or future general or
limited partners, stockholders, directors, officers, managers, employees,
members or agents of any of the foregoing, shall have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions
and (ii) Parent's receipt of the Termination Fee from the Company pursuant to
this Section 7.5 (plus, in the case the Termination Fee is not timely paid,
the amounts described in the first sentence of this Section 7.5(d)) shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Affiliates against the Company, its Subsidiaries and any of their respective
Affiliates, and any of the former, current, or future general or limited
partners, stockholders, directors, officers, employees, managers, members or
agents of any of the foregoing for any loss suffered as a result of any breach
of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement or the failure of the Merger to
be consummated, and upon payment of such amounts, none of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates, any of the former,
current, or future general or limited partners, stockholders, directors,
officers, employees, managers, members or agents of any of the foregoing,
shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing shall not relieve any party from liability for fraud or intentional
breach of this Agreement.

 _Miscellaneous and General_

  


 

  

SECTION 8.1. _Survival_. This Article VIII and the agreements of the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub contained in Article II and Sections 5.9, 5.10, 5.11 and
the indemnification obligations of Parent pursuant to Section 5.15(c) shall
survive the consummation of the Merger. This Article VIII and the agreements
of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub contained in Section 5.10, Section 7.5,
the indemnification and reimbursement obligations of Parent pursuant to
Section 5.15(c), the Confidentiality Agreements and the Equity Financing
Commitment (including the Guarantee) shall survive the termination of this

other representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement
shall not survive the consummation of the Merger or the termination of this
Agreement.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.2. _Modification or Amendment_. Subject to the provisions of the
applicable Laws, at any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto
may modify or amend this Agreement by written agreement executed and delivered
by duly authorized officers of the respective parties. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, to the extent any amendment or waiver to Section 7.5(d), Section
8.5(a), Section 8.5(b), Section 8.10, Section 8.12 or this Section 8.2 (and
the related defined terms contained in the foregoing provisions) is sought
which is materially adverse to the rights of the Financing Sources, the prior
written consent of the Financing Sources shall be required before such
amendment or waiver is rendered effective.

  

  


 

  

 

69  

  

SECTION 8.3. _Waiver of Conditions_. The conditions to each of the parties'
obligations to consummate the Merger Transactions are for the sole benefit of
such party and may be waived by such party in whole or in part to the extent
permitted by applicable Laws. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any such waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of such party.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.4. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each such counterpart being deemed to be an original instrument,
and all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same
agreement.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.5. _GOVERNING_ _LAW_ _AND VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL; SPECIFIC
PERFORMANCE._

  


 

  

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF TO
THE EXTENT THAT SUCH PRINCIPLES WOULD DIRECT A MATTER TO ANOTHER JURISDICTION;
_PROVIDED_ THAT, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THE DEBT FINANCING
COMMITMENTS, ANY LEGAL SUIT, ACTION, LITIGATION, PROCEEDING OR CLAIM AGAINST
ANY FINANCING SOURCE (WHETHER IN LAW OR EQUITY OR IN CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) SHALL BE GOVERNED, INCLUDING AS TO VALIDITY, INTERPRETATION AND
EFFECT, BY THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. The parties hereby
irrevocably submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware, or to the extent such court does not have
subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District Court for the District
of Delaware (the " _Chosen Courts_ ") in respect of the interpretation and
enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of the documents referred
to in this Agreement, and in respect of the Transactions, and hereby waive,
and agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for
the interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is
not subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought
or is not maintainable in the Chosen Courts or that the Chosen Courts are an
inconvenient forum or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate, or that
this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such Chosen
Courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims relating to
such action, suit or proceeding shall be heard and determined in the Chosen
Courts. The parties hereby consent to and grant any such Chosen Court
jurisdiction over the person of such parties and, to the extent permitted by
Law, over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process
or other papers in connection with any such action, suit or proceeding in the
manner provided in Section 8.6 or in such other manner as may be permitted by
law shall be valid, effective and sufficient service thereof. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not, and will
not permit its Affiliates to, bring or support any action, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in
law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of
the Financing Sources and any other debt financing sources in any way relating
to this Agreement or any of the Transactions, including with respect to any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing
Commitments, the Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum other
than any state or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in the
City of New York and agree that the waiver of jury trial set forth in Section
8.5(b) hereof shall be applicable to any such proceeding.

  

  


 

  

 

70  

  

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (iv) EACH
PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 8.5.

  


 

  

(c) The parties agree that (i) irreparable damage for which monetary damages,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event
that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement
(including failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in
order to consummate the Transactions) in accordance with its specified terms
or otherwise breach such provisions, (ii) the provisions in Section 7.5 (A)
are not intended to and do not adequately compensate for the harm that would
result from a breach of this Agreement and (B) shall not diminish or otherwise
impair in any respect any party's right to specific enforcement and (iii) the
right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Merger and the other
Transactions and without that right, none of the parties hereto would have
entered into this Agreement. The parties acknowledge and agree that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any
other remedy, subject to Section 8.5(d), to which they are entitled at law or
in equity. Without limitation of the foregoing and notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the parties hereby further acknowledge and
agree that prior to the Closing, the Company shall be entitled to seek
specific performance to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of, and
to prevent or cure breaches of Sections 5.5 and 5.15 by Parent or Merger Sub.
Each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees that it will not oppose the granting of
an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis
that (x) the Company has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any
party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.

  

  


 

  

 

71  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, including the
provisions of Section 8.5(c), it is explicitly agreed that the Company shall
be entitled to seek specific performance of Parent's obligation to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded to fund the Merger and to effect the Merger in
accordance with Section 1.3 in the event that, but only in the event that, (i)
all conditions in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 (other than those conditions that by
their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, but each of which
shall be capable of being satisfied on the Closing Date) have been satisfied
or waived at the time when the Closing would have occurred, (ii) the Debt
Financing (or, if alternative financing is being used pursuant to Section
5.15(a), pursuant to the commitments with respect thereto) has been funded or
will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the
Closing, and (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing that if
specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and the Debt
Financing are funded, then it will take such actions that are required of it
to cause the Closing of the Merger Transactions to occur pursuant to Section
1.3. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be entitled to
enforce or seek to enforce specifically the obligation to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded or to complete the Merger if the Debt Financing or the
alternative financing as set forth in Section 5.15(a) pursuant to the
commitments with respect thereto has not been funded (or will not be funded at
the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing). The Company
shall be permitted and entitled to seek both a grant of specific performance
and payment of the Parent Termination Fee; _provided_ that under no
circumstance shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both (1) a
grant of specific performance to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and
the Merger to be consummated that results in the Closing and (2) payment of
the Parent Termination Fee.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.6. _Notices_. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to
be given hereunder by any party to the others shall be in writing and

applicable Required Financial Information, it may deliver to Parent written
notice to that effect (stating when it believes it completed such delivery),

date specified in that notice unless Parent in good faith reasonably believes
the Marketing Period has not commenced and, within five Business Days after
the delivery of such notice by the Company, delivers a written notice to the
Company to that effect (stating with reasonable specificity why Parent
reasonably believes the Marketing Period has not commenced). Notwithstanding

Company to its stockholders.

only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in
this Agreement is made to a Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a
Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever
the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement,
they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The
words "date hereof" when used in this Agreement shall refer to the date of
this Agreement. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the
degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not
mean simply "if". The words "made available to Parent" and words of similar

corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates. The mere
inclusion of any item in any section or subsection of any party's Disclosure
Letter as an exception to any representation or warranty or otherwise shall
not, in and of itself, be deemed to constitute an admission by the applicable
party, or to otherwise imply, that any such item (i) has had or is reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or otherwise represents an
exception or material fact, event or circumstance for the purposes of this
Agreement, (ii) did not arise in the ordinary course of business or in a
manner consistent with past practice or (iii) meets or exceeds a monetary or
other threshold specified for disclosure in this Agreement. Inclusion of any
item in a Disclosure Letter shall not constitute, or be deemed to be, an
admission by any party to any third party of any matter whatsoever (including
any violation of applicable Law or breach of Contract), nor shall it be deemed
to establish a standard for materiality or a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Matters disclosed in any section or subsection of a party's Disclosure Letter
are not necessarily limited to matters that are required by this Agreement to
be disclosed therein. Such additional matters are set forth for informational
purposes only and do not necessarily include other matters of a similar nature
or impose any duty or obligation to disclose any information beyond what is
required by this Agreement, and disclosure of such additional matters shall
not affect, directly or indirectly, the interpretation of this Agreement or
the scope of the disclosure obligations hereunder. Headings inserted in the
sections or subsections of any party's Disclosure Letter are for convenience
of reference only and shall not have the effect of amending or changing the
express terms of the sections or subsections as set forth in this Agreement.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.16. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors, legal
representatives and permitted assigns. No party to this Agreement may assign
any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement, by
operation of Law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other
parties hereto. Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is
void.

another capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of the

fullest extent permitted by applicable law. The provisions of this paragraph
(b) of this _Article Ninth_ shall not be deemed to preclude the
indemnification of any person who is not specified in this paragraph (b) of
this _Article Ninth_ but whom the Corporation has the power or obligation to
indemnify under the provisions of the DGCL or otherwise.

 OF

 _Stockholders_

  


 

  

SECTION 1. _Annual Meetings_. The annual meeting of stockholders for the

time, within or without the State of Delaware, as the Board of Directors shall
determine.

  


 

  

SECTION 2. _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of stockholders for the
transaction of such business as may properly come before the meeting may be
called by order of the Board of Directors or by stockholders holding together

executive office of the Corporation.

  


 

  

SECTION 3. _Notice of Meetings_. Written notice of all meetings of the
stockholders, stating the place (if any), date and hour of the meeting, the

and vote at such meeting, shall be mailed or delivered to each stockholder not
less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the meeting. Notice of any special
meeting shall state in general terms the purpose or purposes for which the
meeting is to be held.

  


 

  

SECTION 4. _Stockholder Lists_. The officer who has charge of the stock ledger
of the Corporation shall prepare and make, at least five days before every
meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote
at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of
each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each
stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder,
for any purpose germane to the meeting, either at a place within the city
where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice
of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to
be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the
meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder
who is present.

  


 

  

The stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders
entitled to examine the stock ledger, the list required by this Section 4 or
the books of the Corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting
of stockholders.

  

  


 

    

  

SECTION 5. _Quorum_. Except as otherwise provided by law or the Corporation's
Certificate of Incorporation, a quorum for the transaction of business at any
meeting of stockholders shall consist of the holders of record of a majority
of the issued and outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation
entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person or by proxy. At all
meetings of the stockholders at which a quorum is present, all matters, except
as otherwise provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, shall be
decided by the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to
vote thereat present in person or by proxy. If there be no such quorum, the
holders of a majority of such shares so present or represented may adjourn the
meeting from time to time, without further notice, until a quorum shall have
been obtained. When a quorum is once present it is not broken by the
subsequent withdrawal of any stockholder.

  


 

  

SECTION 6. _Organization_. Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by
the Chairman, if any, or if none or in the Chairman's absence, if any, or if
none or in the absence the President, if any, or if none or in the President's
absence a Vice-President, or, if none of the foregoing is present, by a
chairman to be chosen by the stockholders entitled to vote who are present in
person or by proxy at the meeting. The Secretary of the Corporation, or in the
Secretary's absence an Assistant Secretary, shall act as secretary of every
meeting, but if neither the Secretary nor an Assistant Secretary is present,
the presiding officer of the meeting shall appoint any person present to act
as secretary of the meeting.

  


 

  

SECTION 7. _Voting; Proxies; Required Vote_.

  


 

  

(a) At each meeting of stockholders, every stockholder shall be entitled to
vote in person or by proxy appointed by instrument in writing, subscribed by
such stockholder or by such stockholder's duly authorized attorney-in-fact

share of stock entitled to vote registered in the name of such stockholder on
the books of the Corporation on the applicable record date fixed pursuant to
these Bylaws. At all elections of directors the voting may but need not be by

action shall be authorized by the vote of the majority of the shares present
in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the
subject matter.

stockholders may, except as otherwise required by law or the Certificate of
Incorporation, be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a
vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be
signed by the holders of record of the issued and outstanding capital stock of
the Corporation having not less than a minimum number of votes that would be
necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares
entitled to vote thereon were present and voted, and the writing or writings

thereat. Each inspector, if any, before entering upon the discharge of his or
her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of
inspector at such meeting with strict impartiality and according to the best
of his ability. The inspectors, if any, shall determine the number of shares
of stock outstanding and the voting power of each, the shares of stock
represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and the validity and
effect of proxies, and shall receive votes, ballots or consents, hear and
determine all challenges and questions arising in connection with the right to
vote, count and tabulate all votes, ballots or consents, determine the result,
and do such acts as are proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness

by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, or the President or Vice-President,
and by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, or the Secretary or an
Assistant Secretary of the Corporation, representing the number of shares
registered in certificate form. Any and all signatures on any such certificate
may be facsimiles. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has
signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall
have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such
certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same
effect as if he were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of
issue. The name of the holder of record of the shares represented thereby,
with the number of such shares and the date of issue, shall be entered on the
books of the Corporation.

SECTION 2. _Transfers of Stock_. Upon compliance with provisions restricting
the transfer or registration of transfer of shares of stock, if any, shares of

surrender and cancellation of certificates for a like number of shares,
properly endorsed, and the payment of all taxes due thereon.

  


 

  

SECTION 3. _Fractional Shares_. The Corporation may, but shall not be required
to, issue certificates for fractions of a share where necessary to effect
authorized transactions, or the Corporation may pay in cash the fair value of
fractions of a share as of the time when those entitled to receive such
fractions are determined, or it may issue scrip in registered or bearer form
over the manual or facsimile signature of an officer of the Corporation or of
its agent, exchangeable as therein provided for full shares, but such scrip
shall not entitle the holder to any rights of a stockholder except as therein
provided.

  

  

The Board of Directors shall have power and authority to make all such rules
and regulations as it may deem expedient concerning the issue, transfer and
registration of certificates representing shares of the Corporation.

  


 

  

SECTION 4. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. The Corporation may issue

it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the Board of Directors
may require the owner of any lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or his
legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify
the Corporation against any claim that may be made against it on account of
the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance
of any such new certificate.

any, what part of any, funds legally available for the payment of dividends
shall be declared as dividends and paid to stockholders; the division of the
whole or any part of such funds of the Corporation shall rest wholly within
the lawful discretion of the Board of Directors, and it shall not be required
at any time, against such discretion, to divide or pay any part of such funds
among or to the stockholders as dividends or otherwise; and before payment of
any dividend, there may be set aside out of any funds of the Corporation
available for dividends such sum or sums as the Board of Directors from time
to time, in its absolute discretion, deems proper as a reserve or reserves to
meet contingencies, or for equalizing dividends, or for repairing or
maintaining any property of the Corporation, or for such other purpose as the
Board of Directors shall think conducive to the interest of the Corporation,
and the Board of Directors may modify or abolish any such reserve in the
manner in which it was created.

 _Ratification_

  


 

  

Any transaction, questioned in any lawsuit on the ground of lack of authority,
defective or irregular execution, adverse interest of director, officer or
stockholder, non-disclosure, miscomputation, or the application of improper
principles or practices of accounting, may be ratified before or after
judgment, by the Board of Directors or by the stockholders, and if so ratified
shall have the same force and effect as if the questioned transaction had been
originally duly authorized. Such ratification shall be binding upon the
Corporation and its stockholders and shall constitute a bar to any claim or
execution of any judgment in respect of such questioned transaction.

specific instances.

  


 

  

SECTION 3. _Proxies; Powers of Attorney; Other Instruments_. The Chairman, the

ARTICLE XIII

  


 

  

 _Indemnification_

  


 

  

SECTION 1. _Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings other than
Those by or in the Right of the Corporation_. Subject to Section 3 of this
Article XIII, the Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by the
DGCL and applicable Delaware law as in effect at any time, indemnify any
person (an " _Indemnified Person_ ") who was or is a party (including as a
witness) or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation)
by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, employee
or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee, partner, member or agent of
another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
trust, employee, benefit plan or other enterprise, against all expenses
(including attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
actually and reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with
such action, suit or proceeding if such Indemnified Person acted in good faith
and in a manner such Indemnified Person reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any
criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such
Indemnified Person\'s conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action,
suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea
or nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a
presumption that the Indemnified Person did not act in good faith and in a
manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the
best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such Indemnified Person\'s
conduct was unlawful.

  


 

  

SECTION 2. _Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings by or in the
Right of the Corporation_. Subject to Section 3 of this Article XIII, the
Corporation shall indemnify any Indemnified Person who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action
or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its
favor against all expenses (including attorneys\' fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with the defense
or settlement of such action or suit if such Indemnified Person acted in good
faith and in a manner such Indemnified Person reasonably believed to be in or
not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, except that no
indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to
which such Indemnified Person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the
Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery in the
State of Delaware (the " _Court of Chancery_ ") or the court in which such
action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the
adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case,
such Indemnified Person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification
for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem
proper.

  

  


 

  

 

12  

  

SECTION 3. _Indemnification Procedures_. In furtherance, but not in
limitation, of the foregoing provisions of this Article XIII, the following
procedures, presumptions and remedies shall apply with respect to the right to
indemnification under this Article XIII.

  


 

  

(a) To obtain indemnification under this Article XIII, an Indemnified Person
shall submit to the Secretary a written request, including such documentation
and information as is reasonably available to the Indemnified Person and
reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the Indemnified
Person is entitled to indemnification (the " _Supporting Documentation_ ") The
determination of the Indemnified Person\'s entitlement to indemnification
shall be made reasonably promptly following the later of (A) the receipt by
the Corporation of the written request for indemnification together with the
Supporting Documentation and (B) the receipt by the Corporation of written
notice of final disposition of the action, suit or proceeding in respect of
which indemnification is sought. The Secretary shall, promptly upon receipt of
such a request for indemnification, advise the Board of Directors in writing
that the Indemnified Person has requested indemnification.

  


 

  

(b) Any indemnification under this Article XIII (unless ordered by a court)
shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon
a determination that indemnification of the Indemnified Person is proper in
the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article XIII, as the case
may be. The Indemnified Person\'s entitlement to indemnification under this
Article XIII shall be determined in one of the following ways (i) by a
majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or
proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of such
directors designated by a majority vote of such directors, even though less
than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors, or if such directors
so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (iv) by the
stockholders.

  


 

  

(c) If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 3(b) of this
Article XIII, that the Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification, the
Corporation shall be obligated to pay the amounts constituting such
indemnification reasonably promptly after such determination has been made and
shall be conclusively bound by such determination unless such indemnification
is prohibited by applicable law.

  


 

  

(d) In the event that the Indemnified Person seeks a judicial adjudication of
his or her rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Article
XIII, such Indemnified Person shall be entitled to recover from the
Corporation, and shall be indemnified by the Corporation against, any expenses
actually and reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with
such judicial adjudication if such Indemnified Person prevails in such
judicial adjudication.

  


 

  

SECTION 4. _Primary Obligation_. With respect to any Indemnified Person who is
employed, retained or otherwise associated with, or appointed or nominated by
a stockholder or any of its affiliates and who acts or serves as a director,
officer, manager, fiduciary, employee, consultant, advisor or agent of, for or
to the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, the Corporation or its
subsidiaries shall be primarily liable for all indemnification,
reimbursements, advancements or similar payments (the " _Indemnity
Obligations_ ") afforded to such Indemnified Person acting in such capacity or
capacities on behalf or at the request of the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries, in such capacity, whether the Indemnity Obligations are created
by law, organizational or constituent documents, contract (including these
Bylaws) or otherwise. Notwithstanding the fact that such stockholder and/or
any of its affiliates, other than the Corporation (such persons, together with
its and their heirs, successors and assigns, the " _Stockholder Parties_ ")
may have concurrent liability to an Indemnified Person with respect to the
Indemnity Obligations, in no event shall the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries have any right or claim against any of the Stockholder Parties
for contribution or have rights of subrogation against any of the Stockholder
Parties through an Indemnified Person for any payment made by the Corporation
or any of its subsidiaries with respect to any Indemnity Obligation. In
addition, in the event that any Stockholder Parties pay or advance to an
Indemnified Person any amount with respect to an Indemnity Obligation, the
Corporation shall, or shall cause its subsidiaries to, as applicable, promptly
reimburse such Stockholder Party for such payment or advance upon request.

  

  


 

  

 

13  

  

SECTION 5. _Good Faith Defined_. For purposes of any determination under
Section 3 of this Article XIII, an Indemnified Person shall be deemed to have
acted in good faith and in a manner such Indemnified Person reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or,
with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable
cause to believe such Indemnified Person\'s conduct was unlawful, if such
Indemnified Person\'s action is based on good faith reliance on the records or
books of account of the Corporation or another enterprise, or on information
supplied to such Indemnified Person by the officers of the Corporation or
another enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal
counsel for the Corporation or another enterprise or on information or records
given or reports made to the Corporation or another enterprise by an
independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert
selected with reasonable care by the Corporation or another enterprise. The
term "another enterprise" as used in this Section 5 shall mean any other
corporation or any partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise of which such Indemnified
Person is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director,
officer, employee, partner, member or agent. The provisions of this Section 5
shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances
in which an Indemnified Person may be deemed to have met the applicable
standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2 of this Article XIII, as the
case may be.

  


 

  

SECTION 6. _Expenses Payable in Advance_. Expenses, including without
limitation attorney\'s fees, incurred by an Indemnified Person in defending
any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or
proceeding shall, subject to the last sentence of this Section 6, be advanced
to such Indemnified Person by the Corporation reasonably promptly after the
receipt by the Corporation of a statement or statements from such Indemnified
Person requesting such advance or advances from time to time, whether prior to
or after final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding. Such statement
or statements shall reasonably evidence the expenses incurred by such
Indemnified Person and, if required by law at the time of such advance, shall
include or be accompanied by an undertaking by or on behalf of such
Indemnified Person to repay the amounts advanced if ultimately it should be
determined that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified
against such expenses pursuant to this Article XIII Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 6, the Board of Directors may provide
that such expenses incurred by an Indemnified Person may be so paid subject to
such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate.

  

  


 

  

 

14  

  

SECTION 7. _Nonexclusivity of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_.
The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted
pursuant to this Article XIII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may
be entitled under the Certificate, any agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such Indemnified
Person\'s official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding
such office, it being the policy of the Corporation that indemnification of
any Indemnified Person shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law. The provisions of this Article XIII shall not be deemed to
preclude the indemnification of any person who is not specified in Section 1
or 2 of this Article XIII but whom the Corporation has the power or obligation
to indemnify under the provisions of the DGCL or otherwise.

  


 

  

SECTION 8. _Insurance Contracts and Funding_. The Corporation may purchase and
maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was an Indemnified Person
against any liability asserted against such Indemnified Person and incurred by
such Indemnified Person in any such capacity, or arising out of such
Indemnified Person\'s status as such, whether or not the Corporation would
have the power or the obligation to indemnify such Indemnified Person against
such liability under the provisions of this Article XIII The Corporation may
enter into contracts with any Indemnified Person in furtherance of the
provisions of this Article XIII and may create a trust fund, grant a security
interest or use other means (including, without limitation, a letter of
credit) to ensure the payment of such amounts as may be necessary to effect
indemnification as provided in this Article XIII.

  


 

  

SECTION 9. _Certain Definitions_. For purposes of this Article XIII,
references to "the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting
corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a
constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate
existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its
directors, officers, employees or agents so that any person who is or was a
director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or
was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director,
officer, employee, partner, member or agent of another corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, employee benefit
plan or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the
provisions of this Article XIII with respect to the resulting or surviving
corporation as such person would have with respect to such constituent
corporation if its separate existence had continued. For purposes of this
Article XIII, references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on
an Indemnified Person with respect of any employee benefit plan, and
references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include any
service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which
imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee
or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or
beneficiaries, and an Indemnified Person who acted in good faith and in a
manner such Indemnified Person reasonably believed to be in the interest of
the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed
to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation" as referred to in this Article XIII.

  

  


 

  

 

15  

  

SECTION 10. _Survival of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_. The
indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant
to, this Article XIII shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or
ratified, continue as to an Indemnified Person who has ceased to be a
director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the
heirs, executors and administrators of such an Indemnified Person and shall be
applicable to any action, suit or proceeding commenced or continuing after the
adoption of this Article XIII, whether arising from acts or omissions
occurring before or after such adoption.

  


 

  

SECTION 11. _Limitation on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Article XIII to the contrary, except for proceedings to
enforce rights to indemnification pursuant to Section 3(d) of this Article
XIII, the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify any Indemnified
Person in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such
Indemnified Person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) has been approved
by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such proceeding.

  


 

  

SECTION 12. _Contract Rights_. The obligations of the Corporation under this
Article XIII to indemnify a person who is or was an Indemnified Person,
including the duty to advance expenses, shall be considered a contract between
the Corporation and such person, and no modification or repeal of any
provision of this Article XIII shall affect, to the detriment of such person,
such obligations of the Corporation in connection with a claim based on any
act or failure to act occurring before such modification or repeal.

  


 

  

SECTION 13. _Severability_. If any provision or provisions of this Article
XIII shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason
whatsoever (i) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this Article XIII (including, without limitation, all portions
of any Section of this Article XIII containing any such provision held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that are not themselves invalid, illegal or
unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and (ii)
to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Article XIII
(including, without limitation, all portions of any Section of this Article
XIII containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, that are not themselves invalid, illegal or unenforceable)
shall be construed, to the fullest extent possible, so as to give effect to
the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.

The Board of Directors shall have the power to adopt, amend or repeal these

and new Bylaws made, by the stockholders, and the stockholders may prescribe
that any Bylaw made by them shall not be altered, amended or repealed by the
Board of Directors.
