amounts in dispute and shall be determined by the Independent  Accountants at
the time the determination of such firm is rendered on the merits of the
matters submitted. The fees and disbursements of the Representatives of each
party incurred in connection with the preparation or review of the Final
Closing  Statement and preparation or review of any Notice of Disagreement,
as applicable, shall be borne by such party.

 

(g) The Buyer, on  the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, will
afford the other Party and its Representatives reasonable access, during
normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice, to the personnel,
properties, books and records of the Business  and to any other information
reasonably requested for purposes of preparing and reviewing the calculations
contemplated by this Section 2.7. Each party shall authorize its accountants
to disclose work papers generated by such accountants in  connection with
preparing and reviewing the calculations specified in this Section 2.7
provided, that such accountants shall not be obligated to make any work papers
available except in accordance with such accountants\' disclosure procedures
and  then only after the non-client party has signed an agreement relating to
access to such work papers in form and substance acceptable to such
accountants.

 

(h) The Purchase  Price shall be adjusted, upwards or downwards, as follows:

 

(i) If the Final Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price, the

Adjustment Amount, and the Buyer shall pay the Net Adjustment Amount to the
Sellers; and

 

(ii) If the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds the Final Purchase Price, the
Purchase Price shall be adjusted downwards in an amount equal to the Net

applicable, the Share Purchase Price and French Business Purchase Price in
accordance with their respective pro rata portion of the Purchase Price as
allocated in accordance with Schedule 2.10.

 

2.8 _Withholding Taxes_. The Buyer acknowledges that it does not currently
anticipate that any Taxes will be required to be withheld from amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement  (other than with respect to any amount treated as
compensation for U.S. or other applicable tax purposes or Taxes imposed by the
People\'s Republic of China on the transfer of the Purchased Shares). The
Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold  from any amounts payable or
distributable pursuant to this Agreement to the Sellers or any other Person
such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the
Code or under any provision of any

  \- 26 -

 

 


 

 

applicable Law. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld
and timely paid to the applicable Governmental Entity,  such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. Other than with
respect to any amount treated as compensation for U.S. or other applicable
tax  purposes or with respect to Taxes imposed by the People\'s Republic of
China on the capital gain arising from transfer of the Purchased Shares, the
Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide advance written
notice prior to withholding  and to cooperate (and cause its Affiliates to
cooperate) with Sellers\' efforts to reduce the amount of any such withholding
required. The Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the
Sellers with all evidence of withholding and  remittance including applicable
Tax receipts and Tax forms so as to allow the Sellers to claim applicable Tax
credits, deductions and refunds. With respect to the Taxes imposed by the
People\'s Republic of China on the capital gain arising from the  transfer of
the Purchased Shares, the Buyer agrees not to withhold provided that the
Sellers shall promptly pay such Tax to the applicable Taxing Authority and
obtain a tax clearance certificate with respect to such Tax promptly after the
Closing  (using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain within 30 days
after the Closing).

 

2.9 _Consent to Certain Assignments and Further Assurances_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement or any Related Documents to
the contrary, this Agreement and the Related Documents shall not constitute an
agreement to transfer or assign any asset, permit, claim or right if an
attempted assignment thereof, without the  consent of a third party, would
constitute a breach or other contravention under any agreement or Law to which
any of the Sellers is a party or by which it is bound, or in any way adversely
affect the rights of any of the Sellers or, upon transfer,  the Buyer under
such asset, permit, claim or right (the "Non-Assignable Assets"). The Sellers
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts (and bear their respective
costs of such efforts, provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, such efforts
shall not obligate the Sellers to pay any consent or waiver  fee or other
consideration to any such third party to secure such consent or waiver) to
obtain any consents or waivers required to assign to the Buyer any Purchased
Asset that requires the consent of a third party, without any conditions to
such  transfer or changes or modifications of terms thereunder. If any such
consent or waiver is not obtained prior to the Closing and, as a result
thereof, the Buyer shall be prevented by such third party from receiving the
rights and benefits with  respect to such Purchased Asset intended to be
transferred hereunder, or if any attempted assignment would adversely affect
the rights of any of the Sellers thereunder so that the Buyer would not in
fact receive all such rights or such Seller would  forfeit or otherwise lose
the benefit of rights that such Seller is entitled to retain, the Sellers and
the Buyer shall cooperate in any lawful and commercially reasonable
arrangement, as the Sellers and the Buyer shall agree, under which the Buyer 
would, to the extent practicable, obtain the economic claims, rights and
benefits under such asset and assume the economic burdens and obligations with
respect thereto (solely to the extent they are Assumed Liabilities) in
accordance with this  Agreement, including by subcontracting, sublicensing or
subleasing to the Buyer; provided, that all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
of such cooperation and related actions shall be paid by the Sellers. The
Sellers shall promptly pay to the Buyer  when received all monies received by
any Seller under such Purchased Asset or any claim or right or any benefit
arising thereunder and the Buyer shall promptly pay such Seller for all
Liabilities of such Seller associated with such Purchased Asset  to the
extent they are Assumed Liabilities. The Sellers shall make or complete the
transfer of any Non-Assignable Assets as soon as reasonably possible and
cooperate

  \- 27 -

 

 


 

 

with the Buyer in any other reasonable arrangement designed to provide the
Buyer the benefits of such Non-Assignable Assets,  including enforcement at
the cost and for the account of the Buyer of any and all rights of the Sellers
against any other party thereto arising out of the breach or cancellation
thereof by such other party or otherwise, and to provide for the  discharge
of any Liability associated with any such Non-Assignable Asset to the extent
such Liability constitutes an Assumed Liability. Upon the assignment of any
such Non-Assignable Asset to the Buyer, it will be deemed to be a Purchased
Asset for  purposes of this Agreement.

 

(b) At and after  Closing and without further consideration therefor, (i) the
Sellers will execute and deliver to the Buyer such further instruments and
certificates of conveyance and transfer as the Buyer may reasonably request in
order to more effectively convey  and transfer the Purchased Assets from the
Sellers to the Buyer and to put the Buyer in control of the Business; (ii) the
Buyer will execute, or will arrange the execution of, and deliver to the
Sellers, such further instruments and certificates of  assumption, novation
and release as the Sellers may reasonably request in order to effectively make
the Buyer responsible for all Assumed Liabilities and release the Sellers
therefrom to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; and (iii) 
each of the Parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all appropriate action, do or cause to be done all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law, and execute and deliver
such documents and  other papers, as may be required to carry out the
provisions of this Agreement and the Related Documents and consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by hereby and thereby. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the  extent that, following the
Closing, the Buyer and the Sellers mutually determine in good faith that any
asset or Liability that was intended to be transferred pursuant to this
Agreement was not transferred on the Closing Date (such asset or  Liability,
an "Omitted Asset" or "Omitted Liability," respectively), then, as applicable:
(A) the Sellers will promptly assign and transfer  to the Buyer or their
designated assignee, all right, title and interest in such Omitted Asset or
(B) the Buyer will promptly assume such Omitted Liability and will thereafter
pay, perform, discharge or otherwise satisfy such Omitted Liability in 
accordance with its terms. Upon execution of such assignment or assumption,
the Omitted Asset or Omitted Liability, as applicable, will automatically and
immediately be deemed to be included in and constitute a Purchased Asset or
Assumed Liability,  as applicable and without the need for any additional
consideration, and any failure to deliver an Omitted Asset or assume an
Assumed Liability at Closing will not, in and of itself, constitute a breach
of this Agreement if and to the extent such  omission is fully cured.

 

2.10 _Price Allocation_. Prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall initially
prepare an allocation of the Base ROW Purchase Price, the French Business
Purchase Price and the Share  Purchase Price (and any capitalized costs) and
the Assumed Liabilities (if any) among the Purchased Assets (other than the
Additional Equipment) and the Purchased Shares (the "Initial Allocation"),
which shall be mutually agreed to by the Parties and be attached as Schedule
2.10 to this Agreement and the Sellers and the Buyer agree to allocate and, as
applicable, to cause their relevant  Affiliates to allocate, in accordance
therewith, subject to any adjustment agreed to by the parties pursuant to this
Section 2.10. Solely with respect to Purchased Assets of Sierra US, such
allocation shall be prepared in accordance with Section  1060 of the Code and
the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (and any similar
provision of state or local Law, as appropriate). No later than 90 days after
the Closing Date, Sellers shall deliver to Buyer an allocation, prepared in
a  manner consistent with the preparation of the Initial Allocation,
reflecting any proposed adjustment to the Initial Allocation as a result of
any adjustment to the Base ROW Purchase Price,

  \- 28 -

 

 


 

 

the French Business Purchase Price and the Share Purchase Price (the "Final
Allocation"). The Final Allocation shall be final and conclusive unless the
Buyer disagrees, in good faith, with a material portion of the proposed
allocation and notifies the Sellers that it objects to one  or more items
within 30 days of the delivery of such allocation. In this event, the Sellers
and Buyer will work together in good faith to resolve the issues raised by the
allocation, provided, however, if the Buyer and the Sellers are unable to 
resolve any dispute within 10 days, such dispute shall be resolved by the
Independent Accountants which resolution shall be binding on the Parties. The
Independent Accountants shall resolve the dispute within 30 days of the matter
being referred to  them. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountants
shall be borne equally between the Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the
other hand. The Buyer and the Sellers shall report, act, and file Tax Returns
(including, but not limited to IRS  Form 8594, if applicable) in all respects
and for all purposes consistent with such allocation. No Party shall take any
position (whether in audits, Tax Returns or otherwise) that is inconsistent
with such agreed upon allocation unless required to do  so by applicable Law.

 

2.11 _Inventory Audit_.

 

(a) On a mutually  agreeable date prior to the Closing Date (such date, the
"Audit Date"), a  physical identification and count of the items of
Inventory, including the Consigned Inventory, in existence as of the Audit
Date (the "Audit Date Inventory") shall be conducted by the Sellers and Buyer
(or an accounting firm acceptable to Buyer) in a manner mutually acceptable to
the Sellers and the Buyer in order to  identify the items of Inventory to be
used to calculate the value of the Inventory included and taken in to account
in the calculation and determination of the Estimated Net Working Capital (the
"Pre-Closing Inventory Audit"). During the course of the Pre-Closing Inventory
Audit, the Buyer and its  Representatives shall have the right to participate
in and monitor the Pre-Closing Inventory Audit and shall have sufficient
access to observe, and make inquiries with regard to, the Audit Date
Inventory, and to inspect such Audit Date Inventory.

 

(b) The Sellers  further agree to prepare a statement reflecting the results
of the Pre Closing Inventory Audit (the "Inventory Calculation Statement") and
setting forth (i) the Inventory identified as comprising the Audit Date
Inventory by the Sellers and the Buyer during the Pre-Closing Inventory Audit
and the aggregate value of  the Audit Date Inventory as calculated based on
GAAP to the extent described in the Carve-out Principles (the "Audit Date
Inventory Value"); (ii) the mutually agreed upon adjustments to the Audit Date
Inventory to reflect adjustments to reflect the estimated items of Inventory
in existence as of the  time of Closing on the Closing Date as determined by
utilizing the Sellers\' normal inventory management system to roll forward the
Audit Date Inventory in order to account for any changes to the items of
Inventory comprised therein occurring during  the period from the Audit Date
through and including the time of Closing on the Closing Date (the Audit Date
Inventory as determined after giving effect to such adjustments, the
"Estimated Closing Date Inventory"); and (iii) the aggregate value of the
Inventory comprising the Estimated Closing Date  Inventory as determined in
the manner described in clause (ii) above and calculated based on GAAP to the
extent described in the Carve-out Principles.

9.1 _Proration of Taxes_.

 

(a) _Share Purchase_.

 

(i) The Buyer shall cause to be prepared and filed on a timely basis in
accordance with applicable and past practice, all Tax Returns for Sierra China
for (A) any Pre-Closing Tax Period for which Tax Returns have not been filed
as of the Closing  Date and (B) for any Straddle Period for which Tax Returns
are required to be prepared and filed (all Tax Returns referred to in clause
(A) and (B) above collectively being referred to herein as the "Stub Period
Returns"). The Sellers and the Buyer shall co-operate fully with each other
and make available to  each other in a timely fashion such data and other
information as may reasonably be required for the preparation of all Stub
Period Returns and shall preserve such data and other information until the
expiration of any applicable limitation period  under any Applicable Law with
respect to such Stub Period Returns. The Buyer shall provide to the Seller for
its review and comment a copy of the Stub Period Returns at least thirty (30)
days prior to the date such Stub Period Return is required to  be filed (or,
if any such Stub Period Return is due within 30 calendar days of the Closing
Date, reasonably in advance of filing to permit the Seller sufficient time to
review such Stub Period Return prior to the due date for filing thereof).
The  Seller shall provide its comments (if any) to each such Stub Period
Return to the Buyer within 15 calendar days of its receipt of such

  \- 66 -

 

 


 

 

Stub Period Return (or, if such Stub Period Return is due within 30 calendar
days of the Closing Date,  reasonably in advance of filing to permit the
Buyer sufficient time to consider such comments). The Parties shall act in
good faith to resolve any such disputes prior to the date on which the
relevant Stub Period Return is required to be filed. If  the Parties cannot
resolve any disputed item, the item in question shall be resolved by an
Independent Accountant. The fees and expenses of such Independent Accountant
shall be borne by the Parties in accordance with Section 2.7(f). The Sellers
shall  pay to the Buyer (A) all reasonable costs of the preparation and
filing of the Stub Period Returns with respect to the Pre-Closing Tax Periods
and (B) one-half of the costs (including reasonable allocation of internal
costs) of the preparation and  filing of the Stub Period Returns with respect
to Straddle Periods, in each case unless such amount has been accounted for in
the Net Working Capital.

 

(ii) Other than Taxes which were specifically taken into account in computing
the Net Working Capital, the Seller shall pay (A) all Taxes due with respect
to all Tax Returns for Sierra China for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and (B)
with respect to  all Tax Returns for Sierra China for any Straddle Period
such Taxes as are allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending
immediately prior to the Closing Date (as determined under Section
9.1(a)(iii)).

 

(iii) In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of Taxes allocable to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending immediately prior to the Closing Date
shall be:

 

(A) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (such as real or personal
property Taxes), the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period
(including Taxes determined on an arrears basis with respect to the Straddle
Period)  multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in the Straddle Period prior to the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire relevant
Straddle Period; and

 

(B) in the case of Taxes not described in (A) above (such as franchise Taxes,
Taxes that are based upon or related to income or receipts, or Taxes that are
based upon occupancy or imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer
or  assignment of property), the amount of such Taxes determined as if such
Tax period ended immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 

(b) _Asset Purchase_. In respect of the asset purchase and transfers contained
in this Agreement, any real property or ad valorem type Taxes applicable to
any such assets for any  Straddle Period shall be pro rated such that the
amount of such Taxes allocated to the portion of Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date shall be calculated as set out in Section 9.1(a)(iii) and the
Sellers shall pay such Taxes in relation to  the Pre-Closing Straddle Period
(unless such amounts have been accounted for in determining Net Working
Capital) and the Buyer shall be responsible for the balance of such taxes.

 

9.2 _Transfer Taxes_. (i) Buyer shall be solely responsible for payment of any
Transfer Taxes applicable to or arising from the transactions contemplated in
the French Business  Asset Purchase Agreement. (ii) Subject to Section
9.2(iii), Sellers shall be solely responsible for the

  \- 67 -

 

 


 

 

payment of the Transfer Taxes applicable to or arising from the Transactions
contemplated in the Share Purchase Agreement. (iii)  Subject to Section 9.3,
the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, shall each
bear 50% of (A) any stamp duty imposed by the People\'s Republic of China on
the transfer of the Purchased Shares, and (B) any other Transfer Taxes 
applicable to the Transactions. If required by applicable law, the Buyer shall
pay its portion of such Transfer Taxes to the Sellers at Closing and the
Sellers shall remit such Transfer Taxes to the applicable Tax Authorities. The
Buyer on the one  hand and the Sellers on the other hand, agree to jointly
file, at the Buyer\'s expense, required change of ownership documents and
similar documents or statements.

 

9.3 _GST_.

 

(a) Pursuant to  this Agreement, the Parties agree that the sale of the
Purchased Assets by Sierra will be zero-rated for GST purposes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, after Closing the Buyer shall be responsible
for any additional amounts of GST ("GST Excess"), including interest and
penalties, imposed by a Taxing Authority in respect of the purchase and sale
of the Purchased Assets pursuant hereto in excess  of amounts collected by
the Sellers from the Buyer at Closing.

 

(b) If any payment  made as a consequence of a breach, modification or
termination of this Agreement is deemed by the Excise Tax Act (Canada) in to
include GST, or is deemed by  any applicable provincial or territorial
legislation to include a similar or valued added or multi-staged Tax, the
amount of such payment shall be increased accordingly.

 

9.4 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. The Sellers and the Buyer shall provide each
other with such cooperation and information as either of them reasonably may
request of the other in  filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim
for refund, determining a liability for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes
or participating in or conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect of
Taxes or making representations to or  furnishing information to parties
subsequently desiring to purchase any part of the Purchased Assets or the
Business from the Buyer. Such cooperation and information shall include
providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof,  together with
related work papers and documents relating to rulings or other determinations
by taxing authorities. The Sellers and the Buyer shall make themselves (and
their respective employees) reasonably available on a mutually convenient
basis  to provide explanations of any documents or information provided under
this Section 9.4.

 

9.5 _Tax Refunds_.

 

Any use or income Tax refunds that are received by Sierra China after the
Closing Date that relate to Tax periods or portions  thereof ending
immediately prior to the Closing Date (excluding any refund or credit
attributable to any loss in a tax year (or portion of a Straddle Period)
beginning on or after the Closing Date applied (e.g., as a carryback) to
income in a tax  year (or portion of a Straddle Period) ending on or before
the Closing Date) shall be for the account of Sellers, and Buyer shall pay
over to Sellers any such refund within 30 days after receipt thereto.

termination in accordance with (y) Section 10.4(a), (c) or (e), or (z) Section

Required PRC Approvals have been previously received), then the Sellers shall
refund the full  amount of the Guaranteed Payment to the Buyer within five
Business Days of such termination by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to such account or accounts as may be designated in writing by the Buyer
at least two Business Days prior to  such payment date.

receive the full amount of the Guaranteed Payment from  the Buyer in the

described in Section 10.2, such payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy

the avoidance of doubt obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

10.4 _Termination_ This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing Date:

 

(a) by the written  agreement of the Buyer and the Sellers;

 

(b) by the  Sellers, on the one hand, or the Buyer, on the other hand, if the

Pacific time on or after December 31, 2020 (the "Outside Date"), unless such
date is extended by the mutual written agreement of

  \- 69 -

 

 


 

 

the Sellers and the Buyer; provided, that the termination right set out in
this Section 10.4(b) shall not be available to the  Party whose failure to
fulfill or cause to be fulfilled any obligation, covenant or agreement under
this Agreement or whose breach of any representation or warranty under this
Agreement has been the cause of the failure of the Transactions to be 
consummated prior to such date;

 

(c) by the Buyer,  if the Sellers shall have breached or failed to perform
any of their representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform would give rise to a
failure of a condition set forth in  Sections 8.1 or 8.2 and which breach or
failure to perform is incapable of being cured by the Sellers by the earlier
of (i) within twenty days after the giving of written notice by any of the
Sellers of such breach or failure and (ii) the Outside  Date; provided, that
at the time of such termination, the Buyer shall not be in material breach of
their obligations under this Agreement;

 

(d) by the  Sellers, if the Buyer shall have breached or failed to perform
any of their representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform would give rise to a
failure of a condition set forth  in Section 8.1 or 8.3 and which breach or
failure to perform is incapable of being cured by the Buyer by the earlier of
(i) within twenty days after the giving of written notice by the Buyer of such
breach or failure and (ii) the Outside Date;  provided, that at the time of
such termination, the Sellers shall not be in material breach of their
obligations under this Agreement; or

 

(e) by the  Sellers, on the one hand, or the Buyer, on the other hand, if
consummation of the Transactions would violate any nonappealable final Order
or applicable Law permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
the consummation of the  Transactions.

 

Neither the Buyer nor the Sellers may rely on the failure of any condition set
forth in Sections 8.1, 8.2 or  8.3, as the case may be, in connection with
any termination hereunder if such failure was primarily caused by such
Party\'s failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement. The Party
desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section  10.4 shall do
so by giving notice of such termination to the other Party.

 

10.5 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event  of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
10.4, then subject to Sections 10.5(b), this Agreement shall become void and
have no effect, except as provided in Section 6.11, Section 10.1, Article XI,
the Confidentiality Agreement, and  this Section 10.5.

 

(b) If this  Agreement is terminated under Sections 10.4(c) or 10.4(d), by
the Sellers, on the one hand, or the Buyer, on the other hand (the
"Terminating Party") and the right of the Terminating Party to terminate arose
because of a breach of this Agreement by the non-Termination Party (including
a breach by the  non-Termination Party resulting in a condition in favour of
such terminating Party failing to be satisfied), then the non-Termination
Party shall remain fully liable for any and all Losses sustained or incurred
by the Terminating Party directly or  indirectly as a result thereof.

(c) For the  avoidance of doubt, if this Agreement is terminated as provided
herein all information received by the Parties with respect to the other
Parties, their respective Affiliates and the Transactions shall be treated in
accordance with the  Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full
force and effect notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement.

Parties further agree that by seeking the remedies provided for in this

STRICTLY PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL

 

Project Shasta -- Put Option in respect of the French Business

 

Dear Sirs,

 

We refer to our discussions relating to the contemplated acquisition by the
Buyer from the Beneficiary of the French Business (the "Transaction").

 

Capitalised terms and expressions used and not otherwise defined in this
agreement shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the French Asset 
Purchase Agreement (as defined below).

       1  |  

Put Option

    
---|--- 
          1.1  |  

We hereby irrevocably undertake to acquire from the Beneficiary the French
Business, as further described in the French Asset Purchase Agreement, a copy
of which is attached  hereto as Schedule 1 (the "French Asset Purchase
Agreement"), under the terms and conditions set out in the French Asset
Purchase Agreement (such commitment (constituting a "promesse  unilaterale
d\'achaf"), the "Put Option"). The aggregate consideration to be  paid by the
Buyer to the Beneficiary for the French Business in the event the Put Option
is exercised shall be equal to the Purchase Price, as adjusted pursuant to the
terms of the French Asset Purchase Agreement.

    
---|--- 
          1.2  |  

By countersigning this agreement, the Beneficiary accepts the Put Option
solely as an option without any undertaking to exercise it.

    
---|--- 
          1.3  |  

The Put Option shall enter into force on the date hereof (the "Put Option
Date") and shall remain valid until the earlier of (i) the date which is five
(5) Business Days after the completion of the Consultation Process (or the
date on which it is  deemed completed in accordance with paragraph 3.4 below)
and (ii) three (3) months after the Put Option Date or any other timeframe
agreed upon by the Buyer and the Beneficiary (the "Option Period").

    
---|--- 
    

 

1  


 

       1.4  |  

The Put Option may be exercised at any time until the end of the Option Period
by written notice in the form attached hereto as Schedule 2 sent by the
Beneficiary to the Buyer in  accordance with the provisions of Clause 11.5
(Notices) of the French Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Exercise Notice").

    
---|--- 
          1.5  |  

If no Exercise Notice has been sent by the end of the Option Period, the Put
Option shall automatically lapse without any action on the part of either
party, and each party shall  be released from its obligations under this
agreement, save for the provisions of paragraphs 8 (Confidentiality), 10
(Reference to the provisions of the French Asset Purchase Agreement) and 11
(Governing Law -- Disputes) below, with no costs,  indemnity or penalties of
any kind payable to or by any party save for any prior breach of this Put
Option.

    
---|--- 
          1.6  |  

If an Exercise Notice has been sent by the end of the Option Period, we hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally undertake to sign and enter into the French
Asset Purchase  Agreement within five (5) Business Days as from receipt of
the Exercise Notice and in any event to acquire the French Business from the
Beneficiary in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in the French Asset  Purchase Agreement.

    
---|--- 
          1.7  |  

We hereby acknowledge that by countersigning this agreement, you will be only
bound by the obligations provided under paragraphs 3 (Consultation Process), 4
(Municipality Pre-emptive Right Procedure), 5 (Exclusivity), 6 (Conduct of the
French Business), 7.3 and 8 (Confidentiality) below.

    
---|--- 
          2  |  

Financing of the Transaction

    
---|--- 
    

We confirm that we have all available funding or other access to debt and
equity financing in an amount  sufficient to pay the Purchase Price and that
our obligations pursuant to this agreement and, if the Put Option is
exercised, pursuant to the French Asset Purchase Agreement, are not subject to
the availability and/or drawing of such financing.

       3  |  

Consultation Process

    
---|--- 
          3.1  |  

We acknowledge and agree that, in accordance with applicable law, before any
decision is made by the Beneficiary to enter into the French Asset Purchase
Agreement in connection  with the contemplated Transaction, the works council
(comite social et economique) of the Beneficiary (the "Works Council") shall
be consulted about the Transaction (the "Consultation Process").

    
---|--- 
          3.2  |  

By countersigning this agreement, you shall (within the limit of your powers)
and shall cause the management of the Beneficiary to, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the  Put Option Date and in any event no later than ten
(10) Business Days after the Put Option Date, convene meeting(s) of the Works
Council, and conduct diligently the Consultation Process in order to complete
the Consultation Process as soon as  reasonably practicable after the Put
Option Date and in any event prior to the end of the Option Period.

    
---|--- 
          3.3  |  

We hereby undertake to, and to cause our Affiliates to, (i) upon request from
you, provide you with any relevant document or information (including with
respect to the structure  chart of the Buyer and its Affiliates, the
financing of the Transaction and our prospects for

    
---|--- 
    

 

2  


 

 

the French Business) reasonably required for the purposes of the Consultation
Process, including in order  to answer promptly to the questions that may be
raised by the Works Council (or by any expert appointed by the Works Council
as part of the Consultation Process), provided that we shall not be required
to disclose any confidential or commercial  sensitive information pertaining
to the Buyer, its Affiliates or their respective businesses and affairs, (ii)
upon request from you, use reasonable effort to, upon reasonable notice,
participate into the Consultation Process and cause senior  representatives
of the Buyer and/or its Affiliates to attend meetings with the Works Council
organised by you as part of the Consultation Process, and, more generally,
(iii) fully cooperate with you in connection with the Consultation Process
with a  view to obtaining the opinion of the Works Council as soon as
practicable as from the Put Option Date and avoid taking any act likely to
prevent or delay the obtaining the opinion of the Works Council.

       3.4  |  

For the purpose of this agreement, the Consultation Process shall be deemed to
have been completed in relation to the contemplated Transaction if either:

    
---|--- 
          
    | (a)  |  

the Works Council has issued an opinion (either express (positive or negative)
or implied) with respect to the contemplated Transaction as documented by duly
signed minutes of  the meeting (or an excerpt thereof) during which such
opinion has been issued; or

    
---|---|--- 
          
    | (b)  |  

in the absence of any such opinion, the Works Council is deemed to have
rendered an opinion following the expiration of the period provided under
article R. 2312-6 of the French  Labor Code (or the expiry of such longer
period as may be ordered by the competent court in accordance with article L.
2312-15 of the French Labor Code).

    
---|---|--- 
          4  |  

Municipality Pre-emptive Right Procedure

    
---|--- 
          4.1  |  

We understand that the Municipality of Issy-les-Moulineaux has a pre-emptive
right on the French Business in accordance with articles L.214-1 et seq. of
the French Urban Code (Code de Pubanisme).

    
---|--- 
          4.2  |  

By countersigning this agreement, you shall (within the limit of your powers)
and shall cause the management of the Beneficiary to, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the  Put Option Date and in any event no later than ten
(10) Business Days after the Put Option Date, make, in accordance with the
terms of the French Asset Purchase Agreement, full and accurate filings with
the Municipality of Issy-les-  Moulineaux in order to obtain its waiver as
soon as possible.

Enforcement

    
---|--- 
          7.1  |  

The parties hereto expressly agree that this agreement constitutes a "promesse
unilaterale" governed  by Article 1124 of the French Civil Code (and does not
constitute an offer ("offre") governed by Article 1114 et seq. of the French
Civil Code).

    
---|--- 
          7.2  |  

We hereby give our definitive consent to the purchase of the French Business
in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the French Asset
Purchase Agreement,  the entry into force ("formation") of which requires
only the exercise of the Put Option. Consequently, our obligations under this
agreement, in particular our  undertakings to sign and enter into the French
Asset Purchase Agreement and to acquire the French Business in accordance with
the terms and subject to the conditions of the French Asset Purchase
Agreement, are irrevocable and unconditional  and may not be withdrawn for
any reason whatsoever (including before the end of the Option Period), and the
parties hereto acknowledge that, in accordance with Article 1124 of the French
Civil Code, the sale of the French Business in  accordance with the terms and
subject to the conditions of the French Asset Purchase Agreement shall be
definitive ("parfaite") upon exercise of the Put Option  (whether or not the
French Asset Purchase Agreement is executed).

    
---|--- 
          7.3  |  

Furthermore, parties hereto agree that (i) as from the Put Option Date with
respect to the Buyer, and (ii) as from the exercise of the Put Option with
respect to the Beneficiary,  their respective obligations pursuant to the
exercise of the Put Option, including the obligation to sign the French Asset
Purchase Agreement, may be enforced through specific performance (execution
forcee en nature) in accordance with Article 1217 of the French

    
---|--- 
    

 

4  


 

 

Civil Code, and that such specific performance (execution forcee en nature)
will constitute a balanced course of action falling outside the "manifest
disproportion" exclusion contained in Article 1221 of the French Civil Code.

       7.4  |  

In addition, we agree that if we fail to execute the French Asset Purchase
Agreement, the Beneficiary shall have the right to terminate the sale of the
French Business  contemplated by the French Asset Purchase Agreement by
written notice served to the Buyer, but without the need for a prior notice
("mise en demeure"), without  prejudice to all other rights and remedies
available to the Beneficiary in such event, including the right to claim
damages subject to any applicable limitation provided under Section 10 of the
MAPA.

No Set-off

    
---|--- 
    

The Buyer shall not be entitled to exercise any right of set-off or retention
right with respect to its  payment obligations of the Purchase Price under
this French Asset Purchase Agreement.

       3.5  |  

No Escrow

    
---|--- 
          
    | 3.5.1  |  

Notwithstanding the provisions of articles L.141-14 to L.141-17 of the French
Commercial Code (Code de  commerce) and article 1684 of the French Tax Code
(Code General des Impots), the Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Purchase
Price shall not be  placed into escrow.

    
---|---|--- 
          
    | 3.5.2  |  

Consequently, any and all claims lodged by any creditor, including the Taxing
Authority, of the French Business on the payment of the Purchase Price to the
extent that such  payment is not already taken into account under the MAPA
and would result in an additional payment obligation of the Buyer should be
indemnified subject to and in accordance with article VII of the MAPA.

    
---|---|--- 
          
    | 3.5.3  |  

The Parties acknowledge that they are fully aware of the consequences arising
out of their decision not to place the Purchase Price into escrow, and thus
grant a pure and simple,  complete and final release to the Persons who
drafted this French Asset Purchase Agreement.

          4  |  

Closing

    
---|--- 
          4.1  |  

The sale and purchase of the Purchased Assets and the assumption of the
Assumed Liabilities contemplated by this French Asset Purchase Agreement (the
"Closing") shall take place (i) as soon as possible, but in no event later
than fifteen (15) Business Days,  after satisfaction or, to the extent
permissible, waiver by the party or parties entitled to the benefit of the
Conditions set forth in Clause 7.1 (other than Conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to  the satisfaction or, to
the extent permissible, waiver of those Conditions at the Closing) and (ii) in
any case, simultaneously with (and subject to) the completion of the
transactions contemplated by the MAPA; or at such other time as the  Buyer
and the Seller may agree (the "Closing Date").

    
---|--- 
          4.2  |  

Each Party shall not be obliged to complete this French Asset Purchase
Agreement and may by written notice to the other Party terminate this French
Asset Purchase Agreement  without liability on its part in connection with
such termination, if the MAPA and the French Asset Purchase Agreement are not
capable of being completed simultaneously.

       4.3  |  

On the Closing Date:

    
---|--- 
          
    | 4.3.1  |  

for the purpose of Tax registration of the transfer of the French Business,
the Seller and the Buyer shall execute in six (6) original copies a
reiterative act ("acte reiteratif"), in the form reasonably satisfactory to
the Parties ("Reiterative Act").

    
---|---|--- 
          
    | 4.3.2  |  

the Seller shall deliver to the Buyer a document presenting the monthly
turnovers (chifres d\'affaires  mensuels) figures achieved between 31
December 2019 and the month preceding the month of the transfer of the French
Business, in accordance with Article L141-2 of the French Commercial Code
(Code de Commerce);

    
---|---|--- 
          
    | 4.3.3  |  

the Seller shall deliver or make available to the Buyer those Purchased Assets
which are capable of transfer by delivery, and shall permit the Buyer to enter
into and take  possession of the French Business; and

    
---|---|--- 
          
    | 4.3.4  |  

the Buyer shall be the owner of the French Business and takeover said French
Business as at the Closing Date. The Buyer shall support the risks and the
Assumed Liabilities  relating to the ownership and the operation of the
French Business as from the Closing Date.

    
---|---|--- 
          5  |  

Consent to certain assignments and further assurances

    
---|--- 
          5.1  |  

Notwithstanding anything in this French Asset Purchase Agreement to the
contrary, this French Asset Purchase Agreement shall not constitute an
agreement to transfer or assign any  asset, permit, claim or right if an
attempted assignment thereof, without the consent of a third party, would
constitute a breach or other contravention under any agreement or Law to which
the Seller is a party or by which it is bound, or in  any way adversely
affect the rights of the Seller or, upon transfer, the Buyer under such asset,
permit, claim or right (the "Non-Assignable Assets"). The Seller  shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts (and bear its costs of such efforts,
provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, such efforts shall not obligate the
Seller to pay any consent or waiver fee or other consideration to any such
third  party to secure such consent or waiver) to obtain any consents or
waivers required to assign to the Buyer any Purchased Asset that requires the
consent of a third party, without any conditions to such transfer or changes
or modifications of  terms thereunder. If any such consent or waiver is not
obtained prior to the Closing and, as a result thereof, the Buyer shall be
prevented by such third party from receiving the rights and benefits with
respect to such Purchased Asset  intended to be transferred hereunder, or if
any attempted assignment would adversely affect the rights of the Seller
thereunder so that the Buyer would not in fact receive all such rights or the
Seller would forfeit or otherwise lose the  benefit of rights that the Seller
is entitled to retain, the Seller and the Buyer shall cooperate in any lawful
and commercially reasonable arrangement, as the Seller and the Buyer shall
agree, under which the Buyer would, to the extent  practicable, obtain the
economic claims, rights and benefits under such asset and assume the economic
burdens and obligations with respect thereto (solely to the extent they are
Assumed Liabilities) in accordance with this French Asset  Purchase
Agreement, including by subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing to the
Buyer; provided, that all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of such
cooperation and related actions shall be paid by the Seller. The Seller shall
promptly pay  to the Buyer when received all monies received by the Seller
under such Purchased Asset or any claim or right or any benefit arising
thereunder, and the Buyer shall promptly pay the Seller for all Liabilities of
the Seller associated with  such Purchased Asset to the extent they are
Assumed Liabilities. The Seller shall make or complete the transfer of any
Non-

    
---|--- 
    

 

16  


 

 

Assignable Assets as soon as reasonably possible and cooperate with the Buyer
in any other reasonable  arrangement designed to provide the Buyer the
benefits of such Non-Assignable Assets, including enforcement at the cost and
for the account of the Buyer of any and all rights of the Seller against any
other party thereto arising out of the breach or  cancellation thereof by
such other party or otherwise, and to provide for the discharge of any
Liability associated with any such Non-Assignable Asset to the extent such
Liability constitutes an Assumed Liability. Upon the assignment of any such 
Non-Assignable Asset to the Buyer, it will be deemed to be a Purchased Asset
for purposes of this French Asset Purchase Agreement.

       5.2  |  

At and after Closing and without further consideration therefor, (i) the
Seller will execute and deliver to the Buyer such further instruments and
certificates of conveyance and  transfer as the Buyer may reasonably request
in order to more effectively convey and transfer the Purchased Assets from the
Seller to the Buyer and to put the Buyer in control of the French Business;
(ii) the Buyer will execute, or will  arrange the execution of, and deliver
to the Seller, such further instruments and certificates of assumption,
novation and release as the Seller may reasonably request in order to
effectively make the Buyer responsible for all Assumed  Liabilities and
release the Seller therefrom to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law; and (iii) each of the Parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, do or cause to be  done
all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law, and execute
and deliver such documents and other papers, as may be required to carry out
the provisions of this French Asset Purchase Agreement and consummate and
make  effective the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, to the extent that, following the Closing, the
Buyer and the Seller mutually determine in good faith that any asset or
Liability that was  intended to be transferred pursuant to this French Asset
Purchase Agreement was not transferred on the Closing Date (such asset or
Liability, an "Omitted Asset" or "Omitted Liability," respectively), then, as
applicable: (A) the Seller will promptly assign and transfer to the Buyer or
its designated assignee, all right, title and interest in such Omitted Asset
or (B) the Buyer will promptly assume such  Omitted Liability and will
thereafter pay, perform, discharge or otherwise satisfy such Omitted Liability
in accordance with its terms. Upon execution of such assignment or assumption,
the Omitted Asset or Omitted Liability, as applicable,  will automatically
and immediately be deemed to be included in and constitute a Purchased Asset
or Assumed Liability, as applicable and without the need for any additional
consideration, and any failure to deliver an Omitted Asset or assume  an
Assumed Liability at Closing will not, in and of itself, constitute a breach
of this French Asset Purchase Agreement if and to the extent such omission is
fully cured.

    
---|--- 
          5.3  |  

For the sake of clarity and pursuant to article 1327-2 of the French Civil
Code (Code civil), the  Parties expressly waive the joint and several
liability (solidarite) for the payment of the Assumed Liabilities. As a
consequence, the Buyer hereby irrevocably  (i) accepts to bear all the
Assumed Liabilities and release the Seller therefrom; and (ii) undertakes to
hold harmless and indemnify the Seller on a euro for euro basis on an ongoing
basis for any and all amounts paid by the Seller in  connection with Assumed
Liabilities.

Employees

    
---|--- 
          6.1  |  

The Parties acknowledge and agree that the French Business constitutes an
autonomous economic entity ("entite  economique autonome") triggering the
application of the provisions of article L. 1224-1 of the French Labour Code
(Code du travail). As a result, the  Parties acknowledge and agree that the
transfer of the French Business constitutes a transfer of an undertaking
within the meaning of French Law and that accordingly, the employment
agreements of the employees employed in France who are  wholly or mainly
assigned at Closing Date to the French Business set out in _Schedule 6.1_ (the
"Transferred Employees") shall be deemed automatically transferred upon
Closing Date from the French Business and the Seller to the Buyer.

    
---|--- 
          6.2  |  

_Schedule 6.1_ hereto sets forth an accurate and up-to-date list of the
Transferred Employees as  at the date hereof. The list of Transferred
Employees may be updated to include those employees who are added to the list
by the Seller between the date of the Put Option Agreement and Closing Date as
a result of a new hire relating to the  French Business but exclude those who
are removed from the list by the Seller between the date of the Put Option
Agreement and Closing Date as a result of the exit of a Transferred Employee
from the Seller\'s headcount, in each case with the  prior agreement of the
Buyer.

    
---|--- 
          6.3  |  

The Parties shall co-operate to produce a letter to be sent to the Transferred
Employees before the Closing Date, informing them on the automatic transfer of
their employment

    
---|--- 
    

contracts to the Buyer in application of article L.1224-1 of the French Labour
Code.

       6.4  |  

The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Transferred Employees will no
longer be considered as employees of the Seller or the Sierra Entities on and
after the Closing Date.

the MAPA having become wholly unconditional in accordance with its terms.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Seller and the

    | 7.4.4  |

Business and (ii) in taking such actions or making  any such filings,
furnishing information required in connection therewith and seeking timely to

    | 7.4.5  |  

No Party will take any action that would have the effect of delaying,

For greater certainty, the Seller shall control and lead all communications
and strategy in connection with obtaining the Municipality Waiver but shall

shall offer commercially reasonable commitments to secure all Permits, Orders

commercially sensitive information relating to such disclosing Party, its
Affiliates, or their respective businesses, except to the extent reasonably

right of the Seller or the Buyer to cause the transactions contemplated hereby
to be consummated. The Parties further agree that by seeking the remedies
provided for  in this Clause 11.7.2, a Party shall not in any respect waive
its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to a Party
under this French Asset Purchase Agreement in the event that this French Asset
Purchase Agreement has been  terminated or in the event that the remedies
provided for in this Clause 11.7.2 are not available or otherwise are not
granted. Each Party further acknowledges and agrees that any specific
performance action (execution forcee en nature) in respect of this French
Asset Purchase Agreement will constitute a balanced course of action falling
outside the "manifest disproportion" exclusion contained in article  1221 of
the French Civil Code (Code civil).

pursuant to which Sellers have agreed to sell to Buyer and Buyer has agreed to
purchase from Sellers, the Business.

    
---|--- 
          B.  |  

As a condition and inducement for the Parties' willingness to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the MAPA, Buyer and Sierra are entering into this
Agreement to provide each  other with the services as described herein.

    
---|--- 
    

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and promises  contained herein, the
adequacy and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereto
agree as follows.

 

ARTICLE 1 
  INTERPRETATION

 

1.1 Definitions. Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, capitalized
terms will have the meanings given to them in the MAPA. Words or abbreviations
that have  well known technical industry or trade meanings and are not
otherwise defined herein or in the MAPA are used in accordance with their
recognized meanings.

 

1.2 Construction. The division of this Agreement into Sections and the
insertion of headings are for convenience of reference only and do not affect
the construction  or interpretation of this Agreement. The terms "hereof",
"hereunder" and similar expressions refer to this Agreement and not to any
particular Section or other portion hereof. Unless something in the subject
matter or context is inconsistent  therewith, references herein to Sections
and Schedules are to Sections of and Schedules to this Agreement. In this
Agreement, words importing the singular number only include the plural and
vice versa and words importing any gender include all  genders. The word
"including" means "including without limitation". A definition applies to
other forms of the word. Except where otherwise expressly provided, all
references to currency herein are to the lawful money of the United States.

 

1.3 Schedule. All Schedules to this Agreement are incorporated by reference
and form part of this Agreement. The following are the Schedules as of the
Effective Date:

 

Schedule A -- Seller Services

 

Schedule B -- Buyer Services

     


 

 

ARTICLE 2 
  TRANSITION SERVICES

 

2.1 Services. This Agreement will govern services that:

       
    | (a)  |  

are required by Buyer (or its Affiliates) for an interim period, as (i) set
out in Schedule A to this Agreement or (ii) added pursuant to Section 2.5
(collectively the "Seller Services") to be performed by Sierra (or its
Affiliates); and

    
---|---|--- 
          
    | (b)  |  

are required by Seller (or its Affiliates) for an interim period, as (i) set
out in Schedule B to this Agreement or (ii) added pursuant to Section 2.5
(collectively the "Buyer Services") to be performed by Buyer (or its
Affiliates); and

    
---|---|--- 
    

The Seller Services and the Buyer Services are collectively the "Services" and
each, a "Service" and the Schedules setting out the Services are the "Service
Schedules".

 

2.2 Services Generally (Sierra). Except as otherwise provided herein, during
the Service Term (as defined in Section 3.1), Sierra will provide, or cause to
be  provided, to Buyer and its Affiliates the applicable Seller Services.

 

2.3 Services Generally (Buyer). Except as otherwise provided herein, during
the Service Term (as defined in Section 3.1), Buyer will provide, or cause to
be provided,  to Sierra and its Affiliates the applicable Buyer Services.

 

2.4 Cooperation. Buyer, on the one hand, and Sierra, on the other hand, will,
and will cause their respective employees to, reasonably cooperate and assist
with any  reasonable requests with employees of the other to the extent
required for effective delivery of the Services. In addition, each Party will
name a point of contact who will be responsible for the day-to-day
implementation of this Agreement,  including attempted resolution of any
issues that may arise during the performance of any Party's obligations
hereunder.

 

2.5 Additional Services. If a service that is required by a Party to conduct
its business during the Service Term is not specifically identified in this
Agreement, but  is reasonably necessary to provide for an orderly transition
of the Business from Sellers to Buyer then at a Party's reasonable request the
Parties will negotiate in good faith, with a view to the provision of such
additional service, the terms and  conditions (as mutually agreed by the
Parties) for the additional service in a new Service Schedule. Each such
Service Schedule will be prepared jointly by the Parties and be duly executed
as an amendment to this Agreement in accordance with  Section 8.9.

 

 

\- 2 -  


 

 

2.6 Services Exceptions and Limitations. Neither Party will be obligated to
provide any Services to the extent the performance of such Service would
require a Party to  violate any applicable Law. In providing the Services, a
Party will not be obligated to, unless specifically set out in a Service
Schedule or the MAPA or to the extent the costs associated therewith are not
reimbursed by the other Party: (a)  maintain the employment of any specific
employee; (b) purchase, lease or license any additional equipment, software or
technology; (c) pay any costs related to the transfer of the Business to
Buyer; or (d) pay any costs related to securing any  alternate supplier of
Services; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 2.6 will excuse a
Party from fulfilling its obligations under the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. Unless otherwise provided in the relevant Services Schedule,  any
such costs to be reimbursed by a Party receiving the relevant Services will
require its prior approval.

 

2.7 Precedence. In the event of a conflict between (a) the provisions of the
main body of this Agreement and the provisions of any of the Service
Schedules, the  provisions of the main body of this Agreement will prevail
provided that the provisions of the applicable Service Schedule will prevail
over the provisions of the main body of this Agreement to the extent the
Service Schedule expressly refers to  the provisions in the main body of this
Agreement over which it prevails; or (b) the provisions of this Agreement and
the provisions of the MAPA as it relates to the Services hereunder, the
provisions of this Agreement will prevail.

 

ARTICLE 3 
  TERM AND TERMINATION.

 

3.1 Term and Termination. The term of this Agreement will commence on the
Effective Date and will remain in effect until the earlier of (a) the
expiration or  termination of all Service Schedules, and (b) 365 days after
the Effective Date, unless earlier terminated or extended in accordance with
this Agreement. The term of each Service in the Service Schedules will be from
the Effective Date (unless  another commencement date is stated therein)
until the expiration of the duration stated therein (a "Service Term"), unless
such Service is earlier terminated  (in whole or in part) upon ten (10) days
prior written notice by the Party receiving such Service to the Party
providing such Service, or in accordance with the terms provided therein. This
Agreement may be extended by the Parties in their sole  discretion, by
agreement in writing, either in whole or in part with respect to one or more
of the Services; provided, however, that such extension will only apply to the
Services for which this Agreement was extended.

 

3.2 Survival. Upon termination of this Agreement in its entirety, all
obligations of the Parties shall terminate, except for the provisions of
Article 4 (with respect  to fees accrued and taxes incurred prior to
termination), Section 6.2, and, in their entirety, Article 5, Article 7, and
Article 8 and this Section 3.2, which will survive termination or expiration
of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  in the event of any
termination with respect to one or more, but less than all Service Schedules,
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect with respect to any
Service Schedules not terminated.

ARTICLE 4 
  FEES AND PAYMENT.

 

4.1 Charges for Services. In consideration for the Services provided by Sierra
and Buyer under this Agreement, each Party will pay to, or cause to be paid
to, the  other Party (or its designated Affiliate) the fees of providing the
Services as defined in the applicable Service Schedule.

 

4.2 Payment Terms. Unless otherwise provided in the Service Schedule, each
Party will send to the other Party monthly invoices showing charges (including
as a separate  line item any applicable Sales Taxes (defined below) that the
provider of the Services is responsible for collecting and remitting to the
applicable taxing authority) for the specific Services provided by the Buyer
or Sierra, as the case may be.  Such invoices will be accompanied by
reasonable documentation or other reasonable explanation supporting such
charges. Unless otherwise provided in the Service Schedule, invoices will be
due and payable within thirty (30) days after receipt. If a  Party disputes
the amount of an invoice, that Party shall deliver a written statement to the
other Party's representative designated pursuant to Section 2.4 before the
payment due date listing all disputed items and describing in reasonable
detail  the reasons it disputes each item. Any amounts not disputed shall be
deemed accepted and shall be paid (despite disputes on other items). The
Parties shall seek to resolve all such disputes expeditiously and in good
faith. If the Parties have not  resolved the dispute within 30 days of the
applicable Party's receipt of written statement, the dispute shall be resolved
in accordance with Section 8.3.

 

4.3 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, each Party will be
responsible for the expenses (including fees and expenses of legal advisors,
accountants and  other professional advisors) incurred by it and its
Affiliates, respectively, in connection with the negotiation and settlement of
this Agreement and the performance of its obligations hereunder. Unless
otherwise indicated, all amounts payable  under this Agreement will be in
United States Dollars.

 

4.4 Taxes. The fees payable by Buyer and Sierra pursuant to this Article 4 are
exclusive of any federal, state, municipal, or other taxes, duties, excises,
tariffs,  fees, assessments or levies now or hereinafter imposed on the
performance or delivery of Seller Services, Buyer Services or direct costs.
Any sales, use, goods and services, harmonized sales or value-added taxes
(collectively, the "Sales Taxes"), duties, excises, tariffs, fees, assessments
or levies imposed on the performance or delivery (in each case for the
avoidance of doubt excluding any  taxes imposed on or measured by income) of:
(a) Services provided by Sierra to Buyer will be the responsibility of Buyer;
and (b) Services provided by Buyer to Sierra will be the responsibility of
Sierra. Either Party receiving the Services may  deduct or withhold from any
payments to the other Party any amount required to be withheld or deducted in
accordance with applicable Law. The Parties shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate and do all such acts and to execute  all such
documents as will enable them to eliminate or reduce any tax payable or
withholdable with respect to payments made pursuant to this Agreement.

ARTICLE 5 
  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND CONFIDENTIALITY.

 

5.1 Existing Ownership Rights Unaffected. This Agreement will not affect the
ownership of any intellectual or proprietary rights that may arise under law
or as  allocated in the MAPA or the License Agreement. Unless otherwise
provided by the License Agreement, neither Party will gain, by virtue of this
Agreement, any rights of ownership of any intellectual or proprietary rights
owned by the other Party (or  its Affiliates).

 

5.2 Proprietary Notices. No Party will remove any copyright notices,
proprietary markings, trademarks or trade names from the other Party's
software or documentation.

 

5.3 Confidentiality. The Parties hereby expressly incorporate the provisions
of the Confidentiality Agreement into this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE 6 
  PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.

 

6.1 Performance Standards. Specific performance standards for a Service may be
set out in the corresponding Service Schedule. Where none are set out, the
performing  Party will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the
Services in substantially the same manner as provided to, or provided on
behalf of, the Business prior to the date of the MAPA and Sierra or Buyer, as
the case may be, will exercise  similar care and skill as it exercises in
performing similar services for itself and with similar knowledge and
expertise as it exercises in performing services for itself. Each Party
receiving Services will provide sufficient resources and timely  decisions,
approvals and acceptances in order that the Party providing such Services may
accomplish its obligations hereunder in a timely manner.

 

6.2 Disclaimer of Warranties. EXCEPT AS  SPECIFICALLY SET OUT OR REFERENCED
IN THIS AGREEMENT, THERE ARE NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR CONDITIONS OF
EITHER PARTY, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, REGARDING ANY MATTER,
INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF  MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON INFRINGEMENT AND THOSE ARISING BY STATUTE OR
OTHERWISE IN LAW OR FROM A COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. Nothing herein
will affect the representations and warranties of the Parties under  the
MAPA.

 

6.3 Good Faith Cooperation. The Parties will use good faith efforts to
cooperate with each other in all matters relating to the provision and receipt
of Services. The  parties will maintain reasonable documentation related to
the Services and cooperate with each other in making such information
available as needed.

Any and all disputes or controversies arising under this Agreement ("Dispute")

    | (d)  |  

The Arbitrators will have the authority to grant urgent, interim and permanent

including in respect of the misuse of its Confidential Information.

    
---|---|--- 
    

8.4 Relationship Between the Parties. Nothing contained in this Agreement will
be deemed or construed by the Parties hereto, or by any third party, to create
the  relationship of partnership or joint venture or a relationship of
principal and agent, employer-employee, master-servant, or franchisor-
franchisee between the Parties and no provision contained herein will be
deemed to create any relationship  between the Parties hereto other than the
relationship of independent contractors. No employee, contractor or
subcontractor of either Party shall be deemed to be an employee, contractor or
subcontractor of the other Party, it being fully understood  and agreed that
no employee of either Party is entitled to benefits or compensation from the
other Party. Each Party is wholly responsible for withholding and payment of
all applicable federal, state and local and other payroll taxes with respect 
to its own employees, including any contributions from them as required by
Law.

 

8.5 Subcontracting. Either Party may engage subcontractors to perform all or

engages  subcontractors to perform similar services for itself; (b) any such
subcontractor agrees in writing to be bound by confidentiality obligations on
terms no less favorable to the other Party than those contained in this
Agreement, and (c) the  subcontracting Party remains responsible for the
performance of such subcontractor. As used in this Agreement, "subcontractor"

\- 7 -  


 

 

8.6 Force Majeure. Neither Party will be liable for any failure or delay in
performing any of its obligations under this Agreement so long as and to the
extent such  failure or delay is due to any act of God or a public enemy or
terrorist; any act of any military, civil or regulatory authority; any fire,
flood, earthquake, storm, or other similar natural disaster; any epidemic or
public health emergency or any  similar cause beyond its reasonable control
(each such cause, an "Event of Force Majeure"); provided, however, that the
affected Party will give the other  Party prompt written notice of such
inability and the reasons therefor, and will use commercially reasonable
efforts (including implementation of reasonable business continuity and
disaster recovery plans) to resume performance of its obligations  hereunder
with the least possible delay. This applicable Service Term for any Service so
suspended shall be automatically extended for a period of time equal to the
time lost by reason of suspension. The affected Party will give the other
Party  prompt notice of the cessation of the Event of Force Majeure. If an
Event of Force Majeure causes a material failure or delay in the performance
of any Service for more than thirty (30) consecutive days, the Party receiving
such Services may  immediately terminate the applicable Service, upon written
notice to the other Party.

 

8.7 Notices. All notices, requests, demands and other communications hereunder
will be in writing and will be deemed to have been given: (a) when delivered
personally,  (b) the next Business Day, if sent by a nationally-recognized
overnight delivery service (unless the records of the delivery service
indicate otherwise), or (c) upon delivery if sent by electronic mail or
facsimile during a Business Day (or on the  next Business Day if sent by
electronic mail or facsimile after the close of normal business hours or on a
non-Business Day):

8.10 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is determined by any
court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision
will be  severed from this Agreement and the remaining provisions will
continue in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to either of the  Parties.

of this Agreement, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
