ii PUT OPTION AGREEMENT

 

This Put Option Agreement (together with the Exhibits attached hereto, this
"Agreement") is made as of the 24th day of June, 2014, between IMS HEALTH
INCORPORATED, a corporation organized under the Laws of Delaware having its
registered office located 83 Wooster Heights Road, Danbury, Connecticut
060810, USA, registered with EIN number 06-1506026 (the "Offeror"), and
Cegedim SA (the "Beneficiary"), a _soci ete anonyme_ organized under the Laws
of France, having its registered office located 127/137 rue dAguesseau,
registered with the Registry of Commerce of Nanterre under number 350 422
622, acting on its behalf and on behalf of the Seller Parties, for which it
will procure ( _porte-fort_ ) performance. Offeror and Beneficiary are
referred to herein individually as "Party" or collectively as "Parties".

WITNESSETH:

 

WHEREAS, Beneficiary is, amongst other activities, directly and through its
direct and indirect Subsidiaries, engaged in the Business.

 

WHEREAS, Offeror wishes to purchase and acquire, directly and through certain
of its Subsidiaries, the Business by purchasing and acquiring the shares in
the Sold Companies and certain other assets, and assuming certain liabilities
from Beneficiary (the "Contemplated Transaction"), each in accordance with the
terms and subject to the conditions of the draft Master Acquisition Agreement
attached as _Exhibit A_ hereto (the "Draft MAA").

WHEREAS, the purpose of this Put Option Agreement (the "Agreement") is to set
forth the terms and conditions under which Offeror is granting to Beneficiary
a firm, irrevocable, unconditional and binding promise to acquire the Business
from Beneficiary, at Beneficiarys sole option in accordance with the
procedures set out below and the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in the Draft MAA.

NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

INTERPRETATION

Capitalized terms used herein and that are not otherwise defined shall have
the meaning ascribed to such terms in the Draft MAA.

ARTICLE II

 

PUT OPTION

Under the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
Offeror hereby irrevocably and unconditionally grants to Beneficiary a binding
promise to purchase and acquire directly or through its Designated Transferees
(the "Put Option"), which Beneficiary may at its sole discretion elect to
exercise, the Business by purchasing and acquiring the shares in the Sold
Companies and certain other assets, and assuming certain liabilities from
Beneficiary, each in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in the Draft MAA.

 



1 Beneficiary accepts the benefit of the Put Option as an option solely, without
hereby undertaking to exercise it. It is expressly agreed by Offeror that
this acceptance shall not constitute, in any manner whatsoever, an undertaking
by Beneficiary to sell to Offeror any of the shares in the Sold Companies and
those certain other assets as set forth in the Draft MAA, but that it shall
only constitute an option to Beneficiary, exercisable in its sole discretion.

Offeror hereby expressly acknowledges that Beneficiary would not have
announced the Contemplated Transaction if Offeror was not irrevocably and
unconditionally bound to purchase the Business under the terms of this
Agreement and the Draft MAA and consequently (i) irrevocably undertakes not
to withdraw, revoke or modify the Put Option in any respect whatsoever without
Beneficiarys prior written consent and (ii) agrees to specific performance
measures.

---|---|--- 
 



   1.2 | Designated Transferees; Seller Parties 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Purchaser shall be entitled to identify in writing one or
more of its Subsidiaries (the "Designated Transferees") which shall purchase
and acquire any or all of the Shares and the Sold Assets and/or assume any or
all of the Assumed Liabilities _in lieu_ of Purchaser, by providing Seller
with a written notification specifying the Designated Transferee(s) (including
their registered office, identification number and all relevant

---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that Purchaser
(i) shall remain liable for all its obligations arising under this Agreement,
(ii) hereby irrevocably guarantees the fulfillment of any liabilities and
obligations of the Designated Transferee(s) arising out of or in connection

rights and remedies, if any, on behalf of any other Seller Parties. 
---|---|--- 
 



2 ---|---

local Law. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | The sale and transfer of the Sold Assets and the assumption
of the Assumed Liabilities shall be implemented pursuant to asset purchase and
transfer agreements to be executed between the relevant Seller Parties
and Purchaser or a respective Designated Transferee (the "Local APAs";

substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit 1.3(b)_, subject only to
adjustments to reflect the mandatory requirements of local Law. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and a
Local Transfer Agreement (in the form actually executed), the provisions of
this Agreement shall prevail. Purchaser shall not exercise, and shall procure
that no Designated Transferee exercises, any rights, or makes any claim,
under any of the Local Transfer Agreement other than the claim for the
transfer of title to the relevant Shares and Sold Assets or its registration
and for the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities. Seller shall not exercise,
and shall procure that the relevant Seller Parties do not exercise, any
rights, or make any claim, under any of the Local Transfer Agreements other
than the claim for payment of the purchase price as set forth in any such
agreement. 
---|---|--- 



   1.4 | Purchase Price 
---|--- 



     | (a) | The purchase price payable by Purchaser as consideration for
the sale and transfer of the Shares and the Sold Assets and for the assumption
of the Assumed Liabilities shall be an amount of 
---|---|--- 
 

EUR 385,000,000

(in words: Euro three hundred eighty-five million)



     | (i) | plus the Cash (it being specified that item 1(a) of the
definition of "Cash" in _Exhibit 1.4(b)_ shall not exceed the excess of (i)

facilities); 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | minus the Financial Debt; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | minus the Straddle Period Liability; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | plus the amount by which the Net Working Capital exceeds
the Target Net Working Capital, or minus the amount by which the Net Working
Capital falls short of the Target Net Working Capital; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (v) | minus the Revenue Adjustment Amount, if any 
---|---|--- 

(such amount as determined in accordance with this Section 1.4(a), the

3 the line items set out in _Exhibit 1.4(b)_ for the Business, in each case
existing at the Closing Date, determined on the basis of the Closing Date
Accounts and to the extent not included in the definition of Net Working
Capital. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | "Net Working Capital" shall mean the balance of the line
items set out in _Exhibit 1.4(c)_ for the Business, in each case existing at
the Closing Date, determined on the basis of the Closing Date Accounts and to
the extent not included in the definition of Cash or Financial Debt. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | In the event that the sum of the Adjusted 2014 Revenue of
the Business and the Net Proceeds amounts to less than EUR 415,000,000 but not
less than EUR 390,000,000, the "Revenue Adjustment Amount" shall be equal to
the difference between EUR 415,000,000 and the sum of the Adjusted 2014
Revenue of the Business and the Net Proceeds. In the event that the sum of the
Adjusted 2014 Revenue of the Business and the Net Proceeds amounts to less
than EUR 390,000,000, the "Revenue Adjustment Amount" shall be equal to the
sum of (i) EUR 25,000,000, and (ii) 1.5 (in words: one point five) times the
difference between EUR 390,000,000 and the sum of the Adjusted 2014 Revenue
of the Business and the Net Proceeds. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | No item shall be taken into account twice for the purposes
of calculations made in accordance with this Section 1.4 and, to the extent
taken into account in the determination of the Purchase Price, it shall not
be taken into account in the determination of any Losses in accordance with
Article XI. 
---|---|--- 



   1.5 | Estimated Purchase Price 
---|--- 

No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
provide to Purchaser a good faith estimate of the Purchase Price (taking into
account (i) the Interim Revenue Adjustment Amount if not all Disposals have
been completed prior to such date, or (ii) the Revenue Adjustment Amount if
all Disposals are completed by such date) calculated in accordance with
Section 1.4 (the "Estimated Purchase Price") together with the estimated
figures for the respective line items underlying such calculation. On the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the Estimated
Purchase Price.



   1.6 | Closing Date Accounts and Adjustment of Estimated Purchase Price 
---|--- 



     | (a) |

As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, but not later than
ninety (90) Business Days thereafter, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to
Seller (i) combined financial statements of the Business including (x) a
combined balance sheet of the Business as of the Closing Date, and (y) a
combined revenue statement of the Business as of the Closing Date
(the "Closing Date Accounts"), and (ii) on the basis of the Closing Date
Accounts, its reasonably detailed calculations of the Cash, the Financial
Debt, the Net Working Capital, the Disposed Revenue for each Disposed
Business, the  

---|---|--- 
 



4  Interim Revenue Adjustment Amount or the Revenue Adjustment Amount, as the
case may be, the Straddle Period Liability (including the details of
calculation of each relevant Tax) and the resulting adjustments to the
Estimated Purchase Price (together with supporting documentation) (the
"Financial Information"). The Closing Date Accounts shall be prepared in
accordance with (i) IFRS and (ii) the accounting policies attached as
_Exhibit 1.6(a)_ to the extent they are compliant with IFRS, in each case
consistent with past practice of the Business (the "Accounting Principles").
Upon reasonable advance notice, Seller shall grant Purchaser reasonable
access to all relevant documents and information in possession of the Seller
Parties that are required for Purchaser to prepare the Closing Date Accounts,
to the extent such documents and information are not available to Purchaser
or the Companies.



     | (b) | If and to the extent Seller disagrees with the Closing Date
Accounts and/or the Financial Information, Seller may, within ninety (90)
Business Days after receipt of the Closing Date Accounts, deliver a notice
to Purchaser setting forth its disagreement with the Closing Date Accounts
and/or the Financial Information ("Notice of Disagreement"). Any such Notice
of Disagreement shall specify, in reasonable detail, those items or amounts as
to which Seller disagrees and the reasons for such disagreement together with
the underlying documentation, and Seller shall be deemed to have accepted all
other items or amounts contained in the Closing Date Accounts and the
Financial Information delivered by Purchaser pursuant to Section 1.6(a). If
and to the extent Seller has delivered a Notice of Disagreement, Sections
1.6(c) through 1.6(i) shall apply. Purchaser (i) expressly acknowledges and
agrees that Seller may be assisted by its Representatives in its review of
the Closing Date Accounts and/or the Financial Information and in its
drafting, as the case may be, of any Notice of Disagreement, and (ii) shall,
and shall procure that the Designated Transferees will, upon Sellers
request, without undue delay, afford Seller and Sellers Representatives
reasonable access to all applicable documents, books, records, data, working
papers, files, other information and Purchasers Representatives which were
involved in the preparation of the Closing Date Accounts and the Financial
Information. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | The Parties shall, during the twenty (20) Business Day
period following the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement (or any other period

Authority to dispose of any portion of the Business to a third party as part

the Business required by any Antitrust Authority to be disposed, the

Disposal, to the extent these guidelines are consistent with the remedies
imposed by the relevant Antitrust Authority. 
---|---|---

Party shall issue or cause the publication of any other press release or

Exchange) to be made by the Party proposing to issue the same, such Party

made available to it or any of its Representatives in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Ancillary Agreements shall be

consent of the other Party (except (i) for those matters disclosed in the
press release referred to in Section 7.8 in the form attached in _Exhibit
7.8_, (ii) for purposes of the Merger Clearances, (iii) for any press
releases, filings, disclosure or announcements required by Law, including
requirements by the AMF, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, NYSE
Euronext or the New York Stock Exchange, and (iv) for any filings or

shall: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | limit or otherwise restrict the applicability of any other
confidentiality or similar provisions included in any of the Ancillary
Agreements or any other agreement between the Parties, or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | prevent Purchaser to use and employ confidential
information relating to the Business and the Companies to carry out the
Business from Closing, or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | prevent a Party from otherwise disclosing confidential
information to its Representatives, finance providers and rating agencies
bound by a confidentiality obligation on a need to know basis. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7.9 or any
other provision of this Agreement, the Parties acknowledge and agree that all
information disclosed or otherwise discovered by the Parties pursuant to
this Section 7.9(a) shall be used solely for the purpose of evaluating or
implementing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that no such
information shall be used for any other purpose. Section 7.9(a) shall remain
unaffected and prevail over this Section 7.9(b). 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | In the event that any press release or announcement is
required by Law (including requirements by the AMF, the US Securities and
Exchange Commission, NYSE Euronext or the New York Stock Exchange) to be made
by a Party, Section 7.8 shall remain unaffected. 
---|---|--- 



   7.10 | Employee Matters 
---|--- 



     | (a) |

At Purchasers request, Seller shall, or shall cause its relevant Affiliates
to, take such actions as are necessary and appropriate to terminate the
Cegedim 401(k) Plan and any other Seller Benefit Plan in the United States
that includes a cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code
and the consequences related thereto, effective as of a date that is no later
than the day prior to the Closing Date, including that the account balances
of all participants in such Seller Benefit Plan become fully vested as of the
date of termination, provided, however, that Purchaser shall bear the cost
resulting from such termination for Seller and/or its relevant Affiliates
(but shall not be 

---|---|--- 
 



41 incremental costs incurred due to the failure of such Seller Benefit Plan to
be maintained and operated in accordance with the provisions of such Seller
Benefit Plan or applicable Law prior to Closing). 
---|--- 



     | (b) | The Parties agree and acknowledge that, with effect from the
Closing Date, the Transfer Employees shall become employed by Purchaser or its
Affiliates, through Purchasers acquisition of the Companies.  
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Seller confirms that the Transfer Regulations are applicable
to the individuals (i) listed in Part B, Section 4.1 of _Exhibit 2.1(a)_,
which sets out a complete and accurate list of the Reorganization Employees
as of May 31, 2014, and (ii) to the employees of Cegedim Morocco, a list of
which at May 31, 2014 is set forth in _Schedule 4.9(a)_. Accordingly, the
contracts of employment of each Reorganization Employee will have effect from
the date of the transfer of the Business as if originally made between a
Company and the relevant Reorganization Employee. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | Seller confirms that the Transfer Regulations are not
applicable to the individuals listed in Part B, Section 4.2 of Exhibit 2.1(a).
The Parties agree and acknowledge that they intend that those
employees listed which shall remain in the employ of Seller shall become
employed by a Company on or prior to the Closing Date, for which Seller will
cause the relevant Company to make an offer of employment to each such
employee. To the extent such employees accept the relevant offer, they shall
be referred to as "Offer Employees". Such employment shall take effect no
later than on the Closing Date and shall be on terms which are substantially
equivalent to and (unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Purchaser) are
not more generous than the corresponding terms and conditions of employment
applicable to such employee as at the date on which such offer is made (for
the avoidance of doubt the Offer Employees length of service with Seller
would be taken over by the relevant Company). To the extent a Business
Employee accepts such offer, it is the intent of the Parties that a three
party agreement shall be entered into between the former employer, the new
employer and such Offer Employee. If any such employee refuses such offer of
employment, Seller, at its sole discretion and at its own cost, shall, or
shall cause its Subsidiaries to (i) terminate the employment agreement of such
employee, or (ii) maintain the employment of such employee within the
Sellers group. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | Seller shall within 90 days after the Closing Date open up
to 50 positions to create an IT division to which the Business Employees who
formerly worked in Sellers IT division will be entitled to apply. To
the extent that as part of this process any offer is made to any Business
Employee, such offer shall be on terms which are not less favorable to the
respective Business Employees than the corresponding terms and conditions of
employment applicable to such Business Employees as at the Closing Date (for
the avoidance of doubt the Offer Employees length of service with Seller and
French NewCo would be taken over by Seller). To the extent a Business Employee
accepts such offer, it is the intent of the Parties that a three party
agreement shall be entered into between the former employer, the new employer
and such Business Employee. 
---|---|--- 
 



42 agreement, trade union agreement or works council agreement and applicable
Law, Seller shall provide that the Business Employees and Offer
Employees personnel files, including originals of all records created prior
to the Closing Date (the "Personnel Records"), shall be in the possession of
the Companies as of the Closing or transferred to Purchaser or its Affiliates
(including the Companies on and after the Closing) as soon as practicable
thereafter. Seller shall permit Purchaser or its Affiliates or their
successors, and the authorized representatives of each of the foregoing, to
have full access to any personnel records of former employees of the Business
retained by the Seller Parties to the extent reasonably necessary in order for
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or successors to respond to a subpoena,
court order, audit, investigation or otherwise as required by applicable Law
or in connection with any pending or threatened Proceedings. Purchaser and its
Affiliates shall permit Seller and its authorized representatives to have full
access upon reasonable notice during normal business hours to the Personnel
Records in order for any Seller Party to respond to a subpoena, court order,
audit, investigation or otherwise as required by applicable Law or in
connection with any pending or threatened Proceedings (such determination by
the Parties of access shall be reasonable and shall not be unreasonably
delayed). 
---|---|--- 

(g) Seller shall make reasonable efforts, subject to any collective
bargaining agreement, trade union agreement or works council agreement and
applicable Law, to provide Purchaser in a timely manner with information and
documents relating to the Seller Benefit Plans (including service
crediting), employment contracts and policies, pay and performance data,
personnel records, bonus, incentive and commission plans, and such other human
resources related information as may reasonably be requested by Purchaser to
facilitate its efforts to transition Business Employees or Offer Employees,
including, where applicable, integration with the payroll systems and employee
benefit plans and programs of Purchaser and its Affiliates as of the Closing
Date. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller shall
reasonably cooperate with Purchaser in providing access to relevant data and
employment records of Business Employees and Offer Employees reasonably
necessary to administer the benefits of the Business Employees under
any Assumed Benefit Plan or Assumed Employee Program maintained by Purchaser
or its Affiliates in which Business Employees and Offer Employees are eligible
to participate on and after the Closing Date.

 



   7.11 | Intellectual Property 
---|--- 



     | (a) | As soon as practicable after the Closing, Seller shall
deliver to Purchaser correct and complete copies of all Trademark, Copyright
and Patent prosecution files and dockets, registration certificates,
litigation files and related opinions of counsel and correspondence relating
thereto, to the extent not in the possession of the Companies on the Closing
Date. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | As of and following the Closing Date: 
---|---|--- 
 



43 cause the other Seller Parties not to directly or indirectly: (x) exploit,
disclose or make use of all or any part of the Company Intellectual
Property, (y) use the Trademarks included in the Company Intellectual
Property or any mark confusingly similar thereto or (z) attempt to register
the Trademarks included within the Company Intellectual Property or any mark
confusingly similar thereto; and (B) Seller will consent to and not challenge
or interfere with Purchasers efforts to apply for or enforce registrations
for, and rights in, any Company Intellectual Property worldwide, or the use or
ownership thereof by Purchaser. 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | Pursuant to the IT Separation Services Agreement, Seller
shall, or shall cause the other Seller Parties to, maintain in force (i) any
Internet domain name(s) and registration(s) thereof that, as the case may
be, (A) include any Trademark that is not included in the Company
Intellectual Property and (B) are required for the operating of the Business
as currently conducted, and (ii) any Internet domain name(s) and
registration(s) thereof that (A) include both any Trademark included in the
Company Intellectual Property and any Trademark that is not included in the
Company Intellectual Property and (B) are required for the operating of the
Business as currently conducted (any such domain name, a "Shared Domain"). 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Other than the Ancillary Agreements, all Contracts relating
to Intellectual Property (including all licenses, covenants not to sue and
immunities) between a Company, on the one hand, and a Seller Party, on the
other hand, shall, on the Closing, be terminated and cancelled without any
further Liability. As of and after the Closing, Seller shall cause the
relevant Seller Parties, and Purchaser shall cause the Companies, to agree to
and perform the provisions of this Section 7.11(c). 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

As of the Signing Date, the Seller has commissioned an audit by Black Duck
("First Audit") for the purpose of identifying any Open Source Software that
has been incorporated into, integrated with, combined with or linked to any of
the Business Products listed on _Exhibit 7.11(d)(A)_ (or any Software used
therein) or from which any such Business Product (or any Software used
therein) was derived in any way. To the extent that it has not been
commissioned within thirty (30) days following the Signing Date, Seller and
Purchaser shall commission an audit by Black Duck ("Subsequent Audit") for
the purpose of identifying any Open Source Software that has been incorporated
into, integrated with, combined with or linked to any of the Business Products
listed on _Exhibit 7.11(d)(B)_ (or any Software used therein) or from which
any such Business Product (or any Software used therein) was derived in any
way (each such occurrence with respect to the Business Products identified in
_Exhibits 7.11(d)(A)_ and _(B)_ , an "Open Source Software Use"). Seller
shall bear the costs and expenses of the First Audit and, as the case may be,
of the Subsequent Audit (collectively, the "Audits") and any subsequent
consultation as set forth below. Seller and Purchaser have or shall cause
Black Duck to provide copies of the reports setting out the results of the
Audits simultaneously to Seller and to Purchaser. To the extent that such
reports identify any Open Source Software Use, Seller shall provide
to Purchaser, promptly after the receipt of the reports, all information 

---|---|--- 
 



44 the Seller Parties full compliance with all of their obligations applicable
to such Open Source Software or otherwise resulting from such Open Source
Software Uses. If Seller cannot provide such information or if Purchaser
reasonably determines that the information provided by Seller does not
establish such compliance, Seller shall as soon as reasonably practicable
devise, based on consultation with Black Duck, a plan for effectively
remediating any such non-compliance, which plan shall be communicated to
Purchaser (the "Compliance Plan"). Seller agrees to take (and to cause the
other Seller Parties to take) all preparatory steps necessary to enable
Seller (prior to the Closing) and the Companies (prior to and, if necessary,
after the Closing) to implement the Compliance Plan as soon as reasonably
practicable after receiving Purchasers consent thereto (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed), including, as applicable, the following
steps: 
---|--- 



     | (i) | the establishment and maintenance of an internal repository
of all relevant source code; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | the collection and maintenance of all licenses that are
applicable to the Open Source Software identified and authenticated in the
Black Duck report and all Open Source Software attribution information and
copyright notices if required under the license, and 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | the collection and comparison of information on all
modifications made by the Seller Parties or the Companies to any Open Source
Software; 
---|---|--- 
 

provided, however, that Seller shall consult with Purchaser and receive
Purchasers prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) prior to taking any remedial measures to rectify such
non-compliance, including any measures that: (A) require the disclosure of any
source code to Persons other than the Companies; (B) remove any Software code
from any Business Products; or (C) provide any Person other than the Companies
with Software patches or updates. Without limiting the foregoing, as soon as
practicable after the Signing Date, Seller shall, in consultation with
Purchaser, establish general policies, processes and procedures for the
Businesss use and management of Open Source Software and for compliance with
licenses related thereto. It is expressly agreed between the Parties that, in
the event Purchaser does not provide its consent for the implementation of
the Compliance Plan or any remedial measures set forth above, the Seller
Parties shall not be held liable for any non-compliance that could have been
rectified with such consent of Purchaser, provided, however, that this
limitation on liability does not apply to (i) the removal of code that impacts
functionality or (ii) the disclosure of source code.



   7.12 | Cooperation 
---|--- 

Each of the Parties undertakes to make reasonable efforts to ensure that all
measures necessary or useful for the completion of the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement and in the Ancillary Agreements are taken in a
timely manner. Each of the

 



45  Parties also undertakes to take all necessary steps to permit the other
Party and its attorneys to ascertain the satisfactory performance of all of
its undertakings made herein. In the event that at any time after the Closing
Date any additional reasonable measures are necessary or desirable for the
completion of the subject matter hereof, the Parties shall take all such
measures, or shall ensure that they are taken.

TAX MATTERS



   8.1 | Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Seller shall, and shall procure that the other Seller
Parties and the Companies will, prepare and timely file, or cause to be timely
filed, all Tax Returns of the Companies and all Tax Returns in respect of the
assets, liabilities, or the operation of the Business (i) that are not yet
filed as at the Signing Date but due on or before the Closing Date or (ii) for
any Tax period that ends on or before the Closing Date and are due after the
Closing Date (excluding for the avoidance of doubt, any Straddle Period), and
shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes shown on such Tax Returns or on any
Tax assessment notices received by the Seller Parties (with respect to the
Business or any Company) or the Companies on or before the Closing Date,
provided that any such Tax which is not yet paid at the Closing Date shall be
deemed paid by Seller if taken into account in the determination of the
Purchase Price pursuant to Sections 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6. Such Tax Returns shall
be prepared in accordance with applicable Law. Seller shall, and shall procure
that the Seller Parties and the Companies will, (i) provide Purchaser with
copies of completed drafts of such Tax Returns timely so as to
allow Purchaser to review and comment on such drafts, and (ii) incorporate
any timely and reasonable comments communicated by Purchaser, provided such
comments are not likely to increase Sellers liability under this Agreement.
Purchaser hereby expressly acknowledges that it shall not be entitled to
file, or cause to be filed, any amendment, change or note whatsoever in
relation to Tax Returns of the Companies or to Tax Returns in respect of the
assets, liabilities, or the operation of the Business (i) filed on or before
the Closing Date or (ii) for any Tax period that ends on or before the Closing
Date and are due after the Closing Date without Sellers consent.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser may file, or cause
to be filed, an amended Tax Return to the extent required by applicable Law. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Seller shall be entitled to refunds received by Purchaser,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Companies, net of all reasonable after-
tax costs incurred by or imposed on Purchaser, any of its Subsidiaries, or any
of the Companies with respect to such refunds, of any Taxes borne by any
Seller Party or Company in relation to a period that ends on or before the
Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Tax Refunds") only to the extent that the
individual Pre-Closing Tax Refund exceeds EUR 25,000. Purchaser shall, and
shall cause any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Companies to, take such
reasonable steps as shall be necessary to effectively obtain such refunds.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller shall not be entitled
to any Pre-Closing Tax Refunds to the extent they are reflected as a
receivable in the Net Working Capital in the Closing Date Accounts, and
Sellers right to receive the Pre-Closing Tax Refunds shall survive only
until the expiration of the relevant statute of limitation. 
---|---|--- 
 



46 ---|--- 



     | (a) | After the Closing Date, Purchaser shall have the exclusive
right to represent the interests of the Companies and of the Business in any
and all Tax audits, assessments or administrative or court proceedings
relating to Tax Returns for Tax periods ending after the Closing Date;
provided, however, that Seller shall have the right to participate in any such
audit, assessment or proceeding and to employ counsel of Sellers choice at
its own expense for purposes of such participation and Purchaser shall not be
entitled to settle, either administratively or after the commencement of
litigation, without Sellers consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, any claim for Taxes to the extent that any such audit, assessment
or proceeding would result in a Tax payable by a Seller Party or an indemnity
payment by Seller pursuant to Sections 8.1 or 11.1. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | After the Closing Date, the Seller Parties shall have the
exclusive right to represent the interests of the Companies and of the
Business in any and all Tax audits, assessments or administrative or court
proceedings relating to Tax Returns for Tax periods ending on or before the
Closing Date; provided, however, that Purchaser shall have the right to
participate in any such audit, assessment or proceeding and to employ counsel
of Purchasers choice at its own expense, and the Seller Parties shall not be
entitled to settle, either administratively or after the commencement of
litigation, any claim for Taxes of Purchaser, the Companies or the Business if
such settlement would adversely affect Taxes for any period after the Closing
Date to any extent without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event the Seller Parties
fail within thirty (30) Business Days after notice to answer, defend or
handle any such audit, assessment or proceeding, or to respond in a timely
manner to a request or inquiry made by a Tax Authority in connection with such
audit, assessment or proceeding, then Purchaser shall have the right to
represent the interests of the Companies and of the Business, and the Seller
Parties shall be bound by the results obtained by Purchaser in connection with
such audit, assessment or proceeding, provided however that Purchaser shall at
all times keep the Seller Parties informed of any development in relation to
any such audit, assessment or proceeding. 
---|---|---

receipt by the Seller Parties or the Companies of notice of any pending Tax

Seller Parties or the Companies.

receipt by Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date

the Companies that includes any pre-Closing period. 
---|---|--- 
 



47 cooperate, and to cause the Companies to cooperate, and provide each other
with such information relating to the Business and the Companies as the other
Party may reasonably request in (i) filing any Tax Return or other Tax filing
or claim for refund of Taxes, (ii) determining any Tax liability or right to
refund of Taxes, (iii) conducting or defending any audit or other proceeding
in respect of Taxes, or (iv) effectuating the terms of this Agreement. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other Partys request)
the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any
such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on
a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder. Seller shall, and shall procure that the
Seller Parties will, retain its and their books and records with respect to
Tax matters pertinent to the Business relating to any Tax period beginning
before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations
(and, to the extent notified by Purchaser, any extensions thereof) of the
respective Tax periods, and abide by all record retention agreements entered
into with any Tax Authority. Prior to the expiry of the relevant retention
period, Seller shall give Purchaser reasonable written notice prior
to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records
(excluding for the avoidance of doubt, any books and records transferred to
Purchaser prior to such date) and, if Purchaser so requests, Seller shall
allow Purchaser and the Companies to take possession of such books and
records. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Party shall be unreasonably
required to prepare any document, or determine any information, not then in
its possession in response to a request under this Section 8.2(e). 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | Seller and Purchaser agree to enter into an exit agreement
(convention de sortie) that will address relevant Tax consequences resulting
from the Companies exit from the French consolidated group of
Seller substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit 8.2(f)_.

   8.3 | Straddle Period 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Income Taxes relating to the pre-Closing portion of any
Straddle Period shall be determined and computed as if a fiscal year had been
formally closed on the Closing Date, taking into account carry forward
losses available for offset until such period and available tax credits,
provided that: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | any Tax due in relation to the pre-Closing portion of any
Straddle Period which is deductible from the basis of assessment of income
Taxes will be treated as immediately deductible for the purpose of calculating
income Taxes relating to the pre-Closing portion of any Straddle Period even
if not immediately deductible under standard Tax rules; and 
---|---|--- 
 



48 annual basis (including but not limited to research and development tax
credit) shall be allocated between the period ending on the Closing Date and
the period after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each
such period. 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | If the benefit of any carry forward losses, Tax credit or
Tax deduction taken into account for purposes of calculating the Straddle
Period Liability is subsequently denied by the relevant Tax authority (other
than as a result of an event, action, circumstance, condition, occurrence or
non-occurrence attributable to the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
occurring after Closing), then the portion of additional Straddle Period
Liability resulting from such denial shall become payable by Seller to the
Purchaser. 
---|---|--- 

The same principles shall apply for all Taxes which might be due in
respect of the Straddle Period and calculated by reference to income, profits
or gains earned, accrued or received, or deemed to be earned, accrued or
received for Tax purposes, during the Straddle Period.

 

(b) Real and personal property Taxes and any other _ad valorem_ Taxes due in
relation to the Straddle Period shall be apportioned between the pre-Closing
portion of any Straddle Period and the post-Closing portion of any Straddle
Period on a _per diem_ basis.

(c) Any withholding tax due in relation to a specific payment or a Tax that
is due as a result of the disposition of a capital asset shall be allocated to
the pre-Closing portion of any Straddle Period if the relevant specific event
giving rise to the withholding tax or the disposition of a capital asset
occurs on or prior to the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, any such
event or disposition occurring after the Closing Date shall not be taken into
account in computing the Taxes allocated to the pre-Closing portion of any
Straddle Period.

(d) For purposes of calculating a Tax due for the Straddle Period, to the
extent the applicable Tax rate is not known at the date of the calculation of
the Straddle Period Liability, the last available rate shall be applied. For
those Taxes or Tax credits the final of which cannot be finally determined at
the date of calculation of the Straddle Period Liability, a reasonable
estimate taking into account the elements which are known (and for those not
known, the one used for the previous Tax period shall be used) shall be made.

 



   8.4 | Value Added Taxes 
---|--- 



     | (a) | All consideration specified for supplies of goods or
services made, or deemed to be made, under this Agreement that do not
explicitly address VAT, shall be exclusive of any and all applicable VAT. With
respect to each such supply of goods or services, the Party that makes such
supply shall, on or after the Closing Date, provide the other Party with a
properly completed and executed VAT invoice (or other valid and customary VAT
documentation) with respect to the relevant supply of goods or services
promptly and in accordance with applicable Law. 
---|---|--- 
 



49 retaining any VAT records as of Closing preserve such VAT records for such
periods as may be required by relevant Tax Law and during such period permit
the other party or its agents at all reasonable times and subject to
reasonable written notice to inspect and take copies of such VAT records at
the cost of the person requesting such inspection or copies.

   11.6 | Notice and Opportunity to Defend 
---|--- 



     | (a) | If there occurs an event which Seller or a Purchaser
Indemnified Person asserts is an indemnifiable event pursuant to Sections 11.1
or 11.2, the Person(s) seeking indemnification (the "Indemnified Person")
shall notify in writing the Party obligated to provide indemnification (the
"Indemnifying Party") promptly, but no later than twenty (20) Business Days,
after the Indemnified Person is informed of any claim, event or matter as to
which indemnity may be sought; provided that the failure of the Indemnified
Person to give notice as provided in this Section 11.6 shall not relieve any
Indemnifying Party of its obligations under Section 11.1, except to the
extent that such failure prejudices the rights of any such Indemnifying Party.
In the event of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or demand asserted by any
Person who is not a Party or a Purchaser Indemnified Person (or a successor to
such Party or Person) (a "Third Party Claim") which is or gives rise to an
indemnification claim, the Indemnifying Party may elect within ten (10)
Business Days to participate or assume the defense of any such claim or
any litigation resulting therefrom using counsel that upon retention to
represent the Indemnifying Party with respect to such matter is reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who must give the Indemnifying Party
written notice of any objection to such counsel within five (5) Business Days
after its receipt of notice of such retention and absent such objection, such
counsel shall be deemed to be reasonably acceptable). 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Person may participate in such defense at the
Indemnified Persons expense, which shall include counsel of its choice at
its own expense; provided that the Indemnified Person shall have the right to
employ, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, one counsel of its choice in each
applicable jurisdiction (if more than one jurisdiction is involved) to
represent the Indemnified Person if 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | the Indemnifying Party elects not to defend a Third Party
Claim, 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | the Indemnifying Party fails to notify the Indemnified
Person within the required time period of its election as provided in this
Section, or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | the Indemnifying Party having timely elected to defend a
Third Party Claim, fails, in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified
Person, after at least ten (10) Business Days notice to the Indemnifying
Party, to adequately prosecute or pursue such defense (it being acknowledged
that to the extent no court filing or hearing is required within such period,
the Indemnifying Party shall not be deemed not to have adequately prosecute or
pursue such defense).  
---|---|--- 
 



56 Party Claim, 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | no compromise or settlement thereof may be effected by the
Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified Persons consent (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless (A) there is
no finding or admission of any violation of Law by the Indemnified Person or
its Affiliates and no effect on any other claims that may be made against the
Indemnified Person, (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are
paid in full by the Indemnifying Party, and (C) the Indemnified Person
receives an unconditional release from all liability in respect of the Third
Party Claim, and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | the Indemnifying Party shall have no liability with respect
to any compromise or settlement thereof effected by the Indemnified Person
without its consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld). The
Indemnified Person shall furnish such information regarding itself or the
claim in question as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request in writing
and as shall be reasonably required in connection with the defense of such
claim and litigation resulting therefrom. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | Notwithstanding the foregoing, if 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | an Indemnified Person determines in good faith that there is
a reasonable probability that an action brought by a Major Customer or Major
Supplier may have a material adverse effect (other than as a result of
monetary damages) on the Indemnified Persons relationship with such Major
Customer or Major Supplier, or 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | the Third Party Claim involves any action by any
Governmental Entity, 
---|---|--- 

such Indemnified Person may, by notice to the Indemnifying Party, assume the
exclusive right to defend such action at the Indemnified Persons expense. In
such event, the Indemnifying Party may participate in such defense at the
Indemnifying Partys expense, which shall include counsel of its choice at
its own expense. The Indemnified Person shall consult with, and furnish
information regarding the action, to the Indemnifying Party and its counsel,
if any, as reasonably requested and the Indemnified Person shall reasonably
consider the Indemnifying Partys suggestions and comments regarding the
defense of such action. No compromise or settlement thereof may be effected by
the Indemnified Person without the Indemnifying Partys consent (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Indemnifying Party shall furnish
such information regarding itself or the claim in question as the Indemnified
Person may reasonably request in writing and as shall be reasonably required
in connection with the defense of such claim and litigation resulting
therefrom.

 



57 the contrary, 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | In the case of any Losses incurred, arising out of, in
connection with or as a result of an indemnification claim with respect to
Taxes pursuant to Section 8.1 or 11.1, (A) any Third Party Claims shall
be handled in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 8.2, and
(B) Seller shall indemnify the affected Purchaser Indemnified Persons within
thirty (30) days after payment by the Purchaser Indemnified Persons of any
Taxes resulting in such Losses to the extent that such payment of Taxes is
required by Law; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | If the Purchaser Indemnified Persons are required by Law to
pay an amount with respect to Taxes for Tax periods ending on or before the
Closing Date in order to represent the interests of the Companies and of
the Business in any and all Tax assessments or administrative or court
proceedings pursuant to Section 8.2, Seller shall indemnify the affected
Purchaser Indemnified persons within thirty (30) days after such payment,
provided however that if payment can legally be deferred subject to the
provision of guarantees, the Purchaser Indemnified Persons shall offer Seller
the possibility to offer such guarantees or to pay the costs thereof in lieu
of immediate payment of such Taxes;  
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | if Seller fails to pay all or part of any amount paid by
the Purchaser Indemnified Persons specified in Sections 11.6(e)(i) and
11.6(e)(ii) when due, then Seller shall also be obligated to pay to the
affected Purchaser Indemnified Persons interest on the unpaid amount for each
day during which the obligation remains unpaid as provided in Section 1.7(c);
and 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | if, following the conclusion of any administrative or court
proceedings, the Purchaser Indemnified Persons recover from any relevant Tax
authority an amount with respect to Taxes, for Tax periods ending on or before
the Closing Date, which the Seller has paid to the Purchaser Indemnified
Persons under Sections 11.6(e)(i) or 11.6(e)(ii) above or the Purchaser
Indemnified Persons receive an indemnity covering the costs of any guarantees
provided by Seller or the costs of which were borne by Seller, under Section
11.6(e)(ii), the Purchaser Indemnified Persons shall promptly repay such
amounts to Seller. 
---|---|--- 



   11.7 | Effect of Investigation or Knowledge; Limitations on Liability;
Other 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Subject to the provisions of this Section 11.7, any claim
for indemnification by an Indemnified Person pursuant to Section 11.1(c) and
Section 11.2 shall not be adversely affected by any investigation by
or opportunity to investigate afforded to the Indemnified Person at any time,
nor shall such a claim be adversely affected by the Indemnified Persons
knowledge on or before the Closing Date of any breach of the type specified in
Article XI or of any state of facts that may give rise to such a breach. The
waiver of any condition based 
---|---|--- 
 



58 performance of or compliance with any covenant or obligation pursuant to
Section 11.1(c) and Section 11.2, will not adversely affect the right
to indemnification, payment of Losses or other remedy based on such
representations, warranties, covenants or obligations. 
---|--- 



     | (b) | The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided
under this Article XI shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the
Indemnified Person under insurance policies in effect and applicable to
such Loss after taking into account any increase in premiums as a result of
the relevant insurance claim. Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to pursue all such insurance recoveries to which Purchaser or the
Companies may be entitled (whether directly or as a result of assignment of
their benefit). 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Any payment or indemnity required to be made pursuant to
Section 11.1 shall be reduced by the amount of any Tax saving or benefit
relating to such payment or indemnity (including any Tax reduction or
credit) actually realized by the Indemnified Person (which term shall, for
purposes of this paragraph, include the ultimate payer(s) of Taxes in the case
of an Indemnified Person that is a branch or a disregarded entity or other
pass-through entity for any Tax purpose) in the year the Loss is incurred
that would not have been realized but for the Loss giving rise to the payment

If there shall be any dispute, controversy or claim between the Parties
arising out of, relating to, or connected with this Agreement (other than
any disputes on the Closing Date Accounts and/or the resulting adjustment to

the chief executive officers of IMS and Cegedim, who shall act by
mutual agreement on all such matters. No recourse to arbitration under this
Agreement shall take place unless and until the chief executive officers of

accordance with the above provisions shall nominate the third arbitrator
within thirty days of their appointment. If the first two appointed
arbitrators fail to nominate a third arbitrator, then, upon request of either
Party, the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the ICC within twenty (20)
Business Days of receiving such request. The third arbitrator shall serve as
Chairman of the Arbitral Tribunal. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | Except as may be required by applicable Law, stock exchange
rules or court order, the parties agree to maintain confidentiality as to all

Sections 2.1 and 5.1, to the extent they are outstanding as of the Closing
Date and not reflected as Financial Debt or as part of the Net Working Capital
in the Closing Date Accounts, and shall file all necessary Tax Returns with
respect to all such Transfer Taxes. If required by Law, Purchaser and/or the
Companies will join in the execution of any such Tax Return. Any Transfer
Taxes resulting from or relating to the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement other than the reorganization
measures referred to in Sections 2.1 and 5.1 and those reflected in the

   13.7 | Binding Effect, Benefits 
---|--- 

This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties
(and, to the extent provided in Section 11.1, the Purchaser Indemnified
Persons) and their respective successors and assigns. Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer on any Person other than
the Parties (and, to the extent provided in Section 11.1, the Purchaser
Indemnified Persons) and their respective successors and assigns any rights,
remedies, obligations, or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



   13.8 | Severability 
---|--- 

Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in
any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent
of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining
provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of
such provision in any other jurisdiction. To the extent any provision of this
Agreement is determined to be prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction,
the Parties agree to use reasonable efforts, and agree to cause their
Subsidiaries to use reasonable efforts, to substitute one or more valid,
legal and enforceable provision that, insofar as practicable, implement the
purposes of the prohibited or unenforceable provision.

 



75 ---|--- 

No Party may assign, delegate, or otherwise transfer any of its rights
or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
other Party hereto, and any such assignment shall be void, except that either
Party may sell, transfer or assign, the Agreement in whole or from time to
time in part, to one or more of its Affiliates, provided that no such
transfer or assignment shall relieve the transferring Party of its obligations
hereunder.



   13.10 | Specific Performance 
---|--- 

The Parties agree that immediate and irreparable harm and damage would occur
for which monetary damages alone would not be an adequate remedy in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly
agreed that in the event of such breach or non-performance, no Party shall
interfere with, delay, obstruct, or prevent the non-breaching Party from
taking, or require such Party to take, any steps prior to taking action to
seek an interim and interlocutory equitable remedy (including an injunction
or order for specific performance) on notice or ex parte to enforce its rights
or to preserve the status quo or prevent irreparable harm and each Party
covenants and agrees not to contest, object to, or otherwise oppose an
application for equitable relief by the other Party in such circumstances, and
waives any and all immunities from any equitable relief to which it may be
entitled. Any such relief or remedy shall not be exclusive, but shall be
in addition to all other available legal or equitable remedies. Each Party
agrees that the provisions of this Section 13.10 are fair and reasonable in
the commercial circumstances of this Agreement, and that no Party would have
entered into this Agreement but for each Partys agreement with the
provisions of this Section 13.10.



   13.11 | Schedules 
---|--- 

Any fact or item disclosed on any Schedule to this Agreement shall be
listed or described under a caption that specifically identifies the
Section(s) of this Agreement to which the item relates. Unless this Agreement
specifically provides otherwise, neither the specification of any item or
matter in any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item in any Schedule hereto is intended to imply
that such item or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the
Ordinary Course of Business, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting
forth or the inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute or
controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter
not described herein or included in any Schedule is or is not in the
Ordinary Course of Business for purposes of this Agreement.
