as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise.   1.2.40. "Tax
Benefit" shall mean, with respect to a taxable year of a Person and without
duplication, the excess, if any, of (i) such Person\'s cumulative liability
for Taxes through the end of such taxable year, calculated by excluding any
Tax items attributable to the Loss or other payment at issue for all taxable
years, over (ii) such Person\'s actual cumulative liability for Taxes through
the end of such taxable year, calculated by taking into account any Tax items
attributable to the Loss or other payment at issue for all taxable years (to
the extent permitted by relevant Tax law and treating such Tax items as the
last items claimed for any taxable year), such Person\'s calculation (which
calculation shall be made in good faith and shall be accompanied by
a reasonably detailed explanation delivered to the Indemnifying Party and
such other information as is reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party)
being binding on all parties hereto without any other party\'s review of any
books, records or Tax Returns of such Person; provided, however, that if all
or a portion of the Tax Benefit associated with a Loss or other payment is
expected to reduce such Person\'s Taxes in one or more taxable years
subsequent to the taxable year in which an indemnification payment is due
pursuant to this Agreement, the Tax Benefit for the taxable year in which
such indemnification payment is due shall be equal to the portion, if any, of
such Tax Benefit that actually reduces such Person\'s Taxes as described
above for such taxable year (and/or one or more prior taxable years), with
the indemnifying party making the indemnification payment without reduction
for any future Tax Benefits, on a present-value basis or otherwise; and
provided further, however, that to the extent the indemnified party
recognizes Tax Benefits with respect to a Loss or other payment in any future
taxable year(s) with respect to which the indemnified party has received one
or more indemnification payments, the indemnified party shall pay the amount
of such Tax Benefits to the indemnifying party as such Tax Benefits are
actually recognized by the indemnified party (but not in excess of the
indemnification payment(s) actually received from the indemnifying party with
respect to the Loss or other payment generating the Tax Benefits).  
1.2.41. "Tax Return" shall mean any federal, state, local or foreign return,
report, statement or form relating to any Tax and any claim for refund of

provided herein.   3.1.1.1 Each Seller shall be entitled to receive from
the  Sellers\' Representative out of the Equity Purchase Price in respect
of  their Shares of Common Stock, to such account or accounts as each

Capital Amount"), determined in accordance with Section 3.4.1, as if it were
the actual Closing Working Capital Amount, but based on the Sellers\'
Representative\'s review of financial information then reasonably available
to the Sellers\' Representative and inquiries of personnel responsible for
the preparation of the financial information of the Company in the ordinary
course. The Enterprise Value will be reduced or increased, as the case may
be, by the amount by which the Estimated Closing Working Capital Amount is
less than or more than an amount equal to $(201,700) multiplied by the number
of restaurants open as of the Closing Date (which amount would be
$(16,338,000) as of the date hereof).   3.2. Time and Place of Closing. The
consummation of the transactions described above (the "Closing") (other than

described therein), shall take place at the offices of Straddling Yocca
Carlson and Rauth, at 10:00 a.m. (local time) on July 7, 2004 or, if all
conditions precedent to Closing set forth in Sections 8 and 9 hereof shall
not have been satisfied at such date, two Business Days after the
satisfaction or waiver of all conditions precedent to Closing which can be
satisfied prior to Closing (the day on which the Closing takes place being
referred to herein as the "Closing Date"). Except as otherwise provided
in Section 12, the failure to consummate the purchase and sale provided for
in this Agreement on the date and time and at the place specified herein will
not relieve any party to this Agreement of any obligation under this
Agreement.   11    3.3. Delivery. At the Closing: (a) each of the Sellers
shall deliver to the Buyer the certificate or certificates evidencing all of
the Shares of Common Stock owned by such Seller, together with a duly
executed stock power; (b) each holder of Options and Warrants shall deliver
to the Buyer evidence of the cancellation of all Options and Warrants owned
by such holder in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer;
and (c) each party will deliver to the other such certificates and other
documents as are contemplated hereby.   3.4. Post-Closing Adjustment
Mechanics.   3.4.1. As soon as practicable (and in no event later than 45
days after the Closing), the Buyer and the Sellers\' Representative shall
jointly prepare or cause to be prepared (a) a balance sheet of the Company as
of the close of business on the Closing Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet")
and (b) a statement of the Working Capital of the Company reflected on the
Closing Balance Sheet (the "Closing Working Capital Amount"). The Closing
Balance Sheet and the Closing Working Capital Amount will be prepared and
determined in accordance with GAAP, using the same policies, principles and
methodology used in connection with the preparation of the Financial
Statements and in accordance with the methodology set forth in Exhibit 3.4
attached hereto. To the extent of any inconsistency between the methodology
described on Exhibit 3.4 and that used in the preparation of the Financial
Statements, the terms of Exhibit 3.4 will govern. In connection with the
preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Working Capital
Amount, the Buyer and the Sellers shall each provide the other party and
their representatives with reasonable access to the personnel, books,
records, documents and other information of the Company. Each party agrees to
make reasonable representations or provide such other assurances as are
reasonably requested by the other party\'s independent accountants
in connection with such access. The Buyer and the Seller\'s Representative
shall jointly notify the Escrow Agent of the Closing Working Capital Amount
promptly following its determination.   3.4.2. If the Buyer and the
Sellers\' representatives cannot agree on the final Closing Balance Sheet and
the Closing Working Capital Amount within 60 days after the Closing, the
parties shall submit their final calculations of the items in dispute to KPMG
LLP or, if such firm declines to serve, then to another nationally recognized
accounting firm selected upon mutual agreement of the parties (the
"Accountants"), for resolution within 30 days or as soon thereafter as
reasonably practicable. If the Buyer and the Sellers\' Representative
are unable to agree upon the Accountants within the 60 day period after the
Closing, then the Accountants shall be determined by the American
Arbitration Association. The Accountants shall review such final calculations
and render a report as to the disputes and the resulting Closing Balance
Sheet and Closing Working Capital Amount. In resolving any disputed item, the
Accountants may not assign a value to any particular item greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less than the lowest
value for such item claimed by either party, in each case as presented to the
Accountants. The decision by the Accountants shall be final and binding on
the parties. The costs and expenses of the Accountants shall be paid on a
proportionate basis by the Sellers, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the
other, based on the inverse proportion of the respective percentages of the
dollar value of disputed issues determined in favor of the Sellers\'
Representative and the Buyer. The Buyer and the Sellers\' Representative
shall make available to the Accountants all relevant books and records
relating to the calculations submitted and all other information reasonably
requested by the Accountants.   12    3.5. Adjustments to the Enterprise
Value. Upon the final determination of the Closing Working Capital Amount,
the Enterprise Value will be adjusted as follows:   3.5.1. If the Closing
Working Capital Amount exceeds the Estimated Closing Working Capital Amount,
then the Enterprise Value will be increased by, and the Buyer will pay the
Sellers\' Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, the amount of such
difference.   3.5.2. If the Closing Working Capital Amount is less than
the Estimated Closing Working Capital Amount, then the Enterprise Value will
be decreased by the amount of such difference, and the Buyer shall be
entitled to payment of such amount from the Working Capital Hold-Back (and,
if necessary, the Hold-Back Amount) pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.  Any
payment in respect of the net adjustment required to be made pursuant to this
Section 3.5 will be made by the Buyer or by the Escrow Agent, as applicable,
in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts specified by the Buyer or the Sellers\' Representative, on behalf of
the Sellers, as applicable, in writing, within five Business Days after the
final determination of the Closing Working Capital Amount.   3.6. Escrow
Hold-Back.   3.6.1. The parties agree that the Hold-Back Amount and the
Working Capital Hold-Back shall be deposited in an account (the "Hold-Back
Account") with Escrow Agent, to be held and administered in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement against which Hold-Back
Account the Buyer shall be entitled to recover any (a) amounts owing to the
Buyer pursuant to Sections 3.5.2 out of the Working Capital Hold-Back and, if
necessary, the Hold-Back Amount and (b) Losses that may be suffered by the
Buyer or another Buyer Indemnitee for which the Buyer or such Buyer
Indemnitee is entitled to indemnity pursuant to Section 7.7 or Section 10 (an
"Escrow Claim"), all in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.   3.6.2.
Escrow Claims shall be made, and may be disputed, in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement. Upon determination by the
parties as to the agreed amount of the Losses as provided in the Escrow
Agreement, amounts shall be released from the Hold-Back Account to satisfy
such claims as determined in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement.   3.6.3. In accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent
shall distribute the remaining balance in the Hold-Back Account to the
Sellers\' Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, less the then existing
Claim Reserves (as defined in the Escrow Agreement), in each case in the
proportions set forth on Schedule 1. The amount, if any, remaining after the
resolution of any Open Claims (as defined in the Escrow Agreement) shall be
distributed to the Sellers promptly after their resolution pursuant to the
terms of the Escrow Agreement, in each case in the proportions set forth on
Schedule 1.   13   4. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLERS. Each

as set forth in Schedule 4.3, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
such Seller and the consummation by such Seller of the transactions
contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement do not and will not conflict with or result in the breach of any of

respective Shares of Common Stock, Options and/or Warrants. In the case of
any Seller who owns Shares of Common Stock, upon delivery of the
certificate(s) representing such Seller\'s Shares of Common Stock at the
Closing duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by a duly executed stock power
with respect to such Shares, such Shares will be assigned, conveyed and

this Agreement nor the consummation by the Company of any of the
transactions contemplated hereby does or will constitute, result in or give
rise to (a) a breach of or a default or violation under any provision of the

duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the State of Delaware and has full power and authority, corporate
and otherwise, to enter into this Agreement, to perform its obligations
hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The

delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Buyer and the Purchaser
Subsidiary and the consummation by the Buyer and the Purchaser Subsidiary of
the Closing hereunder in accordance with the terms and conditions of this

any   28   terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any
Contractual Obligation or the Charter or By-laws of the Buyer or the
Purchaser Subsidiary or a breach of any Legal Requirement applicable to the
Buyer or the Purchaser Subsidiary. Assuming expiration or termination of all

the transactions contemplated hereby, except (a) for items which shall have
been obtained or made on or prior to, and shall be in full force and effect
at, the Closing Date and (b) where failure to obtain such approval, consent,
waiver, authorization or other order, or to make such declaration, filing,
registration, qualification or recording, would not adversely affect the
Buyer\'s or the Purchaser Subsidiary\'s ability to consummate the Closing
hereunder in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
would not prevent the Buyer or the Purchaser Subsidiary from performing in
all material respects any of their respective other obligations under this

and conditions of this Agreement and the Shares.   6.4. Litigation. There

its Affiliates which has had or would reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the ability of the Buyer to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or (b) which seeks rescission of or seeks to
enjoin the consummation of this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.   6.5. Brokers, etc. No broker, finder,
investment bank or similar agent is entitled to any brokerage or finder\'s
fee in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based
upon agreements or arrangements made by or on behalf of the Buyer or any of
its Affiliates.   6.6. Investigation; No Additional Representations; No
Reliance, etc. The Buyer acknowledges that the Sellers and the Company have
not made nor shall any of them be deemed to have made, nor has the Buyer
relied on, any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, express or
implied, with respect to the Company, the Business or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, other than those explicitly set forth herein.
The Buyer acknowledges and   29   agrees that it (a) has made its own

judgment concerning, the Business and the Company, (b) to the knowledge of
the Buyer, the Buyer has been furnished with or given adequate access to such
information about the Business and the Company as it has requested, (c) to
the extent it has deemed appropriate, has addressed in this Agreement any
matters arising out of its investigation and the information provided to it,
and (d) except to the extent provided in Section 10 and excluding any claims
for fraud, which the Buyer explicitly does not waive, will not assert any
claim against the Company, the Sellers or any of their respective partners,
directors, officers, employees, advisors, agents, shareholders, consultants,
investment bankers, brokers, representatives or controlling persons, or any
Affiliate of any of the foregoing, or, except to the extent provided in
Section 10 and excluding any claims for fraud, which the Buyer explicitly

and the Company and the Sellers on the other hand will each use all
commercially reasonable efforts to bring about the fulfillment of each of the
conditions precedent to the obligations of the other set forth in this
Agreement, subject to the following:   7.3.1. Regulatory Compliance.
Promptly upon execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of the Buyer and
the Company will use their commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and, as
promptly as practicable, file, or cause to be prepared and filed, with
the   31   appropriate Governmental Authorities, a notification with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the
HSR Act. The parties will use their commercially reasonable efforts to supply
all information requested by Governmental Authorities in connection with the
HSR Act notification and cooperate with each other in responding to any such
request. The Buyer shall be solely responsible for all filing fees required
to be paid in connection therewith. The parties will use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts and will cooperate fully with one another to
comply as promptly as practicable with all governmental requirements
applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to obtain
promptly all approvals, orders, permits or other consents of any applicable
Governmental Authorities necessary for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the parties will furnish to the other
parties and, upon request, to any Governmental Authorities such information
and assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection with the
foregoing, including by responding promptly to and complying fully with any
request for additional information or documents under the HSR Act. The
parties will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to resolve
favorably any review or consideration of the antitrust aspects of the
transactions contemplated hereby by any Governmental Authority with

7.3.2. Consents, etc. Prior to the Closing Date, upon the Buyer\'s written
request, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (but the
Company and the Sellers shall have no obligation to pay any fees or incur any
material expenses) to assist the Buyer in securing such written consents
or waivers under or with respect to the Contracts (other than the Leases)
that the Buyer reasonably requests in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   7.3.3. Leases. Prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain consents in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer
with respect to the Leases set forth under the heading "Contracts Requiring

5.6 to this Agreement.   7.3.4. Liquor Licenses. The Company and the Sellers
will take all actions reasonably required prior to the Closing to ensure the
continued and uninterrupted ability to serve alcoholic beverages immediately
after the Closing at each restaurant location to the same extent as
immediately prior to the Closing. In furtherance, and not in limitation, of
the foregoing, the Company and the Sellers agree prior to the Closing to file
such notices, applications and other documents and enter into such
arrangements as may be required by any applicable state or local liquor
regulatory authority and to seek such temporary licenses or permits as are
reasonably requested by the Buyer.   7.3.5. Further Assurances. Each party,
upon the request from time to time of any other party hereto after the
Closing, and at the expense of the requesting party but without further
consideration, will take such actions as may be necessary or reasonably
requested to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby in an orderly
fashion.   7.4. Access to Properties and Records. Subject to the provisions
of Section 13.7, the Company will permit the Buyer and its
appropriate representatives to have reasonable access, prior to the Closing
Date, to the employees, properties and books and records of the Company,  
32   during normal working hours and upon reasonable notice, to familiarize
itself with the Company\'s respective properties, business and operating and
financial conditions; provided, however, that the Buyer and its
representatives shall not unreasonably disrupt the personnel and operations
of the Company.   7.5. Shareholders Agreement. The Company and each of the
Sellers that is a party to the Shareholders Agreement hereby agree that the
Shareholders Agreement shall terminate as of the Closing and shall thereafter
be of no further force and effect.   7.6. Indemnification of Directors,
Officers and Employees. The parties agree that following the Closing, the
Company shall, and the Buyer shall cause the Company to, (a) maintain for a
period of six years the coverage provided by the Directors and Officers
Liability Insurance policy of the Company, as in effect on the Closing Date,
with respect to acts or omissions of the Persons covered thereby occurring
prior to the Closing; provided, that the Buyer or the Company may substitute
therefor policies of substantially the same coverage containing substantially
comparable terms and conditions with respect to matters occurring prior to
the Closing Date; provided, further, that in no event shall the Buyer or the
Company be required to expend more than an amount per year equal to 200% of
current annual premiums paid by the Company (which the Sellers represent and
warrant to be not more than $150,000) to maintain or procure such coverage;
and (b) ensure that no change will be made to the Company\'s Charter or By-
laws that would materially adversely affect any individual\'s right
to indemnification in such individual\'s capacity as a director or officer of
the Company with respect to any act or omission in such capacity occurring on
or prior to the Closing Date under the Company\'s Charter or By-Laws and
Delaware General Corporation Law as in effect as of the Closing Date;
provided, that nothing contained in this Section 7.6 shall affect or limit
(i) any Seller\'s obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees as provided
in Section 10 or (ii) the Buyer\'s ability to merge the Company with or into
the Buyer or any of the Buyer\'s Subsidiaries, whether such Subsidiary is
currently in existence or created after the date hereof and whether or not
such Subsidiary is a corporation, limited liability company, limited
partnership or other similar entity. This Section 7.7 shall be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the directors and officers of the
Company, and their respective heirs and estates.   7.7. Tax Matters.  
7.7.1. Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns. The Buyer and the Company shall
prepare, or cause to be prepared, in accordance with applicable Legal
Requirements and in a manner consistent with the Company\'s prior
Tax Returns, all Tax Returns that (i) are required to be filed by, or with
respect to, the Company for Tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date,
and for Tax periods that begin before the Closing Date and end after the
Closing Date (the "Straddle Period"), and (ii) are not filed as of the
Closing Date. The Buyer shall provide each such Tax Return to the Sellers\'
Representative, not later than 20 days before the due date for such Tax
Return (taking into account any extensions of such due date), for the
Sellers\' Representative\'s review and approval. The Sellers\'
Representative\'s approval of each such Tax Return shall not be unreasonably
withheld. Subject to resolving any dispute with the Seller\'s Representative,
the Buyer shall cause the Company to timely file each such Tax Return. The
Buyer and the Company shall not file any amended Tax Returns or make any Tax
election with respect to Taxes of or relating to the Company for (i)
any taxable year or taxable period that ends   33   on or before the
Closing Date, or (ii) the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Tax Periods") which would reasonably be likely
to result in an indemnity payment pursuant to Section 7.7.5, without
the prior written consent of the Sellers\' Representative, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld.   7.7.2. Liability for Taxes. Except as
provided in Section 7.1, the Buyer shall be responsible for all Taxes for
Pre-Closing Tax Periods to the extent that the liability for such Taxes does
not exceed the accrued liability for Taxes (excluding any liability for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) in determining the Closing Working Capital Amount. Except as provided
in Section 7.1, the Sellers shall be responsible for all Taxes for Pre-
Closing Tax Periods to the extent that the liability for such Taxes exceeds
the accrued liability for Taxes (excluding any liability for deferred Taxes
established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) in
determining the Closing Working Capital Amount.   7.7.3. Division of the
Straddle Period. In order to apportion appropriately any Taxes relating to a
Straddle Period, the parties hereto shall, to the extent permitted under
applicable Legal Requirements, elect with the relevant Governmental Authority
to treat for all purposes the Closing Date as the last day of the Tax year or
period of the Company. In any case where applicable Legal Requirements do not
permit the Company to treat the Closing Date as the last day of the Tax year
or period with respect to Taxes that are payable with respect to a Straddle
Period, the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date will be:   (i) in the case of
Taxes that are either (x) income Taxes or  (y) imposed in connection with any
sale or other transfer or  assignment of property (other than any Taxes
imposed on any sales  conveyance made pursuant to this Agreement or
contemplated by  transactions described herein, the payment of which is
governed by  Section 7.1 of this Agreement), deemed equal to the amount
that  would have been payable had the relevant Tax year or period ended on 
the Closing Date (except that, solely for purposes of determining  the
marginal tax rate applicable to the income or receipts during  such period in
a jurisdiction in which such tax rate depends upon  the level of income or
receipts, annualized income or receipts may  be taken into account, if
appropriate for an equitable sharing of  such Taxes); and   (ii) in the
case of Taxes not included in clause (i) of this  Section 7.7.3 that are
imposed on a periodic basis and measured by  the level of any item (including
real estate tax and whether such  tax is payable to a taxing authority, a
landlord or other third  party), deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for
the entire period  (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears
basis, the  amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period) 
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of  calendar
days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the  Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the number of calendar  days in the entire
Straddle Period.   34    7.7.4. Tax Proceedings.   7.7.4.1 In the event
that the Sellers would be liable for the  payment of any Taxes under Section
7.7.2, if assessed or imposed, and such  Taxes are assessed against or
imposed on the Company or the Buyer by any  Governmental Authority, the
Sellers, in their sole and absolute  discretion, will have the right to
participate at their own expense in any  audit involving any such Taxes
and/or to contest any assertion that any  such Taxes are payable in any
proceedings available to the Company or the  Buyer. The Sellers, on the one
hand, and the Company and the Buyer, on the  other hand, shall fully
cooperate in good faith in connection with any  such audit or other
proceeding.   7.7.4.2 In respect of any Taxes for which Sellers would be 
liable under Section 7.7.2, the Sellers will have the right to control all 
proceedings in connection with such contest or audit; provided, however, 
that, as a precondition to Sellers\' right to control such proceedings, (i) 
the Sellers shall deliver to the Buyer a written statement in which the 
Sellers agree to indemnify the Company and the Buyer, severally and not 
jointly based on each Seller\'s Seller\'s Percentage, from and against the 
entirety of any Taxes and other Losses that the Company and/or the Buyer  may
incur resulting from, arising out of, relating to or caused by such 
proceedings, and (ii) the Sellers shall conduct the defense actively and 
diligently; and provided further, however, that the Sellers shall not 
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement without 
the prior written consent of the Company and/or the Buyer, which consent 
shall not be unreasonably withheld, if (x) (A) such judgment or settlement 
is likely to establish a precedential custom or practice materially  adverse
to the continuing business of the Company and/or the Buyer for  periods
beginning after the Closing Date or (B) the Taxes at issue in the  proceeding
relate to a Straddle Period, and (y) the Buyer agrees to limit  the Sellers\'
liability with respect to the Tax items relating to such  judgment or
settlement to the amount of such judgment or settlement.   7.7.4.3 So long
as the Sellers are conducting the defense in  accordance with Section
7.7.4.2, and subject to the Buyer\'s rights in  Section 7.7.4.2, the Company
and/or the Buyer may retain separate  co-counsel at their sole cost and
expense and may participate in, but not  control, such defense.   7.7.4.4
In the event that any of the conditions in Section  7.7.4.2 is or becomes
unsatisfied, (i) the Company and/or the Buyer may  control the defense, and
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter  into any settlement, in any
manner that they reasonably may deem  appropriate, with the consent of the
Sellers, which consent shall not be  unreasonably withheld, (ii) the Sellers
shall reimburse the Company and/or  the Buyer promptly and periodically for
the costs of defense (including  reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses)
and (iii) the Sellers shall  remain severally but not jointly responsible, on
the basis of each  Seller\'s Seller\'s Percentage, for any Taxes and other
Losses that the  Company and/or the Buyer may incur resulting from, arising
out of,  relating to or caused by such proceedings.   35    7.7.5.
Indemnification for Taxes.   7.7.5.1 Sellers will severally but not jointly
(on the basis  of each Seller\'s Seller\'s Percentage) indemnify and hold
harmless, to the  fullest extent permitted by law, the Buyer and the Company
from, against  and in respect of (without duplication) all (i) Taxes for
which the  Sellers are liable under Section 7.1 and/or Section 7.7.2, (ii)
Buyer\'s  and/or the Company\'s Losses to the extent required under Section
7.7.4,  and (iii) breaches of any representation or warranty made by the
Company  in Section 5.13.   7.7.5.2 The Buyer and the Company will
indemnify and hold  harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
Sellers from and  against any Taxes of the Company for which Buyer and the
Company are  liable under Section 7.1 and Section 7.7.2. Buyer and the
Company shall  not take any action or position which would reasonably be
likely to result  in an indemnity payment pursuant to Section 7.7.5, without
the prior  written consent of the Sellers\' Representative, which consent
shall not be  unreasonably withheld.   7.7.5.3 The Sellers will be entitled
to all refunds of Taxes  of the Company, and any amounts credited against
Taxes to which the  Company becomes entitled, to the extent such refunds or
credits relate to  any Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than any refunds that
are addressed  through the calculation of the Closing Working Capital
Amount). The Buyer  and the Company agree to carry back any losses of the
Company from Tax  periods that end on or before the Closing Date to Pre-
Closing Tax Periods  to the extent permitted. If the Buyer or the Company
receives any refund  or credit to which the Sellers are entitled under this
Section 7.7.5.3,  the Buyer will promptly pay in cash the amount of such
refund or credit to  the Sellers\' Representative. Upon request of the
Sellers\' Representative,  the Buyer agrees to obtain a transcript of account
for the Company from  federal and state authorities and deliver the same to
the Sellers\'  Representative.   7.7.5.4 The amount of any payment
otherwise required under  this Section 7.7 will be reduced to take into
account any Tax Benefit  realized as a result of the recognition of the
liability for Taxes (and,  as applicable, related Losses) of the indemnified
party.   7.7.5.5 Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary 
notwithstanding, Section 5.13, Section 7.1 and this Section 7.7 shall 
exclusively govern the parties\' respective liability for, and 
indemnification rights and obligations with respect to, Taxes. Article 10 
(including the indemnification procedures and any limitations on 
indemnification set forth therein) shall not apply to Tax matters.   7.7.5.6
The representations, warranties and covenants  contained in Section 5.13,
Section 7.1 and this Section 7.7 shall survive  until the expiration of the
statutes of limitations applicable to the  Taxes at issue (giving effect to
any extension thereof); provided,  however, that a party\'s obligations to
indemnify with respect to Taxes  shall not terminate with respect to any item
as to which the person to be  indemnified shall have, before the expiration
of the applicable period,  previously made a   36    claim by delivering
a notice of such claim (stating in reasonable detail  the basis of such
claim) to the indemnifying party.   7.8. Employee Benefits. The Buyer agrees
that for purposes of participation, vesting and accrual of vacation time and
other benefits, as applicable (i) service under any qualified defined
contribution plans of the Company shall be treated as service under the
Buyer\'s qualified defined contribution plans, and (ii) service under any
other employee benefit plans of the Company shall be treated as service under
any corresponding employee benefit plans maintained by the Buyer. The Buyer
shall cause the Buyer\'s welfare benefit plans that cover the Company\'s
employees after the Closing to (i) waive any waiting period and restrictions
and limitations for pre-existing conditions or insurability (except for pre-
existing conditions that were excluded under the Company\'s welfare benefit
plans), and (ii) cause any deductible, co-insurance or maximum out-of-pocket
payments made by the Company\'s employees under the Company\'s welfare
benefit plans to be credited to such employees under the Buyer\'s welfare
benefit plans, so as to reduce the amount of any deductible, co-insurance or
maximum out-of-pocket payments payable by the Company\'s employees under the
Buyer\'s welfare benefit plans.   7.9. Other Offers. From the date hereof
until the Closing Date or earlier termination of this Agreement, no Seller
shall, and Sellers will cause the Company and its directors, officers,
employees and representatives not to, directly or indirectly, take any action
to solicit, initiate, encourage, or furnish any information in connection
with, or enter into any discussions or negotiations concerning, any
Acquisition Proposal. For purposes hereof, an "Acquisition Proposal" means
any offer or proposal for, or any indication of interest in, a business
combination involving the Company or the acquisition of any equity interest
in, or a material portion of the assets of, the Company, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall promptly
notify the Buyer of any Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall include the
identity of all relevant parties thereto. The Company further agrees not to
amend its Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-115201) after the
date hereof.   7.10. Notices of Certain Events.   7.10.1. The Company
shall promptly notify the Buyer of:   7.10.1.1 any notice or other
communication from any Person  alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in  connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and   7.10.1.2 any Action commenced or threatened against,
relating  to or involving or otherwise affecting the Company that, if pending
on the  date of this Agreement would have been required to be disclosed
pursuant  to Section 5.8, or that relate to the consummation of the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement.   7.10.2. The Buyer shall
promptly notify the Company and the Sellers\' Representative of:   7.10.2.1
any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent
of such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and   37    7.10.2.2 any Action commenced
or threatened against, relating  to or involving or otherwise affecting the
Buyer that, if pending on the  date of this Agreement would have been
required to be disclosed pursuant  to Section 6.4, or that relate to the
consummation of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement.   7.11.
Non-Compete; Non-Solicitation.   7.11.1. Each SKM Seller agrees that for a
period of three years following the Closing Date, such SKM Seller shall not,
either directly or indirectly, as a principal or for its own account, own,
manage, operate, join, control or participate in the ownership, management,
operation or control of, any Competing Business together with any Seller that
is a current or former employee of the Company; provided, however, that the
ownership of not more than 5% of the outstanding stock of any publicly traded
company shall not be a violation of the restrictions set forth in this
sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the contrary
contained herein, the acquisition or possession of an equity or partnership
interest, for investment purposes, by a non-SKM Seller in a Seller that is an
Affiliate of the Sellers\' Representative shall not be deemed to violate the
provisions of this Section 7.11.1. For purposes of this Section 7.11.1, a
"Competing Business" means a restaurant business that (i) is in the "upscale
family casual" category; (ii) has a guest check average within 20% (plus or
minus) of the Company\'s guest check average; and (iii) has a menu, theme or
decor that is similar to the menu, theme or decor of the Company\'s
restaurants.   7.11.2. Each Seller agrees that for a period of two years
following the Closing Date, such Seller shall not, directly or indirectly,
request, induce or seek to induce any employee of the Company to terminate
his or her employment with the Company, other than any such employee whose
employment with the Company terminates other than as a result of the direct
or indirect solicitation by such Seller; provided, that advertisements by a
Seller and contacts by recruiters directed generally and not to such employee
by a Seller shall not constitute a violation hereof.   7.11.3. If any
provision contained in this Section 7.11 shall for any reason be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Section,
but this Section shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. It is the
intention of the parties that if any of the restrictions or covenants
contained herein is held to cover a geographic area or to be for a length of
time which is not permitted by applicable law, or in any way construed to be
too broad or to any extent invalid, such provision shall not be construed to
be null, void and of no effect, but to the extent such provision would be
valid or enforceable under applicable law, a court of competent jurisdiction
shall construe and interpret or reform this Section 7.11 to provide for a
covenant having the maximum enforceable geographic area, time period and
other provisions (not greater than those contained herein) as shall be valid
and enforceable under such applicable law. Each Seller acknowledges that the
Buyer would be irreparably harmed by any breach of this Section 7.11 and that
there would be no adequate remedy at law or in damages to compensate the
Buyer for any such breach. Each Seller agrees that the Buyer shall be
entitled to injunctive relief requiring specific performance by such Seller
of this Section 7.11.   38    7.12. New Restaurant Expenditures. Sellers
shall cause the Company to make capital expenditures, including with respect
to new restaurants, in the Ordinary Course of Business.   7.13. Related
Party Accounts and Agreements. As of the Closing, no accounts reflecting
transactions between any Seller or any Affiliate of a Seller, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other, will be outstanding other than those
arising in the Ordinary Course of Business, and any agreements relating to
any such transactions shall have been terminated. In order to
avoid confusion, in the event that any such agreement remains existing on the
Closing Date, the parties to such agreement hereby terminate any such
agreement effective as of the Closing Date other than those agreements listed
on Schedule 7.13. In addition, any loan outstanding, directly or indirectly,
from the Company to any officer, director or employee of the Company shall
have been repaid in full as of the Closing Date, except to the extent that
such loan would not violate the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002.   7.14. Sellers\' Representative.   7.14.1. Each of the Sellers
hereby irrevocably appoints Saunders Karp and Megrue, LLC or its designee (as
appointed in writing), as the agent, proxy, and attorney-in-fact for such
Seller for all purposes under this Agreement (including full power and
authority to act on the Seller\'s behalf) to take any action in accordance
with and pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (i) to consummate the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement in accordance with the terms
hereof, and in connection therewith to waive any condition set forth in
Section 9 and to act on behalf of the Sellers for all purposes of Sections
3.4 and 3.5; (ii) to conduct or cease to conduct the defense of all claims
against any of the Sellers in connection with this Agreement, other than
claims made solely under Section 10.2.1, and to settle all such claims on
behalf of all the Sellers and exercise any and all rights which the Sellers
are permitted or required to do or exercise under Section 10; (iii) in
connection with any claim against or by the Sellers under this
Agreement (excluding any claim based solely on Section 10.2.1), to the extent
such amounts cannot then be recovered from the Escrow Account, to require
each Seller from time to time to deposit into a common account such amounts
(pro rated among the Sellers based on their respective Sellers\' Percentages)
as in the judgment of the Sellers\' Representative are necessary to
investigate, defend or prosecute such claim and to spend such amounts for
such purpose and then as promptly as in the judgment of the Sellers\'
Representative is prudent to pay to each Seller its pro rata share (based on
its Seller\'s Percentage) of any amounts remaining in such account; (iv) to
execute and deliver on behalf of the Sellers any amendment to this Agreement
so long as (A) such amendment applies to all Sellers equally (based on their
respective Sellers\' Percentages) and (B) such amendment does not impose any
material obligation on any Seller or materially reduce the Equity Purchase
Price; and (v) to hold in escrow and release to the Company or the Buyer
executed signature pages to this Agreement, Certificates, letters
of transmittal and any other documents or instruments delivered to the
Sellers\' Representative in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby.   7.14.2. Reimbursement; Indemnification. Each Seller
hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees to pay to the Sellers\'
Representative, promptly upon request and in any event within 10 days of such
request, such Seller\'s pro rata share (based on the respective Sellers\'
Percentages) of any amounts paid or to be paid by the Sellers\'
Representative on behalf of the Sellers and agrees to pay its pro rata share
(based on the respective Sellers\' Percentages)   39   of any and all
costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred by the
Sellers\' Representative on behalf of the Sellers in connection with
the protection, defense, expense or enforcement of any rights under this
Agreement. Further, each of the Sellers hereby agrees not to assert any claim
against, and to indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers\' Representative from
and against such Seller\'s pro rata share (based on the respective Sellers\'
Percentages) of any and all Losses incurred by, the Sellers\' Representative
or any of its partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, Sellers,
consultants, investment bankers, representatives or controlling persons, or
any Affiliate of any of the foregoing, relating to the Sellers\'
Representative\'s capacity as a Sellers\' Representative other than such
claims or Losses resulting from the Sellers\' Representative\'s gross
negligence or willful misconduct.   7.14.3. Miscellaneous. Any settlement
entered into or other action taken by any individual Seller shall be valid
only to the extent not inconsistent with this Section 7.14, and no such
settlement or action shall bind or otherwise affect the rights or obligations
of the Sellers\' Representative or any other Seller. In the event of the
default by any Seller of any payment obligations under this Section 7.14, the
defaulted amount shall, as between the Sellers\' Representative and the
Sellers (but without creating any obligations to the Buyer), be pro rated
(based on their respective Sellers\' Percentages) among the non-defaulting
Sellers. The Sellers\' Representative may resign such position at any time,
effective with respect to each Seller thirty days after written notice
thereof is delivered to such Seller or is delivered to the last address of
such Seller provided by such Seller to the Sellers\' Representative;
provided, however, that if any such resignation occurs prior to the
termination of the Sellers\' indemnification obligations under Section
10.2.1, the Sellers\' Representative shall assign its obligations under this
Section 7.14 to a successor Sellers\' Representative in connection with such
resignation, and the effectiveness of such assignment shall be a condition to
the effectiveness of such resignation. Any and all payments made by any of
the Sellers under this Section 7.14 shall be made free and clear of any
present or future taxes, deductions, charges or withholdings and all
liabilities with respect thereto.  8. CONDITIONS TO THE OBLIGATION TO CLOSE

10.3.1. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 10.3 and in Section 7.7,
(i) no Seller shall have any obligation to indemnify any Buyer Indemnitee
pursuant to Sections 10.2.2, 10.2.3, 10.2.4 or 10.2.5 unless and until, and
only to the extent that, the aggregate of all such individual Losses incurred
or sustained by all Buyer Indemnitees with respect to which Buyer Indemnitees
are entitled to indemnification under Sections 10.2.2, 10.2.3, 10.2.4 and

similar qualifications and without any dollar thresholds.   10.3.4.

or any Buyer Indemnitee arising out of any Wage and Hour Dispute for which
Losses the Buyer or such Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to recovery from
the first dollar and without limitation as to amount or time. To the
extent that any claim raised in a Wage and Hour Dispute relates to any period
after the Closing Date, the amount of any Losses payable under this Section
10.3.4 shall be allocated between the Sellers and the Buyer on the basis of
the number of days on which the alleged wrongful action or conduct occurred
that took place on or prior to the Closing Date and the number of days during
which the alleged wrongful action or conduct occurred that took place after
the Closing Date.   44    10.4. Time Limitations. Regardless of any

representation or warranty (other than for breach of the representations and
warranties contained in Sections 4.2, 4.4, 5.2, 5.14.2, 5.14.3 and 6.1.2,
claims for which shall survive indefinitely (subject to any applicable
statutes of limitation with respect to the subject matter of
such representations and warranties)) shall be valid unless notice
thereof, describing with reasonable specificity (in light of the facts then
known) the amount and basis of such claim, is delivered to the relevant
indemnifying parties on or prior to the close of business on the date which
is eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date.   10.5. Limitation on
Remedies. From and after the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy of each
Seller Indemnitee and Buyer Indemnitee as against any Person, with respect to
all claims relating to the subject matter of this Agreement (other than
claims relating to Taxes), shall be pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this Section 10. From and after the date hereof until
the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy of each Seller Indemnitee
(including the Company) and each Buyer Indemnitee with respect to any breach
or inaccuracy of any of the representations and warranties set forth
in Sections 4, 5 and 6 or any breach of any of the covenants and agreements
set forth in Section 7 shall be termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 12. In furtherance of the foregoing, effective as of the Closing
Date, (i) each Seller shall be deemed to release, remise and forever
discharge any and all rights, claims and causes of action it may now or
hereafter have against the Buyer and any of its respective Affiliates,
members, partners, shareholders, officers, directors, employees, agents and
representatives and their respective Affiliates (including the Company)
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, other than (w) claims for
indemnification asserted as permitted by and in accordance with the
provisions set forth in this Section 10, (x) claims by directors, officers
and employees of the Company for indemnification with respect to any periods
prior to the Closing, (y) to the extent permitted under Section 12.2, claims
asserted after termination of this Agreement and (z) claims arising out of
fraud, (ii) the Buyer shall be deemed to release, remise and forever
discharge any and all rights, claims and causes of action it may now
or hereafter have against any and all of the Sellers, their respective
Affiliates, members, partners, shareholders, officers, directors, employees,
agents and representatives and their respective Affiliates relating to the
subject matter of this Agreement, other than (x) claims for indemnification
asserted as permitted by and in accordance with the provisions set forth in
this Section 10, (y) to the extent permitted under Section 12.2, claims
asserted after termination of this Agreement, and (z) claims arising out of
fraud, and (iii) the parties agree that the waiver in writing of any
condition to Closing based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty,
or on the performance of or compliance with any covenant, agreement or
obligation, shall be deemed a waiver of the right to indemnification under
this Section 10 or Section 7.7 with respect to the specific inaccuracy of
such representation or warranty, or the specific failure to perform or
compliance with such covenant, agreement or obligation, in any such case as
set forth in such written waiver. The Buyer represents that it has no
Knowledge of the inaccuracy or non-compliance of any representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation made or undertaken by the Sellers or the
Company in this Agreement or the Schedules attached hereto.   10.6. Third
Party Claims. Promptly after the receipt by any Person entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Section 10 (the "Indemnified Party") of
notice of the   45   commencement of any action against such Indemnified
Party by a third party (such action, a "Third Party Claim"), such Indemnified
Party shall, if a claim with respect thereto is to be made against any party
obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to this Section 10 (the
"Indemnifying Party"), give such Indemnifying Party written notice of such
Third Party Claim in reasonable detail in light of the circumstances then
known to such Indemnified Party. The failure to give such notice shall not
relieve any Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder except to the
extent that such failure materially prejudices such Indemnifying Party. Such
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend such Third Party Claim, at
such Indemnifying Party\'s expense and with counsel of its choice reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, provided that the Indemnifying Party
conducts the defense of such Third Party Claim actively and diligently, and
provided further there is not a conflict of interest between the positions of
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party in conducting the defense of
such claim as determined by the Indemnified Party, in consultation with
outside counsel and the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party agrees to reasonably cooperate in such defense at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party. So long as the Indemnifying Party is
conducting the defense of such claim actively and diligently, the Indemnified
Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and may
participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim, and neither
any Indemnifying Party nor any Indemnified Party will consent to the entry of
any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the other, which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless (i) the proposed settlement
imposes only monetary payment obligations which are to be paid exclusively by
the Indemnifying Party, and (ii) such settlement includes a full release of
the Indemnified Party in respect of all indemnifiable Losses resulting
therefrom, related thereto or arising therefrom. In the event the
Indemnifying Party does not or ceases to conduct the defense of such Third
Party Claim actively and diligently (x) the Indemnified Party may defend
against, and, with the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), consent to the entry
of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to, such Third
Party Claim (provided that the Indemnifying Party may retain separate co-
counsel at its sole cost and expense and may participate in the defense of
such Third Party Claim), (y) the Indemnifying Party will reimburse the
Indemnified Party for the costs of defending against such Third Party Claim
to the extent provided in this Section 10 and (z) the Indemnifying Party will
remain responsible for any Losses the Indemnified Party may suffer as a
result of such Third Party Claim to the extent provided in this Section 10.
The parties agree that any Wage and Hour Dispute and the items set forth on
Schedule 5.8 hereto shall be treated as a Third Party Claim and shall be
subject to the provisions of this Section 10.6.   10.7. Equity Purchase
Price Adjustment. Any indemnification payment made by the Company, the Buyer
or the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated by the Buyer and
the Sellers as an adjustment to the Equity Purchase Price for Tax and all
other purposes.   10.8. Tax Indemnity. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, Section 7.7, rather than this Section 10, shall apply
exclusively to indemnification with respect to Taxes.   46   11. CONSENT
TO JURISDICTION; JURY TRIAL WAIVER.   11.1. Consent to Jurisdiction. Each
party to this Agreement, by its execution hereof, (a) hereby irrevocably
submits, and agrees to cause each of its Subsidiaries to submit, to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts of the State of New York located
in New York County or the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York for the purpose of any action, claim, cause of action or
suit (in contract, tort or otherwise), inquiry proceeding or investigation
arising out of or based upon this Agreement or relating to the subject matter
hereof, (b) hereby waives, and agrees to cause each of its Subsidiaries to
waive, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law, and agrees not to
assert, and agrees not to allow any of its Subsidiaries to assert, by way of
motion, as a defense or otherwise, in any such action, any claim that it is
not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that

47   12. TERMINATION.   12.1. Termination of Agreement. This Agreement

Buyer and the Sellers\' Representative may terminate this Agreement by mutual
written consent at any time prior to the Closing.   12.1.2. The Buyer may
terminate this Agreement by delivering written notice to the Sellers at any
time prior to the Closing in the event the Sellers or the Company are in
material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement, the Buyer has notified the Sellers and the
Company of the breach in writing, there is a reasonable likelihood that
such breach (unless cured, if curable) will result in an inability of the
Sellers or the Company to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 8 and
such breach, if curable, has continued without cure for a period of 10 days
after delivery of such notice of breach.   12.1.3. The Sellers\'
Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, may terminate this Agreement by
delivering written notice to the Buyer at any time prior to the Closing in
the event the Buyer is in material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, the Sellers have notified
the Buyer of the breach in writing, there is a reasonable likelihood that
such breach will (unless cured, if curable) result in an inability of the
Buyer to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 9 and such breach, if
curable, has continued without cure for a period of 10 days after delivery of
such notice of breach.   12.1.4. The Buyer or the Sellers\' Representative,
on behalf of the Sellers, may terminate this Agreement by providing written
notice to the other at any time on or after July 30, 2004, if the Closing of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not have occurred by
reason of the failure of any condition set forth in Section 8, in the case of
the Buyer, or Section 9, in the case of the Sellers\' Representative, to be
satisfied (other than through the failure of any party seeking to terminate
this Agreement to comply fully with its obligations under this
Agreement).   12.2. Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.1, all obligations of the parties
hereunder (other than obligations under Sections 11 and 12, which shall
survive termination) shall terminate without any liability of any party to
any other party; provided, however, that no termination by a party pursuant
to Sections 12.1.2, 12.1.3 and 12.1.4 shall relieve such party from any
liability arising from or relating to any material breach of any covenant or
agreement by such party prior to termination.  13. MISCELLANEOUS.   13.1.

possible under, applicable law. The provisions hereof are severable, and in
the event any provision hereof should be held invalid or unenforceable in any
respect, it shall not invalidate, render unenforceable or otherwise
affect any other provision hereof.   13.4. Successors and Assigns. All of
the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective permitted

(a) no transfer or assignment by any party hereto shall be permitted without
the prior written consent of the other parties hereto and any such attempted
transfer or assignment without consent shall be null and void and (b) no
