Section 1.7 _Tax Consequences_. The Parties intend that, for
United States federal, and applicable state, income tax purposes, (i) the
Company Merger will be treated as a taxable sale by the Company of all of the
Company's assets to Parent in exchange for the Merger Consideration to be
provided to the stockholders of the Company and the assumption of all of the
Company's liabilities, followed by the distribution of such Merger
Consideration to the stockholders of the Company in liquidation of the Company
pursuant to Section 331 and Section 562 of the Code, and that this Agreement
be, and is hereby adopted as, a "plan of liquidation" of the Company for U.S.
federal income tax purposes and (ii) the Partnership Merger will, in the case
of each holder of Partnership Units that receives the Merger Consideration in
the Partnership Merger, be treated as a taxable purchase of Partnership
Units by Parent. If Parent determines in its sole discretion that the
appreciated value of Parent Common Stock on the Closing Date or the reduction
of the cash portion of the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
2.1(d)(i)_ could cause the Company Merger to fail to be treated as described
in this _Section 1.7_ , Parent may cause Merger Sub to be treated as a
partnership for United States federal income tax purposes. If the Company
determines in its sole discretion that the appreciated value of Parent Common
Stock on the Closing Date or the reduction of the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)(i)_ could cause the Company Merger
to fail to be treated as described in this _Section 1.7_ , Parent shall, at
the Company's request, cause Merger Sub to be treated as a partnership for
United States federal income tax purposes.

  



  

ARTICLE II 
  
 TREATMENT OF SECURITIES

  



  

Section 2.1 _Treatment of Capital Stock_.

  



  

(a) At the Company Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Company
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any securities of
the Company or of Merger Sub:

  



  

(i) _Treatment of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Company
Merger Effective Time (other than Company Shares to be cancelled in
accordance with _Section 2.4(a)_ ) shall be converted into the right to
receive (A) that number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares
of Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient determined by dividing $3.75 by
the Average Parent Closing Price and rounding the result to the nearest
1/10,000 of a share (the " _Exchange Ratio_ "); _provided_ , that if the
Average Parent Closing Price is less than $16.00, the Exchange Ratio will be
0.2344, and if the Average

  



    

5 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

Parent Closing Price is greater than $20.17, the Exchange Ratio will be
0.1859 (the " _Stock Consideration_ "), and (B) $7.75 in cash (the " _Cash
Consideration_ "), subject to adjustment as provided in _Section 2.1(c)_ and
subject to any applicable withholding Tax (collectively, the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, all such
Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Company Share shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Company Share in
accordance with _Section 2.2_ , including the right to receive, pursuant to
_Section 2.6_ , cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, if
any, into which such shares of Company Common Stock have been converted
pursuant to this _Section 2.1(a)_ (the " _Fractional Share Consideration_
"), together with the amounts, if any, payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(f)_.

  



  

(ii) _Treatment of Merger Sub Membership Interests_. All
membership interests of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Company Merger Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding as
membership interests of the Surviving Entity.

  



  

(b) At the Partnership Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the
Partnership Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any
securities of the Company Operating Partnership or Partnership Merger Sub:

  



  

(i) _Treatment of Partnership Units_. Each Company OP Unit issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective
Time held by a limited partner of the Company Operating Partnership (each
such Company OP Unit, a " _Partnership Unit_ ") shall be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration. The general partnership interest of
the Company Operating Partnership shall remain outstanding and constitute the
only outstanding partnership interest in the Surviving Partnership
Entity. From and after the Partnership Merger Effective Time, all Partnership
Units shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Partnership Unit shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Partnership Unit in
accordance with _Section 2.2_ , including the right to receive, pursuant to
_Section 2.6_ , the Fractional Share Consideration, together with
the amounts, if any, payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(f)_.

  



  

(ii) _Treatment of Partnership Merger Sub Membership Interests_.
The membership interests of Partnership Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

  



  

(c) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. The Merger
Consideration, Exchange Ratio and other dependent items shall be adjusted
appropriately to reflect the effect of

any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend
or other distribution of securities convertible into Company Common
Stock, Partnership Units or Parent Common Stock, as applicable),

affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), Book-Entry Shares or Partnership Units
upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange
Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with
normal exchange practices. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be

Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by

applicable Law, and from and after the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the

entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds (including
any interest received with respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund
that have not been disbursed, or for which disbursement is pending subject

Certificates or Book-Entry Shares or Partnership Units, and thereafter such
holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Entity, Surviving
Partnership Entity and Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the applicable
Merger Consideration, including any amount payable in respect of the
Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.6_ and any
dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in
accordance with  _Section 2.2(f),_ payable upon due surrender of their
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares or Partnership Units and compliance with
the procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_ , without any interest thereon.

for any Merger Consideration or other amounts delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  



  

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that

Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Exchange Agent,

Subject to applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate,
Book-Entry Share or Partnership Unit (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)
there shall be paid to the holder thereof, without interest, (i) the amount

Merger Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Parent

of the Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.6_, and

by this _Section 2.4_.

  



  

Section 2.5 _Withholding_. All amounts payable pursuant to this
_Article II_ shall be paid without interest (unless otherwise noted). Any
payments made pursuant to this Agreement __ shall be net of all applicable
withholding Taxes that the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Entity
and the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, shall be required to deduct and
withhold under applicable Law (including, but not limited to, Section 1445 of
the Code). To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the
applicable payor and remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  



  

Section 2.6 _Fractional Shares_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no
certificate or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, Book-Entry

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Company Merger
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to aggregate all

shares to its designated broker for sale on the open market at the then-
prevailing market price of Parent Common Stock, which sale or sales shall be
completed as promptly as practicable following the Company Effective Time.
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to, upon receipt of the proceeds of
such sale or sales of such fractional shares from such designated broker,
distribute the proceeds of such sale or sales of such fractional shares to
the holders of Company Common Stock, Partnership Units or Restricted Company
Shares immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time in accordance
with the terms of this _Section 2.6_. Until the proceeds of such sale
or sales have been so distributed, the Exchange Agent shall hold such
proceeds in an account for the benefit of the holders of Company Common
Stock, Partnership Units and Restricted Company Shares immediately prior to
the Company Merger Effective Time (the " _Fractional Shares Fund_ "). The
portion of the Fractional Shares Fund (net of any brokerage commissions
retained by the Exchange Agent's designated broker) to which each holder of
Company Common Stock, Partnership Units or Restricted Company Shares
immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time shall be entitled, if
any, shall be determined by multiplying (i) the amount of the
aggregate proceeds comprising the Fractional Shares Fund (net of any
brokerage commissions retained by the Exchange Agent's designated broker) by
(ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate amount of the
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled to
receive in the Mergers and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of
fractional shares of Parent to which all holders of Company Common Stock,
Partnership Units and Company Restricted Shares immediately prior to the
Effective Time are entitled to receive in the Mergers.

(a) Since January 1, 2011, the Company has designed and maintained a
system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules

as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements and to maintain
asset accountability, (iv) that access to assets is permitted only in

the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets
at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences. Since January 1, 2011, (x) the Company has designed and

13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and
is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, (y) to the knowledge of
the

  



    

18 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

Company, such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely
alerting the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of

the Company as of the date of this Agreement, the principal executive officer

likely to adversely affect in any material respect the Company's ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other individuals who
have a significant role in the Company's internal controls over financial
reporting. As of the date of this Agreement, the principal executive officer
and principal financial officer of the Company have made all certifications
required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder, and the statements contained in all such certifications were, as
of their respective dates made, complete and correct in all

Company or any Company Subsidiary has (i) used any corporate funds for any

and correct in all material respects. Parent and each Parent Subsidiary
has duly paid (or there has been paid on their behalf), or made adequate
provisions for, all material amounts of Taxes required to be paid by them,

ending on or after December 31, 2009 have been provided or made available to
the Company.

subject to taxation as a REIT and has satisfied all requirements to qualify as
a REIT for such years; (ii) has operated since January 1, 2014 until the date
hereof in a manner consistent with the requirements for qualification and
taxation as a REIT; (iii) intends to continue to operate in such a manner as
to qualify as a REIT; and (iv) has not to its knowledge taken or omitted
to take any action that could reasonably be expected to result in a challenge
by the IRS or any other Governmental Entity to its status as a REIT, and to
the knowledge of Parent, no such challenge is pending or threatened.

  



  

(c) (i) There are no current disputes, audits, examinations,

Subsidiaries have not received a written notice or announcement of any
audits, examinations, investigation or other proceedings; (iii) no deficiency
for Taxes of Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries has been claimed,
proposed or assessed, or threatened, in each case, in writing, by any
Governmental Entity, which deficiency has not yet been settled, except for
such deficiencies which are being contested in good faith or with respect to

would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect;
and (iv) neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has in the past three years
received a claim in writing by a Governmental Entity in any jurisdiction in

(y) transfer or similar Taxes arising in connection with acquisitions or
dispositions of property. To the knowledge of Parent, as of the date hereof,
no event has occurred and no condition or circumstance exists, which presents
a material risk that any material Tax described in the preceding
sentence will be imposed upon Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries.

period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate; and

  



  

(IV) following the end of such notice period, the Company Board of
Directors shall have considered in good faith any proposed revisions to this
Agreement proposed by Parent (or as to other proposals made by Parent) in
writing, and shall have determined, after consultation with its independent
financial advisors and outside legal counsel that such Superior Proposal would
continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such revisions were to be given
effect; _provided_ , that in the event of any material change to the material
terms of such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have
delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with that described in
subclause (II) above and the notice period shall have recommenced, except that
the notice period shall be at least two (2) business days; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that any purported termination of this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 5.3(e)_  shall be void and of no force and effect, unless the
Company termination is in accordance with _Section 8.1(e)_ and the
Company pays Parent the Company Termination Payment in accordance with
_Section 8.2(b)_ prior to or concurrently with such termination.

  



  

(f) Nothing in this _Section 5.3_ shall prohibit the Company Board of
Directors from: (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company

communication to the Company's stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the

  



    

63

Exchange Act, in either case, if the Company Board of Directors has
determined in good faith, after consultation with legal counsel, that the
failure to do so would create a material risk of a breach by the Company
Board of Directors of its duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , that any
disclosures (other than those made pursuant to clause (ii) of this _Section
5.3(f)_ ) that are not an express rejection of any applicable Competing
Proposal or an express reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation shall
be deemed a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

  



  

(g) The Company acknowledges and agrees that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.3_ by any Subsidiary of the
Company or the Representatives of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company acting at the direction of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 5.3_ by the
Company.

  



  

(h) As used in this Agreement, " _Competing Proposal_ " shall mean any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other than Parent and its
Subsidiaries) or "group", within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act, relating to, in a single transaction or series of related transactions,
any (A) acquisition of assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries equal to 20%
or more of the Company's consolidated assets or to which 20% or more of the
Company's revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable, (B)
acquisition of 20% or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock, (C) tender

(i) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any
written Competing Proposal that was not the result of a breach by the Company
of this _Section 5.3_ in any material respect and that the Company Board of
Directors has determined, after consulting with the Company's outside legal
counsel and independent financial advisors is reasonably likely to be
consummated in accordance with its terms and that if consummated, would
reasonably be likely to result in a transaction more favorable to
the Company's stockholders from a financial point of view than the
Transactions (including any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed
by Parent in response to such proposal or otherwise); _provided_ , that for
purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal," the references to "20%" in
the definition of Competing Proposal shall be deemed to be references to
"50%."

  



  

Section 5.4 _Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement_.

shall cooperate and provide the other a reasonable opportunity to review and

after it receives notice thereof, of the time of effectiveness of the Form
S-4, the issuance of any stop order relating thereto or the suspension of the
qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Mergers for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted,
reversed or otherwise terminated. Parent shall also use reasonable best
efforts to take any other action required to be taken under the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act, any applicable foreign or state securities or "blue
sky" Laws and the rules and regulations thereunder in connection with the
issuance of the Parent Common Stock in the Mergers, and the Company shall
furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders of the Company
Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such
actions.

  



  

(b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval or the Parent Stockholder Approval, any information relating to the
Company or Parent, or any of their respective affiliates, should be
discovered by the Company or Parent which, in the reasonable judgment of the
Company or Parent, should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to,
any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that any of such
documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties, and the
Company and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any
necessary

amendment of, or supplement to, the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4
and, to the extent required by Law, in disseminating the information contained
in such amendment or supplement to stockholders of the Company and the
stockholders of Parent. Nothing in this _Section 5.4(b)_ shall limit the
obligations of any Party under _Section 5.4(a)_. For purposes of this
_Section 5.4_, any information concerning or related to the Company, its
affiliates or the Company Stockholder Meeting will be deemed to have been
provided by the Company, and any information concerning or related to Parent,
its affiliates or the Parent Stockholder Meeting will be deemed to have been

after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. The
Company shall, through the Company Board of Directors, recommend to its
stockholders that they give the Company Stockholder Approval, include such
recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement and solicit and use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval,
except to the extent that the Company Board of Directors shall have made a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by _Section 5.3(e)_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.4(c)_, if, on a
date for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled, the Company has
not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Company
Common Stock to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a
quorum is present, Parent may require the Company, and the Company shall have
the right, to adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting up to two
(2) times (provided, that the Company Stockholder Meeting shall not be
postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than thirty (30) days after the
date for which the Company Stockholder Meeting was originally scheduled
(excluding any adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law));
_provided_ , _however_ , the Company Stockholder Meeting may not be postponed
or adjourned on the date the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled if the
Company shall have received proxies in respect of an aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock, which have not been withdrawn, such that the
Company Stockholder Approval will be obtained at such meeting.

  



  

(d) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement,
Parent shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Parent Governing
Documents, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene

Parent Stockholder Meeting as soon as practicable after the Form S-4 is
declared effective under the Securities Act. Parent shall, through the Parent
Board of Directors, recommend to its stockholders that they give the Parent
Stockholder Approval, include such recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement, and solicit and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
Parent Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 5.4(d)_, if, on a date for which the Parent Stockholder Meeting is
scheduled, Parent has not received proxies

representing a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock to obtain
the Parent Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, the
Company may require Parent, and Parent shall have the right, to adjourn or
postpone the Parent Stockholder Meeting up to two (2) times (provided, that
the Parent Stockholder Meeting shall not be postponed or adjourned to a date
that is more than thirty (30) days after the date for which the Parent
Stockholder Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any adjournments or
postponements required by applicable Law)); _provided_ , _however_ , the
Parent Stockholder Meeting may not be postponed or adjourned on the date the
Parent Stockholder Meeting is scheduled if Parent shall have received proxies
in respect of an aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock, which
have not been withdrawn, such that Parent Stockholder Approval will be
obtained at such meeting. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed
to relieve Parent of its obligation to submit the issuance of the Parent
Common Stock in the Mergers to its stockholders for a vote on the approval
thereof.

  



  

(e) The Company and Parent will use their respective reasonable best
efforts to hold the Company Stockholder Meeting and the Parent Stockholder
Meeting on the same date and as soon as reasonably practicable after the date

subject to the reasonable restrictions imposed from time to time upon advice
of counsel, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of the
Parent Subsidiaries and the Company Subsidiaries, respectively, to, and with
respect to the Company only, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Company Advisor and the Company Sub-Advisor to, afford to the other
Party and to the Representatives of such other Party reasonable access during

respective properties, offices, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and
records and, during such period, each of the Company and Parent shall,
and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries and the Parent Subsidiaries,
respectively, to, furnish reasonably promptly to the other Party (i) a copy

other information (financial or otherwise) concerning its business,
properties and personnel as such other Party may reasonably
request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor Parent shall
be required by this _Section 6.1_ to provide the other Party or the

party entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or entered into
after the date of this Agreement in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the withholding
Party shall use its reasonable best efforts

to obtain the required consent of such third party to such access or
disclosure), (y) the disclosure of which would violate any Law or duty (
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the withholding Party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable

, _however_ , that the withholding Party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure to the maximum extent
that does not result in a loss of any such attorney-client, attorney work
product or other legal privilege). Each of the Company and Parent will use its
reasonable best efforts to minimize any disruption to the businesses of the
other Party that may result from the requests for access, data and information
hereunder. Prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, each of Parent, Merger
Sub and Partnership Merger Sub shall not, and shall cause their respective
Representatives and affiliates not to, contact or otherwise communicate with
the employees of the Company Advisor or the Company Sub-Advisor (other than

any information exchanged pursuant to this _Section 6.1_, in confidence to
the extent required by and in accordance with, and will otherwise comply
with, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreements.

give prompt notice to the Company, (i) of any notice or other communication
received by such Party (A) from any Governmental Entity in connection with
this Agreement, the Mergers or the other Transactions, (B) from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person (or another Person) is or may be
required in connection with the Mergers or the other Transactions, or (C)
with respect to the Company only, of any written notice received from any
Person in connection with (I) any violation or default under or notice to
terminate, not renew or challenge the validity or enforceability of any
Company Material Contract or any Material Company Lease or (II) any event or
circumstance that would give rise to any option to purchase, right of first
refusal or first offer, or any other right to purchase in favor of any Person
under any Company Material Contract or Material Company Lease, which, in each
case of clause (I) or (II) would, individually, cause losses to the Company or
any Company Subsidiary of more than $5,000,000 or, in the aggregate, cause
losses to the Company or any Company Subsidiary of more than
$25,000,000, (ii) of any Legal Proceeding commenced or, to any Party's
knowledge, threatened against, such Party or any of its Subsidiaries or

arising from or otherwise relating to the Mergers or any other Transaction,
and (iii) upon becoming aware of the occurrence or impending occurrence of
any event, change, development or circumstance relating to it or any of the
Company Subsidiaries or the Parent Subsidiaries, respectively, which makes or
is reasonably likely to make any of the conditions set forth in Article VII to
not be satisfied. The failure to deliver any such notice, in and of itself,
shall not result in the failure of, or otherwise affect, any of the conditions
set forth in Article VII.

  



  

Section 6.2 _Consents and Approvals_.

  



  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of the Company and Parent shall and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries, to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other Party in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Law or pursuant to any Contract to consummate and
make effective, as promptly as practicable, the Mergers and the other
Transactions, including (i) the taking of all actions necessary to cause the
conditions to Closing set forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied, (ii) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and
approvals from Governmental Entities or other Persons necessary in connection
with the consummation of the Mergers and the other Transactions and the making
of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with
Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may
be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Entity or other Persons necessary
in connection with the consummation of the Mergers and the other
Transactions, (iii) the defending of any Legal Proceedings, whether judicial
or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
Mergers or the other Transactions, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining Order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity
vacated or reversed, the avoidance of each and every impediment under any
antitrust, merger control, competition or trade regulation Law that may
be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Mergers so as to
enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible, and (iv) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the Mergers and the other Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of
this Agreement; _provided_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provisions of this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement (including
this _Section 6.2(a)_ ) shall require or obligate Parent or any of its
affiliates to, and the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, in each case in connection with obtaining any approval or consent
from any Governmental Entity with respect to the Mergers, (A) pay or commit to
pay any material amount of cash or other consideration, or incur or commit to
incur any material liability or other obligation, in connection
with obtaining any authorization, consent, Order, registration or approval of
a Governmental Entity or (B) agree or otherwise be required to sell, divest,
dispose of, license, hold separate, or take or commit to take any action that
limits in any respect its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability
to retain, any businesses, products, rights, services, licenses, or assets of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or any interest
or interests therein, if any such action set forth in clauses (A) or (B)
would reasonably be expected to have (x) a material adverse effect on the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (y) a
material adverse effect on Parent or its affiliates

  



    

69

(determined by reference to the magnitude of the business of the Company
being acquired by Parent pursuant hereto).

  



  

(b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each of
Parent and the Company shall give (or shall cause to be given) any notices
to any Person, and each of Parent and the Company shall use, and cause each
of their respective affiliates to use, its reasonable best efforts to obtain
any consents from any Person not covered by _Section 6.2(a)_ that are
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Mergers. Each of the Parties
will furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance
as the other may request in connection with the preparation of any required
governmental filings or submissions and will cooperate in responding to any
inquiry from a Governmental Entity, including promptly informing the other
Party of such inquiry, consulting in advance before making any presentations
or submissions to a Governmental Entity, and supplying each other with copies
of all material correspondence, filings or communications between either
Party and any Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement. To the
extent reasonably practicable, the Parties or their Representatives shall have
the right to review in advance and each of the Parties will consult the
others on, all the information relating to the other and each of their
affiliates that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any Governmental Entity in connection with the Mergers and the
other Transactions, except that confidential competitively sensitive business
information may be redacted from such exchanges. To the extent
reasonably practicable, neither the Company nor Parent shall, nor shall they
permit their respective Representatives to, participate independently in any
meeting or engage in any substantive conversation with any Governmental Entity
in respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry without giving the
other Party prior notice of such meeting or conversation and, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, without giving the other Party the opportunity
to attend or participate (whether by telephone or in person) in any such
meeting with such Governmental Entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
obtaining any approval or consent from any Person pursuant to this  _Section
6.2(b)_ shall not be a condition to the obligations of the Parties to
consummate the Mergers.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in
connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person (other than
any Governmental Entity) with respect to the Mergers, none of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Representatives, shall be obligated to pay or commit to pay
to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other
consideration, make any accommodation or commitment or incur any liability or
other obligation to such Person prior to the Company Merger Effective Time.
Subject to the foregoing sentence, the Parties shall cooperate with respect
to reasonable accommodations that may be requested or appropriate to obtain
such consents. The Parties acknowledge and agree that no approval or consent
of any such Person is a condition to the obligations of any Party to effect
the Mergers.

  



  

Section 6.3 _Publicity_. So long as this Agreement is in effect,
neither the Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective affiliates, shall
issue or cause the publication of any press release or other announcement
with respect to the Mergers or this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the other Party, unless such Party determines, after consultation
with outside counsel, that it is required by applicable Law or by any listing
agreement with or the listing rules

  



    

70

of a national securities exchange or trading market to issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other announcement with respect to the
Mergers or this Agreement, in which event such Party shall endeavor, on a
basis reasonable under the circumstances, to provide a meaningful opportunity
to the other Party to review and comment upon such press release or other
announcement and shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that, except
as set forth in _Section 5.3_ , the Company shall not be required to provide
any such review or comment to Parent in connection with the receipt and
existence of a Competing Proposal and matters related thereto or a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change; _provided_ ,  _further_ , each Party and their
respective controlled affiliates may make oral statements that are not
inconsistent with previous written press releases, public disclosures or
public statements made by Parent and the Company in compliance with this
_Section 6.3_ ; _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent shall not be required to
provide any such review or opportunity to comment to the Company, in
connection with any prospectus, "road show" materials, press release, or other
written materials in connection with any issuance of Parent Equity Interests
or other capital raising initiatives as permitted by _Section 5.2_  so long
as such statements are consistent in substance with previous written press
releases, written public disclosures or other written statements made by
Parent and the Company in compliance with this _Section 6.3_ and not adverse
to the consummation of the Mergers.

  



  

Section 6.4 _Directors ' and Officers' Insurance and Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to honor and fulfill in all
respects the obligations of the Company to the fullest extent permissible
under applicable Law, under the Company Governing Documents in effect on the
date hereof and under any indemnification or other similar agreements in
effect on the date hereof (the " _Indemnification Agreements_ ") to the
individuals covered by such Company Governing Documents or Indemnification
Agreements (the " _Covered Persons_ ") arising out of or relating to actions
or omissions in their capacity as such occurring at or prior to the Company
Merger Effective Time, including in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and the Transactions.

  



  

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 6.4(a)_ , for a period
of six (6) years after the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent (but only to
the extent the Covered Persons would be permitted to be indemnified by the
Company under the Company Governing Documents and applicable Law) and the
Surviving Entity shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to: (i)
indemnify and hold harmless each Covered Person against and from any costs or
expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to: (A) any
action or omission or alleged action or omission in such Covered Person's
capacity as such, or (B) this Agreement and any of the Transactions; and (ii)
pay in advance of the final disposition of any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation the expenses (including attorneys' fees) of
any Covered Person upon receipt, to the extent required by applicable Law, of
an undertaking by or on behalf of such Covered Person to repay such amount if
it shall ultimately be determined that such Covered Person is not entitled to
be indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in

  



    

71 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

this _Section 6.4_  or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Parent nor the
Surviving Entity shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity not to)
settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek
termination with respect to any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation of a Covered Person for which indemnification may be sought
under this _Section 6.4(b)_  unless such settlement, compromise, consent or
termination includes an unconditional release of such Covered Person from all
liability arising out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation.

  



  

(c) For a period of six (6) years after the Company Merger Effective
Time, the limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Entity shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of Covered Persons for periods prior
to and including the Company Merger Effective Time than are currently set
forth in the Company Governing Documents and the certificate of formation of
the Surviving Entity shall not contain any provisions contrary to the
foregoing. The Indemnification Agreements with Covered Persons that survive
the Mergers shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms.

  



  

(d) For a period of six (6) years after the Company Merger Effective
Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company (
_provided_ , that Parent may substitute therefor policies with reputable and
financially sound carriers of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous) with respect
to claims arising from or related to facts or events which occurred at or
before the Company Merger Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent shall not be obligated to make annual premium payments for such
insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 300% of the annual premiums paid
as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance (such 300% amount,
the " _Base Premium_ "); _provided_ , _further_ , if such insurance
coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an annual
premium in excess of the Base Premium, Parent shall maintain the most
advantageous policies of directors' and officers' insurance obtainable for an
annual premium equal to the Base Premium; _provided_ , _further_ , if the

liability insurance "tail" or "runoff" insurance program for a period of six
(6) years after the Company Merger Effective Time with respect to wrongful
acts and/or omissions committed or allegedly committed at or prior to the
Company Merger Effective Time (such coverage shall have an aggregate coverage

aggregate coverage limit under the Company's existing directors' and
officers' liability policy, and in all other respects shall be comparable to
such existing coverage).

assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be

made

so that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of
such assets, as the case may be, shall assume all of the applicable
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.4_.

  



  

(f) The Covered Persons (and their successors and heirs) are intended

Section 6.5 _Takeover Statutes_. The Parties and their respective
boards of directors (or equivalent) shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover Statute is

if any such Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to any of the
foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the Mergers and the other
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the
effect of such Takeover Statute on the Mergers and the other Transactions.
The Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person (other than Parent,
Merger Sub and, at the request of Parent, their respective affiliates) from
any Takeover Statute of any jurisdiction that may purport to be applicable to
the Mergers or any of the other Transactions or otherwise cause any
restrictions in any Takeover Statute not to apply to any such Person, except

accordance with _Section 8.1(e)_.

Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  



  

Section 6.8 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any
Party's rights or obligations under this Agreement, the Parties understand
and agree that (i) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent,

Company Merger Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over

Proceeding related to this Agreement, the Mergers or the other Transactions
is brought against the Company and/or its officers, directors and/or
Representatives by security holders of the Company (a " _Security Holder

Parent the opportunity to participate, subject to a customary joint defense
agreement, in the defense and settlement of any such litigation against
the Company and/or its directors by security holders of the Company, and no

Section 6.12 _Financing_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including
_Section 6.12(d)_), each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its
reasonable best efforts (taking into account the anticipated timing of the
Outside Date) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause
to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and
consummate the Debt Financing and obtain the full amount of the proceeds of
the Debt Financing as soon as reasonably practicable on the terms and
conditions (including the "flex" provisions) described in the Debt Financing
Letters, including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) comply with its
obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) negotiate, execute and
deliver definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter on
terms and conditions (as such terms may be modified or adjusted in accordance
with the terms of, and within the limits of the flex provisions contained in,
the Debt Financing Letters) no less favorable in all material respects to
Parent and Merger Sub than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter,
(iii) timely prepare any offering documents, marketing materials and/or
rating agency presentations required with respect to the Debt Financing and
other information required under the Debt Commitment Letter, (iv) satisfy (or
obtain a waiver of) all conditions applicable to, and within the control of,
Parent and Merger Sub contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including
definitive agreements related thereto), (v) take all actions
reasonably necessary to satisfy the pre-closing requirements set forth in the
"Security" section, the "Cooperation" section and the "Third-party Reports"
sections in the Term Sheet to the Debt Commitment Letter and (vi)
consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing Date, subject to the
terms and conditions contained herein. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the immediately preceding sentence, each of Parent and Merger Sub
shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause each of its affiliates to take, all actions necessary to
maintain in effect, and enforce its rights under, the Debt Commitment Letter
(including any definitive agreements relating thereto). The exercise
by Parent and Merger Sub of the right under the Debt Financing Letters to
remove assets from the collateral pool of the Debt Financing (such assets, "
_Excluded Assets_ ") shall not be deemed to be a breach of Parent and Merger
Sub's obligations under this _Section 6.12(a)_ if the aggregate funds that
would be available to Parent, Merger Sub and Partnership Merger Sub at the
Closing (taking into account the amount of the Debt Financing after such
exclusion, any Alternative Debt Financing with respect to any of the Excluded
Assets, and cash on hand and marketable securities of Parent, Merger Sub,
Partnership Merger Sub, the Company and the Company\'s Subsidiaries on the
Closing Date) would be sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration, fund the
reserves required to be funded at Closing in connection with the Debt
Financing and any such Alternative Debt Financing and pay all fees and
expenses required to be paid at the Closing by Parent, Merger Sub, Partnership
Merger Sub, the Company, the Operating Partnership or the Company
Subsidiaries in connection with the Mergers, the other Transactions, the Debt
Financing and any such Alternative Debt Financing.

  



  

(b) Parent and Merger Sub shall not, without the prior written consent
of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), enter into any amendment or modification to, or grant any
waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Debt Financing Letters, if such
amendment, modification or waiver would (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the
Debt Financing or increase the aggregate amount of reserves required to

  



    

75 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

be funded at Closing in connection with the Debt Financing, or both, in each
case, such that the aggregate funds that would be available to Parent, Merger
Sub and Partnership Merger Sub at the Closing (taking into account other
financial resources of Parent, Merger Sub and Partnership Merger Sub,
including cash on hand and marketable securities of Parent, Merger Sub,
Partnership Merger Sub, the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries on the
Closing Date) would not be sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration, fund
the reserves required to be funded at Closing in connection with the Debt
Financing and pay all fees and expenses required to be paid at the Closing by
Parent, Merger Sub, Partnership Merger Sub, the Company, the Operating
Partnership or the Company Subsidiaries in connection with the Mergers, the
other Transactions and the Debt Financing, (B) impose new or additional
conditions or other terms or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the
conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing or other terms in a manner
that would reasonably be expected to (x) materially delay or prevent the
ability of Parent, Merger Sub, Partnership Merger Sub or the Company to
enforce its rights against any other party to any Debt Commitment Letter, the
ability of Parent, Merger Sub or Partnership Merger Sub to consummate the
Transactions or the likelihood of the consummation of the Transactions or (y)
make the funding of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date or satisfaction of
the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing materially less likely to
occur, or (C) relieve any Debt Financing Source of any of its funding
commitment under a Debt Commitment Letter (it being understood that Parent
may amend, restate, modify or supplement any Debt Commitment Letter to add and
appoint additional arrangers, bookrunners, underwriters, agents, lenders and
similar entities, to provide for the assignment and reallocation of a portion
of the debt financing commitments contained therein and to grant customary
approval rights to such additional arrangers and other entities in
connection with such appointments, in each case, so long as the existing Debt
Financing Sources shall remain obligated to fund the portions of the Debt
Financing as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter on the date hereof). Any
reference in this Agreement to (I) "Debt Financing" shall include the
financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Letters as amended or modified in
compliance with this _Section 6.12_ and (II) "Debt Commitment Letter" or
"Debt Financing Letters" shall include such documents as amended or modified
in compliance with this _Section 6.12(b)_.

  



  

(c) Without limiting the foregoing, to the extent necessary in order to
consummate the Debt Financing, Parent agrees that it will, or will cause
its affiliates to (i) pay or fund (or satisfy with a letter of credit, to the
extent permitted under the Term Sheet to the Debt Commitment Letter or
otherwise acceptable to the Debt Financing Sources) all reserves required by
the Debt Financing Sources pursuant to the Term Sheet to the Debt Commitment
Letter (unless Parent otherwise will have obtained Alternative Financing on or
prior to the Closing in amounts sufficient to consummate the Mergers and the
other Transactions and to make, pay and/or satisfy, on or before the
Closing Date, all fees, expenses and reimbursements contemplated by the
Financing Purposes), (ii) validly execute and deliver any "non-
recourse" carve-out guarantees required by the Debt Commitment Letter, (iii)
pay, upon request of the Debt Financing Sources, all diligence expenses
required to be reimbursed under the Debt Commitment Letter and (iv) acquire
any interest rate cap agreement required by the Debt Commitment Letter.

  



    

76 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(d) Parent and Merger Sub shall inform the Company on a reasonably
current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Debt Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and
Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt notice after becoming aware of (i)
any material breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to result
in a material breach or default) by any party to any Debt Commitment Letter or
any definitive agreement related thereto, (ii) any termination of the Debt
Financing contemplated by any Debt Commitment Letter and/or (iii)
the implementation of any of the "flex" provisions in order to effect all or
any portion of the Debt Financing, if such "flex" provisions would prevent or
delay in any material respect the ability of Parent to consummate the Mergers.

  



  

(e) If, notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts by Parent to
satisfy its obligations under this _Section 6.12_ , the Debt Commitment
Letter (or any definitive financing agreements relating thereto) expires or
is terminated prior to the Closing, in whole or in part, for any reason,
including as a result of a breach or repudiation, or if any portion of the
Debt Financing becomes unavailable (other than pursuant to the loan reduction
provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter) on the terms and
conditions (including any "flex" provisions) contemplated in the Debt
Commitment Letter (other than due to a breach by the Company of
this Agreement which would (i) result in the failure of the conditions in
_Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_ to be satisfied or (ii) prevent or render
impracticable the consummation of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date),
each of Parent and Merger Sub will (1) use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain, on a prompt basis, alternative financing from alternative sources (the
" _Alternative Debt Financing_ ") in an amount such that the aggregate funds
that would be available to Parent, Merger Sub and Partnership Merger Sub at
the Closing (taking into account other financial resources of Parent, Merger
Sub and Partnership Merger Sub, including available cash on hand and
marketable securities of Parent, Merger Sub, Partnership Merger Sub, the
Company and the Company's Subsidiaries on the Closing Date and any then-
available Debt Financing pursuant to any then-existing Debt Commitment Letter)
will be sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration, fund the reserves
required to be funded at Closing in connection with the Debt Financing and
pay all fees and expenses required to be paid at the Closing by Parent, Merger
Sub, Partnership Merger Sub, the Company, the Operating Partnership or the
Company Subsidiaries in connection with the Mergers, the other Transactions
and any such Alternative Debt Financing, and to obtain a new financing
commitment letter with respect to such Alternative Debt Financing (the "
_New Debt Commitment Letter_ ") and any new related fee letters (the " _New
Fee Letter_ "), which shall replace the existing Debt Commitment Letter and
related Fee Letters, respectively, in whole or in part, and (2) promptly
notify the Company of such unavailability and the reason therefor and
promptly provide copies of any such New Debt Commitment Letter or New Fee
Letter to the Company; _provided_ , that Parent and Merger Sub shall not be
required to arrange or obtain any such Alternative Debt Financing on terms
and conditions (including any fees and/or "flex" provisions) that are less
favorable to Parent and Merger Sub (in the aggregate) than those terms and
conditions contained in the Debt Financing Letters. In the event any New
Debt Commitment Letter is obtained, (i) any reference in this Agreement to
the "Debt Financing" shall mean the debt financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter as modified pursuant to clause (ii) below and (ii) any
reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Commitment Letter" or the "Debt
Financing Letters" shall be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letter and
any Fee Letter to

  



    

77 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

the extent not superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter or New Fee Letter,
as the case may be, at the time in question and any New Debt Commitment
Letter or New Fee Letter to the extent then in effect.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall require, and in no event
shall the reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or
construed to require, Parent or Merger Sub to (i) commence any litigation or
similar enforcement action against the Debt Financing Sources to enforce
Parent's or Merger Sub's rights under the Debt Financing Letter, (ii) pay any
amounts, fees or expenses in excess of those contemplated in the
Debt Financing Letters (whether to secure waiver of any conditions contained
therein or otherwise), (iii) amend or waive any of the terms or conditions
hereof or (iv) consummate the Closing at any time prior to the date determined
in accordance with _Section 1.3_.

  



  

Section 6.13 _Financing Cooperation_.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company shall,

any document in connection with this _Section 6.13(a)(ii)_ that would be
effective at any time before the Company Merger Effective Time or participate

cooperating in and facilitating the completion of field examinations,
collateral audits, asset appraisals, surveys, Phase I environmental site

_however_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
(A) none of Parent, the Debt Financing Sources or their Representatives shall
have the right to take and analyze any samples of any environmental media

material or to perform any invasive testing procedure on any such property,
unless and only to the extent (I) recommended pursuant to a third party

other fee in connection with any proposed Debt Financing, (B) enter into any
definitive agreement, including any credit or other agreements, pledge or

relationship, documents and communications, and any privileges associated
therewith shall not be transferred to Parent, Merger Sub, Partnership Merger

Section 6.16 _Dividends_.

  



  

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Company Merger Effective Time and termination of this Agreement pursuant to 
_Section 8.1_ , neither the Company nor Parent shall make, declare or set
aside any dividend or other distribution to its respective stockholders
without the prior written consent of the Company (in the case of Parent) or
Parent (in the case of the Company); _provided_ , _however_ , that the written
consent of the other Party shall not be required for the authorization and
payment of the Company Permitted Dividend or the Parent Permitted Dividends,
as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing and any other restriction on
dividends and other distributions in this Agreement, including the
restrictions set forth in _Section 5.1(c)_ and _Section 5.2(c)_ , each of the
Company, any Company Subsidiary, Parent, and any Parent Subsidiary shall be
permitted (without the consent of the other Party) to declare and make
dividends and distributions, including under Sections 858 or 860 of the Code,
prior to the Closing if the making of such dividends or distributions prior
to the Closing is necessary for the Company or Parent, as applicable, to
maintain its status as a REIT under the Code or applicable state Law and
avoid the imposition of any entity level income or excise Tax under the Code
or applicable state Law. If either Party determines that it is necessary to
declare a dividend or distribution (whether a Company Permitted Dividend, a
Parent Permitted Dividend or otherwise), it shall notify the other Party as
soon as reasonably practicable prior to such declaration.

  



  

(b) The Parties shall take such actions as are necessary to ensure that
if either the holders of Company Common Stock receive the Company Permitted
Dividend for a particular period prior to the Closing Date, or the holders of
Parent Common Stock receive the Parent Permitted Common Dividend for a
particular period prior to the Closing Date, then the holders of Company
Common Stock or the holders of Parent Common Stock, as the case may be, shall
be entitled to receive the applicable Permitted Dividend for such period as
necessary to result in the holders of Company Common Stock and the holders of
Parent Common Stock receiving the applicable Permitted Dividend covering
the same periods prior to the Closing Date.

Section 6.17 _Divestiture Assistance_. The Company shall, and shall
cause the Company Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with Parent's and/or Merger Sub's reasonable requests for
assistance in connection with a potential sale of the Company's and/or any
Company Subsidiaries' interests in (a) all Company Properties located in the
United Kingdom and (b) Company Properties having an aggregate fair market
value not in excess of 10% of the aggregate fair market value of all Company
Properties located in the United States, in each case including by means
of sale or transfer of equity interests of applicable Company Subsidiaries (a
Company Property potentially to be sold under clause (a) and (b), a "
_Potential Divestiture_ "), which would be undertaken by Parent at or after
the Company Merger Effective Time; _provided_ , that such cooperation does
not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries. Such assistance shall include using commercially
reasonable efforts to: (i) cause the Company Advisor, the Company Sub-Advisor
and the Company's Representatives to provide reasonable assistance with the
preparation of confidential information memorandums, presentations or similar
materials relating to any such Potential Divestiture and to participate in
a reasonable number of meetings and/or property tours with Persons evaluating
any such Potential Divestiture, as may be requested by Parent; and (ii)
deliver to Parent any existing financial information pertaining to the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries, and any Company Property reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with a Potential Divestiture that is (x)
reasonably necessary to complete such Potential Divestiture and (y)
customarily used in a divestiture or sale of assets or equity interest of the
type contemplated by a Potential Divestiture; and (iv) reasonably cooperate
with Parent and/or Merger Sub to obtain any third-party consents that are
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate a Potential Divestiture at the
Company Merger Effective Time or immediately thereafter (it being understood
that the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall have no obligation to
secure any required third-party consents, which shall be the sole obligation
of Parent). None of the representations, warranties or covenants of the
Company shall be deemed to apply to, or deemed breached or violated by, any of
the actions contemplated by this _Section 6.17_ or by any action taken by the
Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives at the request of
Parent in furtherance of this _Section 6.17_. Notwithstanding anything in
this _Section 6.17_ to the contrary, until the Company Merger Effective Time
occurs, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be
required to (A) pay any fees in connection with a Potential Divestiture, (B)
enter into any agreements related to a Potential Divestiture that will be
effective at any time before the Company Merger Effective Time or (C) unless
promptly reimbursed by Parent upon written request of the Company, be
required to incur any out of pocket expenses and costs in connection with a
Potential Divestiture. Parent shall (1) promptly, upon written request by the
Company (such written request to include invoices or other reasonably detailed
evidence of the out of pocket costs or expenses incurred that are requested
to be reimbursed hereunder), reimburse the Company for all reasonable and
documented out of pocket expenses and costs (including reasonable attorneys'
fees) incurred by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or their
respective Representatives in connection a Potential Divestiture, including
any action taken by any of them at the request of Parent or Merger Sub
pursuant to, and in accordance with, this _Section 6.17_ , and (2) indemnify
and hold harmless the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all damages, losses, costs,
liabilities or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection
with the Potential Divestiture and any information used in
connection therewith and all other

actions taken by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives taken at the request of Parent pursuant to this
_Section 6.17_ , except to the extent finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to have arisen from the Company's, any Company
Subsidiary's or their respective Representatives' fraud, gross negligence,
willful misconduct or bad faith. Parent expressly acknowledges and agrees
that the consummation of all or any portion of any Potential Divestiture is
not a condition to its and/or Merger Sub's obligations to effect the Closing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent, Merger
Sub and Partnership Merger Sub shall not seek to implement a Potential
Divestiture that would reasonably be expected to cause a breach, violation or
default under, or give rise to a termination right with respect to, the Debt
Financing Letters or that would reasonably be expected to materially delay
the Closing or have a material adverse effect on the ability of
Parent, Merger Sub or Partnership Merger Sub to consummate the Mergers.

Related Parties and any Debt Financing Source for any loss or damage suffered

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary:

  



  

(i) If one Party to this Agreement (the " _Termination Payor_ ") is
required to pay another Party to this Agreement (the " _Termination Payee_ ")
any payment under _Section 8.2(b)_ or _8.2(c)_ (such payment, a " _Termination
Payment_ "), such Termination Payment shall be paid into escrow on the date
such payment is required to be paid by the Termination Payor pursuant to this
Agreement by wire transfer of same day funds to an escrow account designated
in accordance with this _Section 8.2(e)_. In the event that the Termination
Payor is obligated to pay the Termination Payee a Termination Payment, the
amount payable to the Termination Payee in any taxable year of the
Termination Payee shall not exceed the lesser of (I) such Termination
Payment payable to the Termination Payee, and (II) the sum of (A) the maximum
amount that can be paid to the Termination Payee without causing the
Termination Payee to fail to meet the requirements of Section 856(c)(2) and
(3) of the Code for the relevant taxable year, determined as if the payment
of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2) or
856(c)(3) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ ") and the Termination Payee has
$1,000,000 of income from unknown sources during such year which is not
Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income which is not
Qualifying Income), in each case, as determined by the Termination Payee's
independent accountants, plus (B) in the event the Termination Payee receives
either (x) a letter from the Termination Payee's counsel indicating that the
Termination Payee has received a ruling from the IRS as described below in
this _Section 8.2(e)_ or (y) an opinion from the Termination Payee's outside
counsel as described below in this _Section 8.2(e)_ , an amount equal to the
excess of such Termination Payment, less the amount payable under
subclause (A) above.

  



  

(ii) To secure the Termination Payor's obligation to pay these
amounts, the Termination Payor shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash
equal to such Termination Payment with an escrow agent selected by the
Termination Payor on such terms (subject to this _Section 8.2(e)_ ) as shall
be mutually agreed upon by the Termination Payor, the Termination Payee and
the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of such Termination
Payment pursuant to this _Section 8.2(e)_ shall be made at the time the
Termination Payor is obligated to pay the Termination Payee such amount
pursuant to this _Section 8.2_ by wire transfer of same day funds. The escrow
agreement shall provide that such Termination Payment in escrow or any
portion thereof shall not be released to the Termination Payee unless the
escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following: (A) a letter
from the Termination Payee's independent accountants indicating the maximum
amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to the Termination Payee without
causing the Termination Payee to fail to meet the requirements of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount
did not constitute Qualifying Income and the Termination Payee has $1,000,000
of income from unknown sources during such year which is not Qualifying
Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income which is not Qualifying
Income), in which case the escrow agent shall release such amount to the
Termination Payee, or (B) a letter from the Termination Payee's counsel
indicating that (A) the Termination Payee received a ruling from the IRS
holding that the receipt by the Termination Payee of such Termination Payment
would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross
income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code or (B)
the Termination Payee's outside counsel has

  



    

92 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by the Termination
Payee of such Termination Payment should either constitute Qualifying
Income or should be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, in which case the escrow agent shall release
the remainder of such Termination Payment to the Termination Payee. The
Termination Payor agrees to amend this  _Section 8.2(e)_ at the reasonable
request of the Termination Payee in order to (i) maximize the portion of such
Termination Payment that may be distributed to the Termination Payee
hereunder without causing the Termination Payee to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, or (ii) assist the
Termination Payee in obtaining a favorable ruling or legal opinion from its
outside counsel, in each case, as described in this _Section 8.2(e)_. Any
amount of such Termination Payment that remains unpaid as of the end of a
taxable year shall be paid as soon as possible during the following taxable
year, subject to the foregoing limitations of this _Section 8.2(e)_.

  



  

(f) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this _Section 8.2_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that each
of the Company Termination Payment, Parent Termination Payment and the Parent
Vote-Down Termination Payment is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated
damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent, Merger Sub and
Partnership Merger Sub or the Company and Company Operating Partnership, as
applicable, in the circumstances in which the Company Termination Payment, the
Parent Termination Payment or the Parent Vote-Down Termination Payment is
payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount
would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

the Company Board of Directors, and no stockholders or holders of
Restricted Company Shares whether purporting to act in its capacity as such
or purporting to assert any right (derivatively or otherwise) on behalf of
the Company, shall have any right or ability to exercise or cause the exercise
of any third party beneficiary rights referenced in clause (ii) of the
preceding sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Debt Financing Source
(and its respective Representatives) shall be express third party
beneficiaries with respect to _Sections 6.12(f)_ , _8.2_ , _9.11_  and
_9.12_.

  



  

Section 9.10 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Mergers is not affected in any manner adverse to any Party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the Mergers are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

  



  

Section 9.11 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of actions (whether at
Law, in contract or in tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or related
to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws
of the State of Maryland without giving effect to conflicts of laws principles
(whether of the State of Maryland or any other jurisdiction that would cause
the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Maryland).

  



  

(b) All Legal Proceedings and proceedings arising out of or relating
to this Agreement shall be heard and determined exclusively in any Maryland
state or federal court. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally (a) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Maryland
state or federal court, for the purpose of any Legal Proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement and the Transaction brought by any Party, (b)
agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding except in such courts,
(c) agrees that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be
heard and determined in any Maryland state or federal court, (d) waives, to
the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or
proceeding, and (e) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding. Each of the Parties agrees that a final judgment in any such
action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
Law. Each Party irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner
provided for notices in _Section 9.4_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect
the right of any Party to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each
Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that it will not bring
or support any Legal

Proceeding of any kind or description (whether at Law, in contract or in
tort) against the Debt Financing Sources in any way relating to this
Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in any
forum other than a court of competent jurisdiction sitting in the Borough of
Manhattan of the City of New York, whether a state or federal court, and that
the provisions of _Section 9.12_ relating to the waiver of jury trial shall
apply to any such Legal Proceeding.

  



  

Section 9.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR
THE MERGERS AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH
WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH
WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.12_.

  



  

Section 9.13 _Assignment_.  This Agreement shall not be assigned by
any of the Parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the
prior written consent of the other Parties, except that (a) Merger Sub or
Partnership Merger Sub may assign, in its sole discretion and without the
consent of any other Party, any or all of its rights, interests and
obligations hereunder to (i) Parent, (ii) Parent and one or more direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent, or (iii) one or more direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent and (b) Parent, Merger Sub and
Partnership Merger Sub may assign, in their sole discretion and without the
consent of any other Party, any or all of their rights, interests and
obligations hereunder to any of their lenders or other financing sources from
time to time as collateral security. Subject to the preceding sentence, but
without relieving any Party of any obligation hereunder, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and
their respective successors and assigns.

  



  

Section 9.14 _Enforcement; Remedies_.

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such
Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

  



  

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Except as
set forth in this _Section 9.14_ , including the

limitations set forth in _Section 9.14(c)_ , it is agreed that prior to the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ , the non-
breaching Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement by any other Party and to specifically enforce the
terms and provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding  _Section 9.14(b)_ , it is acknowledged and
agreed that the Company shall be entitled to specific performance of
Parent's obligation pursuant to the terms of this Agreement to consummate the
Mergers only in the event that each of the following conditions has been
satisfied: (i) all of the conditions in _Sections 7.1_ , _7.2_ and _7.3_ have
been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing or the failure of which to be satisfied is caused by
a material breach by Parent, Merger Sub or Partnership Merger Sub of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement), (ii) the full amount (i.e. before giving effect to any loan
reduction provisions in the Debt Commitment Letter; it being understood that
any reserve requirements under the Debt Commitment Letter shall not be deemed
a loan reduction) of the proceeds of the Debt Financing has been funded or
will be funded at the Closing and (iii) Parent, Merger Sub and Partnership
Merger Sub have failed to complete the Closing in accordance with _Section
1.3_. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be entitled
to enforce or seek to enforce specifically Parent's obligations to consummate
the Mergers if the full amount (i.e. before giving effect to any loan
reduction provisions in the Debt Commitment Letter; it being understood that
any reserve requirements under the Debt Commitment Letter shall not be deemed
a loan reduction) of the proceeds of the Debt Financing has not been funded
or will not be funded at the Closing.

  



  

(d) The Parties' right of specific enforcement is an integral part of
the Transactions and each Party hereby waives any objections to the grant of
the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches
of this Agreement by any other Party (including any objection on the basis
that there is an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity),
and each Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with,
the covenants and obligations of such Party under this Agreement all in
accordance with the terms of this _Section 9.14_. In the event any Party
seeks an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, such
Party shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with such order or injunction all in accordance with the terms of
this _Section 9.14_.
