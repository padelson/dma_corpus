WHEREAS, Parent desires to acquire the Company on the terms and subject to the

and amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_
") to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock ("
_Shares_ "), for $41.00 per Share, net to the seller in cash, without
interest (the " _Offer Price_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, following the consummation of the Offer, Purchaser will, in
accordance with Section 251(h) of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_
"), with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent, and each Share, except as otherwise provided

Consideration, subject to any applicable withholding Taxes;

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
unanimously (a) adopted and declared the advisability of this Agreement, the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement collectively, the " _Transactions_ "), (b) declared that it is in

WHEREAS, the respective board of directors of Parent and Purchaser have
adopted, approved and declared it advisable for Parent and Purchaser to enter

acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Purchaser and
the Company hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

 _THE OFFER_

 

Section 1.1 _The Offer_.

 

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with _Article VIII_ , as promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement but in no event more than ten (10) Business Days after the date of
this Agreement, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer; 
_provided_ that the Company agrees that no Shares owned by the Company or any
of the Subsidiaries of the Company be tendered pursuant to the Offer.

 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the prior
satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction or waiver by
Purchaser of the other conditions set forth in _Annex I_ (collectively, the "
_Offer Conditions_ "), after the Expiration Date (as defined herein) Purchaser
shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) consummate the Offer in
accordance with its terms, and promptly accept for payment and promptly
thereafter pay for all Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer.

 

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") in accordance with the terms set forth in this Agreement, the
Minimum Condition and the other Offer Conditions. Purchaser expressly reserves
the right, at any time, to in its sole discretion waive, in whole or in part,
any Offer Condition or modify the terms of the Offer;  _provided_ , _however_
, without the prior written consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not (A)
subject to adjustment pursuant to _Section 1.1(f),_ decrease the Offer Price,
(B) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (C) decrease the
maximum number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (D) amend or
modify any of the Offer Conditions in a manner that adversely affects holders
of Shares generally, (E) change the Minimum Condition, (F) impose conditions
to the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions, (G) extend or otherwise
change the Expiration Date in a manner other than as required or permitted by
this Agreement, or (H) provide for a "subsequent offering period" (or any
extension thereof) in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act.

(d) Unless extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight (New York City time) on the date
that is twenty (20) Business Days (for this purpose calculated in accordance
with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) following the commencement
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of the Offer (the "
_Initial Expiration Date_ ") or, in the event the Initial Expiration 

 



2  Date has been extended pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement,
the date and time to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial
Expiration Date, or such later date and time to which the Initial Expiration
Date has been extended pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement,
being referred to as the " _Expiration Date_ ").

 

(e) The Offer shall be extended from time to time as follows: (i) if, on the
scheduled Expiration Date, the Minimum Condition has not been satisfied or
any of the other Offer Conditions has not been satisfied, or waived by Parent
or Purchaser if permitted hereunder, then Purchaser shall extend the Offer for
one or more periods of not more than five (5) Business Days each (or of not
more than ten (10) Business Days each if the only Offer Condition(s) not yet
satisfied is the Offer Condition relating either to the absence of Restraints
or to the receipt of required regulatory approvals) (the length of such
periods to be determined by Parent) or such other number of Business Days as
the parties may agree (subject to the right of Purchaser to waive any Offer
Condition (other than the Minimum Condition) in accordance with this Agreement
and the parties respective rights to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with _Article VIII_ of this Agreement); and (ii) Purchaser shall extend the
Offer for the minimum period required by applicable Law or the applicable
rules, regulations, interpretations or positions of the SEC or its staff or
the NYSE. Purchaser shall not be required to extend the Offer beyond the End
Date and shall not in any event extend the Offer beyond the End Date without
the Companys prior written consent.

(f) The Offer Price shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to
reflect the effect of any change in the fully diluted number of shares of
capital stock of the Company as a result of any reclassification, stock split
(including a reverse stock split) or combination, merger, issuer tender,
exchange or readjustment of shares or any stock dividend or stock
distribution occurring on or after the date hereof and at or prior to the
Offer Acceptance Time, and such adjustment to the Offer Price shall provide to
the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated
by this Agreement prior to such action; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
in this _Section 1.1(f)_ shall be deemed to permit or authorize the Company
to effect any such change that it is not otherwise authorized or permitted to
undertake pursuant to this Agreement.

(g) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to the terms
hereof, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) promptly (and
in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of such termination) irrevocably
and unconditionally terminate the Offer, not acquire any Shares pursuant to
the Offer and cause any depository acting on behalf of Purchaser to return,
in accordance with applicable Law, all tendered Shares to the registered
holders thereof.

(h) On the date of commencement of the Offer (within the meaning of Rule
14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent and Purchaser shall file with the SEC a
Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with
all amendments and supplements thereto and including exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule TO_ ") that will contain or incorporate by reference the Offer to
Purchase and form of the related letter of transmittal and other appropriate
ancillary offer documents, and shall cause the Schedule TO (together with all
exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ") to be
disseminated to holders of Shares as and to the extent required by the
Exchange Act and other applicable Laws. 

 



3  Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent
that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and Parent further agrees to use all reasonable efforts to promptly
cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as soon as reasonably
practicable and to the extent required by applicable Law. The Company shall
promptly furnish or otherwise make available to Parent and Purchaser or
Parents legal counsel all information concerning the Company and its
stockholders that may be required in connection with any action contemplated
by this _Section 1.1(h)_, including communicating the Offer to the record and
beneficial holders of the Shares. Parent and Purchaser shall give (x) the
Company and its counsel reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Offer Documents prior to the filing thereof with the SEC and (y) reasonable
and good faith consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested by the Company and its counsel thereto. Parent and Purchaser agree
to provide the Company and its counsel with any comments Parent, Purchaser or
their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents promptly after receipt of such comments. Each of Parent and
Purchaser shall respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Offer Documents or the Offer. Parent and Purchaser agree to
give (x) the Company and its counsel reasonable opportunity to review any
proposed written or oral responses to any comments of the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Offer Documents or the Offer and (y) reasonable and good
faith consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel and reasonable opportunity
to participate in any substantive telephonic communications with the staff of
the SEC related thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations of the
Company in the immediately preceding three sentences shall not apply if the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) effects a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in accordance with _Section 6.3_.

 

(i) Parent shall cause to be provided to Purchaser all of the funds necessary
to purchase any Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant
to the Offer.

Section 1.2 _Company Actions_.

 

(a) On the date of commencement of the Offer, the Company shall, following the
filing of the Schedule TO, file with the SEC and disseminate to holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws, a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9 (together with any exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto,
the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") that, subject to the right of the Company Board (or
a committee thereof) to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant
to _Section 6.3_, shall contain the Company Board Recommendation and
shall mail the Schedule 14D-9 to these holders of Shares. The Schedule 14D-9
shall include as an exhibit an Information Statement pursuant to Section 14(f)
of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l promulgated thereunder. The Company agrees
that it will cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all material respects with
the Exchange Act and other applicable Laws. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the
Company agrees to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff and
to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule
14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and the Company further agrees to take all
steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with
the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as

 



4  soon as reasonably practicable and to the extent required by applicable
Laws. The Company shall give (x) Parent and its counsel reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 prior to the filing thereof with
the SEC and (y) reasonable and good faith consideration to the reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested by Parent and its counsel thereto.
The Company agrees to provide Parent and its counsel with any comments the
Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments. The Company shall
respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9. The Company agrees to give (x) Parent and its counsel
reasonable opportunity to review any proposed written or oral responses to any
comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 and (y)
reasonable and good faith consideration to the reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Parent and its counsel and
reasonable opportunity to participate in any substantive telephonic
communications with the staff of the SEC related thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the obligations of the Company in the immediately preceding three
sentences shall not apply if the Company Board (or a committee thereof)
effects a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with  _Section
6.3_. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of
the Company Board Recommendation contained in the Schedule 14D-9.

 

(b) The Company shall promptly furnish, or promptly cause its transfer agent
to furnish, Parent, or Parents designee, with a list of its stockholders,
mailing labels and any available listing or computer file containing the names
and addresses of all record holders of Shares and lists of securities
positions of Shares held in stock depositories, in each case true and correct
as of the most recent practicable date, and shall promptly provide to Parent
such additional information (including updated lists of stockholders, mailing
labels and lists of securities positions) and such other assistance as Parent
may reasonably request in connection with the Offer. Parent and Purchaser and
their agents shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such
labels, listings and files, shall use such information only in connection with
the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall,
upon request, deliver, and shall use their reasonable efforts to cause their
agents to deliver, to the Company (or destroy) all copies and any extracts or
summaries from such information then in their possession or control.

(c) The parties hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Schedule
14D-9 to be disseminated concurrently with and in the same mailing envelope
as the Offer Documents.

Section 1.3 _Directors_.

 

(a) Upon the Offer Acceptance Time and all times thereafter, subject to
compliance with applicable Laws and the applicable rules of the
NYSE, Purchaser shall be entitled to elect or designate such number of
directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board as is
equal to the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Company Board
(after giving effect to the directors elected or designated by Purchaser
pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by (ii) the percentage that the
aggregate number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent, Purchaser and any of
their Subsidiaries bears to the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock then outstanding. As used in this Agreement, the terms "beneficial
ownership" (and its correlative terms) shall have the meaning assigned to such
term

 



5  in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act. The Company and the Company Board
shall, upon Purchasers request at any time following the Offer Acceptance
Time, take all such actions necessary to (A) appoint to the Company Board the
individuals designated by Purchaser and permitted to be so designated by the
first sentence of this _Section 1.3(a)_, including promptly filling vacancies
or newly created directorships on the Company Board, promptly increasing the
size of the Company Board (including by amending the bylaws of the Company if
necessary so as to increase the size of the Company Board) and/or promptly
securing the resignations of such number of its incumbent directors as are
necessary or desirable to enable Purchasers designees to be so elected or
designated to the Company Board, and (B) cause Purchasers designees to be so
appointed at such time. The Company shall, upon Purchasers request following
the Offer Acceptance Time, also cause Persons elected or designated by
Purchaser to constitute the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole
number) as is on the Company Board of each committee of the Company Board to
the extent permitted by applicable Laws and the rules of the NYSE. From and
after the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company shall, at Parents request, take
all action necessary to elect to be treated as a "controlled company" as
defined in the rules of the NYSE and make all necessary filings and
disclosures associated with such status. The Companys obligations under this
_Section 1.3(a)_ shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 14f-l promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly upon execution
of this Agreement take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l in order to fulfill its obligations under this 
_Section 1.3(a)_, including mailing to stockholders (together with the
Schedule 14D-9) the information required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act
and Rule 14f-l as is necessary to enable Purchasers designees to be elected
or designated to the Company Board. Purchaser shall supply the Company with,
and be solely responsible for, information with respect to Purchasers
designees and Parents and Purchasers respective officers, directors and
Affiliates to the extent required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 14f-l.

(b) In the event that Purchasers designees are elected or designated to the
Company Board pursuant to _Section 1.3(a)_, then, until the Effective Time,
the Company shall cause the Company Board to maintain three (3) directors who
are members of the Company Board on or prior to the date hereof and who are
not officers, directors or employees of Parent, Purchaser, or any of their
Subsidiaries, each of whom shall be an "independent director" as defined by
the NYSE rules and eligible to serve on the Companys audit committee under
the Exchange Act and NYSE rules, and at least one of whom shall be an "audit
committee financial expert" as defined in Items 407(d)(5)(ii) and (iii) of
Regulation S-K (the " _Continuing Directors_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if any Continuing Director is unable to serve due to death, disability or
resignation, the Company shall take all necessary action (including creating a
committee of the Company Board) so that the Continuing Director(s) shall be
entitled to elect or designate another Person (or Persons) to fill such
vacancy, and such Person (or Persons) shall be deemed to be a Continuing
Director for purposes of this Agreement. If no Continuing Director then
remains, the other directors shall designate three (3) Persons who are not
officers, directors or employees of Parent, Purchaser, or any of their
Affiliates, and who do not otherwise have any material financial or other
material interest in or material relationship with Parent, Purchaser or any
of their Affiliates, to fill such vacancies and such Persons shall be deemed
Continuing Directors for all purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Purchasers designees
constitute a majority of the Company Board after the Offer Acceptance Time and
prior to the Effective Time, then the affirmative vote of a majority of the

 



6  Continuing Directors shall (in addition to the approval rights of the
Company Board or the stockholders of the Company as may be required by the
Company Charter Documents or applicable Law) be required (i) for the Company
to amend or terminate this Agreement, (ii) to exercise or waive any of the
Companys rights, benefits or remedies hereunder, if such action would
adversely affect, or would reasonably be expected to adversely affect, the
holders of Shares (other than Parent or Purchaser), (iii) to amend the Company
Charter Documents if such action would adversely affect the holders of Shares
(other than Parent or Purchaser), or (iv) to take any other action of the

Agreement) in reasonable circumstances and other advisors at the expense of
the Company as determined by the Continuing Directors, and the authority to

ARTICLE III

 

 _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK_

 

Section 3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company
or the holders of any shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") or any shares of capital stock of
Purchaser:

 

(a) _Capital Stock of Purchaser_. Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Purchaser shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.

 



8 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Any shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock, and any
shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Purchaser, shall be
automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with
_Section 3.1(b)_ and Dissenting Shares) shall thereupon be converted
automatically into, and shall thereafter solely represent, the right to
receive the Offer Price in cash without interest (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "), subject to any applicable withholding Tax. As of
the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
the holders immediately prior to the Effective Time of shares of Company
Common Stock not represented by certificates (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and the
holders of certificates that which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_
") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor upon
surrender of such Book-Entry Share or Certificate in accordance with _Section
3.2(b)_ without interest (subject to any applicable withholding Tax).

 

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent shall designate
the Companys current transfer agent or another bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") for the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock to receive the
funds to which holders of such shares of Company Common Stock shall become
entitled pursuant to this Agreement and shall enter into an agreement
reasonably acceptable to the Company with the Paying Agent relating to the
services to be performed by the Paying Agent. At or prior to of each of the
Offer Acceptance Time and Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall take all
steps necessary to enable and cause Purchaser to, deposit with the Paying
Agent all of the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Purchaser becomes
obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer and in respect of the aggregate
Merger Consideration to be paid to holders of shares of Company Common Stock,
as applicable (the " _Payment Fund_ "). If Parent decides to invest the
Payment Fund, pending its disbursement to former holders of Company Common
Stock, then the Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent in (i)
short-term direct obligations of the United States of America, (ii) short-term
obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of
America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest or
(iii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or a
combination of the foregoing. Any interest and other income from such
investments shall become part of the Payment Fund and any amounts in excess of
the amounts payable pursuant to this _Article III_  shall promptly be paid to
Parent. No investment by the Paying Agent of the Payment Fund shall relieve
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from making the payments
required by this _Article III_ and Parent shall promptly replace any portion
of the Payment Fund lost through any investment made pursuant to this _Section
3.2(a)_. No investment by the Paying Agent of the Payment Fund shall have
maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this
Agreement. Following the Effective Time, Parent agrees to make available to
the Paying Agent, from time to time as needed, additional cash to purchase any
Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer
and in respect of the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid to holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, as applicable.

 



9 (b) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of
Company Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which, in the case of shares
of Company Common Stock represented by Certificates, shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company
may reasonably agree and shall be prepared prior to Closing) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Paying Agent or, in the
case of Book-Entry Shares, receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying
Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may
reasonably request), together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions (and such other
customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent), the
holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor, subject to any required withholding taxes, the Merger
Consideration, without interest, for each share of Company Common Stock
surrendered, and any Certificates surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If
payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (A)
the Person requesting such exchange present proper evidence of transfer or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (B) the Person requesting
such payment shall have paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason
of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or
shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this  _Section 3.2_, each Certificate and
Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated
by this _Article III_ , without interest.

 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company Common Stock upon the
surrender for exchange in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock, and at the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that
evidenced ownership of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such shares of Company Common Stock other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law.
If, at any time after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this _Article III_.

 



10 (d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person
of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate, as contemplated by this _Article III_.

 

(e) _Termination of Payment Fund_. At any time following the first (1st)
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying
Agent and which have not been disbursed in accordance with this _Article III_
, and thereafter Persons entitled to receive payment pursuant to this _Article
III_ shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors
thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration, that may be
payable upon surrender of any Company Common Stock held by such holders, as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority
shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation, the
Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(g) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any payment made pursuant
to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986 (the " _Code_ "), or under any applicable provision of state, local or
foreign Law related to Taxes. To the extent amounts are so withheld and paid
over to the appropriate Taxing authority, the withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

Section 3.3 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time which are held by a
stockholder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
shares pursuant to, and complies in all respects with, the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") shall not be
converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), but instead such Dissenting
Stockholder shall be entitled to receive such consideration as may be
determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and such Dissenting Stockholder shall cease

 



11  to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights set forth in
Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and until such Dissenting Stockholder shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost rights to
appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such
Dissenting Stockholders shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be
treated as if they had been converted into and become exchangeable for the
right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each
such share of Company Common Stock, in accordance with  _Section 3.1(c)_,
without any interest thereon and less any applicable withholding taxes. The
Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals
of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and
received by the Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii)
the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal under the DGCL. No party shall, without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto, make any payment with respect to
any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

 

Section 3.4 _Treatment of Equity Awards_.

 

(a) Each option and stock appreciation right issued pursuant to any Company
Stock Plan that represents the right to acquire shares of Company Common
Stock which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or
not then vested or exercisable) (each, an " _Option_ ") shall at the Effective
Time automatically (and without any further action being required on the part
of the holders thereof) be canceled and terminated at the Effective Time in
exchange for an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time _times_ (y) the excess, if any, of the per share Merger
Consideration _over_ the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
under such Option, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect
to such payment; _provided_ that if the exercise price per share of any such
Option is equal to or greater than the per share Merger Consideration, such
Option shall be canceled without any cash payment being made in respect
thereof.

 

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock issued pursuant to any Company Stock
Plan that is subject to specified vesting criteria (each, a share of "
_Restricted Stock_ ") which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall at the Effective Time become fully vested and be treated in
accordance with _Section 3.1_. At the Effective Time, all
outstanding dividends associated with each share of Restricted Stock, shall
be paid out by the Company in a cash lump sum.

(c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit with
respect to shares of Company Common Stock that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Company RSUs_ ") shall be
converted into a vested right to receive cash in an amount equal to the per
share Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, all outstanding dividends
associated with each Company RSU shall be paid out by the Company in a cash
lump sum.

 



12 (d) Without limiting the generality of _Section 3.2(g)_, the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this _Section 3.4_ to any holder of Options,
shares of Restricted Stock and Company RSUs such amounts as the Surviving
Corporation is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code, or any applicable provision of state, local or
foreign Law related to Tax, and the Surviving Corporation shall make any
required filings with and payments to Tax authorities relating to any such
deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and
withheld by the Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for the purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
Options, Restricted Stock or Company RSUs in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation.

 

(e) No later than the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to
be provided, to the Surviving Corporation all funds necessary to fulfill the
obligations under this _Section 3.4_. All payments required under this
_Section 3.4_ shall be made at, or as soon as practicable after, the
Effective Time. If reasonably requested by the Parent, prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall adopt resolutions of the Company Board
necessary to (i) terminate, effective as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, the Company Stock Plans and any other plan, program, or arrangement (or
provision thereof) for the issuance or grant of any interest in respect of
shares of Company Common Stock, (ii) provide that neither Parent, the Company
nor any of their Subsidiaries will, as of the Effective Time, be bound by any
rights under any Company Stock Plan or any other plan, program, or
arrangement (or provision thereof) for the issuance or grant of any interest
in respect of shares of Company Common Stock or other rights in respect of,
the capital stock of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries, except the right to receive the payment contemplated by this
_Section 3.4_ and (iii) provide that any Company Plan which allows any
current or former employees, directors or individual independent contractors
or consultants to invest directly or indirectly in Company Common Stock, if
any, will be amended to eliminate such investment option.

thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein, as such
statements and reports may have been amended since the date of their filing,
the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective effective dates (in
the case of Company SEC Documents that are registration statements filed

SEC Documents complied in all material respects with applicable Law,
including the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act, and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the case may be, applicable to
such Company SEC Documents, and none of the Company SEC Documents as of such
respective dates (or, if amended, the date of the filing of such amendment,
with respect to the disclosures that are amended) contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 and Rule
15d-15 under the Exchange Act. The Companys disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,

by the Company or its subsidiaries with any of its officers, directors or

30  Proposal or any proposal reasonably expected to lead to, any Takeover
Proposal and shall promptly request the return from, or destruction by, all
such Persons of all copies of non-public information previously furnished or
made available to such Persons by or on behalf of the Company in accordance
with the terms of any confidentiality or similar agreement in place with such
Person. The Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers,
directors and employees shall not, and shall use their reasonable best efforts
to cause their other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any (including
by way of furnishing or providing access to non-public information), or take
any action which is reasonably expected to lead to, a Takeover Proposal; (ii)

or other similar agreement providing for any Takeover Proposal (each, a "

agreed that any violation of the restrictions on the Company set forth in
this  _Section 6.3_ by any officer or director of the Company (or any other
Representative of the Company that is authorized, intentionally sanctioned or
intentionally caused by the Company) shall be deemed a breach of this 
_Section 6.3_ by the Company.

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 6.3(a)_, at any time prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time, in response to a bona fide written Takeover Proposal made
after the date hereof which did not result from a breach of this _Section
6.3_, the Company may, if the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel) that such Takeover Proposal is or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, and after giving Parent
written notice of such determination (x) furnish any information and other
access to, any Person making such Takeover Proposal and any of its
Representatives pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement;
_provided_ , that the Company provides Parent any information with respect to
the Company that could reasonably be expected to be material to Parent
furnished to such other Person which was not previously furnished to Parent
prior to, or concurrently with, the time it is provided to such other Person,
and (y) participate in discussions and negotiations with the Person making
such Takeover Proposal and its Representatives or potential sources of
financing. In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in
this _Section 6.3_, the Company will promptly provide notice to Parent in
writing (and in any case within forty-eight (48) hours of knowledge of
receipt) of the receipt of such Takeover Proposal, or any request for
information relating to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries of the Company
or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any third party with respect to a
Takeover Proposal. The Company shall, in any such notice to Parent, indicate
the identity of the Person making such Takeover Proposal or request), and
thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis
of all material developments affecting the status of and terms of such
Takeover Proposal or request or any changes to the material terms thereof (and
the Company shall provide Parent promptly after receipt thereof with copies
of any material written materials constituting such Takeover Proposal or
request or any changes to the material terms thereof) and of the status of any
such discussions or negotiations. In addition, during the period from the
date hereof through the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company shall enforce and
not terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality
or 

 



31  "standstill" agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, other than (should the Company Board determine in good faith, following
consultation with its legal counsel that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law) a restriction in
any applicable confidentiality or "standstill" agreement that would prohibit
or restrict any such Party from making a non-public bona fide written
Takeover Proposal directly to the Company Board (provided the foregoing shall
not alter or affect any of the Companys other obligations in this _Section
6.3_).

 

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this Agreement, the Company Board shall
not, nor any committee thereof shall, (i)(A) withdraw, modify, amend or
qualify or publicly propose to withdraw, modify, amend or qualify, any part of
the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or its
interests in the Transaction, (B) adopt, approve, recommend or declare
advisable, or publicly propose to adopt, approve, recommend or declare
advisable, any Takeover Proposal, (C) fail to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 or (D) within eight (8) Business Days of
a written request by Parent for the Company to reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation following the date any Takeover Proposal or modification
thereto is published or made public, the Company fails to issue a press
release that reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation (without
qualification) (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to
herein as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) approve or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, or cause to authorize
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into, any Company Acquisition
Agreement. Parent shall be entitled to make a written request for
reaffirmation of the type contemplated by _Section 6.3(c)(i)(D)_ up to
three (3) times in total and Parent shall not be entitled to make such a
written request for reaffirmation if Parent has received from the Company a
Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change and the applicable Notice Period with
respect to such Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change has not ended.

(d) Notwithstanding _Section 6.3(c)_, but subject to  _Section 6.3(e)_, at
any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company Board may effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change (and, solely with respect to a Superior
Proposal, terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_) only
if (i) (A) a Takeover Proposal (that did not result from a breach of this
_Section 6.3_) is made to the Company and not withdrawn and (B) if the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisors, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes
a Superior Proposal, and, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, or (ii) (A) if, other than in
connection with a Takeover Proposal, there is or arises an event, fact,
circumstance, development or occurrence (an " _Intervening Event_ ") that
affects the business assets or operations of the Company Board prior to the
Offer Acceptance Time and (B) the Company Board has concluded in good faith,
following consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take
such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law.

 



32 (e) The Company Board shall not make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
or, with respect to a Superior Proposal, terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(d)(ii)_, unless (i) the Company shall have first provided Parent
written notice (" _Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") of its intent
to, as applicable, (x) terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive
acquisition agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, which notice shall
include the material terms and conditions of the transaction that constitutes
such Superior Proposal, the identity of the party making such Superior
Proposal, and copies of any proposed transaction agreements and related
material documents with respect to such Superior Proposal, or (y) make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with _Section 6.3(d)_,
which notice shall specify the details of an Intervening Event, if applicable,
in each case of (x) and (y) at least four (4) Business Days prior to its
taking such action (the " _Notice Period_ "); and (ii) the Company shall
have, and shall have caused its legal counsel and financial advisors to,
negotiate with Parent and its Affiliates and Representatives during the Notice
Period in good faith (to the extent Parent has requested to negotiate) to
make such modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (i) in
the case of a Superior Proposal, so that this Agreement results in a
transaction no less favorable to the stockholders of the Company than such
Takeover Proposal that was deemed a Superior Proposal and (ii) in the case of
an Intervening Event, modification of this Agreement results in a transaction
no less favorable to stockholders of the Company than the effect of the
Intervening Event, in each case, as would enable Parent to proceed with the
Transactions on such modified terms and, at the end of the Notice Period,
after taking into account any such modified terms as may have been proposed by
Parent since its receipt of such written notice, the Company Board shall have
again in good faith made the determination referred to in clause (i)(B) or
(ii) (B), as applicable, of _Section 6.3(d)_. In the event of any material
revision or amendment (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any change in
price) to the terms of a Superior Proposal, the Company Board shall, in each
case, make the determination referred to in clause (i)(B) or (ii)(B), as
applicable, of _Section 6.3(d)_, deliver a new Notice of Adverse
Recommendation and commence a new Notice Period, and, in such case, all
references to four (4) Business Days in this _Section 6.3(e)_ shall be deemed
to be two (2) Business Days.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) from (i) taking and
disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, (ii) making
any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if the Company Board (or a
duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such
disclosure would be inconsistent with applicable Law, (iii) informing any
Person of the existence of the provisions contained in this _Section 6.3_ or
(iv) making any "stop, look and listen" communication to the stockholders
of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that all actions taken or agreed to be taken by the Company or the
Company Board or any committee thereof shall comply with the provisions of 
_Section 6.3(a)_.

(g) As used in this Agreement, " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean any inquiry,
proposal or offer from any Person or group (as defined in Section 13(d) of
the Exchange Act), other than Parent and any of its Subsidiaries) relating to,
or that is reasonably expected to lead to, (i) any purchase or acquisition, in
a single transaction or series of related transactions, of (A) assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including securities of Subsidiaries) that
account for 15% or more of the Companys consolidated assets or from which 15%
or more of the Companys revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are
derived or (B) 15% or more of

 



33  the outstanding Company Common Stock or 15% of the equity securities of any
Subsidiary of the Company pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other
business combination, sale of shares of capital stock, tender offer, exchange
offer or similar transaction or (ii) a tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d)
of the Exchange Act) beneficially owning more than 15% of the outstanding
Company Common Stock or 15% of the equity securities of any Subsidiary of the
Company or of any resulting parent company of the Company, other than the
Transactions.

 

(h) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any bona
fide written Takeover Proposal on terms which the Company Board (or a duly
authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation
with the Companys outside legal counsel and independent financial advisor to
be (i) more favorable to the holders of Company Common Stock from a financial
point of view than the Transaction, taking into account all legal, financial,
regulatory and other factors (including all the terms and conditions of such
proposal and the Offer and this Agreement (including any changes to the
terms of the Offer and this Agreement proposed by Parent in accordance with
_Section 6.3(e))_ that the Company Board considers relevant and (ii)
reasonably capable of being completed in accordance with its terms, taking
into account the financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects and terms of
such proposal and the third party; _provided_ that for purposes of the
definition of Superior Proposal, the references to "15%" in the definition of
Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%."

holding separate or other disposition of assets or businesses of Parent or
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, (ii) the termination,
relinquishment, modification, or waiver of existing relationships, ventures,
contractual rights, obligations or other arrangements of Parent or Company or
their respective Subsidiaries or (iii) the creation of any relationships,

the Company or their respective Subsidiaries (each a " _Remedial Action_ "),
other than, after exhausting the parties obligations pursuant to clause (c)
above, or with the consent of Purchaser, Remedial Actions involving solely the
Company and/or its Subsidiaries that would not, after 

 



35  giving effect thereto, have a materially negative impact on the Company and
its Subsidiaries (or their respective businesses) taken as a whole; _provided_
, _however_ , that if Parent directs the Company to take any Remedial Action,
such Remedial Action may, at the discretion of the Company, be conditioned
upon consummation of the Transactions.

 

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the event that
any litigation or other administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
commenced, threatened or is foreseeable challenging any of the Transactions
and such litigation, action or proceeding seeks, or would reasonably be
expected to seek, to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the Transactions, Parent and the Company shall, subject to
_Section 6.4(d)_ , use their respective reasonable best efforts to take any
and all action to avoid or resolve any such litigation, action or proceeding
and each of the Company, Parent and Purchaser shall cooperate with each other
and use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such
litigation, action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the Transactions as promptly as
practicable and in any event no later than three (3) Business Days prior
to the End Date.

(f) Neither Parent nor Purchaser shall, nor shall they permit their respective
Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to acquire any assets, business, Person or
division thereof (through acquisition, license, joint venture, collaboration
or otherwise outside the ordinary course), if such acquisition, would
reasonably be expected to materially increase the risk of not obtaining any
applicable clearance, consent, approval or waiver under Antitrust Laws with
respect to the Transactions; it being understood that the foregoing shall not
limit or affect any of the Companys obligations set forth in  _Section
6.1_.

Section 6.5 _Public Announcements_. The initial press releases with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be separate press releases to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Following such initial press
release, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing,
and give each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press
release or other public statements with respect to the Transactions and shall
not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to
such consultation, except as such party may reasonably conclude may be
required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange or national securities
quotation system (and then only after as much advance notice and
consultation as is feasible); _provided_ , _however_ , that the restrictions
set forth in this _Section 6.5_ shall not apply to any release or public
statement (a) made or proposed to be made by the Company in connection with a
Takeover Proposal, a Superior Proposal or a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or any action taken pursuant thereto or (b) in connection with any
dispute between the parties regarding this Agreement or the Transactions;
_provided_ ,  _further_ , that the foregoing shall not limit the ability of
any party hereto to make internal announcements to their respective employees
and other stockholders that are not inconsistent in any material respects with
the prior public disclosures regarding the Transactions.

 



36 Section 6.6 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information, from the date hereof until the
earlier of the Offer Acceptance Time or the date on which this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries to, upon reasonable notice, afford to Parent and its
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to the
Companys and its Subsidiaries properties, as applicable (including for the
conduct of Phase I environmental site assessments but not for the conduct of
sampling or analysis of soil, groundwater, building materials, effluent, or
other environmental media commonly known as Phase II environmental assessment
work), books, financial statements, forecasts and other financial data, Tax
returns, Contracts, litigation files and other records, and the Company shall
furnish promptly such other documents and information concerning its business
and properties as the Parent and its Representatives may reasonably request
(other than any publicly available document filed by it pursuant to the
requirements of federal or state securities Laws); _provided_ that such access
shall not unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries; _provided,_ _further,_ that other than with
respect to a customary due diligence investigation by any financing sources or
their Representatives the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be obligated
to provide such access or information if permitting such access or disclosing
such information would (i) violate applicable Law, (ii) violate a Contract or
obligation of confidentiality owing to a third-party, (iii) jeopardize the
protection of the attorney-client privilege or (iv) expose such party to risk
of liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal information. Until the
Effective Time, the information provided will be subject to the terms of the
confidentiality letter agreement, dated as of December 12, 2013, between
Parent and the Company, and the supplemental confidentiality letter agreement,
dated as of February 2, 2014, between Parent and the Company (as such letters
may be amended from time to time, collectively, the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent
and Company shall not, and Parent and Company shall cause their respective
Representatives not to, use such information for any purpose unrelated to the
consummation of the Transactions. In addition to the foregoing, the Company
shall provide Parent and its Representatives with current and forecasted
financial information and provide access to the Companys management to
discuss the same.

Section 6.7 _Takeover Laws_. The Company and the Company Board shall each (a)
use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that no state takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Transactions and
(b) if any state takeover statute or similar statute becomes applicable to
the Transactions, use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that such
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on the Transactions.

Section 6.8 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each current and former
director and officer (and, to the extent provided in the Company Charter
Documents, other employee) of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries (each,
an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") to the same
extent such Indemnitees are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement
(including with respect to advancement of expenses) by the Company pursuant to
the Company Charter Documents, the equivalent charter documents of the
Company Subsidiaries and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on
the date of this Agreement with such Indemnitees for acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time.

 



37 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall request the Company
to, purchase and prepay a six-year "tail" policy on terms and conditions
providing substantially equivalent benefits and coverage levels as the
policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance in effect as of the date hereof as maintained by the
Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the
Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_"), covering without limitation the
Transactions (the " _Tail Policy_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if such
"tail" policy is not available at a cost per year equal to or less than 250%
of the aggregate annual premiums paid by the Company during the most recent
policy year for the DandO Insurance, Parent or, at Parents request, the
Company shall purchase the best coverage as is reasonably available for such
amount. Parent shall cause the Tail Policy to be maintained in full force and
effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored
by the Surviving Corporation.

(c) The provisions of this _Section 6.8_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
for or limitation of, any other rights to indemnification or contribution
that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. The obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 6.8_ shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights
of any Indemnitee to whom this _Section 6.8_ applies unless (A) such
termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (B) the affected
Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification
(it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.8_
applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.8_).

 

(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations
thereof set forth in this _Section 6.8_.

 

Section 6.9 _Transaction Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in review and comment on all material filings or
responses to be made by the Company in the defense or settlement of any
stockholder litigation against the Company or any of its directors or officers
relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, and no such settlement of
any stockholder litigation shall be agreed to without Parents prior written
consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed,
except that Parent shall not be obligated to consent to any settlement which
does not include full release of Parent and each of its Affiliates or which
imposes an injunction or other equitable relief upon Parent or any of its
Affiliates (including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation).
The Company shall notify Parent promptly (and in any event within 48 hours)
of the commencement of any such stockholder litigation of which it has
received notice.

 

Section 6.10 _Section 16_. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company
shall take all steps reasonably necessary to cause the Transactions,
including any dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including
derivative securities with respect to such equity securities of the Company)
by each individual who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements
of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



38 Section 6.11 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each employee of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) as
of the Effective Time (" _Company Employees_ "), (i) annual base salary and
base wages and cash incentive compensation opportunities (including target
bonus amounts that are payable subject to the satisfaction of performance
criteria in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, but excluding any
long-term incentive awards) that are each no less favorable than that in
effect as of the Effective Time and (ii) employee benefits that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than the employee benefits provided to the Company
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide Company Employees whose employment terminates
during the one (1) year period following the Effective Time with severance
benefits at levels no less favorable than and pursuant to the terms of
Parents current severance policies or, if more favorable, then as required by
applicable local Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, terms of continued
employment of any Current Employee subject to a collective bargaining
agreement shall be governed by the applicable collective bargaining agreement.

(b) For the purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of
benefits but not for purposes of defined benefit pension accrual under the
employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to
any Company Employee after the Effective Time (including the Company Plans)
(the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her
years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company
Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service
under any similar Company employee benefit plan in which such Company Employee
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time, _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent
that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to
the same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under a Company
Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the
Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his
or her covered dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or
waived under the comparable Old Plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in
which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by any Company
Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
of the Old Plan ending on the date such Company Employees participation in
the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New
Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-
of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 



39 (c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor all obligations under the Company
Plans and compensation and severance arrangements and agreements in accordance
with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time and the
Transactions shall be deemed to constitute a "change in control," "change of
control" or any similar concept under such Company Plans, arrangements or
agreements.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each Company Employee
employed by Parent or its Affiliates on December 31, 2014 such Company
Employees annual incentive bonus, calculated in accordance with the bonus
plan in effect as of the date hereof and determined consistent with past
practice. 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this Agreement shall (i) be treated as an amendment to
any Company Plan, (ii) obligate Parent or the Surviving Corporation to (A)
maintain any particular benefit plan or arrangement or (B) retain the
employment of any particular employee (all such employees will be "at will")
or (iii) prevent Parent or the Surviving Corporation from amending or
terminating any benefit plan or arrangement. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing herein shall confer any third party beneficiary rights or rights
of enforcement to any Person (including Company Employees) other than the
parties to this Agreement.

Section 6.12 _Purchaser and Surviving Corporation_. Parent shall take all
actions necessary to (a) cause Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation to
perform promptly their respective obligations under this Agreement and (b)
cause Purchaser to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement.

Section 6.13 _Payoff Letter_. By no later than the fifth (5th) Business Day
prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company shall cause the administrative
agent for the lenders under the Senior Credit Facility to prepare and deliver
to the Company a customary "payoff letter" or similar document in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent specifying the aggregate amount of
the Companys obligations in respect of Indebtedness (including principal,
interest, fees, expenses, prepayment penalties or payments and other amounts
payable under the Senior Credit Facility) that will be outstanding as of the
Closing Date under the Senior Credit Facility and providing, upon receipt of
such amounts, (i) that all Indebtedness under or pursuant to the Senior
Credit Facility shall have been repaid and discharged and (ii) for the
release of all claims and Liens held by or on behalf of such lenders in
respect of the properties and assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries. The
Company shall also have made arrangements reasonably satisfactory to Parent
and have provided to Parent recordable form lien releases and other documents
reasonably requested by Parent prior to the Closing Date such that all Liens
on the assets or properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that
are not Permitted Liens shall be (or shall have been) satisfied, terminated
and discharged on or prior to the Closing Date.

 



40 Section 6.14 _Actions with Respect to 5.46% Notes_. Following the execution of
this Agreement, the Company shall prepare all notices, certificates and other
documents required to be delivered to holders of the Companys 5.46%
Guaranteed Senior Notes due 2020 (the " _5.46% Notes_ ") in connection with
the Transactions, including the execution of this Agreement, pursuant to the
Note Purchase Agreement governing the 5.46% Notes (the " _Note Purchase
Agreement_ "). The Company shall deliver all such notices, certificates and
other documents to holders of the 5.46% Notes in accordance with the terms
and within the time periods specified in the Note Purchase Agreement,
including, without limitation, the delivery of the notices and certificates
required pursuant to Section 8.7 of the Note Purchase Agreement, and shall
provide Parent the reasonable opportunity to review and comment in a timely
manner on each of the foregoing notices, certificates and documents reasonably
in advance of their delivery, it being understood that the Companys
obligation to prepay any 5.46% Notes pursuant to the offer of prepayment
contained in any such notice shall not occur on or prior to the Effective
Time.

 

Section 6.15 _No Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement is intended to give Parent or Purchaser, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys or its Subsidiaries
operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries
respective operations.

terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ shall not be

any such action or proceeding by mailing copies thereof by registered or

the other party by any other legally available method.

 

(d) Parent has appointed its Subsidiary Imerys USA, located at 100 Mansell
Rd., Roswell, Georgia, USA 30076, as its authorized agent (the " _Authorized

instituted in such jurisdiction. Parent and Purchaser hereby represent
and warrant that the Authorized Agent has accepted such appointment and has
agreed to act as said agent for service of process. Service of process upon
the Authorized Agent shall be deemed, in every respect, effective service of
process upon Parent. 

Section 9.9 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties agree that immediate,
extensive and irreparable damage would occur for which monetary damages would
not be an adequate remedy in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are
otherwise breached. Accordingly, the parties agree that, if for any
reason Parent, Purchaser or the Company shall have failed to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or otherwise breached this Agreement, then
the party seeking to enforce this Agreement against such nonperforming party
under this Agreement shall be entitled to specific performance and the
issuance of immediate injunctive and other equitable relief without the
necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy, and the
parties further agree to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with the obtaining of any such injunctive or other
equitable relief, this being in addition to and not in limitation of any other
remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.

shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from
time to time.
