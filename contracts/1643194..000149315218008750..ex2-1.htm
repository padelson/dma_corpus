This SHARE EXCHANGE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of June 15,
2018, is by and among DD's Deluxe Rod Holder Inc., a Nevada corporation ("
_DDLX_ "), GOLDEN SUNSET GROUP LIMITED, a Seychelles International
Business Company (" _Golden Sunset_ "), and the shareholders of Golden Sunset

A. Golden Sunset has 460,000,000 shares (" _Ordinary Shares_ "), $0.00025 par

outstanding capital stock of DDLX on a fully diluted basis as of and
immediately after the Closing (as defined below). The number of shares of
Common Stock to be received by each Shareholder is listed opposite each such
Shareholder's name on _Annex A_. The aggregate number of shares of Common
Stock that is reflected on _Annex A_ is referred to herein as the "Shares."

  



  

B. The Board of Directors of each of DDLX and Golden Sunset has determined
that it is desirable to effect this share exchange.

(collectively, " _Liens_ "), in exchange for the Common Stock listed on _Annex
A_ opposite such Shareholder's name.

  



  

1.2.  _Closing_. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the transactions
contemplated hereby (the " _Transactions_ ") shall take place on the business

below are satisfied or waived, or such other date and time as the Parties may
mutually determine (the " _Closing Date_ ")

Each of the Shareholders hereby severally (and not jointly) represents and
warrants to DDLX with respect to itself, as follows.

  



  

2.1.  _Good Title_. The Shareholder is the record and beneficial owner, and
has good title to its Golden Sunset Shares as specified on _Annex A_ , with
the right and authority to sell and deliver such Golden Sunset Shares. Upon
delivery of the certificate or certificates duly assigned, representing the
same as herein contemplated and/or upon registering of DDLX as the new owner
of such Golden Sunset Shares in the share register of Golden Sunset, DDLX
will receive good title to such Golden Sunset Shares, free and clear of all
Liens.

  



  

2.2.  _Organization_. The Shareholder, if an entity, is duly organized and
validly existing in its jurisdiction of organization.

  



  

2.3.  _Power and Authority_. The Shareholder has the legal power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations
hereunder. All acts required to be taken by the Shareholder to enter into
this Agreement and to carry out the Transactions have been properly taken.
This Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Shareholder, enforceable against the Shareholder in accordance with the terms
hereof.

  



  

2.4.  _No Conflicts_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Shareholder and the performance by the Shareholder of its obligations
hereunder in accordance with the terms hereof: (a) will not require the
consent of any third party or any federal, state, local or foreign government
or any court of competent jurisdiction, administrative agency or commission
or other governmental authority or instrumentality, domestic or foreign
(each, a " _Governmental Entity_ ") under any statute, law, ordinance, rule,
regulation, order, writ, injunction, judgment, or decree (collectively, "
_Laws_ "); (b) will not violate any Laws applicable to the Shareholder;
and (c) will not violate or breach any contractual obligation to which the
Shareholder is a party.

  



  

2.5.  _Litigation_. There is no pending proceeding against the Shareholder
that involves the Golden Sunset Shares or that challenges, or may have the
effect of preventing, delaying or making illegal, or otherwise interfering
with, any of the Transactions and, to the knowledge of the Shareholder, no
such proceeding has been threatened, and no event or circumstance exists that
is reasonably likely to give rise to or serve as a basis for the commencement
of any such proceeding.

  



  

2.6.  _No Finder 's Fee_. The Shareholder has not created any obligation for
any finder's, investment banker's or broker's fee in connection with
the Transactions that are not payable entirely by the Shareholder.

  



  

2.7.  _Purchase Entirely for Own Account_. The Shareholder is acquiring the
Shares proposed to be acquired hereunder for investment for its own account

laws.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

2.8.  _Available Information_. The Shareholder has such knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating
the merits and risks of investment in DDLX and has had full access to all the
information it considers necessary or appropriate to make an informed
investment decision with respect to the Common Stock.

  



  

2.9.  _Non-Registration_. The Shareholder understands that the Shares have
not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
_Securities Act_ "), and, if issued in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement, will be issued by reason of a specific exemption from
the registration provisions of the Securities Act which depends upon, among
other things, the bona fide nature of the investment intent and the accuracy
of the Shareholder's representations as expressed herein. The non-registration
shall have no prejudice with respect to any rights, interests, benefits and
entitlements attached to the Shares in accordance with DDLX's articles of
incorporation or bylaws or the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation.

  



  

2.10.  _Restricted Securities_. The Shareholder understands that the Shares
are characterized as "restricted securities" under the Securities Act. The
issuance of the Shares hereunder is being effected in reliance upon an
exemption from registration afforded under Section 4(a)(2) of the
Securities Act for transactions by an issuer not involving a public offering
or Regulation S Promulgated under the Securities Act. The Shareholder further
acknowledges that if the Shares are issued to the Shareholder in accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement, such Shares may not be resold without
registration under the Securities Act or the existence of an exemption
therefrom. The Shareholder represents that it is familiar with Rule 144
promulgated under the Securities Act, as presently in effect, and understands
the resale limitations imposed thereby and by the Securities Act.

  



  

2.11.  _Legends_. It is understood that the Shares will bear the following
legend or one that is substantially similar to the following legend:

  



  

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT"), OR ANY STATE

requirements of the Securities Act.

8.2.  _Amendments; Waivers; No Additional Consideration_. No provision of
this Agreement may be waived or amended except in a written instrument signed
by Golden Sunset, DDLX and Shareholders holding a majority in interest of the
Golden Sunset Shares. No waiver of any default with respect to any provision,
condition or requirement of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a continuing
waiver in the future or a waiver of any subsequent default or a waiver of any
other provision, condition or requirement hereof, nor shall any delay or
omission of any Party to exercise any right hereunder in any manner impair the
exercise of any such right. No consideration shall be offered or paid to any
Shareholder to amend or consent to a waiver or modification of any provision
of this Agreement and any other documents or agreements executed in
connection with the Transactions unless the same consideration is also
offered to all Shareholders then holding the Shares.

  



  

8.3.  _Replacement of Securities_. If any certificate or instrument
evidencing any Shares is mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, DDLX shall
issue or cause to be issued in exchange and substitution for and upon
cancellation thereof, or in lieu of and substitution therefor, a new
certificate or instrument, but only upon receipt of evidence reasonably
satisfactory to DDLX of such loss, theft or destruction and customary and
reasonable indemnity, if requested. The applicants for a new certificate or
instrument under such circumstances shall also pay any reasonable third-party
costs associated with the issuance of such replacement Shares. If a
replacement certificate or instrument evidencing any Shares is requested due
to a mutilation thereof, DDLX may require delivery of such mutilated
certificate or instrument as a condition precedent to any issuance of a
replacement.

  



  

8.4.  _Remedies_. In addition to being entitled to exercise all rights
provided herein or granted by law, including recovery of damages, each of the
Shareholders, DDLX and Golden Sunset will be entitled to specific performance
under this Agreement. The Parties agree that monetary damages may not be
adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of any breach of
obligations described in the foregoing sentence and hereby agrees to waive in
any action for specific performance of any such obligation the defense that a
remedy at law would be adequate.

  



  

8.5.  _Independent Nature of Shareholders ' Obligations and Rights_. The
obligations of each Shareholder under this Agreement are several and not
joint with the obligations of any other Shareholder, and no Shareholder shall
be responsible in any way for the performance of the obligations of any other
Shareholder under this Agreement. The decision of each Shareholder to
acquire the Shares pursuant to this Agreement has been made by such
Shareholder independently of any other Shareholder. Nothing contained herein,
and no action taken by any Shareholder pursuant hereto, shall be deemed to
constitute the Shareholders as a partnership, an association, a joint venture
or any other kind of entity, or create a presumption that the Shareholders are
in any way acting in concert or as a group with respect to such obligations
or the transactions contemplated herein. Each Shareholder acknowledges that
no other Shareholder has acted as agent for such Shareholder in connection
with making its investment hereunder and that no Shareholder will be acting
as agent of such Shareholder in connection with monitoring its investment in
the Shares or enforcing its rights under this Agreement. Each Shareholder
shall be entitled to independently protect and enforce its rights,
including without limitation the rights arising out of this Agreement, and it
shall not be necessary for any other Shareholder to be joined as an
additional party in any proceeding for such purpose. Each of Golden Sunset and
DDLX acknowledges that each of the Shareholders has been provided with this
same Agreement for the purpose of closing a transaction with multiple
Shareholders and not because it was required or requested to do so by any
Shareholder.

  



    

 | -12-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

  



  

8.6.  _Limitation of Liability_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, each of DDLX and Golden Sunset acknowledges and agrees that the
liability of a Shareholder arising directly or indirectly under this Agreement
and any other documents or agreements executed in connection with the
Transactions of any and every nature whatsoever shall be satisfied solely out
of the assets of such Shareholder, and that no trustee, officer, other
investment vehicle or any other affiliate of such Shareholder or any
investor, shareholder or holder of shares of beneficial interest of such
Shareholder shall be personally liable for any liabilities of
such Shareholder.

  



  

8.7.  _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to a
Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation".

  



  

8.8.  _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse
to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that
the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

  



  

8.9.  _Counterparts; Electronic Execution_. This Agreement may be executed in
two (2) or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but
all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
Counterparts may be delivered via facsimile, electronic mail (including pdf
or any electronic signature complying with the U.S. federal ESIGN Act of 2000,
e.g., www.docusign.com) or other transmission method and any counterpart so
delivered shall be deemed to have been duly and validly delivered and be
valid and effective for all purposes.

  



  

8.10.  _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement, taken
together with the Golden Sunset Disclosure Letter and the other agreements
and documents referred to herein, (a) constitute the entire agreement and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the Parties with respect to the Transactions and (b) are not intended to
confer upon any person other than the Parties any rights or remedies.

  



  

8.11.  _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Nevada, regardless of the laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws
thereof.

  



  

8.12.  _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests
or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part,
by operation of law or otherwise by any of the Parties without the prior
written consent of each of the other Parties. Any purported assignment
without such consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.
