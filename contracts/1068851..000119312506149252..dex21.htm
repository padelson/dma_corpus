respective shareholders, boards of directors, committees elected or appointed
thereby, officers and agents, which were valid and effective immediately prior

and shall be as effective and binding thereon as the same were with respect
to the Company and Prosperity, respectively, as of the Effective Time.



 

-2- Section 1.3 _Board of Directors and Officers of Continuing Corporation_. At
the Effective Time and until thereafter changed in accordance with applicable
law or the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of Continuing Corporation, the

in entity and identity of the Company and Prosperity. All rights, franchises
and interests of the Company and Prosperity, respectively, in and to any type
of property and choses in action shall be transferred to and vested in
Continuing Corporation by virtue of such Merger without reversion or
impairment, without further act or deed and without any assignment having

Section 1.5  _Liabilities of Continuing Corporation_. At the Effective Time,
Continuing Corporation shall be liable for all liabilities of the Company and

other obligees and all liens on property of either the Company or Prosperity
shall be preserved unimpaired subsequent to the Merger. 

Section 1.6 _Ratification by Shareholders_. This Agreement shall be submitted

cooperate fully in the procurement of any other consents and approvals and the
taking of any other actions in satisfaction of all other requirements

") and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the " _OCC_ ").

Section 1.7 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended by the parties hereto that the
Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code, and the parties hereto hereby adopt this Agreement as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of
the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.



 

-3- Section 1.8 _Modification of Structure_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, Prosperity may elect, subject to the filing of all
necessary applications and the receipt of all required regulatory approvals,
to modify the structure of the transactions contemplated hereby so long as (i)
there are no material adverse federal income tax consequences to the
shareholders of the Company as a result of such modification, (ii) the
consideration to be paid to holders of Company Common Stock under this
Agreement is not thereby changed in kind or reduced in amount solely because
of such modification and (iii) such modification will not be likely to
materially delay or jeopardize receipt of any required regulatory approvals.
In the event of such election, the parties agree to execute an
appropriate amendment to this Agreement in order to reflect such election.

thereof, be cancelled and converted into and represent the right to receive
one share of common stock, $1.00 par value, of Prosperity (" _Prosperity
Common Stock_ ") (the " _Exchange Ratio_ "), plus cash in lieu of any
fractional share of Prosperity Common Stock (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").
At the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Stock shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and each certificate previously representing any such shares
shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

" _Average Closing Price_ " of Prosperity Common Stock shall be the average of
the closing price per share of Prosperity Common Stock on The Nasdaq Stock
Market, Inc. National Market System (" _Nasdaq_ ") (as reported in _The Wall
Street Journal_ or, if not reported thereby, another alternative source as
chosen by Prosperity) for the twenty (20) consecutive trading days ending on
and including the tenth trading day preceding the Closing Date.

(b) Each share of Company Stock held in the treasury of the Company and each
share of Company Stock owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary
of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled
without any conversion and no payment or distribution shall be made
with respect thereto.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Prosperity
will not issue any certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of
Prosperity Common Stock otherwise issuable pursuant to the Merger. In lieu of
the issuance of any such fractional shares, Prosperity shall pay to each
former holder of Company Stock otherwise entitled to receive such fractional
share an amount of cash determined by multiplying (i) the Average Closing
Price (as defined in Section 2.2(d) hereof) by (ii) the fraction of a share of
Prosperity Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive pursuant to this Section 2.1.



 

-4- Section 2.2 _Adjustment to Exchange Ratio_.

(a) The aggregate number of shares of Prosperity Common Stock to be exchanged
for each share of Company Stock shall be adjusted appropriately to
reflect any change in the number of shares of Prosperity Common Stock by
reason of any stock dividends or splits, reclassification, recapitalization or
conversion with respect to Prosperity Common Stock, received or to be received
by holders of Prosperity Common Stock, when the record date or payment occurs
prior to the Effective Time.

(b) In the event the Average Closing Price shall be less than $28.50, the
Company may give notice of its intent to terminate the Agreement as provided
in Section 9.1(f) hereof; subject to Prosperitys right, in its sole and
absolute discretion, to increase the Exchange Ratio to a number (rounded to
the nearest ten thousandth) determined by multiplying (i) the quotient of
$28.50 divided by the Average Closing Price of Prosperity and (ii) the
Exchange Ratio. If Prosperity elects to make the Walkaway Counter Offer (as
defined in Section 9.1(f)), it shall give prompt written notice to the
Company of such election, which notice shall include the revised Exchange
Ratio. Any references in this Agreement to "Exchange Ratio" shall thereafter
be deemed to refer to the Exchange Ratio after giving effect to any
adjustment set forth in the Walkaway Counter Offer Notice.

(c) Except as provided in Section 6.12 hereof, in the event the Average
Closing Price of Prosperity is greater than $34.84, the Exchange Ratio shall
be adjusted to a number determined by multiplying (i) the quotient of $34.84
divided by the Average Closing Price of Prosperity and (ii) the Exchange
Ratio.

Section 2.3 _Treatment of Company Stock Options_.

(a) At any time prior to the Closing Date, each option to acquire shares of
Company Common Stock (" _Company Stock Option_ ") may be purchased or
acquired by the Company or exercised for cash by the holder in accordance with
its terms. Notwithstanding anything in any Company Stock Option Plan (as
defined below) to the contrary, at the Effective Time, each Company Stock
Option which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto
pursuant to the Texas United Bancshares, Inc. 1998 Incentive Stock Option
Plan, the Texas United Bancshares, Inc. 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, the 1998
Incentive Stock Option Plan for Gateway Holding Company, Inc. or pursuant to
a nonqualified stock option agreement with the Company (collectively, the "
_Company Stock Option Plans_ ") shall automatically become vested and shall,
at the option of the holder, either (i) be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive the Cash Option Consideration (as defined below), or (ii) be
converted (automatically and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof) into the right to receive the Prosperity Option Consideration (as
defined below).

"Cash Option Consideration" shall mean, with respect to each Company
Stock Option, a cash payment equal to the difference between (1) the Exchange
Ratio multiplied by the Average Closing Price and (2) the exercise price of
such Company Stock Option as listed on _Schedule 3.2(d)_.



 

-5- "Prosperity Option Consideration" shall mean an option (a " _Prosperity
Option_ ") to purchase shares of Prosperity Common Stock in an amount and at
an exercise price determined as provided below (and otherwise subject to the
terms of the Company Stock Option Plan and/or agreement evidencing the grant
thereunder):

(i) The number of shares of Prosperity Common Stock to be subject to the
Prosperity Option (rounded to the nearest whole share) shall be equal to the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Option
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio; and

(ii) The exercise price per share of Prosperity Common Stock under the
Prosperity Option shall be equal to the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock under the Company Stock Option divided by the Exchange Ratio.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Prosperity
will not issue a Prosperity Option representing the right to purchase
any fractional share of Prosperity Common Stock. In lieu of the issuance of a
Prosperity Option to purchase such fractional share, Prosperity shall pay a
cash payment determined by multiplying (i) the difference between (A) the
Average Closing Price and (B) the exercise price of such Prosperity Option by
(ii) the fraction of a share of Prosperity Common Stock which such holder
would otherwise be entitled to receive upon the exercise of such Prosperity
Option.

(c) The adjustment provided herein with respect to any options which are
"incentive stock options" as defined in Section 422 of the Code shall be and
is intended to be effected in a manner which is consistent with Section 424(a)
of the Code. The duration and other terms of the Prosperity Option shall be
the same as the Company Stock Option except that all references to
the Company shall be deemed to be references to Prosperity.

Section 2.4 _Dissenting Shares_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, the holder of which
has not voted in favor of the Merger and who has delivered a written demand
for payment of the fair value of such shares within the time and in the manner
provided in Article 5.12 of the TBCA, is referred to herein as a "
_Dissenting Share_." Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or
represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.1 of this Agreement unless and until such holder shall have failed to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his right to appraisal and
payment under Article 5.12 of the TBCA. If any such holder shall have so
failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right,
such holders Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted into and to have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the
right to receive the Merger Consideration without any interest thereon.

Section 2.5 _Exchange of Shares_.

(a) Prosperity shall deposit or cause to be deposited in trust with
Computershare Investor Services, Inc., Denver, Colorado (the " _Exchange
Agent_ ") (i) certificates representing shares of Prosperity Common Stock and
(ii) cash in an aggregate



 

-6- amount sufficient to make the appropriate payments (A) to holders of
Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 2.4 hereof, if any, and (B) holders of
a fraction of a share of Prosperity Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(c)
(such certificates and cash being referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose, except as provided in
this Agreement. The Exchange Agent shall promptly deliver the stock
certificates representing shares of Prosperity Common Stock and the cash
payment upon surrender of certificates representing shares of Company Common
Stock.

(b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall
mail to each record holder of an outstanding certificate or certificates
which as of the Effective Date represented shares of Company Common Stock (the
" _Certificates_ "), a form letter of transmittal which will specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
Agent and contain instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates for payment therefor. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a
Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the amount of cash and number of shares of Prosperity Common Stock provided
in Section 2.1 hereof, and such Certificate shall forthwith be cancelled.
Prosperity shall provide the Exchange Agent with certificates for Prosperity
Common Stock, as requested by the Exchange Agent, for the number of shares
provided in Section 2.1. No interest will be paid or accrued with respect to
the shares of Prosperity Common Stock or cash payable upon surrender of the
Certificates. Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 2.5, each Certificate (other than Certificates representing
Dissenting Shares) shall represent for all purposes the right to receive the
Merger Consideration without any interest thereon.

(c) No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time with
respect to shares of Prosperity Common Stock and payable to the
holders thereof shall be paid to the holder of a Certificate until such
holder surrenders such Certificate to the Exchange Agent in accordance with
this Section 2.5. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this
Section 2.5, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such
dividends or other distributions, without interest thereon, which had become
payable after the Effective Time with respect to the shares of Prosperity
Common Stock represented by such Certificate. 

(d) After the Effective Time, the stock transfer ledger of the Company shall
be closed and there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Company of the shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to Prosperity, they shall be promptly presented to
the Exchange Agent and exchanged as provided in this Section 2.5.

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of
any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of the
Company for six months after the Exchange Agent mails the letter of
transmittal pursuant to Section 2.5 shall be returned to Prosperity upon
demand, and any shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied
with the exchange procedures in this Article II shall look to Prosperity only,
and not the Exchange Agent, for the payment of any Merger Consideration in
respect of such shares.



 

-7- (f) If any certificate representing shares of Prosperity Common Stock is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance
thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be appropriately endorsed
(or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in
proper form (reasonably satisfactory to Prosperity) for transfer, and that the
person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate
representing shares of Prosperity Common Stock in any name other than that of
the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or required for any
other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such tax has been paid or not payable.

(g) None of Prosperity, the Company, the Exchange Agent or any other person
shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for
any Prosperity Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto) or cash properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 

(h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Prosperity or
the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as
Prosperity or the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against Prosperity with respect to such Certificate,
the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant
to this Agreement.

remedies), and is in full force and effect; there are no existing defaults by
the Company or, to the Companys knowledge, the other party thereunder and, to
the Companys knowledge, there are no allegations or assertions of such by any

located on any Company Real Property, nor any appurtenances thereto or
equipment therein, nor the operation or maintenance thereof, violates in any
material manner any restrictive covenants or encroaches on any property owned
by others, nor does any building or structure of third parties encroach upon
any Company Real Property, except for those violations and encroachments which
in the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company. No condemnation proceeding is pending or, to the
Companys knowledge, threatened, which could reasonably be expected to

not yet delinquent or which are being contested in good faith through proper

improvement district assessments, easements, covenants, restrictions and
other matters of record which do not, individually or in the aggregate,
materially adversely affect the use and enjoyment of the relevant real
property.

facilities used in the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries are in

consistent with past practices.

Section 4.8 _Prosperity Employee Benefit Plans_. The employee pension benefit
plans and welfare plans (referred to collectively herein as the " _Prosperity
Plans_ ") that are sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Prosperity and
its Subsidiaries have all been operated in all material respects in compliance
with ERISA, the Code and any other applicable laws. None of the Prosperity
Plans nor any of their respective related trusts have been terminated (except
the termination of any Prosperity Plan which is in compliance with the
requirements of ERISA and which will not result in any additional liability
to Prosperity), and there has been no "reportable event," as that term is
defined in Section 4043 of ERISA, required to be reported since the effective
date of ERISA which has not been reported, and none of such Prosperity Plans
nor their respective related trusts have incurred any "accumulated funding
deficiency," as such term is defined in Section 302 of ERISA (whether or not
waived), since the effective date of ERISA. The Prosperity Plans are the only
employee pension benefit plans covering employees of Prosperity and its
Subsidiaries. Prosperity and its Subsidiaries will not have any material
liabilities with respect to employee pension benefits, whether vested or
unvested as of the Closing Date, for any of their employees other than under
the Prosperity Plans, other than the benefits due under such plans. Neither
Prosperity not any of its Subsidiaries contributes or, has within the last six
years contributed to, any multiemployer plan.

 



 

-30- Section 4.9 _Compliance with Laws and Regulatory Filings_. Prosperity and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local
laws, rules, regulations and orders applicable to them, except where such
noncompliance would not result in a Material Adverse Effect on Prosperity.
Except for approvals by regulatory authorities having supervisory
jurisdiction over Prosperity and its Subsidiaries, no prior consent, approval
or authorization of, or declaration, filing or registrations with, any person
or regulatory authority is required of Prosperity and its Subsidiaries in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance by Prosperity of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Prosperity and its
Subsidiaries have filed all reports, registrations and statements, together
with any amendments required to be made thereto, that are required to be
filed with the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, the TDB or any other
regulatory authority having supervisory jurisdiction over Prosperity and its
Subsidiaries, and such reports, registrations and statements, as finally
amended or corrected, are, to the knowledge of Prosperity and its
Subsidiaries, true and correct in all material respects.

Section 4.10 _Taxes_. Prosperity and its Subsidiaries have filed with the
appropriate governmental authorities all material Tax Returns and reports
required to be filed, and have paid all Taxes and assessments due and owing
(whether or not shown on any Tax Return). At the time of filing, all such Tax
Returns were correct and complete in all material respects. Neither Prosperity
nor any of its Subsidiaries has executed or filed with any governmental
authority any agreement extending the period for assessment and collection of
any Tax. Neither Prosperity nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
pending action or proceeding by any governmental authority for assessment
or collection of Taxes, nor has any written claim for assessment or
collection of Taxes been asserted against Prosperity or any of its
Subsidiaries.

Section 4.11 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since March 31, 2006, (i)
Prosperity and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses in
the ordinary and usual course consistent with prudent banking
practices (excluding the incurrence of expenses related to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby) and (ii) no event has occurred or
circumstance arisen that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or is
reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect on Prosperity.

Section 4.12 _Insurance_. All insurance policies owned by Prosperity or by
which Prosperity or any of its properties or assets is covered are in full
force and effect. All such policies, taken together, provide adequate
insurance coverage for the assets and operations of Prosperity for all
material risks to which Prosperity is normally exposed in the operation of
its business. No insurance has been refused with respect to any operations,
properties, or assets of Prosperity nor has any insurance been limited by any
insurance carrier that has carried, or received any application for any such
insurance during the last three years. Prosperity has no reason to believe
that existing insurance coverage cannot be renewed as and when the same shall
expire upon terms and conditions as favorable as those presently in effect,
other than possible increases in premiums or unavailability of coverage that
does not result from any extraordinary loss experience on the part of
Prosperity.

Section 4.13 _Brokers, Finders and Financial Advisors_. Other than Keefe,
Bruyette and Woods, Inc., neither Prosperity nor any of its officers, directors
or employees have employed any broker, finder, financial advisor or
investment banker or incurred any liability for any brokerage, financial
advisory, investment banking or other fees or commissions in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.



 

-31- Section 4.14 _Sarbanes-Oxley Act Compliance_. Prosperity and its Subsidiaries
and any of the officers and directors of Prosperity and its Subsidiaries, in
their capacities as such, are in compliance, in all material respects, with
the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder by the SEC and Nasdaq.

Section 4.15 _Prosperity Information_. None of the information relating to
Prosperity and its Subsidiaries that is provided by Prosperity for inclusion
in (i) the Proxy Statement will contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, and (ii) the Registration Statement will,
at the time the Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement
thereto, if any, becomes effective under the Securities Act contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact

misleading.

Prosperity or a successor entity on the same terms and conditions as provided
for in this Agreement and (ii) that if such Prosperity Transaction is
completed before the Effective Time, the shareholders of the Company will be

give prompt notice to Prosperity, and Prosperity shall give prompt notice to
the Company, of (i) any representation or warranty made by it in
this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect,
including, without limitation, as a result of any change in a Disclosure
Schedule, or (ii) the failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement; provided, however, that no such notification shall
affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties
or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement; and
provided further, however, that if such notification under clause (i) relates
to any matter which arises for the first time after the date of this
Agreement, then the other party may only terminate this Agreement if such
matter would cause the condition set forth in Section 10.3 with respect to the
Company and in Section 11.3 with respect to Prosperity, incapable of being
satisfied.



 

-47- Section 7.2 _Confidentiality_. Prosperity and the Company will not disclose,
and will cause their respective representatives to not disclose, directly or
indirectly, before or after the consummation or termination of this Agreement,
any confidential information, whether written or oral (" _Subject Information_
") acquired from the other party to any person, firm, corporation,
association or other entity for any reason or purpose whatsoever, other than
in connection with the regulatory notice and application process or, after
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1 hereof, use such
Subject Information for its own purposes or for the benefit of any person,
firm, corporation, association, or other entity under any circumstances. The
term "Subject Information" does not include any information that (i) at the
time of disclosure or thereafter is generally available to and known to the
public, other than by a breach of this Agreement by the disclosing party, (ii)
was available to the disclosing party on a nonconfidential basis from a
source other than the nondisclosing party or (iii) was independently acquired
or developed without violating any obligations of this Agreement.

any of their officers, directors or representatives to, issue or cause the
publication of any press release or public announcement with respect to,
or otherwise make any public announcement concerning, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the consent of the other party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

Section 7.4 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

(a) The Company shall execute and deliver such instruments and take such other
actions as Prosperity may reasonably require in order to cause the amendment
or termination of any of its employee benefit plans on terms satisfactory
to Prosperity and in accordance with applicable law and effective no later
than the Closing Date. Prosperity agrees that the employees of the Company who
continue their employment after the Closing Date (the " _Company Employees_ ")
will be entitled to participate as newly hired employees in the employee
benefit plans and programs maintained for employees of Prosperity and
Prosperity Bank, in accordance with the respective terms of such plans and
programs, and Prosperity shall take all actions necessary or appropriate to
facilitate coverage of the Company Employees in such plans and programs from
and after the Closing Date, subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this Section
7.4.

(b) Each Company Employee will be entitled to credit for prior service with
the Company for all purposes under the employee welfare benefit plans
and other employee benefit plans and programs (including any severance
programs but excluding stock option plans), sponsored by Prosperity or
Prosperity Bank to the extent the Company sponsored a similar type of plan in
which the Company Employees participated immediately prior to the Closing
Date. To the extent permitted by such plans, any eligibility waiting period
and pre-existing condition exclusion applicable to such plans and programs
shall be waived with respect to each Company Employee and their eligible
dependents, unless such waiting periods or exclusions would not have been
waived under the similar plans of the Company in which such Company Employee
participated immediately prior to the Closing Date. For purposes
of determining Company Employees benefits for the calendar year in



 

-48- which the Merger occurs under Prosperitys vacation program, any vacation
taken by a Company Employee immediately preceding the Closing Date for the
calendar year in which the Merger occurs will be deducted from the total
Prosperity vacation benefit available to such Company Employee for such
calendar year. Prosperity further agrees to credit each Company Employee and
their eligible dependents for the year during which coverage under
Prosperitys group health plan begins, with any deductibles already incurred
during such year, under the Companys group health plan.

(c) Each Company Employee shall be entitled to credit for past service with
the Company for the purpose of satisfying any eligibility or vesting
periods applicable to Prosperity employee benefit plans which are subject to
Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code (including, without limitation,
Prosperitys 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan).

Section 7.5 _Attendance at Certain Company and Bank Meetings_. In order to
facilitate the continuing interaction of Prosperity with the Company and the
Banks, and in order to keep each party fully advised of all ongoing activities
of the other party, subject to the limitation in this Section 7.5, each party
agrees to allow the other party (the " _Visiting Party_ ") to designate two
representatives (who shall be officers of the Visiting Party), each of whom
will be allowed to attend as an invited guest and fully monitor all regular
and called meetings of the board of directors and loan and discount and
asset liability management committees of the other party (including, but not
limited to, meetings of the officers loan committee of the other party). Each
such party, as the case may be, shall promptly give the Visiting Party prior
notice by telephone of all called meetings. Such representatives shall be
bound by Visiting Partys confidentiality obligations under this Agreement and
shall have no right to vote and may be excluded from sessions of the board of
directors or loan or investment committee during which there is being
discussed (i) matters involving this Agreement, (ii) information or material
which the party hosting the meeting is required or obligated to maintain as
confidential under applicable laws or regulations, (iii) matters which the
Chairman of the Board determines in his or her reasonable discretion would
constitute a conflict of interest or (iv) pending or threatened litigation or
investigations if, in the opinion of counsel to the party hosting the
meeting, the presence of such representative would or might adversely affect
the confidential nature of or any privilege relating to any matters to be
discussed. No attendance by representatives of the Visiting Party at
the other partys board or committee meetings under this Section 7.5 or
knowledge gained or deemed to have been gained by virtue of such attendance
will affect any of the representations and warranties in this Agreement made
by the party hosting the meeting. If the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are disapproved by any regulatory authority whose approval is
required or the Agreement is otherwise terminated prior to the Effective Time,
then the Visiting Partys designees will no longer be entitled to notice of
and permission to attend such meetings.

decree or ruling or taken any other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the Merger and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall
have been final and non-appealable;

(ii) any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are disapproved by
any regulatory authority or other person whose approval is required to
consummate any of such transactions; or

(iii) the Merger shall not have become effective on or before March 31, 2007
or such later date as shall have been approved in writing by the Boards of
Directors of Prosperity and the Company; provided, however, that the right to
terminate under this Section 9.1(a)(iii) shall not be available to any party
whose failure to fulfill any material obligation under this Agreement has been
the cause of, or has resulted in, the failure of the Merger to become
effective on or before such date;

(b) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing by the
Board of Directors of the Company if (i) Prosperity shall fail to comply in
any material respect with any of its covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, or if any of the representations or warranties of Prosperity
contained herein shall be inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) if
the conditions set forth in Article XI have not been met or waived by the
Company. In the event the Board of Directors of the Company desires to
terminate this Agreement because of an alleged breach or inaccuracy as
provided in clause (i) above, such Board of Directors must notify Prosperity
in writing of its intent to terminate stating the reason therefor. Prosperity
shall have fifteen (15) days from the receipt of such notice to cure the
alleged breach or inaccuracy.

(c) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing by
action of the Board of Directors of Prosperity if (i) the Company shall fail
to comply in any material respect with any of its covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement, or if any of the representations or warranties of
the Company contained herein shall be inaccurate in any material respect or
(ii) if the conditions set forth in Article X have not been met or waived by
Prosperity. In the event the Board of Directors of Prosperity desires to

shall have fifteen (15) days from the receipt of such notice to cure the
alleged breach or inaccuracy.



 

-51- (d) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing by
either Prosperity or the Company if the approval of the shareholders of
Prosperity or the Company contemplated by this Agreement shall not have been
obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at the meeting
of shareholders of Prosperity or the Company at which they consider the
Agreement.

(e) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing upon the
mutual written consent of Prosperity and the Company and the approval of such
action by their respective Boards of Directors.

(f) This Agreement may be terminated any time prior to Closing by the Board
of Directors of the Company at any time during the five-day period following
the tenth trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the
"Determination Date"), if the Average Closing Price of the Prosperity Common
Stock shall be less than $28.50, subject to the following. If the Company
elects to exercise its termination right pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence, it shall give prompt written notice to Prosperity; provided
that such notice of election to terminate may be withdrawn at any time within
the aforementioned five-day period. During the five-day period commencing with
its receipt of such notice, Prosperity shall have the option of increasing the
Exchange Ratio as set forth in Section 2.2(b) hereof (" _Walkaway Counter

such election and the revised Exchange Ratio, whereupon no termination shall
have occurred pursuant to this Section 9.1(f) and this Agreement shall remain

If Prosperity declares or effects a stock dividend, reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction prior to the Determination Date, the prices for the Prosperity
Common Stock shall be appropriately adjusted for the purposes of applying this

Board of Directors of the Company if prior to the Effective Time, the Company

9.3(c)) and the Companys Board of Directors determines in its good faith
judgment and in the exercise of its fiduciary duties, based as to legal
matters on the written advice of independent legal counsel and as
to financial matters on the written advice of Hoefer and Arnett, Incorporated
or an investment banking firm of national reputation, that such alternative
Acquisition Proposal (if consummated pursuant to its terms) is a Superior
Proposal (as defined in Section 9.3(d)) and that the failure to terminate
this Agreement and accept such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with
the proper exercise of such fiduciary duties; provided, however, that
termination under this clause (g) shall not be deemed effective until payment
of the Termination Fee required by Section 9.3.

(h) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing by the
Board of Directors of Prosperity if the Company Board of Directors shall have

resolved to do the foregoing.

Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. Except as provided in Section 9.3, in the
event of termination of this Agreement by either Prosperity or the Company as
provided in Section 9.1 or the abandonment of the Merger without breach by any
party hereto, this Agreement (other than Section 7.2) shall become void and
have no effect, without any liability on the part of any party or its
directors, officers or shareholders. Nothing contained in this Section 9.2
shall relieve any party hereto of any liability for a breach of this
Agreement.

Section 9.3 _Termination Fee_. To compensate Prosperity for entering into this
Agreement, taking actions to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereunder and incurring the costs and expenses related thereto and other
losses and expenses, including foregoing the pursuit of other opportunities by
Prosperity, the Company and Prosperity agree as follows:

(a) Provided that Prosperity shall not be in material breach of any covenant
or obligation under this Agreement (which breach has not been cured promptly
following receipt of written notice thereof by the Company specifying in
reasonable detail the basis of such alleged breach), the Company shall pay to
Prosperity the sum of $15,000,000 (the "Termination Fee") if this Agreement is
terminated (i) by the Company under the provisions of Section 9.1(g), (ii) by
either Prosperity or the Company under the provisions of Section 9.1(d), if at
the time of any failure by the shareholders of the Company to approve and
adopt this Agreement and the Merger there shall exist an Acquisition Proposal
with respect to the Company and, within twelve months of the termination of
this Agreement, the Company enters into a definitive agreement with any third
party with respect to any such Acquisition Proposal or (iii) by Prosperity
under the provisions of Section 9.1(h). The payment of the Termination Fee
shall be Prosperitys sole and exclusive remedy with respect to termination of
this Agreement as set forth in this Section 9.3(a).

(b) Any payment required by paragraph (a) of this Section 9.3 shall become
payable within two (2) business days after receipt by the non-terminating
party of written notice of termination of this Agreement; provided, however,
that if such termination payment is required pursuant to clause (ii) of
Section 9.3(a), then such termination payment shall become payable within two
(2) business days after the execution and delivery by the Company of such
definitive agreement.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means a written
offer or proposal which contains a fixed price per share or a mathematically
ascertainable formula for calculating a price per share for the Company Common
Stock regarding any of the following (other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) involving the Company or any Subsidiary: (i)
any merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, recapitalization,
business combination, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction
involving any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other
disposition of, all or substantially all of the assets or equity securities or
deposits of, the



 

-53- Company or any Subsidiary, in a single transaction or series of related
transactions which could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with,
prevent or materially delay the completion of the Merger; (ii) any tender
offer or exchange offer for all or substantially all of the outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Company or the filing of a registration statement
under the Securities Act in connection therewith; or (iii) any public
announcement of a proposal, plan or intention to do any of the foregoing or
any agreement to engage in any of the foregoing.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal made by a third person that the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in its good faith judgment to be more favorable to the
Companys shareholders than the Merger (taking into account, in good faith,
the written opinion, with only customary qualifications, of the Companys
independent financial advisor that the value of the consideration to the
Companys shareholders provided for in such proposal exceeds the value of the
consideration to the Companys shareholders provided for in the Merger) and
for which financing, to the extent required, is then committed or which, in
the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company (taking into
account, in good faith, the written advice of the Companys independent
financial advisor), is reasonably capable of being obtained by such third
person.

waived by Prosperity and the Company, respectively, in their sole discretion:

Section 12.1 _Government Approvals_. Prosperity shall have received the
approval, or waiver of approval, of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement from all necessary governmental agencies and authorities, including
the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, the TDB, the OCC and any other regulatory
agency whose approval must be received in order to consummate the Merger,
which approvals shall not impose any restrictions on the operations
of Prosperity or the Continuing Corporation which are unacceptable to
Prosperity; provided, however, that any branch divestiture required by any
governmental agency shall not be deemed to impose unacceptable restrictions on
the operations of Prosperity, and such approvals and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall not have been contested by any federal or state
governmental authority or any third party (except shareholders asserting

and Prosperity shall have approved this Agreement and the transactions

Section 12.3 _Tax Opinion_. The Company shall have received an opinion of

counsel to Prosperity, in each case dated the Closing Date, to the effect
that, based on the terms of this Agreement and on the basis of certain facts,
representations and opinions set forth in such opinion, the Merger will
qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. In rendering
such opinion, such counsel may require and rely upon and may incorporate by
reference representations and covenants, including those contained in
certificates of officers and/or directors of the Company, Prosperity and
others.

Statement covering the shares of Prosperity Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger shall have become effective under the Securities Act and no stop orders
suspending such effectiveness shall be in effect, and no action, suit,
proceeding or investigation by the SEC to suspend the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement shall have been initiated or continuing, or have been
threatened and be unresolved, and all necessary approvals under states
securities laws relating to the issuance or trading of the Prosperity Common
Stock to be issued in the Merger shall have been received.
