to such PFC Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio,
provided that any fractional shares of FNB Common Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be
rounded down to the nearest share, and (iv)&nbsp;the exercise price per share of FNB Common Stock under
each such option shall be the amount (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the per share
exercise price under each such PFC Stock Option prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange
Ratio. Notwithstanding clauses (iii)&nbsp;and (iv)&nbsp;of the preceding sentence, each PFC Stock Option
that is an &#147;incentive stock option&#148; shall be adjusted as required by Section&nbsp;424 of the Code, and
regulations promulgated thereunder, so as not to constitute a modification, extension or renewal of
the option within the meaning of Section 424(h) of the Code. FNB and PFC agree to take all
reasonable and necessary steps to effect the provisions of this Section&nbsp;1.6(a). As of the Effective
Time, FNB shall issue to each holder of each outstanding PFC Stock Option that has been assumed by
FNB (the &#147;Assumed Stock Options&#148;) a document evidencing the conversion and assumption of such PFC

similarly-situated employees of FNB and its Subsidiaries, it being understood that inclusion of the
employees of PFC and the PFC Subsidiaries in the FNB Plans may occur at different times with
respect to different plans, provided that coverage shall be continued under corresponding Benefit

documents with the IRS for a determination letter that the termination of the ESOP as of the ESOP

their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain such favorable determination letter (including,
but not limited to, adopting such amendments to the ESOP as may be requested by the IRS as a
condition to its issuance of a favorable determination letter). As soon as practicable following
the later of the Effective Time or the receipt of a favorable determination letter from the IRS
regarding the qualified status of the ESOP upon its termination, the account balances in the ESOP
shall be either distributed to participants and beneficiaries or transferred to an eligible
tax-qualified retirement plan or individual retirement account as a participant or beneficiary may

their ESOP account balance prior to the receipt of the IRS determination letter but following their
termination of employment. FNB agrees to permit ESOP participants who become employees of FNB and

before 5:00 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time on April&nbsp;30, 2012, except to the extent that the failure of

set forth in the Agreement, subject to the closing of the Merger. All defined terms used but not
defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A condition to FNB&#146;s obligations under the Agreement is that I execute and deliver this Letter
Agreement to FNB.

transactions contemplated thereby all shares of PFC common stock over which I have sole voting
power, and will use my best efforts to cause any shares of PFC common stock over which I share
voting power to be voted for approval and adoption of the Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby. Beneficial ownership shall have the meaning assigned to it pursuant to Rule
13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;On or prior to the record date (the &#147;Record Date&#148;) for the meeting of the PFC shareholders
to vote on approval and adoption of the Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, I (i)
will not offer, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares of PFC common stock over which I
have sole dispositive power, and (ii)&nbsp;shall use my best efforts to not permit the offer, sale,
transfer or other disposition of any shares of PFC common stock over which I have shared
dispositive power, except to the extent that I may be permitted under law to make charitable gifts
or as permitted by paragraph (g)&nbsp;hereof.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;I have beneficial ownership over the number of shares of PFC common stock, and hold stock
options for the number of shares of PFC common stock, if any, set forth in Appendix&nbsp;A hereto.

stock over which I have sole voting and dispositive power, and PFC&#146;s transfer agent shall be given
appropriate stop transfer orders and shall not be required to register any such attempted sale,
unless the sale has been effected in compliance with the terms of this Letter Agreement.
