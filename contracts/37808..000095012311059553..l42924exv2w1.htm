 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June 15, 2011 (this "Agreement"), between F.N.B. CORPORATION, a Florida corporation ("FNB"), and PARKVALE FINANCIAL CORPORATION, a Pennsylvania corporation ("PFC"). 

  

W I T N E S S E T H: 

   

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of PFC and FNB have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their shareholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction provided for in this Agreement pursuant to which PFC will, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, merge with and into FNB (the "Merger"), so that FNB is the surviving company in the Merger (sometimes referred to in such capacity as the "Surviving Company"); and 

  

 WHEREAS, for federal income Tax (as defined in Section 3.10(b)) purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"); and 

  

 WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE 1 

   

THE MERGER 

  

 1.1 _The Merger_. 

  

 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law (the "PBCL") and the Florida Business Corporation Act (the "FBCA"), at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2) PFC shall merge with and into FNB. FNB shall be the Surviving Company in the Merger, and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Florida. As of the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of PFC shall cease. 

  

 1.2 _Effective Time_. 

  

 The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the articles of merger (the "Articles of Merger") that shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Secretary of State of the State of Florida on or before the Closing Date (as defined in Section 9.1). The term "Effective Time" shall mean the date and time when the Merger becomes 

   ##### 

  

 

effective as set forth in the Articles of Merger. "Effective Date" shall mean
the date on which the Effective Time occurs. 

   

 1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. 

  

 (a) _Effects Under PBCL and FBCA_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 1929 of the PBCL and Section 607.1106 of the FBCA. 

   

 (b) _Directors and Executive Officers of the Surviving Company_. The directors of the Surviving Company immediately after the Merger shall be the (i) directors of FNB immediately prior to the Merger, and (ii) one (1) current member of PFCs Board of Directors (the "PFC Designee"), who shall be Robert J. McCarthy, Jr. If Mr. McCarthy does not become a director of the Surviving Company because of death or disability, FNB agrees, after consultation with the members of the Board of Directors of PFC, to cause a member of the PFC Board of Directors as of the date hereof who is mutually agreeable to FNB and PFC to be elected or appointed to the Board of Directors of the Surviving Company as the PFC Designee. The executive officers of the Surviving Company immediately after the Merger shall be the executive officers of FNB immediately prior to the Merger. 

   

 1.4 _Conversion of PFC Capital Stock_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of PFC ("PFC Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Treasury Shares (as defined in Section 1.4(c)) shall, by virtue of the Merger, no longer be outstanding and shall as of the Effective Time automatically be converted into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive as merger consideration (the "Common Stock Merger Consideration") 2.178 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of common stock, $0.01 par value, of FNB ("FNB Common Stock"). 

   

 (b) In the event each issued and outstanding share of the Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, par value $1.00 per share, stated liquidation amount $1,000 per share, of PFC (the "PFC Series A Preferred Stock") is not purchased or redeemed prior to or contemporaneous with the Merger, then each share of the PFC Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of PFC Series A Preferred Stock to be cancelled in accordance with Section 1.4(c)) shall no longer be outstanding and shall as of the Effective Time automatically be converted into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive, subject to the other provisions of this Article 1, one share (the "Preferred Stock Merger Consideration" and, together with the Common Stock Merger Consideration, the "Merger Consideration") of the FNB Preferred Stock to be designated, prior to the Closing Date, as Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series D, stated liquidation amount $1,000 per share (the "FNB Series D Preferred Stock"), and otherwise having rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers such that the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the PFC Series A Preferred Stock are not adversely affected by such conversion and having rights, preferences and privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions that, taken as a whole, are not materially less favorable than the 

  ##### 

  

    

rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and
restrictions of the PFC Series A Preferred Stock immediately prior to such
conversion, taken as a whole. 

   

 (c) At and after the Effective Time, each Treasury Share shall be cancelled and retired and no shares of FNB Common Stock or other consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor. "Treasury Shares" means shares of PFC Common Stock and any outstanding PFC Series A Preferred Stock (together, the "PFC Capital Stock") held by PFC or any of the PFC Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 3.1(c)) or by FNB or any of its Subsidiaries, other than in a fiduciary, including custodial or agency, capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted in good faith. 

   

 (d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of PFC shall be closed as to holders of PFC Capital Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time and no transfer of PFC Capital Stock by any such holder shall thereafter be made or recognized. If, after the Effective Time, certificates representing PFC Capital Stock ("Certificates") are properly presented in accordance with Section 2.2 of this Agreement to the Exchange Agent (as defined in Section 2.1), such Certificates shall be cancelled and exchanged for FNB Common Stock or FNB Series D Preferred Stock (together, the "FNB Capital Stock"), as applicable, held in book entry representing the number of whole shares into which the PFC Capital Stock represented by the Certificates was converted in the Merger, plus, if applicable pursuant to Section 1.4(f), any payment for any fractional share of FNB Common Stock without any interest thereon and any dividends or distributions to which the holder of such Certificates is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(b). 

   

 (e) Each holder of PFC Common Stock shall have the option of enrolling the whole shares of FNB Common Stock issuable to such shareholder upon the consummation of the Merger in FNBs Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase Plan (the "DRSP Plan"). Each PFC shareholder electing to enroll in the DRSP Plan shall be issued FNB Common Stock held in book entry representing the number of whole shares received in the Merger. 

   

 (f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of PFC Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share of FNB Common Stock, after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder, shall receive an amount in cash, without interest, rounded to the nearest cent, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a) the Average Closing Price (as defined below) as of the Closing Date by (b) the fraction of a share (calculated to the nearest ten-thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of FNB Common Stock, to which such holder would otherwise be entitled. No such holder shall be entitled to dividends or other rights in respect of any such fractional shares. "Average Closing Price" means, as of any specified date, the average composite closing price of FNB Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange, including any successor exchange ("NYSE"), as reported by the NYSE for the twenty (20) consecutive trading days ending on and including the fifth such trading day prior to the specified date rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth. 

       ##### 

  

     

 1.5 _FNB Capital Stock_. At and after the Effective Time, each share of FNB capital stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be affected by the Merger. 

  

 1.6 _PFC Equity and Equity-Based Awards_. 

  

 (a) _PFC Stock Options_. Effective as of the Effective Time, each then outstanding option to purchase shares of PFC Common Stock (each a "PFC Stock Option"), pursuant to the equity-based compensation plans identified in Section 3.11(a) of the PFC Disclosure Schedule (as defined in Article 3 hereof) (the "PFC Stock Plans") and the award agreements evidencing the grants thereunder, granted to any current or former employee or director of PFC or any of the PFC Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 3.1(c)) shall at the Effective Time cease to represent a right to acquire shares of PFC Common Stock and shall be converted automatically into a fully vested and exercisable option to acquire shares of FNB Common Stock on the terms hereinafter set forth. FNB shall assume each such PFC Stock Option in accordance with the terms of the relevant PFC Stock Plan and stock option or other agreement by which it is evidenced, except that from and after the Effective Time: (i) FNB and the Compensation Committee of its Board of Directors, including, if applicable, the entire Board of Directors of FNB, shall be substituted for PFC and the compensation committee of the Board of Directors of PFC, including, if applicable, the entire Board of Directors of PFC, administering such PFC Stock Plan, (ii) each PFC Stock Option assumed by FNB may be exercised solely for shares of FNB Common Stock, (iii) the number of shares of FNB Common Stock subject to such PFC Stock Option shall be equal to the number of shares of PFC Common Stock subject to such PFC Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, provided that any fractional shares of FNB Common Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest share, and (iv) the exercise price per share of FNB Common Stock under each such option shall be the amount (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the per share exercise price under each such PFC Stock Option prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio. Notwithstanding clauses (iii) and (iv) of the preceding sentence, each PFC Stock Option that is an "incentive stock option" shall be adjusted as required by Section 424 of the Code, and regulations promulgated thereunder, so as not to constitute a modification, extension or renewal of the option within the meaning of Section 424(h) of the Code. FNB and PFC agree to take all reasonable and necessary steps to effect the provisions of this Section 1.6(a). As of the Effective Time, FNB shall issue to each holder of each outstanding PFC Stock Option that has been assumed by FNB (the "Assumed Stock Options") a document evidencing the conversion and assumption of such PFC Stock Option by FNB pursuant to this Section 1.6(a). Prior to the Effective Time, FNB shall reserve for issuance the number of shares of FNB Common Stock necessary to satisfy FNBs obligations under this Section 1.6(a). As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, FNB shall file and cause to become effective a registration statement or statements on Form S-8 or Form S-3 (or any successor or other applicable form) with respect to the shares of FNB Common Stock subject to the Assumed Stock Options, and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as any PFC Stock Options remain outstanding. 

   

 (b) _Warrant_. The Warrant issued on December 23, 2008 to the U.S. Department of the Treasury ("Treasury Department") in connection with the issuance of the PFC Series A Preferred Stock (the "PFC Warrant") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without 

  ##### 

  

    

any action on the part of any Person, cease to be a warrant to purchase PFC
Common Stock and will be converted automatically into a warrant to purchase
FNB Common Stock (the "FNB Warrant") in accordance with the terms of the PFC
Warrant, and FNB will assume such warrant subject to its terms; provided,
however, that after the Effective Time: 

    

(i) the number of shares of FNB Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of the
FNB Warrant will equal the product of (x) the number of shares of PFC Common
Stock that were purchasable pursuant to the PFC Warrant immediately before
the Effective Time and (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest one-
hundredth (1/100th) of a share; and 

   

(ii) the per share exercise price for the PFC Warrant will equal the quotient
of (x) the per share exercise price of the PFC Warrant in effect immediately
before the Effective Time and (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest
one-tenth (1/10th) of a cent. 

  

 1.7 _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Company_. The FNB Charter (as defined in Section 4.1(b)) as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Company until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law. The FNB Bylaws (as defined in Section 4.1(b)) as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Company until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law. 

  

 1.8 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. 

  

 1.9 _Dissenting Shares_. No outstanding shares of PFC Common Stock shall have any dissenters rights of appraisal under the PBCL. 

  

 1.10 _The Bank Merger_. As soon as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, PFC and FNB shall cause Parkvale Savings Bank ("PFC Bank") and First National Bank of Pennsylvania ("FNB Bank") to enter into a bank merger agreement, the form of which is attached to this Agreement as Exhibit "A" (the "Bank Merger Agreement"), that provides for the merger of PFC Bank with and into FNB Bank (the "Bank Merger"), in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and the terms of the Bank Merger Agreement and as soon as practicable after consummation of the Merger. The Bank Merger Agreement provides that the directors of FNB Bank ("FNB Bank Board") upon consummation of the Bank Merger shall be the directors of FNB Bank immediately prior to the Bank Merger plus the PFC Bank Designee (as defined in Section 6.14(b)). 

  

 1.11 _Right to Revise Structure_. FNB may at any time change the method of effecting the combination contemplated by this Agreement if and to the extent it deems such a change to be desirable; provided, however, that no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the Common Stock Merger Consideration (as defined in Section 1.4(a)) provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of PFCs shareholders as a result of receiving the Merger Consideration or the Tax treatment of either party pursuant to this Agreement, or (iii) materially impede or delay consummation of the transactions this Agreement contemplates.

appropriate documents to reflect the change. 

   

ARTICLE 2 

   

EXCHANGE OF SHARES 

  

 2.1 _FNB to Make Merger Consideration Available_. As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, FNB shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with Registrar and Transfer Company ("Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article 2, (a) book entry shares representing the aggregate number of shares of FNB Capital Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement in exchange for shares of PFC Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, (b) immediately available funds equal to any dividends or distributions payable in accordance with Section 2.2(b), and (c) cash in lieu of any fractional shares of FNB Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 1.4(f) and paid pursuant to Section 1.4 in exchange for outstanding shares of PFC Capital Stock (such cash and book entry shares for shares of FNB Capital Stock, collectively being referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments due pursuant to Section 2.2 except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. 

  

 2.2 _Exchange Shares_. 

  

 (a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, and in no event more than five business days thereafter, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of PFC Capital Stock a letter of transmittal in customary form as prepared by FNB and reasonably acceptable to PFC which shall specify, among other things, that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the shares of PFC Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(b). After the Effective Time of the Merger, each holder of a Certificate formerly representing PFC Capital Stock, other than Treasury Shares, who surrenders or has surrendered such Certificate or customary affidavits and indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such Certificate, together with duly executed transmittal materials to the Exchange Agent, shall, upon acceptance thereof, be entitled to book entry shares representing FNB Common Stock or FNB Series D Preferred Stock, as applicable, into which the shares of PFC Capital Stock shall have been converted pursuant to Section 1.4, as well as any cash in lieu of any fractional share of FNB Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(b). The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificate upon compliance with such reasonable and customary terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal practices. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, (i) each Certificate representing PFC Common Stock shall be deemed from and after the Effective Time of the Merger to evidence only the right to receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the 

    ##### 

  

    

shares of PFC Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates
shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement and any dividends or
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(b),
and (ii) any Certificate representing PFC Series A Preferred Stock shall be
deemed from and after the Effective Time of the Merger to evidence only the
right to receive the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration and any dividends
or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(b).
FNB shall not be obligated to deliver the Merger Consideration or any check
representing cash in lieu of fractional shares and/or declared but unpaid
dividends to which any former holder of PFC Capital Stock is entitled as a
result of the Merger until such holder surrenders his Certificate or
Certificates for exchange as provided in Section 2.2. If any shares of FNB
Capital Stock, or any check representing cash in lieu of fractional shares
and/or declared but unpaid dividends, is to be issued in a name other than
that in which a Certificate surrendered for exchange is issued, the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper
form for transfer and the person requesting such exchange shall affix any
requisite stock transfer tax stamps to the Certificate surrendered or provide
funds for their purchase or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange
Agent that such taxes are not payable. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to FNB, of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
FNB or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
amount as FNB and the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it, FNB or the Surviving
Company with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

 (b) Following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the whole shares of FNB Capital Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any dividends or distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that have been declared by PFC in respect of shares of PFC Capital Stock after the date of this Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, (ii) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of FNB Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.4(f) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time of the Merger and which had become payable with respect to such whole shares of FNB Common Stock prior to the time of surrender, and (iii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time of the Merger but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of FNB Capital Stock. After the date of this Agreement, PFC shall coordinate with FNB the declaration of any dividends in respect of PFC Capital Stock as provided in Sections 5.2(a) and 6.10. 

   

 (c) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of PFC of the shares of PFC Capital Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle transfers of PFC Capital Stock that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to FNB for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement. All shares of FNB Capital Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares of FNB Common Stock and/or declared but unpaid dividends issued upon the surrender for exchange of shares of PFC Capital Stock or the 

    ##### 

  

    

provision of customary affidavits and indemnification for lost or mutilated
Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof and the letter of
transmittal, shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares of PFC Capital Stock. 

   

 (d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund, including any interest thereon, that remains undistributed to the shareholders of PFC following the passage of twelve (12) months after the Effective Time of the Merger shall be delivered to FNB, upon demand, and any shareholders of PFC who have not theretofore complied with this Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to FNB for payment of their claim for FNB Capital Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of FNB Common Stock and any unpaid dividends or distributions payable in accordance with Section 2.2(b). 

   

 (e) Neither PFC nor FNB shall be liable to any holder of shares of PFC Capital Stock or FNB Capital Stock, as the case may be, for such shares, or dividends or distributions with respect thereto, or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

   

 (f) The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to the shares of FNB Capital Stock held by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or other distributions paid or distributed with respect to such shares of FNB Capital Stock for the account of the Persons entitled thereto. 

   

 2.3 _Adjustments for Dilution and Other Matters_. If prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, (a) FNB shall declare a stock dividend or distribution on FNB Capital Stock with a record date prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, or subdivide, split up, reclassify or combine FNB Capital Stock, or make a distribution other than a regular quarterly cash dividend, on FNB Capital Stock in any security convertible into FNB Capital Stock, in each case with a record date prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, or (b) the outstanding shares of FNB Capital Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities in each case as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar change in FNBs capitalization other than a business combination transaction with another bank holding company or financial services company, then a proportionate adjustment or adjustments will be made to the Exchange Ratio and/or the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, which adjustment may include, as appropriate, the issuance of securities, property or cash on the same basis as that on which any of the foregoing shall have been issued, distributed or paid to holders of such class of FNB Capital Stock generally. 

  

 2.4 _Withholding Rights_. The Exchange Agent or, subsequent to the first anniversary of the Effective Time, FNB, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash portion of the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of FNB Common Stock, cash dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(b) and any other cash amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of PFC Capital Stock such amounts as the Exchange Agent or FNB, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or FNB, as the case 

   ##### 

  

 

may be, such withheld amounts shall be paid to the appropriate Tax authority
by the Exchange Agent or FNB and shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of PFC Capital Stock in
respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent
or FNB, as the case may be.

No trust funding any PFC Plan is intended to meet the requirements of Code Section 501(c)(9). None of PFC and the PFC Subsidiaries nor any other person, including any fiduciary, has engaged in any "prohibited transaction", as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, which would reasonably be expected to 

    #####

 (f) (i) No PFC Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a "Multiple Employer Plan"), (ii) none of PFC and the PFC Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six years, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan and (iii) none of PFC and the PFC Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred, during the last six years, any Withdrawal Liability that has not been satisfied in full. There does not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist that would reasonably be likely to result in, any Controlled Group Liability that would be a liability of PFC or any of the PFC Subsidiaries following the Effective Time, other than such liabilities that arise solely out of, or relate solely to, the PFC Benefit Plans. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither PFC nor any of the PFC Subsidiaries, nor, to PFCs knowledge, any of their respective ERISA Affiliates, has engaged in any transaction described in Sections 4069, 4204 or 4212 of ERISA.

 (h) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(h) of the PFC Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution nor the delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions this Agreement contemplates will, either alone or in conjunction with any other event, whether contingent or otherwise, (i) result in any payment or benefit becoming due or payable, or required to be provided, to any director, employee or independent contractor of PFC or any of PFC Subsidiaries, (ii) increase the amount or value of any benefit or compensation 

    ##### 

  

    

otherwise payable or required to be provided to any such director, employee or
independent contractor, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of

deferred compensation, or (iv) result in any amount failing to be deductible
by reason of Section 280G of the Code or would be subject to an excise tax

Code. 

   

 (i) No labor organization or group of employees of PFC or any of PFC Subsidiaries has made a pending demand for recognition or certification, and there are no representation or certification proceedings or petitions seeking a representation proceeding presently pending or, to PFCs knowledge, threatened to be brought or filed, with the National Labor Relations Board.

 (b) There is no judgment or regulatory restriction, other than those of general application that apply to similarly situated financial or bank holding companies or their Subsidiaries, that has been imposed upon FNB, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of FNB or any of its Subsidiaries that has had or is reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect on FNB. 

   

 4.10 _Taxes and Tax Returns_. Each of FNB and its Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed, including all applicable extensions, all Tax Returns required to be filed by it on or prior to the date of this Agreement, all such Tax Returns being accurate and complete in all material respects, has timely paid or withheld and timely remitted all Taxes shown thereon as arising and has duly and timely paid or withheld and timely remitted all Taxes, whether or not shown on any Tax Return, that are due and payable or claimed to be due from it by a Governmental Entity other than Taxes that (i) are being contested in good faith, which have not been finally determined, and (ii) have been adequately reserved against in accordance with GAAP on FNBs most recent consolidated financial statements. All required estimated Tax payments sufficient to avoid any underpayment penalties or interest have been made by or on behalf of each of FNB and its Subsidiaries. Neither FNB nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted any extension or waiver of the limitation period for the assessment or collection of Tax that remains in effect. There are no disputes, audits, examinations or proceedings in progress or pending, including any notice received of an intent to conduct an audit or examination, or claims asserted, for Taxes upon FNB or any of its Subsidiaries. No claim has been made by a Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction where FNB or any of its Subsidiaries has not filed Tax Returns such that FNB or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. All deficiencies asserted or assessments made as a result of any examinations by any Governmental Entity of the Tax Returns of, or including, FNB or any of its Subsidiaries have been fully paid. No issue has been raised by a Governmental Entity in any prior examination or audit of each of FNB and its Subsidiaries which, by application of the same or similar principles, could reasonably be expected to result in a proposed deficiency in respect of such Governmental Entity for any subsequent taxable period. There are no Liens for Taxes, other than statutory liens for Taxes not yet due and payable, upon any of the assets of FNB or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither FNB nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by any Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement or arrangement, other than such an agreement or arrangement exclusively between or 

   ##### 

  

 

among FNB and its Subsidiaries. Neither FNB nor any of its Subsidiaries (A)
has been a member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income
Tax Return, other than a group the common parent of which was FNB, or (B) has
any liability for the Taxes of any Person, other than FNB or any of its
Subsidiaries, under Treas. Reg. §1.1502-6, or any similar provision of
state, local or foreign law, or as a transferee or successor, by contract or
otherwise. Neither FNB nor any of its Subsidiaries has been, within the past
two years or otherwise as part of a "plan (or series of related
transactions)" within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code, of which
the Merger is also a part, a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled
corporation" within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code), in a
distribution of stock intended to qualify for tax-free treatment under
Section 355 of the Code. No share of FNB Common Stock is owned by
a Subsidiary of FNB. FNB is not and has not been a "United States real
property holding company" within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code
during the applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the
Code. Neither FNB, its Subsidiaries nor any other Person on their behalf has
executed or entered into any written agreement with, or obtained or applied
for any written consents or written clearances or any other Tax rulings from,
nor has there been any written agreement executed or entered into on behalf
of any of them with any Taxing Authority, relating to Taxes, including any
IRS private letter rulings or comparable rulings of any Taxing Authority and
closing agreements pursuant to Section 7121 of the Code or any predecessor
provision thereof or any similar provision of any applicable law, which
rulings or agreements would have a continuing effect after the Effective
Time. Neither FNB nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a "reportable
transaction," as set forth in Treas. Reg. §1.6011-4(b), or any transaction
that is the same as or substantially similar to one of the types of
transactions that the IRS has determined to be a tax avoidance transaction
and identified by notice, regulation or other form of published guidance as a
"listed transaction," as set forth in Treas. Reg. §1.6011-4(b)(2). PFC
has received complete copies of (i) all federal, state, local and foreign
income or franchise Tax Returns of FNB and its Subsidiaries relating to the
taxable periods beginning January 1, 2008 or later and (ii) any audit report
issued within the last three years relating to any Taxes due from or with
respect to FNB or its Subsidiaries. Neither FNB, nor any of its Subsidiaries
will be required to include any item of material income in, or exclude any
material item of deduction from, taxable income for any taxable period, or
portion thereof, ending after the Closing Date as a result of any (i) change
in method of accounting for a taxable period ending on or prior to
the Closing Date, (ii) installment sale or open transaction disposition made
on or prior to the Effective Time, (iii) prepaid amount received on or prior
to the Closing Date or (iv) deferred intercompany gain or any excess loss
account of FNB or any of its Subsidiaries for periods or portions of periods
described in Treasury Regulations under Section 1502 of the Code, or
any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign law, for
periods, or portions thereof, ending on or before the Closing Date. 

   

 4.11 _Employee Benefits_. For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meaning: 

  

 "FNB Benefit Plans" means any employee benefit plan, program, policy, practice or other arrangement providing benefits to any current or former employee, officer or director of FNB or any of its Subsidiaries or any beneficiary or dependent thereof that is sponsored or maintained by FNB or any of its Subsidiaries or to which FNB or any of its Subsidiaries contributes or is obligated to contribute, whether or not written, including without limitation any employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA, any employee 

   ##### 

  

 

pension benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA, whether or
not such plan is subject to ERISA, and any bonus, incentive, deferred
compensation, vacation, stock purchase, stock option, equity compensation,
severance, employment, change of control or fringe benefit plan, program or
policy. 

   

 "FNB Employment Agreement" means a contract, offer letter or agreement of FNB or any of its Subsidiaries with or addressed to any individual who is rendering or has rendered services thereto as an employee pursuant to which FNB or any of its Subsidiaries has any actual or contingent liability or obligation to provide compensation and/or benefits in consideration for past, present or future services. 

  

 "FNB Plan" means any FNB Benefit Plan other than a Multiemployer Plan. 

  

 (a) Section 4.11(a) of the FNB Disclosure Schedule includes a complete list of all FNB Benefit Plans and all FNB Employment Agreements. 

   

 (b) With respect to each FNB Plan, FNB has delivered or made available to PFC a true, correct and complete copy of: (i) each writing constituting a part of such FNB Plan, including without limitation all plan documents, employee communications, benefit schedules, trust agreements, and insurance contracts and other funding vehicles, (ii) the two most recent Annual Reports (Form 5500 Series) and accompanying schedules, if any, (iii) the current summary plan description and any material modifications thereto, if any (in each case, whether or not required to be furnished under ERISA), (iv) the most recent annual financial report, if any, (v) the most recent actuarial report, if any, and (vi) the most recent determination letter from the IRS, if any. FNB has delivered or made available to PFC a true, correct and complete copy of each FNB Employment Agreement. 

   

 (c) All contributions required to be made to any FNB Plan by applicable law or regulation or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any FNB Plan, for any period through the date of this Agreement have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not required to be made or paid on or before the date of this Agreement, have been fully reflected on the financial statements to the extent required by GAAP. Each FNB Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan under Section 3(1) of ERISA either (i) is funded through an insurance company contract and is not a "welfare benefit fund" within the meaning of Section 419 of the Code or (ii) is unfunded, as noted in Section 4.11(c) of the FNB Disclosure Schedule. 

   

 (d) With respect to each FNB Plan, FNB and its Subsidiaries have complied, and are now in compliance, in all material respects, with all provisions of ERISA, the Code and all laws and regulations applicable to such FNB Plans. Each FNB Plan has been administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms. There is not now, nor do any circumstances exist that would reasonably be expected to give rise to, any requirement for the posting of security with respect to a FNB Plan or the imposition of any material lien on the assets of FNB or any of its Subsidiaries under ERISA or the Code. Section 4.11(d) of the FNB Disclosure Schedule identifies each FNB Plan that is intended to be a "qualified plan" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code ("FNB Qualified Plans"). The IRS has issued a favorable determination letter with respect to each FNB Qualified Plan and the related trust 

   ##### 

  

   

which has not been revoked, or FNB is entitled to rely on a favorable opinion
issued by the IRS, and, to the knowledge of FNB, there are no existing
circumstances and no events have occurred that would reasonably be expected
to adversely affect the qualified status of any FNB Qualified Plan or the
related trust. No trust funding any FNB Plan is intended to meet the
requirements of Code Section 501(c)(9). To the knowledge of FNB, none of FNB
and its Subsidiaries nor any other person, including any fiduciary, has
engaged in any "prohibited transaction", as defined in Section 4975 of the
Code or Section 406 of ERISA, which would reasonably be expected to subject
any of the FNB Plans or their related trusts, FNB, any of its Subsidiaries or
any person that FNB or any of its Subsidiaries has an obligation to
indemnify, to any material Tax or penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the
Code or Section 502 of ERISA. 

   

 (e) With respect to each FNB Plan that is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code, (i) there does not exist any accumulated funding deficiency within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, whether or not waived, and, (ii) except as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect: (A) the fair market value of the assets of such FNB Plan equals or exceeds the actuarial present value of all accrued benefits under such FNB Plan, whether or not vested, on a termination basis, (B) no reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which the 30-day notice requirement has not been waived has occurred, (C) all premiums to the PBGC have been timely paid in full, (D) no liability, other than for premiums to the PBGC, under Title IV of ERISA has been or would reasonably be expected to be incurred by FNB or any of its Subsidiaries and (E) the PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate any such FNB Plan and, to FNBs knowledge, no condition exists that presents a risk that such proceedings will be instituted or which would reasonably be expected to constitute grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or the appointment of a trustee to administer, any such FNB Plan. 

   

 (f) (i) No FNB Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a Multiple Employer Plan, (ii) none of FNB and its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six years, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan and (iii) none of FNB and its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred, during the last six years, any Withdrawal Liability that has not been satisfied in full. There does not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist that would reasonably be expected to result in, any Controlled Group Liability that would be a liability of FNB or any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time, other than such liabilities that arise solely out of, or relate solely to, the FNB Benefit Plans. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither FNB nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to FNBs knowledge, any of their respective ERISA Affiliates, has engaged in any transaction described in Sections 4069, 4204 or 4212 of ERISA. 

   

 (g) Other than a medical retirement plan, FNB and its Subsidiaries have no liability for life, health, medical or other welfare benefits to former employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof, except for health continuation coverage as required by Section 4980B of the Code, Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or applicable law and at no expense to FNB and its Subsidiaries. 

       ##### 

  

     

 (h) Neither the execution nor the delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions this Agreement contemplates will, either alone or in conjunction with any other event, whether contingent or otherwise, (i) result in any payment or benefit becoming due or payable, or required to be provided, to any director, employee or independent contractor of FNB or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) increase the amount or value of any benefit or compensation otherwise payable or required to be provided to any such director, employee or independent contractor, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or funding of any such benefit or compensation, including deferred compensation, or (iv) result in any amount failing to be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code or would be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code. 

   

 (i) No labor organization or group of employees of FNB or any of its Subsidiaries has made a pending demand for recognition or certification, and there are no representation or certification proceedings or petitions seeking a representation proceeding presently pending or, to FNBs knowledge, threatened to be brought or filed, with the National Labor Relations Board or any other labor relations tribunal or authority. Each of FNB and its Subsidiaries is in material compliance with all applicable laws and collective bargaining agreements respecting employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, wages and hours and occupational safety and health. 

   

 4.12 _Compliance with Applicable Law_. FNB and each of its Subsidiaries are not in default in any material respect under any applicable law, statute, order, rule, regulation, policy or guideline of any Governmental Entity applicable to FNB or any of its Subsidiaries, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorist (USA Patriot) Act of 2001, the Bank Secrecy Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and applicable limits on loans to one borrower, except where such noncompliance or default is not reasonably likely to, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on FNB. FNB and each of the FNB Subsidiaries has been and is in compliance in all material respects with (i) the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the NYSE. 

  

 4.13 _Contracts_. Except for matters that have not had and would not reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FNB, (i) none of FNB nor any of its Subsidiaries is, with or without the lapse of time or the giving of notice, or both, in breach or default in any material respect under any material contract, lease, license or other agreement or instrument, (ii) to the knowledge of FNB, none of the other parties to any such material contract, lease, license or other agreement or instrument is, with or without the lapse of time or the giving of notice, or both, in breach or default in any material respect thereunder and (iii) neither FNB nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice of the intention of any party to terminate or cancel any such material contract, lease, license or other agreement or instrument whether as a termination or cancellation for convenience or for default of FNB or any of its Subsidiaries. 

   ##### 

  

  

 4.14 _Agreements with Regulatory Agencies_. Neither FNB nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order or enforcement action issued by, or is a party to any written agreement, consent agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order, or has been since January 1, 2009, a recipient of any supervisory letter from, or has been ordered to pay any civil money penalty by, or since January 1, 2009, has adopted any policies, procedures or board resolutions at the request or suggestion of any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that currently restricts in any material respect the conduct of its business or that in any material manner relates to its capital adequacy, its ability to pay dividends, its credit or risk management policies, its management or its business, other than those of general application that apply to similarly situated financial holding companies or their Subsidiaries, each item in this sentence, whether or not set forth in the FNB Disclosure Schedule ("FNB Regulatory Agreement"), nor has FNB or any of its Subsidiaries been advised since January 1, 2009 by any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing, initiating, ordering or requesting any such FNB Regulatory Agreement. Each bank Subsidiary of FNB has at least a "satisfactory" rating under the U.S. Community Reinvestment Act. 

  

 4.15 _Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither FNB nor any of its Subsidiaries has, and since December 31, 2010, neither FNB nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred, any liabilities or obligations, whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, known or unknown, whether due or to become due, except (i) those liabilities fully accrued or reserved against in the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of FNB and its Subsidiaries as of March 31, 2011 included in the FNB Reports, (ii) for liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since March 31, 2011, (iii) for liabilities and obligations that are not material to FNB and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (iv) for any liabilities incurred with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 (b) There are no legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action, private environmental investigations or remediation activities or governmental investigations of any nature seeking to impose, or that are reasonably likely to result in the imposition, on FNB of any liability or obligation arising under common law or under any local, state or federal environmental statute, regulation or ordinance including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, pending or threatened against FNB, which liability or obligation is reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FNB. To the knowledge of FNB, there is no reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action or governmental investigation that would impose any liability or obligation that would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FNB. FNB is not subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or memorandum by or with any Governmental Entity or third party imposing any liability or obligation with respect to the foregoing that is reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FNB. 

   

 4.17 _Reorganization_. As of the date of this Agreement, FNB is not aware of any fact or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

PFC shall prepare and furnish to FNB such information relating to it and its directors, officers and shareholders as may be reasonably required in connection with the above referenced documents based on its knowledge of and access to the information required for said documents, and PFC and its legal, financial and accounting advisors shall have the right to review in advance and approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, such Registration Statement prior to its filing. PFC agrees to cooperate with FNB and FNBs counsel and accountants in requesting and obtaining appropriate opinions, consents and letters from its financial advisor and independent auditor in connection with the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement. As long as PFC has cooperated as described above, FNB agrees to file, or cause to be filed, the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement with the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable. Each of PFC and FNB agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after the filing thereof. FNB also agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions this Agreement contemplates. After the SEC has declared the Registration Statement effective under the Securities Act, PFC shall promptly mail at its expense the Proxy Statement to its shareholders. 

   

 (b) Each of PFC and FNB agree that none of the respective information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration 

  ##### 

  

    

Statement shall, at the time the Registration Statement and each amendment or
supplement thereto, if any, becomes effective under the Securities Act,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated in this Agreement or necessary to make the
statements in this Agreement not misleading. Each of PFC and FNB agree
that none of the respective information supplied or to be supplied by it for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement and any
amendment or supplement thereto shall contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
in this Agreement or necessary to make the statements in this Agreement not
misleading. Each of PFC and FNB further agree that if such party shall become
aware prior to the Effective Time of any information furnished by such party
that would cause any of the statements in the Registration Statement or the
Proxy Statement to be false or misleading with respect to any material fact,
or to omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements in
this Agreement not false or misleading, to promptly inform the other parties
thereof and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be filed promptly with the SEC and, to the extent required
by law, disseminated to the shareholders of PFC and/or FNB. 

   

 (c) FNB agrees to advise PFC, promptly after FNB receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order or the suspension of the qualification of FNB Common Stock for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or, to the extent FNB is aware thereof, threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC for an amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or for additional information. 

   

 (d) The parties shall cooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties, Regulatory Agencies and Governmental Entities that are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions this Agreement contemplates, including the Merger, and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such Regulatory Agencies and Governmental Entities. FNB agrees that it will file all appropriate applications or notices with each Regulatory Agency or Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over the transactions contemplated by this Agreement within 60 days following the date hereof. PFC and FNB shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all the information relating to PFC or FNB, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appear in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party, Regulatory Agency or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties shall consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties, Regulatory Agencies and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions this Agreement contemplates and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions this Agreement contemplates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require FNB to 

  ##### 

  

    

take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or
restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of third parties, Regulatory Agencies or
Governmental Entities, that would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on FNB, including the Surviving Company after giving effect to
the Merger, after the Effective Time (a "Materially Burdensome Regulatory
Condition"). In addition, PFC agrees to cooperate and use its reasonable best
efforts to assist FNB in preparing and filing such petitions and filings, and
in obtaining such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of third
parties, Regulatory Agencies and Governmental Entities, that may be necessary
or advisable to effect any mergers and/or consolidations of Subsidiaries of
PFC and FNB following consummation of the Merger. 

   

 (e) Each of FNB and PFC shall, upon request, furnish to the other all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of FNB, PFC or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Regulatory Agency or Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, without limitation, any pro forma financial information to be included in the Registration Statement on Form S-4). 

   

 (f) Each of FNB and PFC shall promptly provide each other with any written communications received from any Regulatory Agency or Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will promptly advise the other upon receiving any oral communication with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from any Regulatory Agency or Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is required for consummation of the transactions this Agreement contemplates that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval (as defined in Section 7.1(c)) will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval may be materially delayed. 

   

 (g) PFC and FNB shall consult with each other before issuing any press release with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statements without the prior consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that a party may, without the prior consent of the other party, but after such consultation, to the extent practicable under the circumstances, issue such press release or make such public statements as may upon the advice of outside counsel be required by law or the rules or regulations of the SEC, the FDIC, the OCC, the NYSE or FINRA. In addition, the Chief Executive Officers of PFC and FNB shall be permitted to respond to appropriate questions about the Merger from the press. PFC and FNB shall cooperate to develop all public announcement materials and make appropriate management available at presentations related to the Merger as reasonably requested by the other party. 

   

 6.2 _Access to Information_. 

  

 (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, each of PFC and FNB shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of the other, 

  ##### 

  

    

reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the
Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and
records, and, during such period, the parties shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party all other information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other may reasonably
request. PFC shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, provide to
FNB a copy of each report, schedule and other document filed or received by
it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state
banking laws other than reports or documents that such party is not
permitted to disclose under applicable law. Neither PFC nor FNB nor any of
their Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-
client privilege of such party or its Subsidiaries or contravene any
law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties shall
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in
which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply to the extent possible
in light of those restrictions. 

   

 (b) All information and materials provided pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreements entered into between PFC and FNB (the "Confidentiality Agreements"). 

   

 (c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective representatives shall affect the representations and warranties of the other set forth in this Agreement. 

   

 6.3 _PFC Shareholder Approval_. PFC shall call a meeting of its shareholders for the purpose of obtaining the requisite shareholder approval required in connection with this Agreement and the Merger (the "PFC Shareholders Meeting"), and shall use its reasonable best efforts to call such meeting as soon as reasonably practicable following the Registration Statement being declared effective giving reasonable time for printing and mailing and taking into account the timing of its annual meeting of shareholders. Subject to Section 6.11, the Board of Directors of PFC shall recommend approval and adoption of this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions this Agreement contemplates, by PFCs shareholders and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement (the "PFC Recommendation"). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, PFCs obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 6.3 shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to PFC of any Acquisition Proposal, as defined in Section 6.11(e). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, PFCs obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 6.3 shall terminate. 

  

 6.4 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Cooperation_. Each of PFC and FNB agrees to exercise good faith and use its commercially reasonable best efforts to satisfy the various covenants and conditions to Closing in this Agreement, and to consummate the transactions this Agreement contemplates as promptly as possible. 

  

 6.5 _NYSE Approval_. FNB shall cause the shares of FNB Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time. 

   ##### 

  

  

 6.6 _Benefit Plans_. 

  

 (a) Following the Effective Time, FNB shall take all reasonable action so that employees of PFC and the PFC Subsidiaries shall be entitled to participate, effective as soon as administratively practicable following the Effective Time, in each employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of FNB of general applicability with the exception of FNBs defined benefit pension plan and any other plans frozen to new participants (the "FNB Plans") to the same extent as similarly-situated employees of FNB and its Subsidiaries, it being understood that inclusion of the employees of PFC and the PFC Subsidiaries in the FNB Plans may occur at different times with respect to different plans, provided that coverage shall be continued under corresponding Benefit Plans of PFC and the PFC Subsidiaries until such employees are permitted to participate in the FNB Plans and provided further, however, that nothing contained in this Agreement shall require FNB or any of its Subsidiaries to make any grants to any former employee of PFC under any discretionary equity compensation plan of FNB. FNB shall cause each FNB Plan in which employees of PFC and the PFC Subsidiaries are eligible to participate to recognize, for purposes of determining eligibility to participate in, the vesting of benefits under the FNB Plans and the entitlement to benefits under the FNB Plans (including, but not limited to, severance benefit and vacation plans), the service of such employees with PFC and the PFC Subsidiaries (or predecessor companies) to the same extent as such service was credited for such purpose by PFC or the PFC Subsidiaries, provided, however, that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. Except for the commitment to continue those Benefit Plans of PFC and the PFC Subsidiaries that correspond to FNB Plans until employees of PFC and the PFC Subsidiaries are included in such FNB Plans, nothing in this Agreement shall limit the ability of FNB to amend or terminate any of PFCs Benefit Plans in accordance with and to the extent permitted by their terms at any time permitted by such terms. 

   

 (b) At and following the Effective Time, and except as otherwise provided in Section 6.6(d), FNB shall honor, and, to the extent required by any individual agreement, assume, and the Surviving Company shall continue to be obligated to perform, in accordance with their terms, all benefit obligations to, and contractual rights of, current and former employees of PFC and the PFC Subsidiaries and current and former directors of PFC and the PFC Subsidiaries existing as of the Effective Date, as well as all employment, executive severance or "change-in-control" or similar agreements, plans or policies of PFC that are set forth in Section 6.6(b) of the PFC Disclosure Schedule. The severance or termination payments that are payable pursuant to any such severance agreements, plans or policies of PFC are described in Section 6.6(b) of the PFC Disclosure Schedule. Following the consummation of the Merger and for one year thereafter, FNB shall, to the extent not duplicative of other severance benefits, pay employees of PFC or its Subsidiaries whose employment is terminated by FNB for reasons other than cause, severance as set forth in Section 6.6(b) of the FNB Disclosure Schedule. Following the expiration of the foregoing severance policy, any years of service recognized for purposes of this Section 6.6(b) will be taken into account under the terms of any applicable severance policy of FNB or its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (c) At such time as employees of PFC and the PFC Subsidiaries become eligible to participate in a medical, dental or health plan of FNB or its Subsidiaries, to the extent reasonably practicable and available from its insurers, cause each such plan to (i) waive any 

  ##### 

  

    

preexisting condition limitations to the extent such conditions are covered
under the applicable medical, health or dental plans of PFC and its
Subsidiaries, (ii) honor under such plans any deductibles, co-payments and
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the employees of PFC and its Subsidiaries
and their beneficiaries during the portion of the plan year prior to
such participation, and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence
of insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to such
employee or dependent on or after the Effective Time to the extent such
employee or dependent had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement
under an analogous Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (d) PFC shall permit the PFC Employee Stock Ownership Plan as amended and restated effective as of January 1, 2008 (the "ESOP") to terminate in accordance with its terms effective as of the occurrence of a "change in control" as defined in Section 7.4(e) of the ESOP (the "ESOP CIC Date") and the accounts of all participants and beneficiaries in the ESOP as of the ESOP CIC Date to become fully vested as of the ESOP CIC Date. All shares of PFC Common Stock held in the ESOP shall be converted into the Common Stock Merger Consideration. As soon as practicable after the date hereof, PFC shall, after consultation with FNB, file or cause to be filed all necessary documents with the IRS for a determination letter that the termination of the ESOP as of the ESOP CIC Date will not adversely affect the ESOPs qualified status, with a copy to be provided to FNB and its counsel. Prior to the Effective Time, PFC and, following the Effective Time, FNB shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain such favorable determination letter (including, but not limited to, adopting such amendments to the ESOP as may be requested by the IRS as a condition to its issuance of a favorable determination letter). As soon as practicable following the later of the Effective Time or the receipt of a favorable determination letter from the IRS regarding the qualified status of the ESOP upon its termination, the account balances in the ESOP shall be either distributed to participants and beneficiaries or transferred to an eligible tax-qualified retirement plan or individual retirement account as a participant or beneficiary may direct, except that ESOP participants whose employment is terminated by FNB may elect to receive their ESOP account balance prior to the receipt of the IRS determination letter but following their termination of employment. FNB agrees to permit ESOP participants who become employees of FNB and its Subsidiaries to roll over their account balances in the ESOP to the FNB 401(k) Plan. 

   

 (e) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, PFC shall, at the written request of FNB, freeze or terminate such of the PFC Benefit Plans as is requested by FNB, provided that such request is received from FNB in a timely manner. 

   

 (f) In order to assist with a smooth transition of the operations of PFC and its Subsidiaries and the transactions which this Agreement contemplates, FNB or one of its Subsidiaries agree to offer employment to certain officers and employees of PFC and its Subsidiaries as employees of FNB and its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in Section 6.6(f) of the FNB Disclosure Schedule. 

   

 6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. 

  

 (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (each a "Claim") in which any individual who is now, or has been at 

  ##### 

  

    

any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, a director or officer of PFC or any of PFC Subsidiaries or
who is or was serving at the request of PFC or any of PFC Subsidiaries as a
director, officer, employee, member or otherwise of another Person (the
"Indemnified Parties"), is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to
(i) the fact that he is or was a director or officer of PFC or any of PFC
Subsidiaries or was serving at the request of PFC or any of PFC Subsidiaries
as a director or officer of another Person or (ii) this Agreement or any of
the transactions this Agreement contemplates, whether asserted or arising
before or after the Effective Time, the parties shall cooperate and use their
best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. From and after the
Effective Time, FNB shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent currently
provided under applicable law, the PFC Articles, the PFC Bylaws as in effect
on the date hereof and any agreement set forth in Section 6.7 of the PFC
Disclosure Schedule, each such Indemnified Party against any losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses, including reimbursement for
reasonable fees and expenses, including fees and expenses of legal counsel,
including local counsel, incurred in advance of the final disposition of any
claim, suit, proceeding or investigation upon receipt of any
undertaking required by applicable law, judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation. 

   

 (b) FNB and the Surviving Company agree that all rights to indemnification of liabilities, including advancement of expenses, and all limitations with respect thereto, existing in favor of any Indemnified Person, as provided in the PFC Articles or the PFC Bylaws, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect, without any amendment thereto; provided, however, that in the event any Claim is asserted or made, any determination required to be made with respect to whether an Indemnified Persons conduct complies with the standards set forth under the PBCL, the PFC Articles or the PFC Bylaws, as the case may be, shall be made by independent legal counsel, whose fees and expenses shall be paid by FNB and the Surviving Company, selected by such Indemnified Person and reasonably acceptable to FNB; and, provided further that nothing in this Section 6.7 shall impair any rights or obligations of any current or former director or officer of PFC or its Subsidiaries, including pursuant to the respective organizational documents of PFC, or their respective Subsidiaries, under the PBCL or otherwise. 

   

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, FNB shall obtain at the expense of PFC, and FNB shall maintain for a period of six years following the Effective Time, directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance policies in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including the transactions this Agreement contemplates, covering the Indemnified Persons who as of the Effective Time are covered by PFCs directors and officers liability insurance or fiduciary liability insurance policies, provided that FNB may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous than such policies of PFC or single premium tail coverage with policy limits equal to PFCs existing coverage limits, provided that in no event shall FNB be required to expend for any one year an amount in excess of 150% of the annual premium currently paid by PFC for such insurance (the "Insurance Amount"), and further provided that if FNB is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this Section 6.7(c) as a result of the preceding provision, FNB shall use its commercially 

  ##### 

  

    

reasonable best efforts to obtain the most advantageous coverage as is
available for the maximum Insurance Amount. The provisions of the immediately
preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid policies
have been obtained prior to the Effective Time from an insurer or insurers
selected by FNB that have an insurer financial strength rating by A.M. Best
Co. of at least "A", which policies provide the Indemnified Persons with
coverage, from the Effective Time to the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time, including in respect of the transactions this Agreement contemplates,
on terms that are no less advantageous to Indemnified Persons than PFCs DandO
Insurance existing immediately prior to the date of this Agreement. If such
prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, then the FNB
shall maintain such policies in full force and effect and continue the
obligations thereunder. 

   

 (d) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. 

   

 6.8 _Additional Agreements_.

mutually agree in good faith.

F.N.B. Corporation 
 One F.N.B. Boulevard 
 Hermitage, PA 16148  

 

Ladies and Gentlemen: 

   

 F.N.B. Corporation ("FNB") and Parkvale Financial Corporation ("PFC") have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of June ___, 2011 (the "Agreement") whereby PFC will merge with and into FNB (the "Merger") and shareholders of PFC will receive the Merger Consideration as set forth in the Agreement, subject to the closing of the Merger. All defined terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Agreement. 

  

 A condition to FNBs obligations under the Agreement is that I execute and deliver this Letter Agreement to FNB. 

  

 Intending to be legally bound hereby, I irrevocably agree and represent as follows: 

  

 (a) I will vote or cause to be voted for approval and adoption of the Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby all shares of PFC common stock over which I have sole voting power, and will use my best efforts to cause any shares of PFC common stock over which I share voting power to be voted for approval and adoption of the Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. Beneficial ownership shall have the meaning assigned to it pursuant to Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 

  

 (b) On or prior to the record date (the "Record Date") for the meeting of the PFC shareholders to vote on approval and adoption of the Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, I (i) will not offer, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares of PFC common stock over which I have sole dispositive power, and (ii) shall use my best efforts to not permit the offer, sale, transfer or other disposition of any shares of PFC common stock over which I have shared dispositive power, except to the extent that I may be permitted under law to make charitable gifts or as permitted by paragraph (g) hereof. 

  

 (c) I have beneficial ownership over the number of shares of PFC common stock, and hold stock options for the number of shares of PFC common stock, if any, set forth in Appendix A hereto. 

  

 (d) I agree that PFC shall not be bound by any attempted sale of any shares of PFC common stock over which I have sole voting and dispositive power, and PFCs transfer agent shall be given appropriate stop transfer orders and shall not be required to register any such attempted sale, unless the sale has been effected in compliance with the terms of this Letter Agreement.

_______________, 2011 

   

 (e) I agree that, if I exercise any options to purchase PFC common stock prior to the Record Date, any of the shares of PFC common stock so acquired by me, except any shares sold as part of a cashless exercise, shall be subject to clauses (a), (b) and (d) above. 

  

 (f) I represent that I have the capacity to enter into this Letter Agreement and that it is a valid and binding obligation enforceable against me in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency and other laws affecting creditors rights and general equitable principles. 

  

 (g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, I may transfer any or all of the shares of PFC common stock over which I have beneficial ownership to my spouse, ancestors or descendants; provided, however, that in any such case, prior to and as a condition to the effectiveness of such transfer, each person to which any of such shares or any interest in any of such shares is or may be transferred shall have executed and delivered to FNB an agreement to be bound by the terms of this Letter Agreement. In addition, I may sell, transfer or assign shares of PFC common stock to the extent and on behalf of trusts or estates of which I am not a beneficiary in order to comply with fiduciary obligations or legal requirements. 

  

 I am signing this Letter Agreement solely in my capacity as a shareholder of PFC and as an optionholder if I am an optionholder, and not in any other capacity, such as a director or officer of PFC or as a fiduciary of any trusts in which I am not a beneficiary. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: (a) I make no agreement or understanding herein in any capacity other than in my capacity as a beneficial owner of PFC common stock and (b) nothing herein shall be construed to limit or affect any action or inaction by me or any of my representatives, as applicable, in serving on PFCs Board of Directors or as an officer of PFC, in acting in my capacity as a director, officer or fiduciary of PFC or as fiduciary of any trust of which I am not a beneficiary. 

  

 This Letter Agreement shall be effective upon acceptance by FNB. 

  

 This Letter Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect concurrently with, and automatically upon, the earlier to occur of (a) the consummation of the Merger, (b) the written agreement of the parties to terminate this Letter Agreement, and (c) any termination of the Agreement in accordance with its terms, except that any such termination shall be without prejudice to FNBs rights arising out of my willful breach of any covenant or representation contained herein. 

  

 All notices and other communications in connection with this Letter Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally, sent via facsimile, with confirmation, mailed by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or delivered by an express courier, with confirmation, to the parties at their addresses set forth on the signature page hereto.
