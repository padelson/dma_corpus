U.S. Bank, N.A. to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the
payment of certain amounts payable in respect of the Common Shares and Vested
Company Options in accordance with this _Article III_ , and, in connection
therewith, shall enter into a paying agent agreement in customary form (which
shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent) with the Paying Agent (the " _Paying
Agent Agreement_ ").

 

SECTION 3.2 _Letters of Transmittal; Payment and Exchange of Company
Certificates_.

 

(a) Within a reasonable time prior to the Closing, the Company shall cause to
be mailed to each Equityholder holding Common Shares a letter of transmittal
in substantially the form of _Exhibit A_ hereto, with any changes thereto as
mutually agreed upon by Parent and the Company (each, a " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ").

 

(b) At the Closing, Parent shall pay to the Paying Agent an amount equal to
the Merger Consideration Estimate less the aggregate amount equal to the sum
of all Estimated Option Payments payable to all Optionholders who are current
or former employees.

(c) _Payment at the Closing for Company Common Stock_. At the Closing, each
Equityholder who holds Common Shares and, at least two (2) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, delivers to the Paying Agent for cancellation the stock
certificates representing such Equityholders Common Shares (collectively,
such Equityholders " _Company Certificates_ ") together with a duly executed
and completed copy of a Letter of Transmittal, shall have such Company
Certificates so surrendered canceled, and Parent shall pay, or shall cause
the Paying Agent to pay, to any such

 



23  Equityholder, to the account or accounts designated in such Equityholders
Letter of Transmittal by means of a wire transfer of immediately available
funds, an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the
Per Share Merger Consideration Estimate by (ii) the number of Common Shares
represented by the Company Certificates surrendered by such Equityholder.

 

(d) _Exchange Procedures Following the Closing_. To the extent that an
Equityholder who holds Common Shares has not delivered the Company
Certificates representing all of such Equityholders Common Shares at least

Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, the Company Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled, and Parent shall pay, or shall cause the Paying Agent
to pay, to any such Equityholder, to the account or accounts designated in the
Letter of Transmittal by means of a wire transfer of immediately available
funds, an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the
Per Share Merger Consideration Estimate by (ii) the number of Common Shares
represented by the Company Certificates surrendered by such Equityholder;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if at the time of such payment the Merger
Consideration has been determined and/or all or a portion of the Escrow Fund
and/or the Representative Fund has been released, then the amount payable to
such Equityholder shall be based upon the Per Share Merger
Consideration (rather than the Per Share Merger Consideration Estimate)
and/or the distributed portion(s) of the Escrow Fund and the Representative
Fund allocable to such Equityholder.

 

(e) _Payment at the Closing for Vested Company Options_. As soon as
administratively practicable and, in any event, within three (3) Business
Days following the Closing, Parent shall pay, or shall cause the Paying Agent
to pay, to each Optionholder, an amount in cash equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (i) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock issuable upon the exercise of each such unexercised Vested Company
Option held by such Optionholder as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, by (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Per Share Merger Consideration
Estimate less (B) the exercise price per share of such Vested Company Option
(such amount an " _Estimated Option Payment_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing
or anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall cause any such

of an Acquired Company to be made through the Surviving Corporations payroll
system, subject to withholding in accordance with _Section 3.5_.

with the terms of the escrow agreement to be executed at Closing by Parent,
the Escrow Agent and the Equityholders Representative in substantially the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit_ _ _ _B_ , with any changes thereto as
mutually agreed upon by Parent and the Company (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "),
and (ii) $1,000,000 (the " _Representative Fund_ ") to the Equityholders
Representative to use for purposes of paying the expenses incurred by the
Equityholders Representative in fulfilling its obligations under this
Agreement. The Escrow Fund shall be disbursed in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement and _Section 2.7(d)_. The Representative Fund shall be disbursed in
accordance with _Section 9.2(e)_.

 

(g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Company Certificates_. If any Company
Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, Paying Agent shall as a
condition precedent to the payment of any Per Share Merger Consideration to a
given Equityholder pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)_ , require such Equityholder to
provide an appropriate affidavit and an agreement to indemnify against
any claim that may be made against Parent or the Surviving Corporation with
respect to such Company Certificate.

 



24 (h) Unless required otherwise by applicable Law, any amount held by the Paying
Agent that remains undistributed to Equityholders twelve months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation (which shall
thereafter act as Paying Agent hereunder) and any Equityholder who has not
theretofore complied with the provisions of _Sections 3.2(c)_ , _(d)_ or
_(e)_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (as general
creditors of the Surviving Corporation) for payment of any consideration due
pursuant to this _Section 3.2_  (other than payment of the Representative
Fund, which shall be distributed by the Equityholder Representative pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement). Any amounts remaining unclaimed by
Equityholders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to
or become property of any Governmental Authority pursuant to applicable Laws
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, be retained by the
Surviving Corporation, subject to the immediately preceding sentence.

 

(i) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
3.2_ , none of the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any of the
Acquired Companies or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person for any
amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

 

SECTION 3.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock which are issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by
holders of such shares of Company Common Stock who have not voted such shares
in favor of the Merger, consented thereto in writing or otherwise
contractually waived their rights to appraisal and who have properly demanded
or may properly demand appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who have
complied in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the
" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be exchangeable for the right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration, and holders of such shares of Company
Common Stock shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of
such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the
DGCL unless and until such holders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or
lose their rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the
Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or
loses its appraisal rights and dissent rights under the DGCL or a court of
competent jurisdiction determines that such holder is not entitled to relief
provided under Section 262 of the DGCL, such holders shares of Company
Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and
to have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.6_ , without
any interest thereon, and the Paying Agent shall promptly thereafter pay the
amounts payable with respect to such Dissenting Shares that shall have become
Common Shares in accordance with _Section 3.2_ , subject to and in accordance
with the terms and conditions set forth in _Section 3.2(d)_. The Company
shall give Parent and Merger Sub prompt written notice of any demands for
appraisal, withdrawals of demands for appraisal and any other related
instruments received by the Company. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands
for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demand.

 

SECTION 3.4 _No Further Ownership Rights in Shares of Company Common Stock;
Closing of Company Transfer Books_. At and after the Effective Time, each
holder of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights as a stockholder
of the Company, except for, in the case of a holder of Company Common Stock
(other than shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)_ or Dissenting
Shares), the right to surrender his or her Company Certificate in exchange for
payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration Estimate (in accordance with
_Section 3.2(c)_ or _Section 3.2(d)_ , as applicable) and any further amounts
payable pursuant to _Section 2.7(d)_ , _Section 2.7(e)_ and _Section 9.2(e)_
or, in the case of a holder of Dissenting Shares, to perfect his or her right
to receive payment for his or her shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to
the DGCL, and no transfer of shares of Company Common Stock shall be made on
the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time,
the stock

 



25  transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and no transfer of shares of
Company Common Stock shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time,
Company Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall
be canceled and exchanged as provided for in this Agreement.

SECTION 3.5 _Withholding Rights_. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or any applicable provision of any other Tax Law; _provided_ _,_
_however_ , __ (a) before making any such deduction or withholding, other than
a deduction or withholding from a payment to an employee or former employee
of the Acquired Companies, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable,
shall give the Equityholders Representative notice of the intention to make
such deduction or withholding (such notice, which shall include the
authority, basis and method of calculation for the proposed deduction or
withholding, shall be given at least a commercially reasonable period of time
before such deduction or withholding is required, in order for the
Equityholders Representative to obtain reduction of or relief from such
deduction or withholding), (b) Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, shall cooperate with the Equityholders Representative to the
extent reasonable in efforts to obtain reduction of or relief from such
deduction or withholding and (c) Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, shall timely remit to the appropriate Tax Authority any and all
amounts so deducted or withheld and timely file all Tax Returns and provide
to the Equityholders Representative such information statements and other
documents required to be filed or provided under applicable Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld and remitted by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation in accordance with the foregoing, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or
the Surviving Corporation.

SECTION 3.6 _Option Plan and Company Options_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall take all actions pursuant to the
Option Plan and any option grant agreements or other agreements relating to
any of the Company Options that are necessary to give effect to the provisions
of _Section 2.6(a)_ , _Section 3.2(e)_ and _Section 3.6(b)_ with respect to
the Option Plan and Company Options.

 

(b) The Option Plan and all Company Options shall terminate as of the
Effective Time, and no holder of Company Options shall have any
rights thereunder, including any rights to acquire any equity securities of
the Acquired Companies, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiaries thereof,
other than as set forth herein (including pursuant to _Section 3.2(e)_ ) or by
applicable Law. 

ARTICLE IV.

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub, the Company shall deliver to Parent and
Merger Sub a disclosure schedule with numbered sections corresponding to the
relevant sections in this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ").
Any disclosure set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule with respect to
a particular representation or warranty contained herein shall be deemed to
be a disclosure with respect to all other applicable representations or
warranties contained in this Agreement if the applicability of such disclosure
to any other applicable representation or warranty would be reasonably
apparent to a Person reviewing the Company Disclosure Schedule, regardless of
whether an explicit reference to such other representation or warranty is
made. Nothing in the Company Disclosure Schedule is intended to broaden the
scope of any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this
Agreement, and disclosure of any item in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall
not constitute an admission that such item is 

 



26  material or required to be disclosed. Subject to the exceptions and
qualifications set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule in accordance with
the first two sentences of this paragraph, the Company hereby represents and
warrants to Parent and Merger Sub, as of the date hereof and as of the Closing
Date, as follows:

 

SECTION 4.1 _Authority_. The Company has all requisite corporate power and
authority to enter into this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to
which the Company is a party, to perform its obligations hereunder and
thereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Transaction Documents to which the Company is a party. The execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which
the Company is a party by the Company, the performance by the Company of its
obligations hereunder and thereunder, and the consummation by the Company of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents to which the Company is a party, have been duly and validly approved
and authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company, and no other approval
or action on the part of the Company is necessary to authorize the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which
the Company is a party by the Company, the performance by the Company of its
obligations hereunder and thereunder or the consummation by the Company of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents to which the Company is a party, other than the Required Company
Stockholder Vote. This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which
the Company is a party have been duly executed and delivered by the Company
and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties
to such agreements, this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
to which the Company is a party constitute legally valid and binding
obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
their terms, except as such enforceability may be subject to (i) the effect of
any applicable Law of general application relating to bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors
rights and relief of debtors generally and (ii) the effect of rules of law and
general principles of equity, including rules of Law and general principles
of equity governing specific performance, injunctive relief and other
equitable remedies (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in
a proceeding in equity or at Law). The affirmative vote or consent of the
holders of a majority of the shares of the outstanding Company Common Stock to
approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger (the " _Required Company
Stockholder Vote_ ") is the only vote, consent or approval of the holders
of Ownership Interests necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement and the
Merger or otherwise authorize or approve any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or any other Transaction Documents to which the Company is a
party.

 

SECTION 4.2 _Organization_ _; Subsidiaries_.

 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware, and has all requisite power
and authority to own, operate or lease the properties and assets now owned,
operated or leased by it, and to carry on the Business. The Company is duly
qualified to do business as a foreign corporation, and is in good standing,
under the Laws of each jurisdiction in which the character of its properties
owned, operated or leased, or the nature of its activities, makes such
qualification necessary, except in those jurisdictions where the failure to be
so qualified or in good standing, when taken together with all other failures
by the Acquired Companies to be so qualified or in good standing, would not
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Acquired Companies, taken as a
whole, in any material respect. True and complete copies of the Certificate
of Incorporation (the " _Company Certificate of Incorporation_ ") and Bylaws
(the " _Company Bylaws_ ") of the Company, each as amended and in effect as of
the date of this Agreement, have been made available to Parent. The Company
is not in violation of any of the provisions of the Company Certificate of

standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its formation, and has all
requisite power and authority to own, operate or lease the properties and
assets now owned, operated or leased by it, and to carry on the Business. Each
Subsidiary of the Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign
entity, and is in good standing, under the Laws of each jurisdiction in which
the character of its properties owned, operated or leased, or the nature of
its activities, makes such qualification necessary, except in those
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing, when
taken together with all other failures by the Acquired Companies to be so
qualified or in good standing, would not reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the Acquired Companies, taken as a whole, in any material respect. The

Ownership Interests of its Subsidiaries. All outstanding Ownership Interests
of each of the Companys Subsidiaries are validly issued, are fully paid and

(other than restrictions on transfer under applicable securities Laws). No
shares of Company Common Stock are held by a Company Subsidiary. The Company
does not hold or beneficially own any direct or indirect equity, ownership or
similar interest in any Person, or any subscriptions, options, warrants,
rights, calls, convertible securities or other agreements or commitments for
any interest in any Person. True and complete copies of the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents) of each
Acquired Company, each as amended and in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, have been made available to Parent. No Acquired Company is in
violation of any of the provisions of its certificate of incorporation or
bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents).

authorizations, orders, permits, declarations, filings, registrations

SECTION 5.5 _Litigation and Governmental Orders_. (i) There are no Actions of
any kind or nature pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against
Parent or Merger Sub, any of the assets or properties of Parent or Merger Sub,
or any of the directors and officers of Parent or Merger Sub in their capacity

Order relating to Parent or Merger Sub or any of their assets or properties.

SECTION 5.6 _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to
any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission for which any of the

liable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement based upon any arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their respective Affiliates.

SECTION 5.7 _No Prior Activities_. Merger Sub has not incurred nor will it
incur any liabilities or obligations, except as contemplated by this Agreement
and except those incurred in connection with its organization and with the
negotiation of this Agreement or any other Transaction Documents and the
performance of its obligations hereunder or thereunder and the consummation of
the

 



43  transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger. Except as
contemplated by this Agreement and except in connection with its organization
and with the negotiation of this Agreement or any other Transaction Documents
and the performance of its obligations hereunder or thereunder and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger, Merger Sub has not engaged in any business activities of any type or
kind whatsoever, or entered into any agreements or arrangements with any
Person, or become subject to or bound by any obligation or undertaking. All of
the issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is owned beneficially
and of record by Parent, free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than those
created by this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement).

 

SECTION 5.8 _Sufficient Funds_. Assuming (i) the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.2_ (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but which conditions are
capable of and would be satisfied at the Closing) and (ii) the satisfaction of
the Financing Conditions, the net proceeds of the Financing (both before
and after giving effect to the exercise of any or all "market flex"
provisions related thereto), when funded in accordance with the Commitment
Letters on the Closing Date will be sufficient to consummate the transactions
contemplated on the Closing Date, including for the payment of the Required
Amount. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company
a true and complete copy of the executed Debt Commitment Letter and Equity
Commitment Letters. As of the date hereof, neither of the Commitment Letters
has been modified, amended or altered, and, as of the date hereof, the
respective commitments contained in the Commitment Letters have not been
withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. Neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates has entered into any agreement, side letter or other commitment or
arrangement relating to the financing of the Required Amount or transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that would contain any additional
conditions precedent or contingencies that would permit the Lenders to reduce
the total amount of the Debt Financing or the Guarantors to reduce the total
amount of the Equity Financing to an amount less than the Required Amount,
other than as set forth in the Commitment Letters, the fee letters and/or the
engagement letters related thereto. The Commitment Letters are in full force
and effect and represent a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Parent
and, to the knowledge of the Parent, each other party thereto, subject to the
qualification that such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or other laws of general application relating to or
affecting rights of creditors. Parent has fully paid (or caused to be paid)
any and all commitment fees and other amounts that are due and payable on or
prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with the Financing. As of
the date hereof, to the knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred that, with
or without notice, lapse of time, or both, would reasonably be expected to
constitute a failure to satisfy a condition precedent on the part of Parent or
Merger Sub or any other party thereto under the terms and conditions of the
Commitment Letters. As of the date hereof, assuming satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.2_ and completion of the Marketing Period,
Parent does not have any reason to believe that (i) any of the conditions to
the Financing will not be satisfied or (ii) the Financing will not be
available to Parent and Merger Sub on the Closing Date. There are no
conditions precedent related to the funding or investing (as applicable) of
the Financing other than the Financing Conditions. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement (including _Article VIII_ and _Section 9.15_ ),
Parent understands and acknowledges that under the terms of this Agreement,
the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger are not in
any way contingent upon or otherwise subject to the consummation by Parent or
Merger Sub of any financing arrangements, the obtaining by Parent or Merger
Sub of any financing or the availability, grant, provision or extension of
any financing to Parent or Merger Sub.

SECTION 5.9 _Solvency; Surviving Corporation After the Merger_.
Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby with the actual intent to hinder, delay or
defraud either present or future creditors. Assuming the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in  _Section 7.2_ (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the

 



44  Closing, but which conditions are capable of and would be satisfied at the
Closing) and immediately after giving effect to the Merger and the other
transactions and indebtedness contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, (i)
the sum of the debt (including contingent liabilities) of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, does not exceed the fair value of the present
assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (ii) the present
fair saleable value of the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, is not less than the amount that will be required to pay the probable
liabilities (including contingent liabilities) of Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, on their debts as they generally become absolute and
matured; (iii) the capital of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
is not unreasonably small in relation to the business of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, contemplated as of the date hereof; and (iv)
Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, do not intend to incur, or
believe that they will incur, debts (including current obligations and
contingent liabilities) beyond their ability to generally pay such debts as
they mature in the ordinary course of business. For the purposes of this
_Section 5.9_ , the amount of any contingent liability at any time shall be
computed as the amount that, in light of all of the facts and circumstances
existing at such time, represents the amount that can reasonably be expected
to become an actual or matured liability.

 

SECTION 5.10 _Due Diligence Investigation_. Parent has had an opportunity to
discuss the business, management, operations and finances of the Acquired
Companies with their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
representatives and Affiliates, and has had an opportunity to inspect the
facilities of the Acquired Companies. Parent has conducted its
own independent investigation of the Acquired Companies. In making its
decision to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent has relied solely upon the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in _Article IV_ (and
acknowledges that such representations and warranties are the only
representations and warranties made by any Acquired Company) and has not
relied upon any other information provided by, for or on behalf of the
Acquired Companies or Equityholders, or their respective agents or
representatives, to Parent in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including in any confidential information memorandum
previously made available to Parent or in any data room to which Parent and
its advisors and other representatives have been provided access by the
Company. Parent has entered into the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement with the understanding, acknowledgement and agreement that no
representations or warranties, express or implied, are made with respect to
any projection or forecast regarding future results or activities or the
probable success or profitability of any Acquired Company. Parent
acknowledges that no current or former stockholder, director, officer,
employee, affiliate or advisor of any Acquired Company has made or is making
any representations, warranties or commitments whatsoever, express or
implied, with respect to the Acquired Companies or their businesses.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary herein, (a) nothing
in this _Section 5.10_ shall in any way limit any of the representations or
warranties set forth in  _Article IV_ , and (b) the provisions of this
_Section 5.10_ shall not, and shall not be deemed or construed to, waive or
release any claims for actual fraud with respect to any of the representations
or warranties set forth in _Article IV_.

ARTICLE VI.

pursuant to _Section 6.3_ , or in connection with the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or otherwise, shall be governed by the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Company

taken, all appropriate action, and do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to promptly
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) obtain all authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of, and give

cooperate fully each other in promptly seeking to obtain all such
authorizations, consents, orders and approvals, giving such notices, and
making such filings. Notwithstanding the foregoing and except as otherwise
expressly set forth in this Agreement, in connection with obtaining such
authorizations, consents, orders and approvals from third parties, no Acquired
Company shall be required to make payments to any Person, other than any
payment required to be made pursuant to the terms of any Contract between an
Acquired Company and such other Person.

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the terms of _Section 6.5(a)_ ,
(i) to the extent required by applicable Law, each of Parent and the Company
shall file, or cause to be filed, a Notification and Report Form pursuant to
the HSR Act, with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
within five (5) Business Days of the date of this Agreement (including, in
the case of Parent, a request for early termination of the applicable waiting
period under the HSR Act), and (ii) each of Parent and the Company shall (A)
supply the other or its outside counsel with any information that may be
required or requested by any Governmental Authority in connection with such
filings or submissions, (B) supply any additional information that may be
required or requested by the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the
Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or other Governmental Authorities in
which any such filings or submissions are made under the HSR Act, (C) use
their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as
reasonably practicable, (D) to the extent permitted by applicable Law or
Governmental Authority, not make any notification in relation to the
transactions contemplated hereunder without first providing the other
party with a copy of such notification in draft form and giving such other
party a reasonable opportunity to discuss its content before it is filed with
the relevant Governmental Authority, and such first party shall consider and
take account of all reasonable comments timely made by the other party in
this respect, (E) promptly notify each other of any material communications
with any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and ensuring to the extent permitted by applicable Law or
Governmental Authority that each of the parties is given the opportunity to
attend any meetings with or appearances before any Governmental Authority with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (F) take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and do, or

 



49  cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby, including (1) taking
all such action as reasonably may be necessary to resolve such objections, if
any, as the FTC, the DOJ, or any other Governmental Authority or Person may
assert under any applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment
under any Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect
to the Merger so as to enable the transactions contemplated hereby to be
consummated as soon as expeditiously possible, (2) agreeing to and effecting
the sale, divestiture or disposition of assets or businesses of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, (3) agreeing to and implementing any restrictions
or actions that after the Closing Date would limit the freedom of the
Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries action with respect to, or their
ability to retain, one or more of its or its Subsidiaries businesses or
assets, and (4) contesting, defending and appealing any Actions brought by a
Governmental Authority, whether judicial or administrative, challenging or
seeking to restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Merger or seeking to
compel any divestiture by Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries of shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or
property, or to impose any limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct
their businesses or to own or exercise control of such assets, properties or
stock to avoid or eliminate any impediment under any Antitrust Law, in each
case as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any order, judgment, decree, injunction, ruling or writ of any
Governmental Authority in any Action that would otherwise have the effect of
preventing or materially delaying the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. In furtherance of the foregoing and subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, the parties to this Agreement shall not take
any action that is reasonably likely to have the effect of unreasonably
delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any required authorizations,
consents, orders or approvals.

(c) Immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Company shall duly take all lawful action, and shall use reasonable best
efforts, to obtain the Required Company Stockholder Vote pursuant to executed
written consents (the " _Written Consent_ ") in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit C_. The materials submitted to the Companys stockholders in
connection with the Written Consent shall include the unanimous recommendation
of the Companys Board of Directors that the Companys stockholders vote
their shares of Company Common Stock in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement. Promptly following receipt of the Written Consent, the Company
shall cause its corporate Secretary to deliver a copy of such Written Consent
to Parent. Promptly after the receipt by the Company of the Required Company
Stockholder Vote pursuant to the Written Consent, the Company shall deliver
notice thereof and notice of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL
to the stockholders of the Company in compliance with Sections 228(e) and 262
of the DGCL. In connection therewith, the Company shall give notice of the
exercise of its rights set forth in Section 3(e) of the
Stockholders Agreement in connection with and with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) and take all actions
reasonably necessary, advisable or appropriate in order to enforce its rights
with respect to holders of shares of Company Common Stock under Section 3(e)
of the Stockholders Agreement (including, if necessary, to irrevocably waive
any appraisal rights available to such holder of Company Common Stock with
respect to the Merger pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL).

(d) Immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Parent, as sole stockholder of Merger Sub, shall adopt this Agreement and
approve the Merger and the related transactions contemplated hereby in
accordance with the DGCL and Merger Subs certificate of incorporation and
bylaws.

 

SECTION 6.6 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_.
From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual who was a
director or officer of an Acquired Company prior to the Closing in their
capacities as such (collectively, the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ "),
against any and all Damages incurred or

 



50  suffered by any of the Company Indemnified Parties in connection with any
Liabilities or any Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, to the extent that the relevant Acquired Company
would have been required under the Company Certificate of Incorporation and
Company Bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents of the relevant
Acquired Company), as the case may be, in each case as in effect on the date
of this Agreement, to indemnify such Company Indemnified Parties and (ii)
advance expenses as incurred by any Company Indemnified Party in connection
with any matters for which such Company Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification from Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.6(a)_ to the extent
required under the Company Certificate of Incorporation and Company Bylaws
(or equivalent organizational documents of the relevant Acquired Company);
_provided_ , ___however_ , that the Company Indemnified Party to whom expenses
are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately and finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction and all
rights of appeal have lapsed that such Company Indemnified Party is not
entitled to indemnification under the Company Certificate of Incorporation
and Company Bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents of the relevant
Acquired Company), and pursuant to this _Section 6.6(a)_.

 

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries
for a period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time (i) to
maintain provisions in its certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other
organizational documents concerning the indemnification and exoneration
(including provisions relating to expense advancement) of the Company
Indemnified Parties that are no less favorable to those Persons than the
provisions of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational
documents of each Acquired Company, as applicable, in each case, as of the
date of this Agreement, and (ii) not to amend, repeal or otherwise modify
such provisions in any respect that would adversely affect the rights of those
Persons thereunder, in each case, except as required by Law.

 

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company (at the expense of Parent)
shall purchase a prepaid directors and officers liability insurance policy
or policies (i.e., "tail coverage") (the " _D andO Tail Policy_"), which policy
or policies shall cover those persons who are currently covered by the
Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy for an
aggregate period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time with
respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred before the
Closing, the premium for which shall not be treated as a Company Transaction
Expense.

(d) The terms and provisions of this _Section 6.6_ shall operate for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Company Indemnified Parties and
their respective heirs and representatives, each of whom is an intended third
party beneficiary of this _Section 6.6_. Notwithstanding any other provisions
of this Agreement, the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
contained in this _Section 6.6_ shall be binding upon the successors and
assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation. In the event that Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective successors or assigns,
(i) consolidates with or merges into any Person, or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties or assets to any Person, then, and in each
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, honor the
indemnification obligations set forth in this _Section 6.6_.

 

SECTION 6.7 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) For purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting (excluding
equity-based compensation) and benefit accrual (excluding, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, credit for service for benefit accrual under any
defined benefit plan) and level of vacation and other paid time off under any
benefit plan or arrangement provided, sponsored, maintained or contributed to
by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
Continuing Employees (as defined below)

 



51  from and after the Effective Time shall receive full credit for service with
the Acquired Companies (and with any predecessor employer) to the same extent
such same service credit was recognized under the Company Benefit Plans,
except to the extent such credit would result in duplication of benefits for
the same period of service. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall use
commercially reasonable measures to (i) waive for each Continuing Employee
and his or her dependents, all limitations as to preexisting conditions
exclusions, waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements and any other restriction that would prevent immediate or
full participation applicable under any welfare benefit plans that such
employees may be eligible to participate in after the Effective Time, other
than limitations, waiting periods or other restrictions that are already in
effect with respect to such employees and that have not been satisfied as of
the Effective Time under any welfare benefit plan maintained for the
Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide
each Continuing Employee and his or her dependents with full credit for any
co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements for the plan year that
includes the Closing Date under any welfare plans of the Parent, Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries that such employees are
eligible to participate in after the Effective Time, as if there had been a
single continuous employer.

 

(b) For a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing, Parent shall
provide (or cause the Surviving Corporation or another Affiliate of Parent to
provide) to employees of the Surviving Corporation or any other Affiliate of
Parent who were employees of any Acquired Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time (" _Continuing Employees_ ") base compensation, incentive or
bonus opportunities, severance benefits and employee welfare and retirement
benefits (other than equity-based compensation arrangements) (such
compensation and benefits, collectively, " _Employee Benefits_ ") which
are substantially similar in the aggregate to the Employee Benefits provided
to the employees of the Acquired Companies immediately prior to the Closing.

 

(c) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company
shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Acquired Company to continue any specific Company
Benefit Plan or to continue the employment of any specific Person.

 

(d) This _Section 6.7_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 6.7_ ,
expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer upon any
other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever or to constitute
an amendment of any Company Benefit Plan or any plan maintained Parent or its
Affiliate (or an undertaking to amend any such plan) or other compensation and
benefits plan maintained for or provided to Acquired Company employees,
including Continuing Employees, prior to or following the Closing Date.
Without limiting the foregoing, no provision of this _Section 6.7_ shall
create any third party beneficiary rights in any current or former employee,
director or consultant of any Acquired Company.

 

SECTION 6.8 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes imposed with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne by Parent. Parent
hereby agrees to file in a timely manner all necessary documents (including,
but not limited to, all Tax Returns) with respect to all such amounts for
which Parent is so liable. Parent shall provide the
Equityholders Representative with evidence satisfactory to the
Equityholders Representative that such Transfer Taxes have been paid by
Parent. Parent shall pay all such Transfer Taxes without deduction or
withholding from any consideration or amounts payable under this Agreement.

 



52 (b) _FIRPTA Certificate_. At the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent
a certification (and accompanying notice to the Internal Revenue Service)
certifying that the Merger is exempt from withholding under Section 1445 of
the Code and Parent is hereby authorized to deliver such notice to the
Internal Revenue Service after the Closing.

(c) _Shareholder Approval of Parachute Payments_. To the extent any individual
may receive any payment or benefit from any Acquired Company, Parent or any
of their Affiliates that individually or in the aggregate would be a
"parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then no
later than one calendar day prior to the Closing, the Company shall obtain a
written waiver from each such individual, pursuant to which the individual
shall have waived his or her rights to some or all of such payments
and benefits so that all remaining such payments and benefits applicable to
such individual shall not constitute "parachute payments" (such waived
payments and benefits, the " _Waived 280G Benefits_ "). Promptly following
the execution of such waivers, and in all events prior to the Closing, the
Company shall solicit a vote of the Waived 280G Benefits from the stockholders
of the Company in the manner provided under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code
and its associated Treasury Regulations. Prior to soliciting such waivers and
vote, the Company shall provide a draft of such waivers and such stockholder
vote solicitation materials (together with any calculations and supporting
documentation) to Parent for Parents comment. To the extent that any of the
Waived 280G Benefits are not approved by the stockholders of the Company as
contemplated above, prior to the Closing, such Waived 280G Benefits shall not
be made or provided in any manner. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
deliver to Parent evidence that a vote of the stockholders of the Company was
solicited in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.8(c)_
and that either (a) the requisite number of votes was obtained with respect
to the Waived 280G Benefits (the " _280G Approval_ "), or (b) the 280G
Approval was not obtained, and, as a consequence, the Waived 280G Benefits
shall not be made or provided.

 

SECTION 6.9 _Notice of Certain Events_. During the Pre-Closing Period, each of
the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other party of the failure
of an Acquired Company, Merger Sub or Parent, as the case may be, to comply
with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which would reasonably be expected
to result in any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement not to be
satisfied.

 

SECTION 6.10 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or advisable to
obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions
described herein and to consummate the Debt Financing on the Closing Date.
Such actions shall include the following: (i) maintaining in effect the
Commitment Letters; (ii) participation by senior management of Parent in, and
assistance with, the preparation of rating agency presentations and meetings
with rating agencies; (iii) causing the Equity Financing to be consummated
upon satisfaction of the applicable Financing Conditions at the time the
Closing is required to occur pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _2.3_ ; (iv) taking
into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period, satisfying on a
timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in the Debt
Commitment Letter; (v) negotiating, executing and delivering Debt Financing
Documents that reflect the terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter
(including any "market flex" provisions related thereto) or on such other
terms acceptable to Parent and its Financing Sources; and (vi) in the event
that the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2_ (except for delivery of
certificates and other deliverables pursuant to  _Section 7.2(a)(iii)_ and
_Section 7.2(e)_ , all of which shall have been capable of being delivered on
the date the Closing should have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.3_ ) and the
Financing Conditions (other than those to be satisfied at funding) have been
satisfied or, upon Closing and funding, respectively, would be satisfied, and
the

 



53  Closing is required to occur pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _2.3_ , cause the
financing providers to fund the Financing in an amount equal to the Required
Amount (less the amount of any cash on hand which is to be applied in
accordance with this Agreement). Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
enforce its rights under the Commitment Letters and Debt Financing Documents,
in the case of a Financing Failure Event. Parent shall give the Company
prompt notice of any breach, repudiation, or threatened (in writing) breach of
the Commitment Letters (including any Financing Failure Event) of which Parent
or its Affiliates becomes aware;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
will Parent or such Affiliate be under any obligation to disclose any
information that is subject to attorney-client or similar privilege if Parent
or such Affiliate cannot disclose such information in a way that would not
waive such privilege. In the event that Parent or an Affiliate do not provide
access or information in reliance on the preceding sentence, such Person shall
provide notice to the Company that such access or information is being
withheld and such Person shall use its reasonable best efforts to communicate,
to the extent feasible, the applicable information in a way that would not
waive such privilege. Merger Sub and Parent shall keep the Company
reasonably informed on a current basis of the status of their efforts to
consummate the Debt Financing. Without limiting its other obligations under
this _Section 6.10(a)_ , if a Financing Failure Event occurs Parent shall (i)
use reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable, obtain
alternative debt financing in the Required Amount (less the amount of the
Equity Financing and cash on hand permitted to be applied to the Required
Amount under this Agreement) from the same or other sources and which do not
include terms and conditions to the consummation of such alternative debt
financing that are materially less favorable (taken as a whole) to Parent and
Merger Sub than the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter (including the "flex" provisions of the Fee Letter); _provided_ ,
_however_ , for the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall not be required to
execute any alternative Debt Commitment Letter (and related documents)
or arrange for such alternative debt financing (x) on terms and conditions
(including the "flex" provisions of any related fee letter) which are
materially less favorable (taken as a whole) unless otherwise determined by
Merger Sub and Parent in their sole discretion, (y) having economic or
conditionality terms less favorable than those set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter (after giving effect to the "flex" provisions) provided on
the date of this Agreement or (z) pay any fees in excess of those
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, including the "flex" provisions of
the related fee letters (whether to secure waiver of any conditions contained
therein or otherwise) and (ii) promptly provide the Company with a true and
complete copy of a new financing commitment. Parent shall not, without the
prior written consent of the Company: (i) permit any amendment or modification
to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Debt Commitment
Letter if such amendment, modification, waiver or remedy (w) adds new
conditions (or modifies any existing conditions in a manner adverse to Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company or the transactions contemplated hereby) to the
consummation of all or any portion of the Debt Financing, (x) reduces the
amount of the Debt Financing (together with the proceeds of the Equity
Financing and any cash on hand permitted to be applied to the Required Amount
under this Agreement) below the Required Amount, (y) adversely affects the
ability of Merger Sub or Parent to enforce their rights against other parties
to the Debt Commitment Letter as so amended, replaced, supplemented or
otherwise modified, relative to the ability of Merger Sub and Parent to
enforce their rights against such other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter
as in effect on the date hereof or (z) taking into account the expected timing
of the Marketing Period, could otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (
_provided_ , _however_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent may amend
the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, book-
runners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement, if the addition of such
parties, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially delay the availability of the Debt Financing or the
consummation of the contemplated transactions); or (ii) terminate the Debt
Commitment Letter unless it is replaced, prior to or concurrently with the
termination, with a new commitment that, were it structured as an amendment
to the existing Debt Commitment Letter, would satisfy the requirements of this
Section 6.10(a) (including the limitations on assignment set forth in this
Section 6.10(a). Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any
such amendment,

 



54  modification, waiver or replacement. Neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates shall amend, modify, supplement, restate, substitute or replace the
Equity Commitment Letters, other than to increase the amount of the funding
commitment thereunder. Parent shall not consent to any assignment of rights or
obligations under the Commitment Letters without the prior written approval of
the Company, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this _Section 6.10_ shall require, and in no event shall
reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to
require, Parent or Merger Sub to seek equity financing from any source other
than those counterparty to, in any amount in excess of, or on other terms and
conditions different from, the Equity Commitment Letters. Upon the request of
the Company, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to confirm (y) with its
financing sources their intent and ability to perform, and the availability of
the Financing, under the Commitment Letters, subject only to satisfaction
or waiver of the Financing Conditions, and (z) that neither it nor its
financing sources are aware of any event or condition that could reasonably be
expected to result in the failure of a Financing Condition. Parent represents
that the Asset Contribution (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter) has
occurred prior to the date of this Agreement, and Parent agrees that it shall
not, directly or indirectly, take any action such that the condition set forth
in Section 3 of Exhibit D of the Debt Commitment Letter as and to the extent
relating to the Asset Contribution (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter)
shall not be satisfied.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause each of the other
Acquired Companies to, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause
their Affiliates to, at Parents sole expense, cooperate in connection with
the arrangement of the Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent
or Merger Sub in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing or any
alternative financing they may seek in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including: (i) preparing and furnishing the Required
Financial Information and all other financial and pertinent information and
disclosures regarding the Acquired Companies (including their businesses,
operations, financial projections and prospects) as may be reasonably
requested by Parent or Merger Sub as promptly as reasonable practicable
(provided that neither the Company nor the Acquired Companies shall be
responsible in any manner for providing the information relating to the
proposed debt and equity capitalization that is required for any pro formas or
projected financial information identified therein), (ii) participating in a
reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence
sessions (including requesting accountants to participate in such due
diligence sessions), drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies
in connection with the Debt Financing in connection with the Debt Financing,
and assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency
presentations, road show presentations, bank information memoranda (including,
to the extent necessary, an additional bank information memorandum that does
not include material non-public information) and similar documents required in
connection with the Debt Financing; (iii) reasonably assisting Parent and
Merger Sub in procuring a public corporate credit rating and a public
corporate family rating in respect of the relevant borrower or issuer under
the Debt Financing and public ratings for the Debt Financing or notes to be
offered in connection with the Debt Financing; (iv) obtaining customary
authorization letters with respect to the bank information memoranda from a
senior officer of the Acquired Companies ( _provided_ , that such
authorization letters shall not include (y) any indemnification provisions or
(z) any representations or warranties regarding the status of information as
non-public information); (v) at least five (5) Business Days prior to Closing,
providing all documentation and other information about the Acquired Companies
that is reasonably requested by the Financing Sources and the Financing
Sources reasonably determine is required by applicable "know your customer"
and anti-money laundering rules and regulations including the USA PATRIOT Act,
to the extent requested by Parent or Merger Sub in writing at least ten (10)
Business Days prior to Closing; and (vi) to cause the other Acquired Companies
and their respective representatives to, provide to Parent and Merger Sub, all
other reasonable cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is necessary
in connection with the Debt Financing; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it would interfere
unreasonably with the 

 



55  business or operations of the Acquired Companies; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that no Acquired Company, nor any of its respective non-continuing directors
or non-continuing officers shall be required to take any action in the
capacity as a member of the board of directors of such Acquired Company to
authorize or approve the Debt Financing; _provided_ , _further_ , that no
Acquired Company shall be required to commit to take any action that is not
contingent upon the Closing (including the entry into any agreement) or that
would be effective prior to the Effective Time (except, in any case, the
authorization letter contemplated by clause (iv) above). No Acquired Company
shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or agree to
provide any indemnity in connection with the Debt Financing that would be
payable or would become effective prior to the Effective Time. No liabilities,
costs or expenses incurred by any Acquired Company in taking any of the
actions required to be taken by it pursuant to this _Section 6.10(b)_ will be
treated as a current liability for purposes of determining the Closing Net
Working Capital Amount or included in the Closing Debt or the Unpaid Company
Transaction Expenses. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company,
reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the
Acquired Companies in connection with this  _Section_ _ _ _6.10(b)_. The
Company hereby consents to the reasonable use of the Acquired Companies logos
in connection with the Financing, provided that such logos are used solely in
a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage
the Acquired Companies or the reputation or goodwill of the Acquired Companies
or any of their logos and on such other customary terms and conditions as the
Company shall reasonably impose. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless,
each Acquired Company, and its respective officers, employees and
representatives, from and against any and all liabilities or losses suffered
or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of Debt Financing
and any information utilized in connection therewith in each case except to
the extent the relevant amounts result from the bad faith, gross negligence or
willful misconduct of, or the inaccuracy of any information provided by, the
Acquired Companies or any of their respective Related Parties.

SECTION 6.11 _Termination of Certain Agreements_. Prior to the Effective Time,
except for this Agreement and except for liabilities relating to employment
relationships, the Company shall cause the Contracts listed in _Section 6.11_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule between any Acquired Company, on the one
hand, and any Related Party, on the other hand, to be terminated in full and
of no further force or effect effective upon the Effective Time and shall
cause evidence of such termination of such liabilities, obligations and
agreements reasonably satisfactory to Parent to be delivered to Parent.

SECTION 6.12 _Retention of Books and Records_. Parent shall cause the Acquired
Companies to retain all books, ledgers, files, reports, plans, operating
records and any other material documents pertaining to the business of the
Acquired Companies prior to the Closing that are required to be retained under
current retention policies of the Acquired Companies for a period of seven
(7) years from the Closing Date, and to make the same available to the
Equityholders Representative after the Closing for inspection for legitimate
business reasons, such as the preparation of Tax Returns, and copying by the
Equityholders Representative or its representatives at the Equityholders
Representatives expense, during regular business hours and upon reasonable
request and upon reasonable advance notice; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries may dispose of
any such books and records at any time after the date that is two (2) years
after the Closing Date if Parent gives at least thirty (30) days
prior written notice of such intention to dispose to the Equityholders
Representative, and the Equityholders Representative is given a reasonable
opportunity during such thirty (30) day period, at its cost and expense, to
remove and retain all or any part of such books and records as it may elect.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any such access shall be
subject to such additional limitations as Parent or the Surviving Corporation
may reasonably require to prevent the disclosure of any confidential or
legally privileged information.

 



56 SECTION 6.13 _Resignations_. Prior to the Effective Time, following Parents
request to the Company in writing at least five (5) Business Days prior to

(a) by the mutual written consent of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company;

 



59 (b) by either the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, by written notice to the other party if any Governmental
Authority with jurisdiction over such matters shall have issued a Governmental
Order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such
Governmental Order shall have become final and unappealable; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the terms of this _Section 8.1(b)_ shall not be available to

results in the imposition of such Governmental Order or the failure of such
Governmental Order to be resisted, resolved or lifted, as applicable;

 

(c) by either the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, by written notice to the other party if the Merger shall not have
been consummated on or before July 18, 2016 (the " _Outside Date_ "), unless

any breach in any material respect of this Agreement by the party seeking to
terminate the Agreement pursuant to the terms of this _Section 8.1(c)_ ;

(d) by the Company, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement,

representation or warranty shall have become untrue; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if such inaccuracy in Parents and Merger Subs representations and
warranties or breach by Parent or Merger Sub is curable by Parent or Merger
Sub prior to the Outside Date, then the Company may not terminate this
Agreement under this _Section 8.1(d)_ prior to the earlier of (i) thirty
(30) days following the receipt of written notice from the Company to Parent
and Merger Sub of such breach, and (ii) the Business Day immediately prior to
the Outside Date (it being understood that the Company may not terminate this

Merger Sub set forth in _Section 7.2_ or (B) if such breach by Parent or
Merger Sub is cured prior to the earlier of the dates specified in clauses (i)
and (ii) such that the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(a)_ would then be

(e) by Parent, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or

satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such representation
or warranty shall have become untrue; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such
inaccuracy in the Companys representations and warranties or breach by the
Company is curable by the Company prior to the Outside Date, then Parent may
not terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(e)_ prior to the earlier
of (i) thirty (30) days following the receipt of written notice from Parent to
the Company of such breach, and (ii) the Business Day immediately prior to the
Outside Date (it being understood that Parent may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(e)_ if (A) it is then in material
breach of this Agreement and such breach by Parent would prevent the
satisfaction of any of the conditions to the obligation of the Company set
forth in _Section 7.1_ or (B) if such breach by the Company is cured prior to
the earlier of the dates specified in clauses (i) and (ii) such that the
conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) would then be satisfied);

(f) by the Company, if (i) the Marketing Period has ended and all conditions
set forth in _Section 7.2_ have been satisfied as of the date on which the

evidence to Parent of) the Required Company Stockholder Vote, _provided_ ,
_however_ , Parent shall only be entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 8.1(g)_ prior to the Company obtaining the Required
Company Stockholder Vote.

 

SECTION 8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to and in
accordance with _Section 8.1_ , this Agreement shall forthwith become void
and of no further force or effect whatsoever and there shall be no liability
on the part of any party to this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, except as provided in _Section 8.2(b)_ and
_Section 8.2(c)_ , nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any party
to this Agreement from any liability resulting from or arising out of any
willful and material breach of any agreement or covenant in this
Agreement prior to such termination; _provided_ , _further_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms of _Section 6.4_ , this _Section 8.2_
and _Article IX_ shall remain in full force and effect and shall survive any
termination of this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 8.2(a)_ , in the event that (i) Parent or the
Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_ if at the time
of such termination the Company would have been entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_ , (ii) the Company validly terminates
this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 8.1(d)_ or (iii) the Company validly
terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_ , then Parent shall
pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company a termination fee of $71,250,000 in
cash (the " _Termination Fee_ "). Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, the
Termination Fee, if applicable, to the Company by wire transfer of immediately
available funds within five (5) Business Days after the termination of this
Agreement. Payment of the Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Company Parties (as defined below) against the Parent Related
Parties (as defined below) following a termination of this Agreement under the
circumstances described in the first sentence of this _Section 8.2(b)_ , it
being understood that in no event shall Parent be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion. While the Company may pursue both a
grant of specific performance to the extent permitted by  _Section_ _ _
_9.15_ and the payment of the Termination Fee to the extent permitted by this
_Section 8.2(b)_ , under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or
entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance to require Parent to
consummate the Closing and payment of the Termination Fee. The parties
acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section 8.2_ are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the Commitment Letters to
the contrary, in the event that Parent or Merger Sub fail to effect the
Closing for any reason or no reason or any of them otherwise breaches this
Agreement (or any representation, warranty or covenant hereof) (whether
willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) or otherwise fail
to perform hereunder (whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or
otherwise), then, except for (i) the Companys rights under this Agreement
pursuant to the fourth sentence and the last sentence of _Section 6.10(b)_ ,
the second sentence of _Section 8.2(d)_ , the last sentence of _Section
9.15(b)_ and _Section 9.4_ , (ii) the Companys right to enforce the Guarantee
and (iii) the right of the Company to enforce the Equity Commitment Letters
and to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable
relief pursuant to, and only to the extent expressly permitted by, _Section
9.15_ and Section 6 of the Equity

 



61  Commitment Letters, the Companys right (subject to the terms, conditions
and limitations hereof) to terminate this Agreement and receive the
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_ shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) of (i)
the Acquired Companies, (ii) any former, current or future, direct or
indirect, stockholder, member, owner, director, manager, officer, employee,
agent, representative, Affiliate or assignee of any of the Acquired Companies
or (iii) any former, current or future, director, manager, officer, employee,
agent, representative, Affiliate or assignee of any of the foregoing
(the Persons described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) shall be collectively
referred to as the " _Company Parties_ ") against (A) Parent, Merger Sub or
the Guarantors, (B) the former, current or future holders of any equity,
partnership or limited liability company interest, controlling persons,
directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members,
managers, general or limited partners, stockholders, owners or assignees of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Guarantors, (C) any lender, prospective lender,
arranger or agent of or under the Debt Financing or any of their respective
former, current or future equityholders, controlling persons, directors,
officers, employees, Affiliates, managers or agents (including the Lenders)
or (D) any holders or future holders of any capital stock or other equity or
ownership interest (including any options, warrants, calls, rights,
convertible or exchangeable securities, "phantom" stock rights, stock
appreciation rights, stock-based performance units with respect to such
interest or stock), controlling persons, directors, officers, employees,
agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners,
stockholders, owners or assignees of any of the foregoing (the Persons
described in clauses (A), (B), (C) and (D) shall be collectively referred to
as the " _Parent Related Parties_ " and individually as a " _Parent Related
Party_ "), for any Liabilities, losses, damages, claims, judgments, awards,
settlements, demands, costs or expenses of any kind or nature suffered as a
result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
(whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) in this
Agreement or failure to perform under this Agreement (whether willfully,
intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) or other failure of the Merger to
be consummated (whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally
or otherwise).

(d) The parties acknowledge that the Termination Fee if payable pursuant to
_Section 8.2(b)_ does not constitute a penalty but constitutes payment of
liquidated damages and that the Companys liquidated damages amount is
reasonable in light of the substantial but indeterminate harm anticipated to
be caused by Parents and Merger Subs breach or default under this
Agreement, the difficulty of proof of loss and damages, the inconvenience and
non-feasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy, and the value of
the transactions to be consummated hereunder. If Parent fails to timely pay
the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_ to the extent due and owing
thereunder and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company commences an
Action that results in a final and non-appealable judgment against Parent for
the Termination Fee, Parent shall pay to the Company, together with the
Termination Fee, (i) interest on the Termination Fee from the date of
termination of this Agreement at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate as
published in _The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition_ , in effect on the
date hereof and (ii) any reasonable out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Company in connection
with such Action (which shall not, for the avoidance of doubt, include any
losses incurred by any Person as a result of any breach of this Agreement in
addition to the Termination Fee); provided, however, if Parent is the
prevailing party in such Action that results in a final and non-appealable
judgment against the Company, the Company shall pay to Parent any reasonable
out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees)
incurred by Parent in connection with such Action (which shall not, for the
avoidance of doubt, include any losses incurred by any Person as a result of
any breach of this Agreement).

GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

SECTION 9.1 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. None of
the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any
instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective
Time and no claim for any breach or inaccuracy in such representations or
warranties may be made after the Effective Time. None of the covenants
or agreements of any party to this Agreement required to be performed or
complied with by such party prior to the Closing shall survive the Effective
Time, and no claim for any breach of or failure to perform any such covenant
or agreement may be made after the Effective Time. Unless otherwise
indicated, the covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement which by
their terms are required to be performed at or after the Closing shall survive
the Effective Time until they have been performed or satisfied.

SECTION 9.2 _Equityholders_ __ _Representative_.

 

(a) _Appointment_. By virtue of the adoption of this Agreement by the
Companys stockholders, and without further action of any Company
stockholder, each Equityholder shall be deemed to have irrevocably constituted
and appointed Genstar Capital Partners V, L.P. (and by execution of this
Agreement it hereby accepts such appointment) as agent and attorney-in-fact
for and on behalf of the Equityholders (in their capacity as such), with full
power of substitution, to act in the name, place and stead of each
Equityholder and to carry out the functions assigned to the Equityholders
Representative under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Equityholders Representative shall have no obligation to act except as
expressly provided herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Equityholders Representative shall have full power, authority and
discretion with respect to _Section 2.7_ and the Escrow Agreement and the
taking by the Equityholders Representative of any and all actions and the
making of any decisions required or permitted to be taken by the
Equityholders Representative under _Section 2.7_ or the Escrow Agreement and
to accept on behalf of each Equityholder service of process and any notices
required to be served on the Equityholders. All actions taken by the
Equityholders Representative under this Agreement shall be binding upon all
Equityholders and their successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified in
writing by each of them. The power of attorney granted in this  _Section
9.2_ is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable, may be delegated by the
Equityholders Representative and shall survive the death or incapacity of
each Equityholder. Such agency may be changed by the holders of a majority in
interest of the Escrow Fund from time to time (including in the event of the
death, disability or other incapacity of an Equityholders Representative that
is an individual), and any such successor shall succeed the Equityholders
Representative as Equityholders Representative hereunder. For the avoidance
of doubt, any compromise or settlement of any matter by the Equityholders
Representative hereunder shall be binding on, and fully enforceable against,
all Equityholders. No bond shall be required of the Equityholders
Representative, and the Equityholders Representative shall receive no
compensation for its services. Each Equityholder agrees that
the Equityholders Representative shall be entitled to engage such counsel,
experts and other agents and consultants as it shall deem necessary in
connection with exercising its powers and performing its function hereunder
and (in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Equityholders
Representative) shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and
advice of such Persons.

 

(b) _Limitation on Liability_. The Equityholders Representative shall not be
liable to any Person for any act of the Equityholders Representative, in its
capacity as such, taken in good faith and in the exercise of its reasonable
judgment and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of its duties under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement
(it being understood that any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of
legal counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith and reasonable
judgment), except to the extent any liability, loss, damage, penalty,
fine, cost or expense is actually incurred by such Person as a proximate
result of the gross negligence or bad faith of the

 



63  Equityholders Representative. The Equityholders Representative may seek
indemnification from the Equityholders for, any liability, loss, damage,
penalty, fine, cost or expense incurred by the Equityholders Representative
while acting in good faith and in the exercise of its reasonable judgment and
arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its
duties under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, except to the extent
that any such liability, loss, damage, penalty, fine, cost or expense is the
proximate result of the gross negligence or bad faith of the Equityholders
Representative.

 

(c) _Access_. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide the Equityholders Representative with
reasonable access to information about the Surviving Corporation in accordance
with, and subject to the terms and conditions of, _Section 6.12_ for purposes
of performing its duties and exercising its rights under this Agreement,
_provided_ , that the Equityholders Representative shall treat confidentially
any nonpublic information about the Surviving Corporation (except in
connection with the performance by the Equityholders Representative of
its duties or the exercise of its rights under this Agreement).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any such access shall be
subject to such additional limitations as Parent or the Surviving Corporation
may reasonably require to prevent the disclosure of any confidential or
legally privileged information.

(d) _Actions of the Equityholders  Representative_. From and after the
Effective Time, a decision, act, consent or instruction of the Equityholders
Representative shall constitute a decision of all Equityholders and shall be
final, binding and conclusive upon each Equityholder, and the Escrow Agent,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation may rely upon any decision, act, consent
or instruction of the Equityholders Representative as being the decision,
act, consent or instruction of each Equityholder notwithstanding any dispute
among the Equityholders and without any obligation to inquire of any
Equityholder. Each of Parent and its Affiliates (including, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) shall not have any Liability,
and is hereby relieved from any Liability to the Equityholder Representative
or any Equityholder, for any actions or omissions of the Equityholders
Representative or any acts done by Parent or the Surviving Corporation in
accordance with any decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Equityholders Representative. Notice to the Equityholders Representative,
delivered in the manner provided in _Section 9.5_ , shall be deemed to be
notice to each Equityholder for the purposes of this Agreement.

(e) _Expenses_. The Equityholders Representative shall use the Representative
Fund to pay any expenses incurred by the Equityholders Representative in
fulfilling its obligations hereunder and shall return any remaining balance of
the Representative Fund to the Equityholders (in accordance with each such
Equityholders Pro Rata Share) upon completion by the Equityholders
Representative of its duties hereunder.

SECTION 9.3 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, all costs and expenses (including all fees and disbursements of
counsel, financial advisors and accountants) incurred in connection with the
negotiation and preparation of this Agreement, the performance of the terms
of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, shall be paid by the respective party incurring such costs and
expenses, whether or not the Closing shall have occurred;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall pay all fees payable under the HSR Act in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

SECTION 9.4 _Costs and Attorneys_ __ _Fees_. Subject to the limitations set
forth herein, in the event that any action, suit or other proceeding is
instituted concerning or arising out of this Agreement, the prevailing party
in a final and non-appealable judgment shall recover from the other party all
of such prevailing partys reasonable out of pocket fees, costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees) incurred in connection with each and every such
action, suit or other proceeding, including any and all appeals and petitions
therefrom.

SECTION 9.6 _Public Announcements_. Unless otherwise required by applicable
Law or by the rules of any securities exchange or self-regulatory
organization applicable to Parent or any direct or indirect Affiliate of
Parent, no party to this Agreement shall make any public announcements in
respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
or otherwise communicate with any news media regarding this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, without the prior written consent
of the other parties to this Agreement. If a public statement is required to
be made pursuant to applicable Law or by the rules of any securities exchange
or self-regulatory organization applicable to Parent or any direct or indirect
Affiliate of Parent, the parties shall consult with each other, to the
extent permitted by Law and reasonably practicable, in advance as to the
contents and timing thereof. Allscripts may disclose the existence and terms
of this Agreement and any other material agreements which Allscripts or any of
its subsidiaries has entered into or will enter into in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and may file this Agreement and
any such other agreements, on a Current Report on Form 8-K and in other
filings made by Allscripts with the U.S.

  



66  Securities and Exchange Commission after the date of this Agreement,
provided that the Company or, after Closing, the Equityholders Representative
is afforded a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such
filings in advance and Allscripts considers any comments made by the Company
or, after Closing, the Equityholders Representative in good faith. The
Company and Parent further acknowledge and agree that (x) the Equityholders
Representative may disclose such terms and the existence of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby to its Affiliates in order that such
Persons may provide information about the subject matter of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to their respective actual
and prospective limited partners and investors in connection with their
fundraising and reporting activities, and (y) Parent may disclose such terms
and the existence of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
to GI Partners and its affiliated investment funds in order that such Persons
may provide information about the subject matter of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby to their respective actual and prospective
limited partners and investors in connection with their fundraising and
reporting activities. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 9.6_ to the
contrary, this _Section 9.6_ shall not apply to any public announcement or
other public communication that is consistent with information disclosed in
any other public announcement or other public communication that was
previously made or issued in compliance with the terms of this _Section 9.6_.

SECTION 9.7 _Interpretation_. The Article and Section headings in this
Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to
alter or affect the meaning or interpretation of any provision of this
Agreement. References to Articles, Sections, Schedules or Exhibits in this
Agreement, unless otherwise indicated, are references to Articles, Sections,
Schedules and Exhibits of or to this Agreement. The parties to this Agreement
have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.
In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises with
respect to any term or provision of this Agreement, this Agreement shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the parties to this Agreement, and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party
to this Agreement by virtue of the authorship of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement. A reference to any legislation or to any
provision of any legislation shall include any modification, amendment, re-
enactment thereof, any legislative provision substituted therefore and all
rules, regulations and statutory instruments issued or related to such
legislation. Any reference to a Governmental Authority shall be deemed also to
refer to any successor thereto unless the context requires otherwise. For all
purposes of and under this Agreement, (i) the word "including" shall be deemed
to be immediately followed by the words "without limitation," (ii) words
(including defined terms) in the singular shall be deemed to include the
plural and vice versa, (iii) words of one gender shall be deemed to include
the other gender as the context requires, (iv) the terms "hereof," "herein,"
"hereto," "herewith" and any other words of similar import shall, unless
otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole
(including all of the Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement) and not to any
particular term or provision of this Agreement, unless otherwise specified,
(v) the use of the word "or" shall not be exclusive and (vi) unless otherwise
defined in this Agreement, accounting terms shall have the respective meanings
assigned to them in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of  _Article IV_ ,
information shall be deemed to have been "made available" to Parent only if
such information was posted to the electronic data room maintained by Merrill
Corporation in a manner accessible and reviewable by Parent prior to 12:00
p.m. Pacific time on the date of this Agreement.

SECTION 9.8 _Severability_. In the event that any one or more of the terms or
provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other certificate, instrument
or other document referred to in this Agreement, shall, for any reason, be
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or
provision of this Agreement or any other such certificate, instrument or other
document referred to in this Agreement, and the parties to this Agreement
shall use their reasonable best efforts to substitute one or more valid,
legal and enforceable terms or provisions into this Agreement which, insofar
as practicable, implement the

 



67  purposes and intent of this Agreement. Any term or provision of this
Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part, degree or within certain
jurisdictions shall remain in full force and effect to the extent not held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable to the extent consistent with the intent of
the parties as reflected by this Agreement. To the extent permitted by
applicable Law, each party waives any term or provision of Law which renders
any term or provision of this Agreement to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect.

SECTION 9.9 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the other Schedules and the Exhibits to this Agreement)
and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the
parties to this Agreement with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement, and supersede all prior
agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties to this
Agreement with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and
the Confidentiality Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement.

SECTION 9.10 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties to
this Agreement (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties to this Agreement, and any purported
assignment or other transfer without such consent shall be void and
unenforceable; _provided_ , _however_ , notwithstanding the foregoing, each of
Parent and Merger Sub (and, after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation) may, without obtaining the consent of any party hereto, assign
any of its rights and/or obligations under this Agreement to any of its
Affiliates or to its lenders as collateral security or to any Person that
acquires (whether by merger, purchase of stock, purchase of assets or
otherwise), or is the successor or surviving entity in any such acquisition,
merger or other transaction involving, Parent or Merger Sub (or, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) ( _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
if Parent or Merger Sub (or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation), as applicable, so assigns its rights and/or obligations without
the consent of the Equityholders Representative (or, if prior to
the Effective Time, the Company), Parent or Merger Sub (or, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation), as applicable, shall not be
relieved of its obligations hereunder in respect of any such assignment, and
_provided_ , _further_ , that any assignment hereunder (other than a
collateral assignment to the Financing Sources) that would give rise to any
withholding Tax under Section 3.5 shall be subject to the prior written
consent of the Equityholders Representative).

 

SECTION 9.11 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is for the sole
benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any
legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Agreement, except for (i) the Company Indemnified
Parties under _Section 6.6_ , (ii) each Acquired Company, and its respective
officers, employees and representatives under _Section 6.10(b)_ , (iii) the
Financing Sources with respect to _Section 8.2(c)_ , _Section 9.10_ , this
_Section 9.11_ , _Section 9.12_ , the last sentence of _Section 9.13_ ,
_Section 9.14_ , and _Section 9.19_ , and (iv) the Parent Related Parties with
respect to _Sections 8.2(b)_ and _8.2(c)_.

 

SECTION 9.12 _Waivers and Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended or
modified only by a written instrument executed by all of the parties to this
Agreement. Any failure of the parties to this Agreement to comply with any
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition in this Agreement may be waived
by the party entitled to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument
signed by the party granting such waiver. No delay on the part of any party to
this Agreement in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any party
to this Agreement of any right, power or privilege hereunder operate as a
waiver of any other right, power or privilege hereunder, nor shall any single
or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power
or

 



68  privilege hereunder. Unless otherwise provided, the rights and remedies
provided for in this Agreement are cumulative and are not exclusive of any
rights or remedies which the parties to this Agreement may otherwise have at
law or in equity. Whenever this Agreement requires or permits consent by or on
behalf of a party, such consent shall be given in writing in a manner
consistent with the requirements for a waiver of compliance as set forth in
this _Section 9.12_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, _Section 8.2(c)_ , _Section 9.10_ , _Section 9.11_ , this _Section
9.12_ , the last sentence of _Section 9.13_ ,  _Section 9.14_ , and _Section
9.19_ (and the related definitions used in those sections and any other
provisions of this Agreement to the extent a modification or waiver thereof
would serve to modify the substance or provisions of such Sections) may not
be amended, waived or otherwise modified in a manner that impacts or is
adverse in any material respect to any Financing Source without the prior
written consent of the Lenders party to the Debt Commitment Letter.

 

SECTION 9.13 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
Delaware applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed entirely
within such State. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally submits, for itself and its assets and properties, to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any Delaware State court, or Federal court of the
United States of America, sitting within the State of Delaware, and any
appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement, the agreements delivered in connection with
this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or for
recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the
parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees
not to commence any such action or proceeding except in such courts, (ii)
agrees that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard
and determined in such Delaware State court or, to the extent permitted by
Law, in such Federal court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally
and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in any such Delaware State
or Federal court and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such Delaware State or Federal court. Each of the parties
to this Agreement hereby agrees that a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each of the
parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably consents to service of process
in the manner provided for in the notices in _Section 9.5_. Nothing in this
Agreement shall affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve
process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the parties hereby further agree that, (i) the Debt Commitment
Letter and the performance thereof by the Financing Sources shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York,
regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles
of conflicts of laws thereof and (ii) it will not bring any legal proceeding,
whether in Law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against the Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising
out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State
of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable Law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof).

SECTION 9.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT ACKNOWLEDGES
AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS
LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE, IT HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE

 



69  TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (INCLUDING THE DEBT FINANCING)
AND AGREES THAT SUCH WAIVER SHALL EXTEND TO THE FINANCING SOURCES. EACH PARTY
TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (IV)
IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.14_.

 

SECTION 9.15 _Equitable Remedies_.

 

(a) Each of the parties to this Agreement acknowledges and agrees that the
other parties to this Agreement would be irreparably damaged in the event
that any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement are not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or otherwise are breached. Therefore,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement and
subject to  _Section 9.15(b)_ , each of the parties to this Agreement hereby
agrees that (i) the parties to this Agreement shall be entitled to obtain an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement, and to enforce specifically the performance by
each other party hereto under this Agreement and (ii) the right of specific
enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have
entered into this Agreement. Each party to this Agreement hereby agrees to
waive the defense in any such suit that the other parties to this Agreement
have an adequate remedy at law and to interpose no opposition, legal
or otherwise, as to the propriety of injunction or specific performance as a
remedy, and hereby agrees to waive any requirement to post any bond in
connection with obtaining such relief. The equitable remedies described in
this  _Section 9.15_ shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other
remedies at law or in equity that the parties to this Agreement may elect to
pursue.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the right of the Company to obtain an injunction or
injunctions or other appropriate form of specific performance or equitable
remedies described in _Section_ _ _ _9.15(a)_ , the parties acknowledge and
agree that the Company shall be entitled to seek an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable remedies to enforce Parents obligations
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement to cause the Equity Financing to be
funded and to consummate the Merger (including enforcement of the Equity
Commitment Letters subject to the terms and conditions thereof) only in the
event that each of the following conditions has been satisfied: (i) all
conditions in _Section 7.2_ have been satisfied at the time the Closing is
required to have occurred pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _2.3_ (except
for delivery of certificates and other deliverables pursuant to _Section
7.2(a)(iii)_ and _Section 7.2(e)_, all of which shall have been capable of
being delivered on the date the Closing should have occurred pursuant to 
_Section 2.3_); (ii) the Closing is required to occur pursuant to _Section
2.3_ ; (iii) the Debt Financing has been funded or the Debt Financing would be
funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing; and
(iv) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice delivered to
Parent that if specific performance is granted pursuant to this _Section
9.15(b)_ and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then it would
take such actions that are within its control to cause the Closing to occur.
For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.15(b)
shall not in any way affect the right of the Company to an injunction or
specific performance or other equitable remedies for obligations other than
with respect to the Equity Financing (it being understood, without limiting
the Companys rights under this _Section 9.15(b)_ and the Equity Commitment
Letter, that if the Equity Financing is not funded, Parent shall have no
obligation to consummate the Merger). If the Company is actually granted
specific performance in accordance with this _Section 9.15_, Parent shall
reimburse the Company for any fees, costs or expenses (including legal fees)
incurred by the Company

 



70  in connection with the Companys pursuit of such grant of specific
performance, and in the event that the Closing occurs, such fees, costs and
expenses shall not be included in Company Transaction Expenses and shall be
included in Closing Cash to the extent such fees, costs and expenses are not
reimbursed as of the close of business on the day immediately preceding the
Closing Date.

 

SECTION 9.16 _Provision Respecting Legal Representation; Attorney-Client
Privilege_.

 

(a) Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby agrees, on its own behalf and
on behalf of its directors, members, partners, officers, employees and
Affiliates, that Latham and Watkins LLP may serve as counsel to each and any
Equityholder and such Equityholders respective Affiliates (individually and
collectively, the " _Holder Group_ "), on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand, in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (the " _Existing Representation_ "), and that, following
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Latham and Watkins LLP (or
any successor) may serve as counsel to the Holder Group or any director,
member, partner, officer, employee or Affiliate of the Holder Group,
in connection with any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(any such representation, a " _Post-Closing Representation_ ") notwithstanding
the Existing Representation and each of the parties hereto hereby consents
thereto and waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom, and each of
such parties shall cause any Affiliate thereof to consent to waive any
conflict of interest arising from the Existing Representation.

(b) Parent waives and shall not assert, and agrees after the Closing to cause
its Affiliates to waive and to not assert, any attorney-client privilege,
attorney work-product protection or expectation of client confidence with
respect to any communication between Latham and Watkins LLP, on the one hand,
and the Holder Group, or any advice given to the Holder Group by Latham and
Watkins LLP, occurring with respect to the Existing Representation
(collectively, " _Pre-Closing Privileges_ ") in connection with any Post-
Closing Representation, including in connection with a dispute between the
Holder Group and one or more of Parent and its Affiliates, it being the
intention of the parties hereto that all rights to such Pre-Closing
Privileges, and all rights to waive or otherwise control such Pre-Closing
Privileges, shall be retained by the Equityholders Representative, and shall
not pass to or be claimed or used by Parent, except as provided in the last
sentence of this _Section 9.16(b)_. Furthermore, Parent (on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates) acknowledges and agrees that any advice given to or
communication with the Holder Group shall not be subject to any joint
privilege (whether or not the Company also received such advice or
communication) and shall be owned solely by the Holder Group. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates, on the one hand,
and a third party other than the Holder Group, on the other hand, the
Surviving Corporation shall be permitted to assert the Pre-Closing Privileges
on behalf of the Holder Group to prevent disclosure of Privileged Materials to
such third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that such privilege may be waived
only with the prior written consent of the Equityholders Representative.

(c) All such Pre-Closing Privileges, shall be excluded from the Merger, and
shall be retained by the Equityholders Representative (on behalf of the
Holder Group).

 

(d) Parent hereby acknowledges that it has had the opportunity (including on
behalf of its Affiliates) to discuss and obtain adequate information
concerning the significance and material risks of, and reasonable available
alternatives to, the waivers, permissions and other provisions of this
_Section 9.16_ , including the opportunity to consult with counsel other
than Latham and Watkins LLP. This _Section 9.16_ shall be irrevocable, and no
term of this _Section 9.16_ may be amended, waived or modified, without the
prior written consent of the Equityholders Representative and Latham
and Watkins LLP.

 



71 SECTION 9.17 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an
original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement.

 

SECTION 9.18 _Time is of the Essence_. Time is of the essence with respect to
the performance of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 9.19 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document (except with respect to the
express obligations of the Financing Sources owed to Parent and Merger Sub
under the Debt Commitment Letter, and to the Surviving Corporation following
the Merger), in no event shall any Financing Source have any
Liability (whether in contract or in tort, in Law or in equity) for any
obligations or Liabilities arising under, in connection with or related to
this Agreement, any Transaction Document or any other instrument, agreement or
document executed or delivered in connection herewith or therewith (as the
case may be) or any Action based on, in respect of, or by reason of this
Agreement, such Transaction Document or such other instrument, agreement or
document (as the case may be) or the negotiation or execution hereof or
thereof, and each such Person irrevocably waives and releases all such
Liabilities, Actions, claims and obligations against any Financing Source.

72 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Equityholders
Representative have caused this Agreement to be executed by their respective
officers thereunto duly authorized, as of the date first above written.
