that, following consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Latham &amp; Watkins LLP (or any successor) may serve as counsel to the Holder Group or any director, member, partner, officer, employee or Affiliate of the Holder Group, in

the other hand, the Surviving Corporation shall be permitted to assert the Pre-Closing Privileges on behalf of the Holder Group to prevent disclosure of Privileged Materials to such third party; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that such privilege
