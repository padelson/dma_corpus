PURCHASE AGREEMENT

This Purchase Agreement (this "Agreement") is made and entered into on March
14, 2019, by and between IDEAL Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Buyer"), and Cree, Inc., a North Carolina corporation ("Seller"). Buyer and
Seller are sometimes referred to collectively herein as the "Parties" and
individually as a "Party".

WHEREAS, Seller desires to sell or cause to be sold to Buyer or one or more of
its designated Affiliates, and Buyer desires to purchase or cause to be
purchased from Seller (or another Seller Entity, as applicable), all of the
Acquired Assets and all of the issued and outstanding capital stock,
membership interests or other equity interests of each Acquired Company (the
"Purchased Interests"), and Buyer or its designated Affiliates desire to
assume the Assumed Liabilities, in each case upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises
herein made, and in consideration of the representations, warranties and
covenants herein contained, the Parties, intending to be legally bound, hereby
agree as follows.

ARTICLE 1 

PURCHASE AND SALE OF ACQUIRED ASSETS AND ACQUIRED COMPANIES



1.1 Sale and Purchase of the Purchased Interests. In accordance with the terms
and upon the conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing Seller hereby agrees
to sell, transfer, assign and deliver to Buyer (or one or more of its
designated Affiliates) all right, title and interest of the Seller Entities in
and to all of the Purchased Interests, in each case free and clear of all
Liens, and Buyer agrees to, or cause its designated Affiliate to, purchase,
acquire and accept from the Seller Entities the Purchased Interests.

1.2 Sale and Purchase of the Acquired Assets. In accordance with the terms and
upon the conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing Seller hereby agrees to
sell, transfer, assign and deliver (and cause each of its Affiliates (as
applicable) to sell, transfer, assign and deliver) to Buyer (or one or more of
its designated Affiliates), and Buyer agrees to, or cause its designated
Affiliate to, purchase, acquire and accept from the Seller Entities all right,
title and interest in and to any and all of the Seller Entities' assets,
properties, rights and claims of all types (in each case, whether tangible or
intangible) that are primarily used in or primarily related to the operation
of the Business or that are otherwise described in this Section 1.2 as an
Acquired Asset and that are not included in the Excluded Assets (collectively,
the "Acquired Assets"), in each case free and clear of all Liens other than
Permitted Liens; provided, however, that notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement or any provision of any Ancillary Agreement, none of the assets of
an Acquired Company shall be considered Acquired Assets for purposes of this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the phrase
"primarily used in or primarily related to" (or any similar phrase used to
characterize particular assets or liabilities) refers to use in or relation to
the balance of Seller's business as of the date of this Agreement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Acquired Assets include:

(a) all trade and other accounts receivable (collectively, the "Accounts
Receivable") attributable to the Business, and all rights in connection with

(b) all inventory primarily used in or primarily relating to the operation of
the Business, including raw materials and supplies, works in process and

its Affiliates or vendors on consignment, in each case (and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein) to the extent included as a current
asset in the final determination of the Working Capital Amount, but excluding
for the avoidance of doubt the inventory described on Schedule 1.2(b) (the
"Acquired Inventory");

(c) all machinery, furniture, fixtures, tools, supplies, spare parts,
vehicles, trailers, equipment, hardware, computers and other tangible personal
property primarily used in or primarily relating to the operation of the
Business, including such property as set forth on Schedule 1.2(c) (which
schedule may be updated by Seller between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing to reflect changes in the Ordinary Course of Business in compliance
with the terms of Section 4.3) together with the third-party Software products
that were provided with and are integrated with or otherwise used primarily in
connection with the operation of such machinery, tools, equipment, hardware,

(including rebates under the rebate agreements listed on Schedule 1.2(i)) and
rights under agreements with employees concerning confidentiality, non-
competition and assignment of inventions, in each case, to the extent
primarily relating to the Business;

(j) all Permits primarily used in or primarily relating to the operation of
the Business, and all rights thereunder, to the extent legally transferable;

(k) all books and records, payroll, sales, marketing and promotional
materials, catalogues and advertising literature, employee manuals, customer

records, ledgers, and copies of all books of original entry, and Occupational
Safety and Health Administration and Environmental Protection Agency files (if
any) (collectively, "Books and Records"), in each case, to the extent
primarily used in or primarily relating to the operation of the Business or to
the extent relating to the Acquired Assets, but specifically excluding any
Books and Records that are described in Section 1.4(a)(iv) or Section
1.4(a)(v); and

(l) all goodwill and going concern value to the extent primarily related to
the Business or any Acquired Asset.

any statute, charter document, bylaw, agreement, or otherwise), in each case
on account of matters that occurred prior to Closing;

(viii) any Environmental Claims or any Liabilities (under Environmental,
Health, and Safety Requirements, Environmental Permits), to the extent arising
out of or relating to facts, circumstances or conditions first existing on or
prior to the Closing or otherwise to the extent arising out of any actions or
omissions of Seller or any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired
Companies);

(ix) any Liability for amounts payable to Seller or any of its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies), except to the extent included as a current
liability in the final determination of the Working Capital Amount;

(x) any Liabilities for Debt; and

(xi) any agreements with any labor organizations, and any and all Liabilities
thereunder, except as expressly stated herein.

Seller agrees to pay, satisfy and discharge, and to cause each of its
Affiliates to pay, satisfy and discharge, all Retained Liabilities when due.

1.5 Purchase Price. The aggregate consideration to be paid for the Acquired
Assets and the Purchased Interests (the "Purchase Price") shall consist of (i)
the Cash Payment (subject to adjustment as provided in this Article 1), (ii)
the amount of the Assumed Liabilities and (iii) the Earnout Amount payable to
Seller in accordance with Section 1.9.

1.6 Estimated Cash Payment. Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the

the Seller's good faith estimate of the Acquired Company Closing Cash, the
Acquired Company Closing Debt, the Closing Debt-Like Items, the Working
Capital Amount, the Working Capital Surplus (if any) and the Working Capital
Deficit (if any) and, based on such estimated amounts, Seller's calculation of
the Cash Payment (the "Estimated Cash Payment") and (b) reasonable supporting
schedules prepared by Seller calculating the information set forth in such

1.7 Payments.

(a) Closing Payments. At the Closing, Buyer shall (i) pay (on behalf of
Seller) the amounts set forth in the Payoff Letters to the holders of Debt set
forth therein (which amounts shall be equal to the aggregate amount of
Acquired Company Closing Debt set forth in Seller's calculation of the
Estimated Cash Payment); (ii) pay (on behalf of Seller, from the Estimated
Cash Payment) the Transaction Expenses set forth in Seller's calculation of
the Estimated Cash Payment pursuant to the direction of Seller;; and (iii) pay

collectively, the "Closing Payments").

(b) Cash Payment Adjustment. Within five (5) Business Days after the Cash
Payment becomes final and binding in accordance with Section 1.8, (i) if the
Final Cash Payment exceeds the Estimated Cash Payment, then such excess shall
be paid by Buyer to Seller in cash; or (ii) if the Estimated Cash Payment
exceeds the Final Cash Payment, then such excess shall be paid by Seller to
Buyer in cash. The Parties shall treat, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to treat, any payment made pursuant to this Section 1.7(b) as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required
by Law.

(c) Earnout Amount. At Seller's option:

(i) the Earnout Amount shall be paid by Buyer to Seller in three (3) equal
annual installments, with the first installment (the "First Earnout Payment")
to be paid within ten (10) Business Days after the Earnout Amount becomes
final and binding in accordance with Section 1.11, the second installment (the
"Second Earnout Payment") to be paid on the one (1) year anniversary of the
date on which the Earnout Amount becomes final and binding in accordance with
Section 1.11; and the third installment (the "Third Earnout Payment") to be

binding in accordance with Section 1.11 if Seller provides written notice to
Buyer within thirty (30) days after the end of the Earnout Period that Seller
elects to receive such lump sum payment; provided, however, that the amount of
such lump sum payment shall be determined by discounting the Earnout Amount to
present value based on the three installment payments set forth in Section
1.7(c)(i) as of the end of the three (3) year anniversary of the Closing Date
using a fifteen percent (15%) discount rate.

(iii) In the event Seller timely provides an Earnout Objections Statement as
contemplated in Section 1.11, only the excess of the Earnout Amount claimed by
Seller in its Earnout Objections Statement over that reported in the Earnout
Report shall be deemed in dispute, and Buyer shall proceed to pay the
undisputed portion on the schedule specified above in this Section 1.7(c).

(d) Acceleration.

(i) If a Business Change of Control Acceleration Event occurs, the Earnout
Period will end; the Earnout Amount shall be deemed to equal fifteen percent
(15%) of the equity value of the Business; and Buyer shall pay to Seller such
Earnout Amount within ten (10) Business Days after the occurrence of such
Business Change of Control Acceleration Event.

(ii) If a Buyer Change of Control Acceleration Event occurs, the Earnout
Period will end; the Earnout Amount shall be deemed to equal the product of
(A) EBITDA generated by the Business during the trailing twelve month period
immediately prior to the occurrence of such Buyer Change of Control
Acceleration Event, (B) multiplied by ten (10), (C) multiplied by fifteen
percent (15%); and Buyer shall pay to Seller such Earnout Amount within ten
(10) Business Days after the occurrence of such Buyer Change of Control
Acceleration Event.

(iii) If a Bankruptcy Acceleration Event occurs, the Earnout Period will end;
the Earnout Amount shall be deemed to equal the product of (A) EBITDA

of such Bankruptcy Acceleration Event.

(iv) For purposes of this Agreement: (A) a "Business Change of Control
Acceleration Event" means the occurrence of the sale by Buyer or any Affiliate
of Buyer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Business or a
material portion of the assets of the Business outside the Ordinary Course of
Business (in each case, other than to an Affiliate of Buyer), whether through
a sale of assets, sale of stock, merger or otherwise; (B) a "Buyer Change of
Control Event" means a merger, consolidation, recapitalization or other
transaction in which any Person becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in
Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
as in effect on the date of this Agreement), directly or indirectly, of 50% or
more of the combined voting power of all interests in Buyer; and (C) a
"Bankruptcy Acceleration Event" means the occurrence of (1) Buyer (or any
Subsidiary of Buyer with a direct or indirect beneficial ownership interest in
the assets of the Business) makes an assignment for the benefit of its
creditors, (2) there is commenced by or against Buyer or any Subsidiary of
Buyer with a direct or indirect beneficial ownership interest in the assets of
the Business any Proceeding relating to Buyer or such Subsidiary under any
bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, readjustment of debt, receivership,
dissolution, or liquidation law or statute, of any jurisdiction, whether now
or subsequently in effect, and such Proceeding remains undismissed for a
period of sixty (60) days or Buyer or any such Subsidiary by any act indicates
its consent to, approval of, or acquiescence in, such Proceeding, or (3) a
receiver or trustee is appointed for Buyer or any such Subsidiary or for all
or substantially all of its property or assets, and the receivership or
trusteeship remains undischarged for a period of sixty (60) days.

(e) Payments. All payments to Seller pursuant to this Section 1.7 shall be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
by Seller in writing. All payments, if any, to Buyer pursuant to this Section
1.7 shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by Buyer in writing. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Buyer and its Affiliates shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amount otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as Buyer or any of its Affiliates is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of any such payment under the Code or
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Laws. Buyer shall notify Seller
if Buyer believes there is such a withholding requirement with respect to any
payment to be made by Buyer hereunder at least five (5) Business Days prior to
making such payment, and the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to minimize any such withholding. To the extent such amounts are so deducted
and withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax authority, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.

1.8 Cash Payment Determination.

(a) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to Seller a statement setting forth in reasonable detail Buyer's
calculation of the Acquired Company Closing Cash, Acquired Company Closing
Debt, the Closing Debt-Like Items, the Working Capital Amount, the Working
Capital Surplus (if any) and the Working Capital Deficit (if any) and, based
on such calculations, Buyer's calculation of the Cash Payment (such statement,
the "Closing Statement"), along with reasonable supporting detail used by
Buyer to compute the information set forth therein.

(b) For a period of forty-five (45) days after the delivery of the Closing
Statement, Buyer shall provide Seller and any accountants or advisors retained
by Seller with the reasonable opportunity, during normal business hours, upon
reasonable advance notice, to review (and copy) the relevant Books and Records
of the Business to the extent used by Buyer in the preparation of, or
otherwise reasonably relevant to, the Closing Statement, and to discuss such
Books and Records and the Closing Statement with the relevant personnel of
Buyer and its Affiliates, in each case to the extent reasonably necessary for,
and for the sole purpose of, Seller's review of the Closing Statement;
provided, that the independent accountants of Buyer shall not be obligated to
make any work papers available to Seller or its representatives unless and
until Seller or such representative has signed a customary agreement relating
to such access to work papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
such independent accountants. If Seller has any objections to the Closing
Statement, then Seller will deliver to Buyer a written statement (the
"Objections Statement") describing (i) which items on the Closing Statement
have not been prepared in accordance with this Agreement, (ii) the basis for
Seller's disagreement with the calculation of such items and (iii) Seller's
proposed dollar amount for each item in dispute, within forty-five (45) days
after delivery of the Closing Statement. If Seller notifies Buyer that it
accepts the contents of the Earnout Report or if Seller fails to deliver an
Objections Statement within such forty-five (45) day period, then the Closing
Statement shall be final, binding and non-appealable by the Parties and the
Cash Payment set forth therein shall be the Final Cash Payment. If Seller
delivers an Objections Statement within such forty-five (45) day period, then
Buyer and Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any such
disputes, but if a final resolution is not obtained within thirty (30) days
after Buyer has received the Objections Statement, any remaining items and
amounts set forth in the Objections Statement which remain in dispute will be
resolved by Deloitte LLP pursuant to the terms of a joint engagement by Buyer
and Seller, provided that if such accounting firm has a material relationship
with either Buyer or Seller or is otherwise unable or unwilling to serve in
the requested capacity and Buyer and Seller are unable to agree on the choice
of an alternative accounting firm, Buyer and Seller will select a nationally-
recognized U.S. accounting firm having no material relationship with either
Buyer or Seller by lot (after excluding their respective regular outside
accounting firms) (the engaged accountants, the "Accountants"). The
Accountants will prepare and deliver a written report to Buyer and Seller and
will submit a resolution of such unresolved disputes promptly, but in any
event within thirty (30) days after the dispute is submitted to the
Accountants. The Accountants shall act as an expert, not as an arbitrator, in
resolving the unresolved disputes, and the proceeding before the Accountants
shall be an expert determination under the Law governing expert determination
and appraisal proceedings. The Accountants' determination of such unresolved
disputes shall be based solely on written submissions by Buyer and Seller (and
not by independent review), and shall be final and binding upon all Parties;
provided, however, that no such determination shall be any more favorable to
Buyer than is set forth in the Closing Statement or any more favorable to
Seller than is proposed in the Objections Statement. The costs, expenses and
fees of the Accountants shall be borne by Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller,
on the other hand, in inverse proportion to the difference between the Final
Cash Payment (as determined by the Accountants) and the Cash Payment as
calculated by Buyer and Seller in the Closing Statement and Objections
Statement, respectively. The Closing Statement shall be revised as appropriate
to reflect the resolution of any objections thereto pursuant to this Section
1.8(b), and the Cash Payment set forth in the so-revised Closing Statement
shall be the Final Cash Payment. Any objection not specified in the Objections
Statement shall be deemed waived by Seller for purposes of determining the
Final Cash Payment and without limiting any other right of Seller under this
Agreement.

1.9 Calculation of Earnout Amount. Except as otherwise provided in Section
1.7(d), the Earnout Amount shall be equal to (a) the product of (i) EBITDA
generated by the Business during the Earnout Measurement Period, (ii)
multiplied by ten (10), (iii) multiplied by fifteen percent (15%) minus (b)
the Inventory Reserve Shortfall Amount, but in no event less than $0.



1.10 Earnout Covenants.

(a) Following the Closing and until the expiration of the Earnout Period,
Buyer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and other Affiliates and any
assignees or successors in interest of any of the foregoing to:

(i) maintain the existence of the Business separately within one or more
Subsidiaries of Buyer;

(ii) operate the Business and provide resources to the Business in a manner
that is reasonably consistent with the manner in which Buyer operates and
provides resources to Buyer's other businesses;

(iii) maintain separate Books and Records for the Business including to allow
for determination of EBITDA;

(iv) except as required to comply with applicable Law, operate the Business in
good faith and not take any action a primary purpose of which is to reduce or
impair the Earnout Amount or the achievement thereof;

(v) not cause the Business to enter into any Contract with Buyer or any
Affiliate of the Buyer that is not commercially reasonable or is otherwise
materially disadvantageous to the Business relative to the terms that would be
obtained at such time from an independent third party on arms'-length terms;

(vi) not impose any corporate overhead, surcharge or related expense on the
Business except as specifically set forth in Schedule 1.10(a)(vi);

(vii) provide, at least twice in each calendar year during the Earnout Period,
Seller and any accountants or advisors retained by Seller with reasonable
access, during normal business hours, upon reasonable advance notice, to the
relevant Books and Records of the Business to the extent reasonably necessary
to examine the financial books and records of the Business, to make such
inspections and copies of such Books and Records as they may reasonably
request, and to discuss such matters with the relevant personnel of Buyer and
its Affiliates responsible for the preparation of such financial books and
records; provided, that the independent accountants of Buyer and its
Affiliates shall not be obligated to make any work papers available to Seller
or its representatives unless and until Seller or such representative has
signed a customary agreement relating to such access to work papers in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to such independent accountants; provided,
further, that any such access shall be conducted at Seller's sole cost and
expense, in accordance with applicable Law (including applicable Law relating
to employment or privacy issues), under supervision of Buyer's or its
Affiliates personnel and in such a manner as to maintain confidentiality and
not to unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the Business.



(b) Until the expiration of the Earnout Period, Seller and Buyer will conduct
quarterly full-day meetings, at mutually agreeable times and locations,
between the Chief Executive Officer of Buyer, the Chief Financial Officer of
Buyer, the senior leadership team of the Business and appropriate senior level
personnel of Seller to discuss significant business issues with respect to the
Business and the financial results of the Business and reasonably in advance
of each meeting shall provide Buyer and its representatives customary
quarterly reporting packages.

(c) Buyer shall deliver to Seller, within forty-five (45) days after the end
of each Quarter, a financial report setting forth Buyer's calculation of
EBITDA for such Quarter in reasonable detail, and Buyer agrees to provide as
promptly as reasonably practicable such reasonable supporting documentation as
Seller may reasonably request in connection therewith. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Quarter" means each three (3)-month period beginning on the first
calendar day of the first calendar month beginning after the Closing Date and
ending (and including) the third (3rd) three-month period during the Earnout
Period. In addition, no later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the end of
each calendar quarter during the Earnout Period, Buyer shall provide Seller
its internal financial reporting package with respect to the performance of
the Business during such quarter.

(d) With respect to each of the Post-Closing Interim Period, Year 1 and Year
2, Buyer shall engage an independent accounting firm having no material
relationship with either Buyer or Seller (which, for the avoidance of doubt,
shall exclude their respective regular outside accounting firms and the
Accountants) that is reasonably acceptable to Seller (the "Earnout Auditor")
to produce a special report concerning the financial statements of the
Business. Such special report will include (i) the financial statements of the
Business, (ii) a reconciliation of Net Income for the applicable period to the
EBITDA for such period, and (iii) the Inventory Reserve Shortfall Amount as of
the end of the applicable period, which such financial statements and related
financial information shall be prepared in accordance with the Earnout
Accounting Principles and the terms of this Agreement and shall be subject to
attestation procedures (as agreed upon by the Parties and the Earnout Auditor)
to be performed by the Earnout Auditor.

(e) With respect to the Earnout Measurement Period, Buyer shall engage the
Earnout Auditor to audit (i) the financial statements of the Business, (ii) a
reconciliation of Net Income for the applicable period to the EBITDA for such
period, and (iii) the Inventory Reserve Shortfall Amount as of the end of the
applicable period, which such financial statements and related financial
information shall be prepared in accordance with the Earnout Accounting
Principles and the terms of this Agreement (such audited financial statements
and other financial information, the "Post-Closing Business Financial
Statements," and the Post-Closing Business Financial Statements with respect
to the Earnout Measurement Period, the "Earnout Financial Statements"). Buyer
shall deliver such audited financial statements to Seller no later than one
hundred twenty (120) days following the end of each applicable period. Each of
Buyer and Seller shall bear fifty percent (50%) of the costs and expenses of
the Earnout Financial Statements, and no such costs or expenses of Buyer or
any of its Affiliates will be charged against the Net Income or EBITDA of the
Business.

1.11 Earnout Report. Within ninety (90) days after the end of the Earnout
Measurement Period, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a report (the
"Earnout Report") containing the Earnout Financial Statements and a reasonably
detailed calculation of the resulting Earnout Amount. For a period of ninety
(90) days after the delivery of the Earnout Report, Buyer shall provide Seller
and any accountants or advisors retained by Seller with the reasonable
opportunity, during normal business hours, upon reasonable advance notice, to
review (and copy) the relevant Books and Records of the Business to the extent
used by Buyer in the preparation of, or otherwise reasonably relevant to, the
Earnout Report, and to discuss such Books and Records and the Earnout Report
with the relevant personnel of Buyer and its Affiliates responsible for the
preparation of the Earnout Report, in each case, to the extent reasonably
necessary for, and for the sole purpose of, Seller's review of the Earnout
Report; provided, that the independent accountants of Buyer shall not be
obligated to make any work papers available to Seller or its representatives
unless and until Seller or such representative has signed a customary
agreement relating to such access to work papers in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to such independent accountants. If Seller has any
objections to the calculation of EBITDA during the Earnout Measurement Period,
as applicable, and the resulting Earnout Amount set forth in the Earnout
Report, then Seller will deliver to Buyer a written statement (the "Earnout
Objections Statement") describing its objections to Buyer within forty-five
(45) days after delivery of the Earnout Report. If Seller fails to deliver an
Earnout Objections Statement within such forty-five (45) day period, then the
calculation of EBITDA during the Earnout Period or the Earnout Measurement
Period, as applicable, the Inventory Reserve Shortfall Amount and the
resulting Earnout Amount set forth in the Earnout Report shall become final,
binding and non-appealable on all Parties and the Earnout Amount set forth
therein shall be the final Earnout Amount. If Seller delivers an Earnout
Objections Statement within such forty-five (45) day period, then Seller and
Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any such disputes,
but if a final resolution is not obtained within thirty (30) days after Buyer
has received the Earnout Objections Statement, any remaining items and amounts
set forth in the Earnout Objections Statement which remain in dispute will be
resolved by the Accountants pursuant to a joint engagement by Buyer and
Seller. The Accountants will prepare and deliver a written report to Buyer and
Seller and will submit a resolution of such unresolved disputes promptly, but
in any event within forty-five (45) days after the dispute is submitted to the
Accountants. The Accountants' determination of such unresolved disputes will
be final and binding upon all Parties. The Accountants shall act as an expert,
not as an arbitrator, in resolving the unresolved disputes, and the proceeding
before the Accountants shall be an expert determination under the Law
governing expert determination and appraisal proceedings. The Accountants'
determination of such unresolved disputes shall be based solely on the written
submissions by Buyer and Seller (and not by independent review), this
Agreement and the applicable defined terms set forth in this Agreement. The
Accountants' determination of such unresolved disputes shall be based solely
on written submissions by Buyer and Seller (and not by independent review),
this Agreement and the applicable defined terms set forth in this Agreement,
and shall be final and binding upon all Parties; provided, however, that no
such determination shall be any more favorable to Buyer than is set forth in
the Earnout Report or any more favorable to Seller than is proposed in the
Earnout Objections Statement. The costs, expenses and fees of the Accountants
shall be borne by Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, in
inverse proportion to the difference from the final Earnout Amount (as
determined by the Accountants) and the Earnout Amount as calculated by Buyer
and Seller in the Earnout Report and Earnout Objections Statement,
respectively. The Earnout Report shall be revised as appropriate to reflect
the resolution of any objections thereto pursuant to this Section 1.11, and
the Earnout Amount set forth in the so-revised Earnout Report shall be the
final Earnout Amount. Any objection not specified in the Earnout Objections
Statement shall be deemed waived by Seller for purposes of determining the
Earnout Amount and without limiting any other right of Seller under this
Agreement. Upon the Earnout Amount becoming final and binding in accordance
with this Section 1.11, Buyer shall pay such Earnout Amount to Seller in
accordance with Section 1.7(c).

1.12 Calculations.

(a) All calculations of Working Capital under this Agreement, whether
estimates or otherwise, shall be determined solely in accordance with the
methodologies and principles set forth on Schedule 1.12(a) (the "Working
Capital Accounting Principles").

(b) All calculations of Net Income and EBITDA under this Agreement, whether
estimates or otherwise, shall be determined solely in accordance with the
methodologies and principles set forth on Schedule 1.9 (the "Earnout
Accounting Principles").

1.13 Allocation of Purchase Price. Buyer and Seller shall attempt in good
faith to agree as to the allocation of the Purchase Price, as finally
determined, the liabilities of E-conolight as of the Closing and all other
relevant items treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as consideration
for the Allocation Assets (collectively, the "Allocable Consideration") among
the Acquired Assets, the assets of E-conolight as of the Closing and the
Purchased Interests of Cree Europe and Cree Canada (such assets, the
"Allocation Assets") in accordance with the principles of Section 1060 of the
Code. At the Closing, Seller shall provide to Buyer an allocation of the
Allocable Consideration (as estimated by Seller) among the Allocation Assets
(such allocation, the "Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation"). The
Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation shall be used to make the necessary
preliminary determinations for Transfer Tax purposes pursuant to Section
8.2(a). As soon as practicable after the Final Cash Payment has been finally
determined pursuant to Section 1.8, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer
an allocation of the Allocable Consideration (as calculated based on the Final
Cash Payment) among the Allocation Assets (the "Final Purchase Price
Allocation"). Buyer shall have thirty (30) days after delivery of the Final
Purchase Price Allocation by Seller to notify Seller in writing of any
disputes with the Final Purchase Price Allocation (any such notice, a
"Purchase Price Allocation Dispute Notice"; such thirty-day period, the
"Purchase Price Allocation Dispute Period"). If Buyer fails to deliver a
Purchase Price Allocation Dispute Notice within the Purchase Price Allocation
Dispute Period, Buyer and Seller shall prepare and file all Tax Returns in a
manner consistent with the Final Purchase Price Allocation, shall make the
necessary final determinations for Transfer Tax purposes pursuant to Section
8.2(a) in accordance with the Final Purchase Price Allocation, and shall not
take any position inconsistent with the Final Purchase Price Allocation or
agree to any proposed adjustment thereto by any taxing authority without first
giving the other party prior written notice of such proposed adjustment. If
Buyer delivers a Purchase Price Allocation Dispute Notice within the Purchase
Price Allocation Dispute Period, Seller and Buyer shall use reasonable efforts
to resolve in good faith all disputes set forth in such Purchase Price
Allocation Dispute Notice. If, within thirty (30) days after delivery by Buyer
of a Purchase Price Allocation Dispute Notice, Buyer and Seller agree as to
such allocation, Buyer and Seller further agree to prepare and file all Tax
Returns in a manner consistent with the agreed allocation and to make the
necessary final determinations for Transfer Tax purposes pursuant to Section
8.2(a) in accordance with such agreed allocation, and shall not take any
position inconsistent with the agreed allocation or agree to any proposed
adjustment thereto by any taxing authority without first giving the other
party prior written notice of such proposed adjustment. If, within thirty (30)
days after delivery by Buyer of a Purchase Price Allocation Dispute Notice,
Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve any disputes relating to the allocation
of the Purchase Price, Buyer and Seller may each use a different purchase
price allocation.

1.14 Nonassignable Assets.

(a) Nothing in this Agreement, nor the consummation of the Transactions, shall
be construed as an attempt or agreement to assign or transfer any Acquired
Asset (including any Contract) to Buyer which by its terms or by Law (i) is
nonassignable without consent, approval, waiver, authorization, notice or
novation by a Governmental Body or other Person, (ii) is otherwise prohibited
by Law or Contract or (iii) with respect to which any attempted assignment or
transfer would be ineffective or would materially and adversely affect the
rights of either the applicable Seller Entity or Buyer or its applicable
designee thereunder (each, a "Nonassignable Asset"), unless and until a
consent, approval, waiver, authorization, notice or novation reasonably
acceptable to Buyer shall have been obtained. Following the Closing, Buyer and
Seller shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, or to cause
their respective Affiliates to obtain, the consent, approval, waiver,
authorization, notice or novation of each such third party to the assignment
or transfer of the Nonassignable Assets to Buyer or its designated Affiliate
in all cases in which such consent, approval, waiver, authorization, notice or
novation is required for the valid and enforceable assignment or transfer
thereof to Buyer.

(b) Until such consent, approval, waiver, authorization, notice or novation
that is necessary for the effective assignment to Buyer of any Nonassignable
Asset is obtained, provided that the applicable Seller Entity can do so
without breaching the terms of such Nonassignable Asset, such Seller Entity
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Buyer, in all material
respects, with, and such Seller Entity shall hold in trust for the exclusive
benefit of Buyer or its designated Affiliates, all the economic (taking into
account all burdens to Seller and its Affiliates, including Tax costs),
operational and other benefits of such Nonassignable Asset, to the extent
permitted, as if such consent, approval, waiver, authorization, notice or
novation, as the case may be, had been obtained. Without limitation of and
subject to the foregoing, at Buyer's request, Seller shall, or shall cause its
applicable Affiliate to, (i) cooperate, in all reasonable respects, in any
lawful and commercially reasonable arrangement proposed by Buyer under which
Buyer and its Affiliates would obtain the economic, operational and other
benefits thereunder and assume the related economic, operational and other
burdens (including the amount of any related Tax costs imposed on Seller or
any of its Affiliates) thereunder; (ii) enforce, for the benefit of Buyer and
its Affiliates and as reasonably directed by Buyer, Seller's or its applicable
Affiliate's rights under such Nonassignable Asset; and (iii) permit Buyer or
its designated Affiliates to practice, exercise and enforce any rights arising
with respect thereto; in each case, as if such Nonassignable Asset (and the
Liabilities related thereto) had been sold, conveyed, assigned and delivered
to, and assumed by, Buyer or its applicable designee, including in the name of
Seller or its applicable Affiliate party to such Nonassignable Asset or
otherwise as Buyer shall specify, including the right to terminate in
accordance with the terms thereof; provided, however, that (A) Buyer hereby
agrees to promptly reimburse Seller for all related Taxes and reasonable
expenses incurred by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller in complying with
Buyer's requests described above, and to indemnify and hold harmless Seller
and its Affiliates to the full extent permitted by applicable Law from and
against any Liabilities arising from or in connection with Buyer practicing,
exercising or enforcing any rights or failing to perform any obligations
arising with respect to such Nonassignable Assets or otherwise in connection
with carrying out any instruction or direction provided by Buyer or its
Affiliates in connection with the activities contemplated in this Section
1.14; and (B) if Seller or such Seller Entity provides Buyer, in all material
respects, with, and Seller or such Seller Entity holds in trust for the
exclusive benefit of Buyer or its designated Affiliates, all the economic,
operational and other benefits of such Nonassignable Asset in accordance with
this Section 1.14, Buyer shall assume the related economic burden imposed on
Seller or its applicable Affiliate (including the amount of any related Tax
costs imposed on Seller or its applicable Affiliate) with respect to such
Nonassignable Asset and, from and after the Closing, Buyer shall, as agent or
subcontractor for Seller, or its applicable Affiliate pay, perform and
discharge fully as and when required the Liabilities of Seller or such
Affiliate of Seller with respect to such Nonassignable Asset. Seller or the
applicable Affiliate of Seller party to the rights of such Nonassignable Asset
will promptly pay to Buyer or its applicable designee all income, proceeds and
other monies received by such Seller or Affiliate from third parties to the
extent related to Buyer's or its Affiliates' intended rights under such
Nonassignable Asset as contemplated by this Section 1.14.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither Seller
nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to pay compensation to any third
party, commence or participate in any Proceeding or offer or grant any
accommodation (financial or otherwise, including any accommodation or
arrangement to remain secondarily liable or contingently liable for any
Assumed Liability) to any third party in connection with Seller's and its
Affiliates' obligations under this Section 1.14. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (i) at any time upon Buyer's request, Seller

any notice to, make any filing with, or obtain any Consent of any Governmental
Body in order to consummate the Transactions. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement have been duly
authorized by Buyer and each Buyer Subsidiary, as applicable.

2.3 Non-contravention. Neither the execution and the delivery of this

subject, (b) violate any provision of the Organizational Documents of Buyer or
any of its Subsidiaries or (c) conflict with, result in a breach of,

3.8 Financial Statements.

(a) Seller's Annual Report on Form 10-K with respect to the fiscal year ended
June 24, 2018 and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and six
months ended December 30, 2018, each as filed with the Securities Exchange
Commission, include true, complete and correct copies of the following
financial statements (collectively, the "Cree Financial Statements"): (i)
audited consolidated balance sheets, statements of income, shareholders'
equity and cash flows of Seller as of and for the fiscal years ended June 25,
2017 and June 24, 2018 (the "Most Recent Fiscal Year End"); and (ii) unaudited
consolidated balance sheets, statements of income, shareholders' equity and
cash flows (the "Cree Most Recent Financial Statements") as of and for the six
(6) month period ended December 30, 2018 (the "Most Recent Fiscal Quarter
End"). The Cree Financial Statements are correct and complete and consistent
with the books and records of Seller (which are in turn correct and complete),
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied, and present
fairly in all material respects in accordance with GAAP the financial
condition, results of operation, changes in equity and cash flow of Seller and
its Subsidiaries as of and for their respective dates and for the periods then
ending; provided, however, that the Cree Most Recent Financial Statements are
subject to normal, recurring year-end adjustments and lack notes (none of
which will be material individually or in the aggregate).

(b) Attached to Section 3.8(b) of the Disclosure Schedule are true, complete
and correct copies of the following financial statements (collectively, the
"Financial Statements"): (i) unaudited pro forma consolidated summary balance
sheets and consolidated summary statements of income of the Business as of and
for the fiscal years ended June 25, 2017 and June 24, 2018; and (ii) unaudited
pro forma consolidated summary balance sheets and consolidated summary
statements of income of the Business (the "Most Recent Financial Statements")
as of and for the six (6) month period ended December 30, 2018. The Financial
Statements were prepared in good faith and fairly present in all material
respects the financial condition and results of operations of the Business as
of such respective times and for such respective time periods referred to
therein. The Financial Statements are derived from the Books and Records that
were utilized for the preparation of the Cree Financial Statements. Seller
does not maintain separate financial statements of the Business. In certain
operational areas, the Business is dependent upon centralized functional
activities of Seller, the costs of which have not been allocated to the
Financial Statements. The Financial Statements are presented on a carve-out
basis and may differ materially from financial statements presented in
accordance with GAAP, in that they do not include all year-end adjustments,
audit adjustments, carve-out adjustments, or footnote disclosures and other
presentation items required for the presentation of financial statement in
conformity with GAAP.

(c) Seller has provided to Buyer certain forecasted financial information
regarding the Business as set forth in Section 3.8(c) of the Disclosure
Schedule (the "Financial Projections"). The Financial Projections (i) were
prepared in good faith and based on assumptions believed by Seller's
management to be reasonable at the time and (ii) to the Knowledge of Seller,
fairly present, in summary fashion, Seller's forecasts with respect to the
specific financial metrics set forth in the Financial Projections as of and
for the periods as set forth therein, it being acknowledged and agreed by
Buyer that projections as to future events are not to be viewed as facts and
that actual results may differ materially from projected results.

(d) The books of account and other financial records of each of Seller and
each other Seller Entity (in each case to the extent related to the Business)
and each Acquired Company have been maintained in accordance with sound
business practices. Each of Seller and each other Seller Entity (in each case
to the extent related to the Business) and each Acquired Company maintains
materially accurate books of account and other financial records reflecting
its assets and liabilities and maintains a system of internal control over
financial reporting that is designed to provide reasonable assurance (i) that
transactions are executed with management's authorization; (ii) that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial
statements of the Business and to maintain accountability for the assets of
the Business; and (iii) regarding unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
of assets of the Business that could have a material effect on the Financial
Statements.

(e) Since the Most Recent Fiscal Year End, the Business has been conducted in
all material respects in the Ordinary Course of Business, and there has not
been any Material Adverse Effect. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, except as set forth on Section 3.8(e) of the Disclosure Schedule,
since the Most Recent Fiscal Year End no Seller Entity, with respect to the
Business, or Acquired Company has:

(i) sold, leased, transferred or assigned any assets or property (tangible or
intangible) with a value in excess of $[****] (individually or in the
aggregate) other than sales of inventory in the Ordinary Course of Business;

(ii) acquired, by merger, consolidation or otherwise, any business, line of
business or equity interests of, any Person or division thereof, in each case,

3.11 Tax Matters. The representations and warranties set forth in this Section
3.11, the last sentence of Section 3.8(e) and Section 3.12(c) constitute the
sole and exclusive representations and warranties by Seller with respect to
Taxes, and no other representation or warranty of Seller set forth in this

of, or any limitations on, any Tax asset or attribute of the Acquired
Companies, including net operating losses, (each, a "Tax Attribute"), or the
ability of Buyer or any of its Affiliates to utilize such Tax Attributes after
the Closing. Except as otherwise set forth on Section 3.11 of the Disclosure
Schedule:

(a) Each Seller Entity and Acquired Company has filed with the appropriate
taxing authorities all income and other material Tax Returns (in the case of a
Seller Entity, limited to Tax Returns with respect to the Business) that it
was required to file. All such Tax Returns are correct and complete in all
material respects. All Taxes that are due and owing by each Seller Entity and
Acquired Company (in the case of a Seller Entity, limited to Taxes with
respect to the Business) (whether or not shown on a Tax Return) have been
paid. No Seller Entity or Acquired Company has waived any statute of
limitations regarding Taxes (in the case of a Seller Entity, limited to Taxes
with respect to the Business) or agreed to any extension of time regarding the
payment of any Tax (in the case of a Seller Entity, limited to any Tax with
respect to the Business). There are no Liens for Taxes (other than Taxes not

Company. Adequate reserves and accruals have been established to provide for
the payment of all Taxes which are not yet due and payable by the Acquired
Companies.

(c) All Taxes that are required to be withheld by each Seller Entity (in each
case, limited to Taxes with respect to the Business) or Acquired Company have
been withheld and, to the extent required, properly paid or deposited. No
claim has been made by any taxing authority in a jurisdiction where a Seller
Entity or Acquired Company does not file Tax Returns that such Seller Entity
or Acquired Company is or may be, by reason of the Business in the case of a
Seller Entity, subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. No Seller Entity or
Acquired Company is a party to any Tax allocation, sharing or indemnity
agreement, and no Seller Entity or Acquired Company is liable for the Taxes of
any other Person as a transferee or successor, by Contract or otherwise (in
each case, to the extent relating to the Business in the case of a Seller
Entity).

Treasury Regulation §301.7701-3(b)(1)(ii).

(f) No Acquired Company has distributed stock or equity interests of another
Person, or has had its stock or equity interests distributed by another

Ordinary Course of Business. The foregoing representations and warranties in

owned or available for use by Buyer immediately subsequent to the Closing on
identical terms and conditions as owned or used by the Seller Entities or the
Acquired Companies immediately prior to the Closing in all material respects.
The consummation of the Transactions will not adversely affect the validity or
enforceability of the Company Intellectual Property under applicable Law and
will not result in the loss of use of, or the loss of the right to, any
Company Intellectual Property.

(g) Each Seller Entity and Acquired Company owns and possesses or has the
right to use pursuant to a valid and enforceable written Contract, all
Software used by such Seller Entity in the operation of the Business or such
Acquired Company.

Property owned by the Seller Entities or the Acquired Companies, or any
Existing Business Products, have done so pursuant to a valid and enforceable
agreement that protects the confidential information of the Seller Entities
and the Acquired Companies and assigns or grants the Seller Entities and the
Acquired Companies (and, in the case of Cree Canada, waives any moral rights)
exclusive ownership of the Person's contribution, development or conception,
or in cases where no such agreement exists, the Seller Entities or the
Acquired Companies exclusively own such Person's contribution, development or
conception by operation of law. To the Knowledge of Seller, no third party has
any claim to any right, title or interest in any Assigned Intellectual
Property owned by the Seller Entities or the Acquired Companies that is
inconsistent with the assignment to the applicable Seller Entities or Acquired
Companies described in this Section 3.13(i).

(j) Except as set forth on Section 3.13(j) of the Disclosure Schedule, no
Seller Entity or Acquired Company is a party to or otherwise bound by any
settlement or consent agreement, covenant not to sue, non-assertion assurance,
release or other similar agreement that could reasonably be expected,

Seller Entity's or Acquired Company's rights to own, use, make, transfer,
encumber, assign, license, distribute, convey, sell, enforce or otherwise
exploit any Assigned Intellectual Property that is included in the Acquired
Assets or is owned by any Acquired Company. No Seller Entity or Acquired

Intellectual Property (including any elements of any Existing Business
Products) for any third party (including any customer or end user).

(k) Each Seller Entity and Acquired Company has taken reasonable steps to

warranty claims, contractual terminations or requests for settlement or refund
due to the failure of the Existing Business Products to meet the requirements
set forth in applicable contractual commitments and express and implied
warranties in an amount that is in excess of the reserve for warranty claims
set forth on the face of the Most Recent Balance Sheet (rather than in any
notes thereto) as adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date in
accordance with the past custom and practice of Seller. No Existing Business
Product sold, leased, or delivered by any Seller Entity or any Acquired
Company is subject to any material guaranty, warranty, or other indemnity,
except as set forth in Section 3.22(a) of the Disclosure Schedule and except
for any guaranty, warranty or other indemnity that is imposed by Law or the
applicable standard terms and conditions of sale of the Business as in effect
at the time of sale. Subject to the Assumed Warranty Liability, each Existing
Business Product manufactured, sold, leased or delivered since January 1, 2017
is and has been manufactured, sold, leased or delivered in conformity in all
material respects with all applicable product specifications and documents,
requirements set forth in applicable contractual commitments, express and
implied warranties and all applicable standards for quality and workmanship
prescribed by Law.

(b) Except as set forth on Section 3.22(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, no
Existing Business Products currently sold or that have previously been sold
since January 1, 2017 contain (or contained) any defects that have not been
remedied that create any material hazard or safety risk. Except as set forth
on Section 3.22(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, there is no presently pending
or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened, and, to the Knowledge of Seller,
there is no reasonable basis for, any Proceeding or demand letter, and there
is no pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, expected recall or similar
action, or any post-sale warning, relating to any material hazard or material
defect in design, manufacture, materials or workmanship, including any failure
to warn or breach of express or implied warranty or representation, relating
to any of the Existing Business Products currently sold or that have
previously been sold by Seller or any of its Affiliates since January 1, 2017,
nor have Seller or any of its Affiliates been subject to any such Proceeding,
demand letter, recall or similar action, or post-sale warning since January 1,
2017.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
representations and warranties set forth in this Section 3.22 are the sole and
exclusive representations and warranties made by Seller with respect to any
warranties pertaining to the Existing Business Products.

any applicable Commodity Jurisdiction determinations issued by the DDTC; and

classification. Neither the Business nor any Acquired Company has or is
developing any products, Software or technology subject to the ITAR except as
set forth on Section 3.23(c) of the Disclosure Schedule.

3.24 Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery Laws. Since January 1, 2017, none of
Seller or any other Seller Entity (in each case with respect to the Business),
any Acquired Company or, to the Knowledge of Seller, any director, officer,

any Acquired Company or any of their respective Affiliates (in each case, with
respect to the Business in the case of a Seller Entity or Affiliate thereof
that is not an Acquired Company) has, directly or indirectly, in violation of
any Law, (i) made, offered or promised to make or offer any payment, loan or
transfer of anything of value, including any reward, advantage or benefit of
any kind, to or for the benefit of any Governmental Official, candidate for
public office, political party or political campaign, for the purpose of: (A)

management level employees to be adequate to detect any of the foregoing under
current circumstances.

(unless a higher standard is set forth herein) to take all actions and to do
all things necessary, proper, or advisable in order to consummate and make
effective the Transactions (including satisfaction, but not waiver, of the
closing conditions set forth in Article 6 below). In connection therewith,
each Party agrees to comply, and to cause its applicable Affiliates to comply,
with its respective pre-Closing commitments, obligations and covenants under
this Agreement.

authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation
of the Transactions, and (ii) as promptly as practicable, and in any event no
later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the date hereof, make all

with each other in connection with the making of all such filings, and each
Party will (and, if applicable, will cause its appropriate Affiliates to) use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the expiration of the waiting
period required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act (including pursuing early
termination of such waiting period); provided, further, that nothing in this
Section 4.2(a) shall require either Party or any of its respective Affiliates
to (1) agree to sell, divest, license, dispose of or hold separate any assets
or businesses, or otherwise take or commit to take any action that could limit

promptly furnish to each other all information reasonably required for any
application or other filing to be made by the other in connection with the
Transactions pursuant and subject to the rules and regulations of any
applicable Law. Except as required or permitted by this Agreement, the Parties
shall not knowingly take any action, or knowingly refrain from taking any
action, the effect of which would be to delay or impede the ability of the
Parties to consummate the Transactions. The filing fees under the Hart-Scott-
Rodino Act and any applicable non-U.S. competition Laws shall be borne by
Buyer.

(b) Subject to applicable Law and the requirements of applicable Governmental

Proceeding by a private person, in each case with respect to the Transactions,
(iii) promptly inform each other of any material communication (or any other
material correspondence or memoranda) received from, or given to, the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the FTC or any other
applicable Governmental Body and (iv) where legally permissible, promptly
furnish each other with copies of all correspondence, filings and written
communications between them or their Subsidiaries or Affiliates, on the one
hand, and any Governmental Body or its respective staff, on the other hand,
with respect to the Transactions. Subject to applicable Law and the
requirements of applicable Governmental Bodies, Seller and Buyer shall (with
respect to any in-person discussion or meeting), and shall to the extent
practicable (with respect to any telephonic discussion or meeting), provide
the other Party and its counsel with advance notice of and the opportunity to
participate in any material discussion or meeting with any Governmental Body
in respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry in connection with
the Transactions. In the event of any dispute between the Parties relating to
the strategy or appropriate course of action or content of any submission made
in connection with obtaining any clearances under applicable completion Laws
with respect to the Transactions, Buyer shall, following consultation with
Seller and after giving due consideration to Seller's views, have the right to
make, in good faith, the final determination with respect to such matter.
Buyer and Seller may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably
designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under
this Section as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material."

(c) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, the Seller Entities and
Acquired Companies will solicit the Consents and Permits set forth on Schedule
4.2(c). At the expense of the Seller Entities, the Seller Entities and the
Acquired Companies will use commercially reasonable efforts, and Buyer will
cooperate in all reasonable respects with the Seller Entities and the Acquired
Companies, as applicable, to obtain prior to the Closing all such Consents and
Permits (provided that no Seller Entity or Acquired Company will be required
to pay any consideration to any third party any connection with obtaining such
Consents and Permits and provided further that the failure obtain any such
Consents or Permits in and of itself shall not constitute a breach of this
Section 4.2(c)).

to (a) permit Buyer and its Debt Financing Sources and their representatives
to have, upon reasonable advance notice, to Seller, reasonable access during
normal business hours to all key personnel, books, properties, records,
Contracts, documents and data of the Seller Entities (in each case to the
extent relating to the Business) and the Acquired Companies and (b) furnish
Buyer, its Debt Financing Sources, and their representatives with copies of
all such books, records, Tax Returns, Contracts, documents, data and
information as Buyer and any Debt Financing Source may reasonably request;
provided, however, that such investigations and inquiries by or on behalf of
Buyer and any Debt Financing Source do not unreasonably interfere with normal
operations or customer or employee relations and are conducted under the
supervision of Seller personnel. Until the Closing Date, Seller will also
deliver to Buyer within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar
quarter a copy of the interim, quarterly financial reporting package for such
quarter prepared in a manner and containing information consistent with
Seller's practices with respect to the Financial Statements and Cree Financial
Statements. No information provided to or obtained by Buyer shall affect any
representation or warranty in this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, neither Seller nor any Affiliate of Seller shall
be required to disclose any information to Buyer, its Debt Financing Sources
or its and their respective representatives if such disclosure would, or would
reasonably be expected to, in each case in Seller's sole discretion: (x) cause
significant competitive harm to Seller, its Affiliates or their respective
businesses (including the Business) if the Transactions are not consummated;
(y) jeopardize any attorney-client or other privilege; or (z) contravene any
applicable Law or fiduciary duty; provided, however, in each case that Seller
shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, use its commercially
reasonable efforts to enable such information to be disclosed, furnished or
made available to Buyer, if and as applicable, so that the Buyer and the Debt
Financing Sources and its and their respective representatives may have access
to such information without causing significant competitive harm, so
jeopardizing privilege or contravening such applicable Law or fiduciary duty,
including by entering into a customary joint defense agreement or common
interest agreement with Buyer. Prior to the Closing, without the prior written
consent of Seller, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, Buyer shall not contact any suppliers to, or customers of, the Seller
or its Affiliates and Buyer shall have no right to perform invasive or further
investigations of the Real Property. Buyer shall, and shall cause its Debt
Financing Sources and its and their respective representatives to, abide by
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement with respect to any access or
information provided pursuant to this Section 4.4 or otherwise.

4.5 Notice of Developments. If Seller becomes aware prior to Closing of any
event, fact or condition or nonoccurrence of any event, fact or condition that
would or will constitute a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of Seller herein, then Seller shall have the right (but not the
obligation) to supplement the information contained in the Disclosure Schedule
with respect to such matter, which, if known at the date of this Agreement,
would have been required to be set forth or described in the Disclosure
Schedule. Neither the supplementation of the Disclosure Schedule pursuant to
this Section 4.5 nor any disclosure after the date hereof of the untruth of
any representation or warranty made in this Agreement shall operate as a cure
of the failure to disclose the information, or a cure of the breach of any
representation or warranty made herein; and determination of any Liability for
breach of representations or warranties either at signing or at Closing shall
be made without reference to any supplements and with reference only to the
Disclosure Schedule as it stands on the date of this Agreement; provided,
however, that if Buyer has the right to terminate this Agreement as a result
of any matter set forth in such schedule supplement and Buyer does not
exercise its right to terminate this Agreement within thirty (30) days of its
receipt of such schedule supplement, then Buyer shall be deemed to have
irrevocably waived any right to terminate this Agreement with respect to such
supplement or any matter disclosed therein; provided, further, that no notice
or supplement pursuant to this Section 4.5 shall limit the Buyer Indemnitees'
right to indemnification under Article 7 or, except as expressly set forth in
this Section 4.5, limit or otherwise waive or affect any other remedies
available to Buyer hereunder, in each case with respect to any matter
disclosed pursuant to this Section 4.5).

4.6 Exclusivity. Seller agrees that it will not, and will cause each of its
Affiliates and each of Seller's and its Affiliates' respective directors,
officers, managers, members, employees, agents, consultants, advisors or other
representatives, including legal counsel, accountants and financial advisors,
not to, directly or indirectly (a) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage
any inquiry, proposal or offer (written or oral) (other than from Buyer or its
Affiliates), to acquire, directly or indirectly, the Business or the Acquired
Companies or any material portion of the assets used in the Business, whether
by merger, consolidation, refinancing, recapitalization, business combination,
share exchange, purchase or issuance of equity securities, purchase of assets,
tender offer or otherwise, other than (i) sales of products of the Business in
the Ordinary Course of Business or (ii) in any transaction involving Seller as
a whole, any equity interest in Seller as a whole, or all or substantially all
of Seller's assets (in each case, an "Acquisition Proposal"), or (b)
participate in any discussion or negotiation regarding, or furnish any
information with respect to, or assist or facilitate in any manner, any
Acquisition Proposal or any attempt to make an Acquisition Proposal. Seller
shall immediately cease, and cause to be terminated, any and all contacts,
discussions and negotiations with third parties regarding any of the
foregoing, and Seller will notify Buyer immediately if any Person makes any
proposal, offer, inquiry or contact related to an Acquisition Proposal and
provide Buyer with the details thereof (including the Person making such
offer, inquiry or contact and a copy of all written communication in
connection therewith) and their response thereto.

4.7 Real Property.

(a) From and after the date hereof through the Closing Date, Seller shall, and
shall cause any applicable other Seller Entity or Acquired Company to,
maintain the Real Property in substantially the same or better condition as
existed on the date of this Agreement, except as otherwise required or
contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, ordinary wear and
tear excepted, and shall not demolish, alter or remove any of the existing
Improvements or erect new Improvements on the Real Property or any portion
thereof, without the prior written consent of Buyer.

(b) Seller shall, and shall cause any applicable other Seller Entity or
Acquired Company, to use commercially reasonable efforts (which such efforts
shall not, for the avoidance of doubt, include the obligation to pay any money
or other consideration) to obtain: (i) landlord estoppels and waivers or
collateral access agreements for each parcel of Leased Real Property and (ii)
non-disturbance and subordination agreements, each in form and substance
satisfactory to Buyer, from each lender with a security interest in the Leased
Real Property.

4.8 Financing.

(a) Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or
advisable to arrange the Debt Financing as promptly as practicable following
the date hereof and to consummate the Debt Financing on the Closing Date. Such
actions shall include commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) maintain in
effect the Debt Commitment Letters; (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all
Financing Conditions; (iii) negotiate, execute and deliver definitive
agreements and other documentation ("Debt Financing Documents") that reflect
the terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letters; and (iv) in the event that
the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and the Financing Conditions have been
satisfied or, upon funding would be satisfied, cause the financing providers
to fund the Debt Financing in an amount sufficient, together with available
cash, to consummate the Transactions. Buyer shall give the Company prompt
notice of any breach, repudiation, or threatened or anticipated breach or
repudiation, by any party to a Debt Commitment Letter of which Buyer or its
Affiliates becomes aware. Without limiting Buyer's other obligations under
this Section 4.8(a), if a Financing Failure Event occurs Buyer shall (x)
promptly notify Seller of such Financing Failure Event and the reasons
therefor, (y) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain alternative
financing, in an amount sufficient, together with available cash, to
consummate the Transactions, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event, and (z) use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain, and when obtained, provide Seller with a copy of, a new financing
commitment, subject only to financing conditions substantially comparable to
the Financing Conditions, that provides for such alternative financing.
Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall amend, modify, supplement,
restate, assign, substitute or replace a Debt Commitment Letter or any Debt
Financing Document except for (a) substitutions and replacements pursuant to
the immediately preceding sentence or (b) if such amendment, modification,
supplement, restatement, assignment, substitution or replacement is not
reasonably likely to (x) impair or materially delay the funding of the Debt
Financing or (y) impair or materially delay the Closing. Upon any such
amendment, supplement, modification or replacement of a Debt Commitment Letter
or Debt Financing Document in accordance with this Section 4.8(a), the term
"Debt Commitment Letter" shall include such "Debt Commitment Letter" as so
amended, supplemented, modified or replaced. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, in no event shall "commercially reasonable efforts" of Buyer
under this Section 4.8 be deemed or construed to require Buyer to instigate or
pursue litigation against any of the Debt Financing Sources. For purposes of
this Agreement, a "Financing Failure Event" shall mean any of the following:
(A) the commitments with respect to all or any portion of the Debt Financing
necessary to consummate the Transactions expiring or being terminated, (B) for
any reason, all or any portion of the Debt Financing necessary to consummate
the Transactions becoming unavailable, or (C) a material breach or
repudiation, by any party to a Debt Commitment Letter (in each case, other
than as a result of a breach by the Seller of this Agreement which prevents or
renders impracticable the consummation of the Debt Financing).

(b) From the date hereof through the Closing Date, Seller shall provide such
customary cooperation in connection with obtaining the Debt Financing as may
be reasonably requested by Buyer. Such obligation to cooperate with Buyer in
connection with obtaining the Debt Financing shall include (i) making
appropriate personnel available, upon reasonable advance notice at mutually
agreeable times, for participation in a reasonable number of meetings,
presentations,



due diligence sessions, rating agency sessions and sessions with potential
lenders or investors, including the Debt Financing Sources, (ii) furnishing
Buyer and its Affiliates and potential lenders or investors all financial and
other pertinent information regarding the Business and Acquired Companies as
may be reasonably requested by Buyer and that is customarily needed for
financings of the type contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters, including
the Financial Statements and the information required by Section 4.4, (iii)
providing information reasonably requested by Buyer for inclusion in
reasonable and customary bank information memoranda, prospectuses, offering
documents and customary marketing materials for any portion of the Debt

Debt Financing Sources in connection with the syndication and arranging of the

its Affiliates shall be required to (1) enter into any agreement that is not
contingent upon the Closing or would be effective prior to the Closing, or (2)
take any action that would encumber any assets of the Business prior to the
Closing or would encumber any assets of Seller or any of its

(a) Schedule 4.9(a) lists all of the Shared Contracts primarily related to the
Business, which Schedule may be supplemented by Buyer and Seller from time to
time by mutual agreement. Seller shall (and shall cause each other Seller
Entity to) use its commercially reasonable efforts to (A) cause the
counterparty to any such Shared Contract to enter into a new Contract with
Buyer or another designee of Buyer, on terms substantially similar to those
contained in such Shared Contract, including with respect to pricing, in order
for the Business to receive the applicable benefits under such Shared Contract
(each such new contract, a "New Contract"), or (B) split the respective rights
and obligations under the Shared Contracts such that, effective at or prior to
the Closing, (i) Buyer or its designated Affiliate shall be the assigned
beneficiary of the rights under such Shared Contracts (the "Assumed Shared
Contracts") to the extent such rights relate to the Business, and shall be
responsible for the liabilities and obligations under the Assumed Shared
Contracts to the extent such liabilities and obligations relate to the
Business and are included in the Assumed Liabilities; and (ii) Seller (or its
applicable Affiliate) shall remain the beneficiary of the remaining rights
under the Assumed Shared Contracts, and shall remain responsible for the
remaining liabilities and obligations under the Assumed Shared Contracts (it
being understood that, for the avoidance of doubt, any and all such remaining
liabilities and obligations shall be Retained Liabilities).

(b) If the Parties are not able, with respect to any such Shared Contract, to
obtain a New Contract or to so assign such Shared Contract prior to the
Closing, then for a period of up to twelve (12) months following the Closing,
(i) the Seller Entities, Buyer and their respective Affiliates shall continue
to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such counterparty to enter
into a New Contract or assign to Buyer or another designee of Buyer the
benefits and obligations under such Shared Contract as they relate to the
Business, and (ii) until such time as a New Contract is executed or a Shared
Contract is so assigned, the Seller Entities and Buyer shall use and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to use commercially reasonable efforts to
secure an alternative arrangement reasonably satisfactory to the Parties under
which the Business would, in compliance with applicable Law, obtain the
benefits and bear the burdens associated with the applicable Shared Contract
such that the Business would be placed in a substantially similar position as
if a New Contract were executed.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither Seller
nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to pay compensation to any third
party, commence or participate in any Proceeding or offer or grant any
accommodation (financial or otherwise, including any accommodation or
arrangement to remain secondarily liable or contingently liable for any
Assumed Liability) to any third party in connection with Seller's obligations
under this Section 4.9.

4.10 Transition Matters. Promptly after the date hereof, and in any event
within five (5) Business Days thereafter, Seller and Buyer shall appoint a
transition team which transition team shall:

(a) cooperate in good faith to develop a plan for separating the Business from
the other businesses of the Seller Entities so as to minimize the adverse
impact of such separation on each Party's businesses; and

(b) review and, as may be mutually agreed, revise and update the schedules to
the Transition Services Agreement between the date hereof and the Closing,
with any such mutually agreed upon revised and updated schedules to replace
the corresponding schedules attached to the form of Transition Services
Agreement.

4.11 Separation of IT Systems and Data. As soon as practicable after the date
hereof, Seller shall, and shall cause the Seller Entities to, [****], in
compliance with applicable Law, separate logically and physically the Seller's
and Seller Entities' IT Systems from the IT Systems of the Business, in such a
manner that the IT Systems of the Business are not accessible to the non-
Affiliates of Buyer and the Seller's and Seller Entities' IT Systems are not
accessible to Buyer, except as and to the extent such access is necessary for
the provision or receipt of services pursuant to the Transition Services
Agreement or as otherwise set forth herein, and shall take all reasonable
precautions necessary to safeguard the confidentiality of any confidential
information (including all Personal Data) with respect to the Business, so
long as Seller or any Seller Entity has access to



such information, using the same confidentiality protections that Seller and
Seller Entities use for their own confidential information or Personal Data
(but in no event less than required by applicable Law).

4.12 Personal Data Pre-Closing. The Parties agree that the collection, use and
disclosure of Personal Data by the Parties in respect of Cree Canada and the
Transactions before the Closing is restricted to those purposes that relate to
the Transactions. In the event a Party collects, uses or discloses such
Personal Data before the Closing, such Party will protect such in respect of
the Transactions using security safeguards appropriate to its sensitivity. If
the Transactions do not close, the Party that has received such Personal Data
shall return it to the Party that disclosed it, or destroy it within a
reasonable time, as requested by the disclosing Party.

4.13 Environmental Compliance. Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take all actions set forth on Schedule 4.13.

4.14 Post-Closing Actions as to Intellectual Property Agreements. Seller shall

ARTICLE 5 

POST-CLOSING COVENANTS

The Parties agree as follows with respect to the period following the Closing.

5.1 Further Assurances.

(a) In case at any time after the Closing any further action is necessary to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each of the Parties will take such
further action (including the execution and delivery of such further
instruments and documents) and give such further written assurances as any
other Party reasonably may request in connection with consummating, evidencing
and otherwise effectuating the Transactions. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, in the event that Buyer, Seller or any of their respective
Affiliates becomes aware after the Closing of any Acquired Asset, Excluded
Asset, Assumed Liability or Retained Liability that was not assigned to or
retained by the applicable Party or its designated Affiliate at the Closing
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, each
Party shall, and shall cause its applicable Affiliates to, execute and deliver
all instruments and documents necessary in connection with (i) in the case of
any Acquired Asset owned by the Seller or any of its Affiliates, transferring
all right, title, and interest in and to such Acquired Asset to Buyer or its
designated Affiliate, (ii) in the case of an Acquired Asset owned by a third
party, granting to Buyer or its designated Affiliate a license or other right
to use such Acquired Asset (if permitted by the applicable Third Party) on
substantially equivalent terms (including with respect to costs and scope of
use) pursuant to which such Acquired Asset was used by the Business prior to
Closing, (iii) in the case of an Excluded Asset owned by the Seller or any of
its Affiliates, transferring all right, title, and interest in and to such
Excluded Asset to Seller or its designated Affiliate, (iv) in the case of an
Assumed Liability of the Seller or any of its Affiliates, transferring all
right, title and interest in and to such Assumed Liability to Buyer or its
designated Affiliate, or (v) in the case of an Retained Liability of the
Seller or any of its Affiliates, transferring all right, title and interest in
and to such Retained Liability to Seller or its designated Affiliate.

(b) Buyer acknowledges that the Books and Records related to the Business are
to a substantial degree commingled with Seller's other Books and Records and
are not efficiently separable. With respect to Books and Records included in
the Acquired Assets, and in addition to its related obligations above in
Section 5.1(a) and in Section 5.5, Seller will accomplish delivery by
delivering to Buyer (i) at Closing, all Books and Records physically located
at the Real Property as of the Closing Date, (ii) at Closing, all Books and
Records included in the Acquired Assets that are in the Dataroom, by delivery
of an electronic copy of the contents of the Dataroom, (iii) at or as soon as
practicable (but not more than five (5) Business Days) after Closing, all
Books and Records included in the Acquired Assets that are maintained by
Seller in electronic form on a segregated basis from Seller's other Books and
Records, and (iv) as soon as practicable thereafter and in any event within
one year (1) from the Closing Date, all other Books and Records included in
the Acquired Assets that are reasonably feasible for Seller to extract from
Seller's other Books and Records for delivery. Without limiting the foregoing,
Seller shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, for a period of five
(5) years after the Closing Date, provide copies of, and reasonable access to,
any other Books and Records included in the Acquired Assets as the Buyer may
request from time to time.

5.2 Litigation Support. In the event and for so long as any Party is actively
contesting or defending against any Proceeding in connection with (a) the
completion of the Transactions or (b) any fact, situation, circumstance,
status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident,
action, failure to act or transaction on or prior to the Closing Date
involving the Business, the Acquired Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, the
Parties will reasonably cooperate with such Party and its counsel in the
contest or defense, make reasonably available its representatives, including
(for so long as such individuals are employed by the Buyer or its Affiliates)
the Continuing Employees listed on Schedule 5.2, and provide such testimony
and reasonable access to its Books and Records as shall be necessary in
connection with the contest or defense, all at the sole cost and expense of
the contesting or defending Party (except to the extent the Parties are
adverse to each other in the Proceeding or the contesting or defending Party
is entitled to indemnification therefor under Article 7); provided, however,
that no Party shall be required to take any action under this Section 5.2 that
would unreasonably interfere with its business or operations; provided,
further that Seller shall coordinate with Buyer (for so long as such
individuals are employed by the Buyer or its Affiliates) prior to contacting
any Continuing Employees (with such contact to be coordinated with Buyer's
Chief Financial Officer or General Counsel), and Buyer shall coordinate with
Seller prior to contacting any employees of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller
(with such contact to be coordinated with Seller's General Counsel).

5.3 Confidentiality.

(a) The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force
and effect (and the obligations thereunder shall be binding upon Buyer and its
Affiliates and Seller and its Affiliates as if parties thereto) until the
Closing. Upon the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate and
be superseded by this Section 5.3 other than Buyer's obligations of, and
Seller's and its Affiliates' rights to, confidentiality thereunder to the
extent the Confidentiality Agreement imposes confidentiality obligations with
respect to information (i) regarding (A) businesses of Seller or its
Affiliates other than the Business, (B) the Excluded Assets, (C) the Retained
Liabilities or (ii) not related to the Acquired Assets, the Licensed
Intellectual Property, the Assumed Liabilities or the Business, as to which,
in each case, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are incorporated
herein by reference and shall survive the Closing. This Section 5.3 shall not
apply to information that is the subject of the Intellectual Property
Assignment and License Agreement. With respect to such information, the terms
of the Intellectual Property Assignment and License Agreement shall control.
If, for any reason, the Closing does not occur, the Confidentiality Agreement
shall otherwise remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

(b) For five (5) years following the Closing Date, Seller agrees to, and to
cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries' respective
officers, directors, employees and agents (collectively, the "Seller Group")
to, (i) maintain the confidentiality of, (ii) not use, and (iii) not divulge
to any Person, any confidential or proprietary information related to the
Business other than information that (A) was, is now, or becomes generally
available to the public or the industry (other than by a breach of this
Section 5.3), (B) was disclosed to Seller or any of its Affiliates by a third
party not known by Seller to be subject to any duty of confidentiality with
respect to such information, (C) was or is now used by Seller in connection
with Seller's other businesses (provided that Seller shall continue to use the
same efforts (if any) to maintain the confidentiality of such information as
it does as of the date of this Agreement), (D) is independently developed
following the Closing by Seller or its employees without the use of or
reference to any such information, (E) is financial information that is or
will be included within the financial statements of Seller or its Affiliates,
(F) is reasonably required in connection with the defense of litigation or
claims other than such litigation or claims between Seller and its Affiliates,
on the one hand, and Buyer and its Affiliates, on the other hand, provided
that Seller takes reasonable measures (including, as applicable, seeking a
protective order or confidential treatment of such information) to protect the
confidentiality of such information, (G) is permitted to be used, or the use
of such information is necessary, in connection with performing any
obligations under or as permitted by any of the Ancillary Agreements, (H) is
general knowledge, skills and experience in the unaided memories of the
employees and agents of Seller or its Affiliates or (I) relates solely to the
Excluded Assets or the Retained Liabilities (such information, to the extent
related to the Business, "Buyer Confidential Information"). If Seller or any
of its Affiliates shall be required by Law to divulge any Buyer Confidential
Information, Seller and its Affiliates, as applicable, shall provide Buyer
with prompt written notice of each request so that Buyer may seek an
appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy, and Seller and its
Affiliates shall cooperate with Buyer to obtain a protective order or other
remedy to maintain the confidentiality of such information; provided, that, in
the event that a protective order or other remedy is not obtained, Seller and
its Affiliates shall furnish only that portion of such information which, upon
the written advice of its outside counsel, Seller and its Affiliates are
legally compelled to disclose and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded any
such information so disclosed.

5.4 Transition.

(a) During the Earnout Period, Seller shall, and shall cause each other Seller
Entity to, use commercially reasonable efforts to refer to Buyer all customer,
supplier, employee or other inquiries or correspondence relating to the
Business, the Existing Business Products and the Acquired Assets after the
Closing Date.

(b) Seller shall, and shall cause each other Seller Entity to, promptly remit
to Buyer all payments and invoices received after the Closing Date to the
extent related to the Existing Business Products or the Acquired Assets or the
Assumed Liabilities, and Buyer shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to)
promptly remit to Seller all payments and invoices received after the Closing
Date to the extent related to the Excluded Assets or the Retained Liabilities.
From and after the Closing, Buyer shall have the right and authority to
collect for its own account all items that are included in the Acquired Assets
and to endorse with the names of the applicable Seller Entity any checks or
drafts received with respect to any such items.

(c) Promptly, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days following the
Closing, Buyer shall cause each Acquired Company with an organizational name
that includes the Cree Name to change its organizational name so that it no
longer reflects the Cree Name and to cease all usage of the Cree Name, other
than historical references and, to the extent existing as of the Closing,
usage of the Cree Name on buildings, facilities, signage, machinery, other
equipment and products until such time as such usage may be removed or
replaced in the Ordinary Course of Business, but in any event not later than
sixty (60) days after the Closing Date. Except as permitted by the immediately
preceding sentence and as permitted by the Intellectual Property Assignment
and License Agreement, following the Closing Buyer shall not, and shall cause
its Affiliates not to, use the Cree Name or any names or symbols that are
deviations thereof or likely to be confusingly similar thereto in any manner
anywhere in the world.

5.5 Access to Books and Records. Seller recognizes that certain historical and
other information to be retained by Seller and the Seller Entities may be
needed by Buyer and its Affiliates in connection with the operation of the
Business after Closing (including for litigation, threatened litigation, Tax
and financial audits and other similar purposes). Following the Closing,
Seller shall (and shall cause each other Seller Entity to) grant to Buyer and
its representatives access and assistance with respect to (subject to any
reasonable privilege or confidentiality considerations), during normal
business hours and under reasonable circumstances, and the right to make
copies of, any Books and Records related to the Business, the Acquired
Companies, the Acquired Assets or the Assumed Liabilities which have been
retained by such Seller Entity as may be necessary or useful in connection
with the conduct of the Business. If within five (5) years after the Closing,
a Seller Entity or any of its Affiliates elects to dispose of any such
records, such Seller Entity or applicable Affiliate shall first give Buyer
sixty (60) days' prior written notice, during which period Buyer shall have
the right to obtain such records without further consideration. Following the
Closing, Buyer shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to) grant to Seller and
its representatives access and assistance with respect to (subject to any
reasonable privilege or confidentiality considerations), during normal
business hours and under reasonable circumstances, and the right to make
copies of, any Books and Records related to the Business, the Acquired
Companies, the Acquired Assets or the Assumed Liabilities in the possession of
Buyer and its Affiliates to the extent such records are reasonably necessary
for Seller to prepare and file its Tax Returns, defend Tax audits, defend
against third party claims, or provide or disclose information in response to
a requirement or request of any Governmental Body or securities exchange or
market or for any other reasonable purpose. If within five (5) years after the
Closing, Buyer or any of its Affiliates elects to dispose of any such records,
Buyer or its applicable Affiliate shall first give Seller sixty (60) days'
prior written notice, during which period Seller shall have the right to
obtain such records without further consideration.

5.6 Insurance. In the event that the Closing occurs and there shall exist or
occur prior to the Closing Date any claims, acts, omissions, events or
circumstances relating to the Business that give rise to Liabilities that
constitute Assumed Liabilities and for which any Seller Entity may reasonably
be entitled to coverage under its insurance policies and Buyer is not entitled
to a substantially similar level of coverage under its insurance policies (the
"Pre-Closing Occurrences"), (a) Buyer shall promptly give notice to Seller,
and (b) at Buyer's request, Seller and its Affiliates shall (i) use
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly report any and all Pre-Closing
Occurrences and collect any amounts payable under any relevant insurance
policies in connection therewith and (ii) remit such amounts, if any
(calculated net of any deductibles and collection costs incurred in collecting
such recovery), to Buyer promptly following receipt thereof. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.6 will (A) obligate Seller or any of
its Affiliates to maintain any insurance policy in effect for any period of
time following the Closing or (B) restrict Seller or any of its Affiliates
from amending any insurance policy for any period of time following the
Closing.

5.7 Collection of Receivables. As reasonably requested by Buyer, after the
Closing the Seller Entities will use commercially reasonable efforts to assist
Buyer in the collection of all Accounts Receivable in accordance with the
Transition Services Agreement. To the extent permitted by applicable Law,
Buyer and its representatives will be entitled to reasonable access to all
relevant documents, books, records, work papers and other information of the
Seller Entities that Buyer and its representatives reasonably request to
process and collect upon the Accounts Receivable. In furtherance of Section
1.2(a), after the Closing the Seller will (and will cause each of its
Affiliates to) promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days after
receipt) remit to Buyer all payments relating to the Business that Seller or
its Affiliates receive in respect of or relating to Accounts Receivable or
other Acquired Assets or which should have otherwise been sent to Buyer.

5.8 Non-Competition and Non-Solicit.

(a) For a period of five (5) years following the Closing, Seller shall not,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to not, directly or indirectly, own
an interest in, invest in, engage in or otherwise conduct the Business, in
each case, anywhere in the world. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the
following shall be a breach of this Section 5.8(a): (i)(A) any acquisition of
Seller or any of its Affiliates pursuant to a merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination or other similar transaction; (B) the
acquisition by any Person of some, a majority or all of Seller's or any of its
Affiliates' issued and outstanding voting equity interests; or (C) the sale,
lease, transfer or other disposition of some, all or substantially all of
Seller's or any of its Affiliates' direct or indirect assets, where, in the
case of each of clauses "(A)," "(B)" and "(C)," the acquiring Person is not an
Affiliate of Seller and is engaged in the Business on or prior to the date of
such acquisition; (ii) the acquisition by Seller or one of its Affiliates,
pursuant to a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination or
other similar transaction, of (A) some, a majority or all of a Person's issued
and outstanding voting equity interests or (B) all or substantially all of a
Person's assets, if such Person engages in the Business, so long as (x) the
Business constitutes less than the greater of ten percent (10%) of the annual
consolidated revenue of such Person on or prior to the date of such
acquisition and (y) none of Seller or any of its Affiliates facilitates such
acquired Person's engagement in the Business through the provision to such
Person or business of the Intellectual Property that is included in the
Acquired Assets or is owned by any Acquired Company or any other rights or
technology provided to Buyer under the Intellectual Property Assignment and
License Agreement for a period of five (5) years following the Closing Date;
(iii) the direct or indirect ownership by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller of
publicly traded interests in or securities of any Person engaged in the
Business to the extent that such investment does not, directly or indirectly,
confer on Seller and its Subsidiaries, collectively, more than five percent
(5%) of the voting power of such Person or the right to appoint a person to
the board of directors or other similar governing body of such Person; and
(iv) the investment in any fund in which Seller or any Subsidiary of Seller is
a passive investor and has no discretion and provides no advice or
consultation to the fund with respect to the investment strategy of or any
individual investments by such fund. Additionally, the purchase (and
subsequent ownership) of a Person exceeding the limits set forth in clause
(ii) above shall not be a breach of this Section 5.8(a) if Seller or its
applicable Subsidiary agree to sell as promptly as practical, but in any event
within twelve (12) months of such purchase, the portion of the Person, as
necessary, such that the limits set forth in clause (ii) are no longer
exceeded.

(b) For a period of [****] following the Closing, Seller shall not, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to not, directly or indirectly, (i) recruit,
solicit or otherwise attempt to employ or retain any employee of Buyer or its
Affiliates (including any Continuing Employee after the Closing Date), or
induce or attempt to induce any such employee (including any Continuing
Employee after the Closing Date) to leave the employ of Buyer or any such
Affiliate, or in any way interfere with the relationship between Buyer or any
of its Affiliates and any of their employees, or (ii) hire or otherwise engage
any employee of Buyer or its Affiliates (including any Continuing Employee
after the Closing Date), in each case, without the consent of Buyer; provided,
however, that (A) placing a general advertisement or other solicitation of
employment not specifically directed at the employees of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates will not be deemed a breach of clause (i), and (B) Seller or its
Affiliates may solicit or hire an employee of Buyer (including any Continuing
Employee after the Closing Date) after such employee (including any such
Continuing Employee) was terminated by Buyer or any of its Affiliates for a
period of at least six (6) months.

(c) For a period of [****] following the Closing, Buyer shall not, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to not, directly or indirectly, (i) recruit,
solicit or otherwise attempt to employ or retain any employee of Seller or any
Affiliate of Seller, or induce or attempt to induce any employee of Seller or
any Affiliate of Seller to leave the employ of Seller or any such Affiliate,
or in any way interfere with the relationship between Seller or any of its
Affiliates and any of their employees, or (ii) hire or otherwise any engage
employee of Seller, in each case, without the consent of Seller; provided,
however, that (A) placing a general advertisement or other solicitation of
employment not specifically directed at the employees of Seller or any of its
Affiliates will not be deemed a breach of clause (i), and (B) Buyer or its
Affiliates may solicit or hire an employee of Seller or its Affiliates after
such employee has ceased to be employed by Seller or any of its Affiliates for
a period of at least six (6) months.

(d) The nature and scope of the foregoing protections have been carefully
considered by the Parties. The Parties agree and acknowledge that the
duration, scope and geographic areas applicable to such provisions are fair,
reasonable and necessary and that adequate compensation has been received by
each Party for such obligations. If, however, for any reason any court
determines that any such restrictions are not reasonable or that such
consideration is inadequate, such restrictions shall be interpreted, modified
or rewritten to include as much of the duration, scope and geographic area
identified in this Section 5.8 as will render such restrictions valid and
enforceable.

(e) In the event of a breach or threatened breach of Section 5.3 or this
Section 5.8, Buyer or Seller, as applicable, shall be entitled, without the
posting of a bond, to enforce the terms of this Agreement by a decree of
specific performance without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money
damages as a remedy, including by obtaining an injunction restraining such
breach. Nothing herein contained shall be construed as prohibiting any Party
from pursuing any other remedy available to it for such breach or threatened
breach. In the event of a Proceeding involving Section 5.3 or this Section
5.8, the non-prevailing party shall reimburse the prevailing party for all
costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses,
incurred in connection with any such Proceeding, including any appeal
therefrom. The existence of any claim or cause of action by Seller or any of
its Affiliates against Buyer or any of its Affiliates, whether predicated on
this Agreement or otherwise, will not constitute a defense to the enforcement
by Buyer of the provisions of Section 5.3 or this Section 5.8, which Sections
will be enforceable notwithstanding the existence of any breach by Buyer or
its Affiliates. In addition, the terms of this Section 5.8 shall be tolled
until such breach or violation is cured if a court determines that Seller
materially violated the terms of this Section 5.8.



5.9 Pre-Closing Confidentiality Agreements. Following the Closing, if
requested by Buyer, Seller agrees, at Buyer's expense, to use commercially
reasonable efforts to enforce any Seller Confidentiality Agreement relating to
confidentiality obligations of an Alternate Bidder (and related remedies in
the event the Alternate Bidder breaches such obligations) with respect to any
"Confidential Information" (as such term is defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement) with respect to the Business or any Acquired Company.

5.10 Termination of Affiliate Arrangements.

(a) Except (i) as otherwise contemplated by the Ancillary Agreements and (ii)
as set forth in Schedule 5.10(a), Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies) to, take such action as may be necessary to
terminate, prior to or concurrently with the Closing, all Contracts solely
between Seller or one or more of its Affiliates (other than the Acquired
Companies), on the one hand, and an Acquired Company, on the other hand.

7.1 Survival. All representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the Closing for
a period ending [****] after the Closing Date; provided, however, that (a) the

Buyer), 2.2 (Authorization of Transaction) and 2.4 (Brokers' Fees)
(collectively, the "Buyer Fundamental Representations") and the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.1 (Corporate
Organization), 3.2 (Capitalization; Ownership), 3.3 (Seller Entities), 3.4
(Authorization of Transaction), 3.6 (Brokers' Fees) and [****] (collectively,
the "Seller Fundamental Representations"), shall survive the Closing for a

[****] after the Closing Date (such covenants, the "Pre-Closing Covenants").
All other covenants set forth herein shall survive the Closing in accordance
with their respective terms and shall continue until all obligations set forth
therein shall have been performed and satisfied. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (1) if prior to 11:59 p.m. Central Time on the last day a claim for
indemnification may be asserted hereunder, an Indemnified Party shall have
given notice of such claim to the Indemnifying Party in accordance with
Section 7.6(a) or 7.7, as applicable, and such claim shall not have been

of limitations with respect to such item shall be deemed to have been reduced
to the shortened survival period contemplated hereby and (y) longer than the
applicable statute of limitations that would otherwise have been applicable to
such item, then, by contract, the applicable statute of limitations with
respect to such item shall be deemed to have been extended to the longer
survival period contemplated thereby. The Parties further acknowledge and
agree that the time periods set forth in this Section 7.1 for the assertion of
claims under this Agreement are the result of arms' length negotiation among
the Parties and that they intend for the time periods to be enforced as agreed
by the Parties.

(a) Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates
and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and

included or referred to therein or otherwise known to the Buyer or any of
their Affiliates as of the Closing).

(d) Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnitees
from and against, and shall reimburse all Buyer Indemnitees for, any and all

under this Article 7, any Liability of any Acquired Company (other than any

Consequences do not result from, arise out of or relate to, and are not caused
by, a breach of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement by Seller or any
Seller Entity or a matter set forth on Schedule 7.2(c) and do not constitute a
Retained Liability or an Acquired Company Retained Liability.

(c) Subject to Seller's obligations under this Article 7, Buyer shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller Indemnitees from and against
any and all Adverse Consequences suffered or incurred by any Seller Indemnitee
resulting from, arising out of, relating to or caused by any Third Party
Claims to the extent resulting from, arising out of, relating to or caused by
the operation of the Business after the Closing to the extent that such
Adverse Consequences do not result from, arise out of or relate to, and are
not caused by, a breach of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement by Seller
or any Seller Entity or a matter set forth in Schedule 7.2(c) and do not
constitute a Retained Liability or an Acquired Company Retained Liability.

7.4 Limitations on Indemnification by Seller.

(a) Seller will have no Liability pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i) (i) unless and
until the Buyer Indemnitees have suffered aggregate Adverse Consequences by
reason of all such breaches indemnifiable pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i) in
excess of $[****] (the "Threshold"), after which point Seller will be
obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees from and against all
indemnifiable Adverse Consequences from and including [****] (for the
avoidance of doubt, Adverse Consequences will not apply towards the Threshold
if they are claimed by a Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to any provision
other than Section 7.2(a)(i)) and (ii) for any individual claim or series of
related claims, unless and until the Buyer Indemnitees have suffered aggregate
indemnifiable Adverse Consequences arising out of such claim or series of
related claims under Section 7.2(a)(i) with respect to such representations
and warranties in excess of $[****] (the "Eligible Claim Threshold")
(provided, that, any claim or series of related claims not exceeding such
amount shall not be aggregated to count towards the Threshold and shall not be
indemnifiable under Section 7.2(a)(i)); provided, however, that the foregoing
limitations shall not apply with respect to any breach of any of the Seller
Fundamental Representations or any claim based on Fraud.

(b) The aggregate maximum Liability of Seller pursuant to Sections 7.2(a)(i),
Section 7.2(c) shall not exceed $[****] (the "Cap"); provided, however, that
the foregoing limitation shall not apply with respect to any breach of any of
the Seller Fundamental Representations. Seller's maximum aggregate Liability
pursuant to Section 7.2 shall not exceed $[****]. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the limitations set forth in this Section 7.4(b) shall not apply
with respect to any claim based on Fraud.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the Buyer
Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification for any Adverse
Consequences to the extent such Adverse Consequences are reflected or reserved
for in the final calculation of the Working Capital Amount; and (ii) Seller
shall not have any Liability or indemnification obligation for any Taxes of
any of the Acquired Companies with respect to any taxable period (or portion
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date. For purposes of clause (i) of this
Section 7.4(c), Adverse Consequences shall be deemed to be reflected or
reserved for in the final calculation of the Working Capital Amount if they
are included on a dollar-for-dollar basis as current liabilities therein.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Buyer
Indemnified Parties' sole and exclusive remedy in connection with a breach of
Section 3.7(e) or any other insufficiency in the Inventory Reserve Amount (all
such breaches and insufficiencies, collectively, the "Inventory Reserve
Shortfall") shall be pursuant to a reduction of the Earnout Amount as
contemplated by Section 1.9(b) as finally determined pursuant to Section 1.11,
and in no event shall any Buyer Indemnified Party have any rights to
indemnification with respect to any Adverse Consequences resulting from,
arising out of, relating to or caused by any Inventory Reserve Shortfall or
otherwise with respect the representations and warranties set forth in Section
3.7(e).

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Buyer

Section 7.2(c).

7.5 Limitations on Indemnification by Buyer.

(a) Buyer will have no Liability pursuant to Section 7.3(a)(i) (i) unless and
until the Seller Indemnitees have suffered aggregate Adverse Consequences by
reason of all such breaches indemnifiable pursuant to Section 7.3(a)(i) in
excess of the Threshold, after which point Buyer will be obligated to
indemnify the Seller Indemnitees from and against all indemnifiable Adverse
Consequences from and including [****] (for the avoidance of doubt, Adverse
Consequences will not apply towards the Threshold if they are claimed by a
Seller Indemnified Party pursuant to any provision other than Section
7.3(a)(i)) and (ii) for any individual claim or series of related claims,
unless and until the Seller Indemnitees have suffered aggregate indemnifiable
Adverse Consequences arising out of such claim or series of related claims
under Section 7.3(a)(i) with respect to such representations and warranties in
excess of the Eligible Claim Threshold (provided, that, any claim or series of
related claims not exceeding such amount shall not be aggregated to count
towards the Threshold and shall not be indemnifiable under Section 7.3(a)(i));
provided, however, that the foregoing limitations shall not apply with respect
to any breach of any of the Buyer Fundamental Representations or any claim
based on Fraud.

(b) The aggregate maximum Liability of Buyer pursuant to Section 7.3(a)(i)
shall not exceed the Cap; provided, however, that the foregoing limitation
shall not apply with respect to any breach of any of the Buyer Fundamental
Representations. Buyer's aggregate maximum Liability pursuant to Section
7.3(a)(i), with respect to inaccuracies in or breaches of the Buyer
Fundamental Representations, and Section 7.3(a)(iii), collectively, will not
exceed an aggregate amount, which, if added to all other amounts paid as
indemnification payments by Buyer under Section 7.3(a)(i) and Section
7.3(a)(iii), collectively, is equal to $[****]. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the limitations set forth in this Section 7.5(b) shall not apply with respect
to any claim based on Fraud.

7.6 Third Party Claims.

(a) If a third party initiates a claim, demand, dispute, lawsuit or
arbitration (a "Third Party Claim") against any Person (the "Indemnified
Party") with respect to any matter that the Indemnified Party is entitled to
make a claim for indemnification against any Party (the "Indemnifying Party")
under this Article 7, then the Indemnified Party must promptly (and in no
event more than thirty (30) days after the receipt by the Indemnified Party of
a written assertion of such Third Party Claim) notify the Indemnifying Party
in writing of the existence of such Third Party Claim in reasonable detail to
the extent reasonably practicable based on then-available information
indicating the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of Adverse
Consequences the Indemnified Party has suffered or incurred and may suffer or
incur, and must deliver copies of any documents served on the Indemnified
Party with respect to the Third Party Claim; provided,



however, that any failure (other than a failure to give notice prior to the
expiration of the survival period for such Third Party Claim, as specified in
Section 7.1) on the part of an Indemnified Party to so notify an Indemnifying
Party shall not limit any of the obligations of the Indemnifying Party under
this Article 7 (except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the
defense of such Third Party Claim).

(b) Upon receipt of the notice described in Section 7.6(a), the Indemnifying
Party will have the right to defend the Indemnified Party against the Third
Party Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party,
provided, that (i) the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party in
writing that it elects to exercise its right to defend the claim within
fifteen (15) days after the Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third
Party Claim; (ii) the Indemnifying Party provides the Indemnified Party with
evidence reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying
Party will have the financial resources to defend against the Third Party
Claim and fulfill its indemnification obligations hereunder; (iii) the Third
Party Claim (A) arises out of or relates to any infringement, misappropriation
or violation of any Intellectual Property rights or (B) involves only money
damages and does not seek an injunction or other equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party or an Affiliate of an Indemnified Party; (iv) the
Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and
diligently and (v) the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party in
writing within ninety (90) days after the assumption of the defense of such
Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party will indemnify the Indemnified
Party from and against the entirety of any Adverse Consequences the
Indemnified Party may suffer resulting from or caused by the Third Party Claim
(it being agreed that the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to defend the
Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim as provided in this Section
7.6(b) during the period until such notice is due). The Indemnifying Party
will keep the Indemnified Party apprised of all material developments,
including settlement offers, with respect to the Third Party Claim and permit
the Indemnified Party to participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim
at the Indemnified Party's expense. So long as the Indemnifying Party is
conducting the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section
7.6(b), the Indemnifying Party will not be responsible for any attorneys' fees
or other expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party regarding the Third Party
Claim; provided, however, that in any action in which the Indemnified Party's
legal counsel reasonably determines that representation of both a Seller
Indemnified Party and a Buyer Indemnified Party by the same counsel creates an
actual conflict of interest, or that such a conflict of interest is likely to
arise in the event that both a Seller Indemnified Party and a Buyer
Indemnified Party are named as defendants in such Third Party Claim, under
applicable standards of professional conduct for attorneys, the Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense with counsel of its own
choice (but no more than one counsel, plus local counsel) at the Indemnifying
Party's cost and expense.

(c) In the event that any of the conditions under Section 7.6(b) is or becomes
unsatisfied, however, (i) the Indemnified Party may defend against the Third
Party Claim in any manner it may reasonably deem appropriate, (ii) the
Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party promptly and
periodically for the costs of defending against the Third Party Claim
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), (iii) the Indemnifying
Party will remain responsible for any Adverse Consequences suffered or
incurred by the Indemnified Party resulting from or caused by the Third Party
Claim to the fullest extent provided in this Article 7.



(d) Neither the Indemnified Party nor the Indemnifying Party will consent to
the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the other Party, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (including
with respect to the matters set forth in Schedule 7.6(d)) and, for the
avoidance of doubt, if the settlement or judgment (i) does not include as an
unconditional term thereof a full release of the Indemnified Party or (ii)
seeks an injunction or other equitable relief.

7.7 Direct Claims. If an Indemnified Party wishes to make a claim for
indemnification hereunder for Adverse Consequences that do not result from a
Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall deliver to
the Indemnifying Party a written notice which contains to the extent
reasonably practicable based on then-available information (a) a description
of the claim for indemnification in reasonable detail, (b) a statement that
the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this Article 7 and
an explanation of the basis therefor, and (c) a demand for payment in the
amount of such Adverse Consequences (or estimated amount if the amount of the
claim is not yet determined, or a statement that the Adverse Consequences
cannot yet be estimated). The Indemnifying Party shall have a period of thirty
(30) days within which to respond to such Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying
Party does not respond within such thirty (30) day period, the Indemnifying
Party will be deemed to have accepted the Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying
Party rejects all or any part of the Direct Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
be free to seek enforcement of its rights to indemnification under this
Agreement with respect to such Direct Claim.

7.8 Recovery for Certain Third Party Claims. Buyer shall pay to Seller the
amounts set forth on Schedule 7.8.

7.9 Other Indemnification Matters.

(a) All indemnification payments under this Article 7 will be deemed
adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required
by applicable Law. Solely for the purposes of determining the amount of
Adverse Consequences resulting from any misrepresentation or breach of a
representation or warranty, but not for purposes of determining whether there
has been any misrepresentation or breach therefrom, all qualifications or
exceptions in any representation or warranty relating to or referring to the
terms "material", "materiality", "in all material respects", "Material Adverse
Effect" or any similar term or phrase shall be disregarded. The right of any
Indemnified Party to indemnification, payment of any Adverse Consequences or
other remedy based on the representations, warranties, covenants and
obligations contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered in
connection with this Agreement will not be affected by any investigation
conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being
acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy
of or compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation. Each Party hereby acknowledges that, regardless of any
investigation made (or not made) by or on behalf of the other Party, and
regardless of the results of any such investigation, such other Party has
entered into this transaction in express reliance upon such representations,
warranties, covenants and obligations.

(b) Seller agrees on behalf of itself and each of the Seller Indemnitees that
neither Seller nor any Seller Indemnitee shall have any claims or rights to
contribution or indemnity from any Acquired Company with respect to any
amounts paid by Seller or any of its Affiliates pursuant to this Article 7.

(c) For all purposes of this Article 7, "Adverse Consequences" shall be
calculated net of the amount of any insurance or third party indemnification
or other coverage actually received



by the applicable Indemnified Party (or any Affiliate thereof) from insurance
policies or third parties not affiliated with such Indemnified Party in
connection with such Adverse Consequences, net of any fees, costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the collection of any such proceeds and net of the
present value of any increase in insurance premiums or other charges paid or
reasonably expected to be paid by the Indemnified Party arising out of such
Adverse Consequences, If an Indemnified Party (or any Affiliate thereof)
receives an amount under insurance or third party indemnification or other
coverage with respect to Adverse Consequences from third parties not
affiliated with such Indemnified Party at any time subsequent to any
indemnification provided by an Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified Party
shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any such payment up to the
excess (if any) of (i) such amount received by the Indemnified Party (and any
Affiliate thereof) (net of any fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection
with the collection of any such proceeds and net of the present value of any
increase in insurance premiums or other charges paid or reasonably expected to
be paid by the Indemnified Party arising out of such Adverse Consequences),
plus (ii) the amount paid by the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Adverse
Consequences, less (iii) the full amount of Adverse Consequences.

(d) Nothing herein shall relieve any Indemnified Party of its common law duty
to mitigate Adverse Consequences.

7.10 Setoff. Unless specifically otherwise set forth in this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement, neither Party shall have any right of setoff of any
amounts due and payable, or any Liabilities arising, under this Agreement
against any other amounts due and payable under this Agreement or any amounts
due and payable, or any Liabilities arising, under any Ancillary Agreement.
Unless specifically otherwise set forth in this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement, the payment obligations under each of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements remain independent obligations of each Party,
irrespective of any amounts owed to any other Party under this Agreement or
the respective Ancillary Agreements.

7.11 Exclusive Remedy. Except as set forth in Section 1.8, Section 1.11,
Section 5.8, Section 8.2, Article 10, Section 12.15, or in the case of Fraud,
the Parties acknowledge and agree that, from and after the Closing,
indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this Article 7 shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of the Parties with respect to any claim related to or
arising from this Agreement, the negotiations and execution of this Agreement
and the performance by the Parties of their respective obligations hereunder.

ARTICLE 8 

TAX MATTERS

8.1 Cooperation on Tax Matters. Buyer and Seller will cooperate, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by any Party, in connection with the filing and
preparation of Tax Returns pursuant to this Article and any Proceeding related
thereto. Such cooperation will include the retention and (upon the other
Party's request) the provision of records and information that are reasonably
relevant to any such Proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Subject to the other provisions of this
Agreement, such cooperation shall also include promptly forwarding copies of
notices and forms or other communication received from or sent to any
Governmental Body which relate to Tax Returns or Taxes of the Acquired
Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any Straddle Period and providing
copies of all relevant Tax Returns for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any
Straddle Period, together with accompanying schedules and related workpapers,
and documents relating to rulings and other determinations relating to Taxes
or Tax Returns by Governmental Bodies, which either Party may possess. Buyer
and Seller will retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to any Acquired Company or the Business relating to any Tax period
beginning on or before the Closing Date until thirty (30) days after the
expiration of the statute or period of limitations of the respective Tax
periods.



8.2 Certain Taxes.

(a) All transfer (including real estate transfer), documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions
("Transfer Taxes") shall be borne [****]; provided that any penalties and
interest caused by the fault of either Party shall be borne solely by that
Party. The Party required by applicable Law to file any Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes shall file such Tax
Returns and other documentation, and, if required by applicable Law, the other
Party will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation. The expenses of preparing such Tax Returns shall be borne
equally by Seller and Buyer.

(b) All real and personal property Taxes and similar ad valorem obligations
levied with respect to the Acquired Assets for any Tax period that begins on
or before the Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date (any such Tax
period, a "Straddle Period") shall be apportioned between the portion of such
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the portion of such Straddle
Period beginning on the day after the Closing Date based on the relative
numbers of days in such portions of such Straddle Period. Seller shall be
responsible for and shall pay the amount of such Taxes apportioned to the
portion of the applicable Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, and
Buyer shall be responsible for and shall pay the amount of such Taxes
apportioned to the portion of the applicable Straddle Period beginning on the
date after the Closing Date.

(c) To the extent that Seller pays or has paid any amounts for which Buyer is
responsible under Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.2(b) and such payment is not
reflected as a positive adjustment in the final determination of the Working
Capital Amount, Buyer shall reimburse Seller within thirty (30) days after a
written request for reimbursement (which written request shall include such
supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate such amount to be
reimbursed) is delivered by the Seller to Buyer. To the extent that Buyer pays
any amounts for which Seller is responsible under Section 8.2(a) or Section
8.2(b), Seller shall reimburse Buyer within thirty (30) days after a written
request for reimbursement (which written request shall include such supporting
evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate such amount to be reimbursed)
is delivered by Buyer to Seller.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Taxes
required to be paid by Buyer pursuant to Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.2(b)
shall be treated as liabilities in calculating the Working Capital Amount.

8.3 Preparation of Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies.

(a) Subject to Section 8.8, Buyer, at its own expense, will prepare, or cause
to be prepared, and timely file, or cause to be timely filed, all Tax Returns
for the Acquired Companies for all Tax periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date that are due after the Closing Date (taking into account
extensions). Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
the past practice of Seller and the Acquired Companies, unless prohibited by
applicable Law. Buyer will provide Seller with copies of any such Tax Returns
for Seller's review and approval (not to be unreasonably withheld), at least
thirty (30) days prior to the due date thereof (giving effect to any
extensions thereto).

(b) Subject to Section 8.8, Buyer, at its own expense, will prepare, or cause
to be prepared, and timely file, or cause to be timely filed, all Tax Returns
for the Acquired Companies for Straddle Periods (such returns the "Straddle
Period Returns"). Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with the past practice of Seller and the Acquired Companies, unless prohibited
by applicable Law. Buyer will provide Seller with copies of any Straddle
Period Returns for Seller's review and approval (not to be unreasonably
withheld) at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date thereof (giving
effect to any extensions thereto), accompanied by a statement setting forth
and calculating in reasonable detail Buyer's calculation of the amount of Pre-
Closing Taxes with respect to such Tax Return.

(c) If Seller does not approve any Tax Return as prepared by Buyer under
Section 8.3(a) or Section 8.3(b) and Seller and Buyer are unable to reach
agreement as to such Tax Return at least ten (10) days prior to the due date
thereof, the disputed items shall be resolved by the Accountants using
principles similar to those set forth in Section 1.8(b). If the Accountants
are unable to resolve any disputed items before the due date for such Tax
Return, the Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by Buyer, in each case as
adjusted to reflect any agreed-upon items, and such Tax Return shall
thereafter be amended to reflect the Accountants' resolution of the matter.

8.4 Actions with Respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods. Except as required by
applicable Law, Buyer shall not modify or amend any Tax Returns of any of the
Acquired Companies relating to any taxable period ending on or before the
Closing Date or any Straddle Period, or cause or permit any of the Acquired
Companies to change any accounting period, adopt or change any accounting
method, surrender any right to claim a refund of Taxes, waive or extend any
statute of limitations, make or change any Tax election or take any other
action, without the prior written consent of Seller, if such action would
reasonably be expected to result in Company Indemnified Taxes or in a
reduction in the amount of Tax refunds that would be payable to Seller under
Section 8.6.

8.5 Tax Claims. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall notify Seller in
writing within three (3) Business Days of receipt by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) of notice of any pending or
threatened federal, state, local or foreign Tax Proceeding that would
reasonably be expected to give rise to an indemnity claim under this
Agreement; provided, however, that any failure to so notify shall not limit
any of the obligations of the Indemnifying Party under Article 7 (except to
the extent such failure materially prejudices the defense of such Tax
Proceeding). Seller shall have the right to control any Tax Proceeding that
relates to any Pre-Closing Tax Period and, if Seller chooses to control any
such Tax Proceeding, Seller shall make all decisions (including selection of
counsel) with respect to such Tax Proceeding and may, in its sole discretion,
pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearing and
conferences with any Governmental Body taken in connection thereof; provided,
however, that the Seller shall keep Buyer apprised of all material
developments, including settlement offers, with respect to the Tax Proceeding
and permit Buyer to participate in the defense of the Tax Proceeding at
Buyer's expense; provided, further, the Seller shall not consent to the entry
of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Tax
Proceeding without the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent will not



be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. In the event of any
conflict or overlap between the provisions of this Section 8.5 and Section
7.6, the provisions of this Section 8.5 shall control.

8.6 Tax Refunds. Seller shall be entitled to any Tax refunds (and any credits
claimed against Tax in lieu of a Tax refund) that any of the Acquired
Companies receives that relates to any Pre-Closing Tax Period and Buyer shall
(subject to the terms of this Section 8.6) cause each of the Acquired
Companies to pay over to Seller any such refund or the amount of such credit
within thirty (30) days after receipt of such refund or application of such
credit; provided that (i) Seller shall not be entitled to any such Tax refund
that is attributable to the carryback of any loss or other Tax Attribute
arising in a taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing
Date or to the extent such Tax refund is taken into account as a current asset
in the final determination of the Working Capital Amount; (ii) Seller shall
only be entitled to such Tax refunds that are refunds of Taxes of the Acquired
Companies that were paid on or prior to the Closing Date or for which a
liability was taken into account in the final determination of the Working
Capital Amount or for Taxes for which any Buyer Indemnitee was indemnified
under Article 7; (iii) the amount of any such Tax refund to be paid to Seller
hereunder shall be net of all Taxes and reasonable out-of-pocket costs
incurred by the Acquired Companies in connection with obtaining such Tax
refund and (iv) any Tax refund or credit with respect to Taxes for any
Straddle Period shall be equitably apportioned consistent with the
apportionment of Pre-Closing Taxes as set forth in the definition of such
term. Upon the request and at the expense of Seller, Buyer shall cause the
Acquired Companies to file a claim for refund of any Taxes, including through
the filing of amended Tax Returns or otherwise in such form as Seller may
reasonably request, to which Seller would be entitled pursuant to this Section
8.6.

8.7 E-conolight Sales Taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Parties agree that all sales by E-conolight on or prior to the
Closing Date that are subject to sales Tax shall be reported on sales Tax
Returns filed under the name and taxpayer identification number(s) of Seller,
consistent with the historical practice of Seller and E-conolight. For the
avoidance of doubt, Section 8.5 shall apply to any Tax Proceedings in which
any Governmental Body challenges such treatment. For the avoidance of doubt,
Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnitees from
and against any and all Adverse Consequences suffered or incurred by any Buyer
Indemnitee resulting from or caused by such historical practice. At least five
(5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall (1) cause
E-conolight to apply for registration (such registrations to be submitted via
online applications if available) for sales Tax purposes in all jurisdictions
in which E-conolight is required to be so registered and (2) provide evidence
of such application to Buyer, which evidence may consist of copies of the
applications for sales Tax registration submitted by E-conolight (including
print-outs or screen captures of applications submitted online) certified by
Seller as having been submitted to the applicable Tax authorities.

8.8 Section 338(g) Elections. Buyer agrees to make, or to cause its designated
Affiliate purchasing the Purchased Interests of Cree Europe to make, an
election under Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to the purchase by
Buyer or such designated Affiliate of the Purchased Interests of Cree Europe.
Buyer agrees to make, or to cause its designated Affiliate purchasing the
Purchased Interests of Cree Canada to make, an election under Section 338(g)
of the Code with respect to the purchase by Buyer or such designated Affiliate
of the Purchased Interests of Cree Canada.



ARTICLE 9 

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

9.1 Employment.

(a) Subject to Section 9.10, Buyer shall, or shall cause an Affiliate to, make
an offer of employment to each Business Employee described or listed on
Schedule 9.1(a) as receiving an offer (including all such Business Employees
on Employee Leave), with such offers of employment to be effective immediately
upon the Employee Transfer Date. As and to the extent required by applicable
Law, such offers of employment shall be contingent upon verification of the
offeree's legal right to work in the applicable jurisdiction. Each such
Business Employee who accepts such offer of employment and becomes an employee
of Buyer, or one of its Affiliates, on the Employee Transfer Date shall be
referred to herein as a "Transferred Employee." Transferred Employees and
Acquired Company Employees shall collectively be known as "Continuing
Employees." The initial terms of employment or continued employment for each
Continuing Employee shall be for Equivalent Employment and shall, in addition,
provide a bonus opportunity, severance benefits (subject to Section 9.3), and
employee benefits that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those
provided by the applicable Seller Entity to such Business Employee or by the
applicable Acquired Company to such Acquired Company Employee, as the case may
be, immediately prior to the Closing, but excluding any Seller Entity equity
awards or equity-based awards of any type.

(b) Seller shall, prior to the Closing, provide Buyer with access, upon
reasonable notice and at reasonable times, to meet with the Business Employees
for the purpose of making offers of employment, providing and collecting pre-
employment forms, administering the Offer Contingencies, and otherwise
communicating to the Business Employees in connection with the offers of
employment described in Section 9.1(a). Seller agrees not to interfere with
Buyer's offers of employment in Section 9.1(a) and agrees not make any
statement (orally or in writing), or engage in any conduct, that has the
purpose or effect to discourage any Business Employee from accepting such
offer of employment by Buyer or any of its Affiliates. Effective on the
Employee Transfer Date, the Seller Entities shall terminate the employment of
each of the Transferred Employees and each Business Employee who has received
an offer of employment from Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer and has not
accepted such offer.

(c) Seller shall take, or shall cause to be taken, all actions required to
release or cause to be released, each Continuing Employee, effective at or
before the Closing, from any Contract with, or other obligation to, any Seller
Entity to the extent (and only to the extent) such Contract or obligation
imposed by any Seller Entity limits or restricts such Continuing Employee from
being employed by or providing services to Buyer or any of its Affiliates, or
otherwise engaging in the Business on behalf of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates. In the case of each Continuing Employee, within a reasonable time
following the Closing (and in any case not later than required by applicable
Law), Seller shall (i) pay each Continuing Employee all Accrued Compensation
Obligations due from any Seller Entity to such Continuing Employee in respect
of the period prior to the Employee Transfer Date, and (ii) pay or retain any
Liabilities arising under, or related to, any Employee Benefit Plan of any
kind related to period prior to the Closing, except, in each case, to the
extent included as a current liability in the Working Capital calculation
included in the Final Cash Payment.



(d) Following the Closing, Seller shall cooperate with Buyer as Buyer may
reasonably request, to make available to Buyer (on terms commensurate with the
arrangements between the applicable Seller Entity and the Contingent Worker),
the services of any Contingent Worker (as of the date of this Agreement or
immediately prior to the Closing) reasonably necessary for the uninterrupted
conduct of the Business or for the completion of projects pertaining to the
Business.

9.2 Seller Equity Awards.

(a) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take such actions as are
reasonably necessary so that, effective as of and contingent upon the Closing,
(i) all outstanding, unvested stock option awards made to any Continuing
Employees outstanding as of the Closing Date will become fully vested and
exercisable in accordance with their terms, (ii) all time-vested restricted
stock unit awards and other equity awards made to any Continuing Employees
that would have vested solely based on the passage of time in the twelve (12)
month period ending on the one year anniversary of the Closing Date (the "One
Year Closing Anniversary Date") will become fully vested in accordance with
their terms, and (iii) all outstanding, unvested performance-based stock units
made to any Continuing Employees will become fully vested with all performance
objectives deemed to have been satisfied at the greater of (A) target level
and (B) the actual performance level (with the Closing Date being treated as
the ending date for the measurement period and the closing price of Seller's
common stock on the Closing Date as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select
Market being used for the calculation of relative total shareholder return).

(b) Effective as of and contingent upon the Closing, each outstanding,
unvested stock option award, time-vested restricted stock unit award, and
other equity award made to any Continuing Employee that would not by its terms
vest, whether by the passage of time or performance of Seller or the Business,
by the One Year Closing Anniversary Date (each, a "Remaining Award" and,
collectively, the "Remaining Awards") will be converted, in settlement and
cancellation thereof, into the contingent right to receive an amount equal to
the product of (i) (A) the closing price of Seller's common stock on the
Closing Date as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, multiplied by (B)
the number of shares of Seller's common stock underlying such Remaining Awards
on the Closing Date, and (ii) the ratio of EBITDA actually generated by the
Business during the Earnout Measurement Period and the Target EBITDA, which
ratio must equal or exceed 80% in order for any of this contingent right to be
due and payable (the "Earnout Bonus") to Continuing Employees. The Earnout
Bonus will be paid by Buyer or one of its Affiliates, as applicable, in cash
within ten (10) Business Days of the date Buyer first owes a payment to Seller
under Section 1.7(c) or Section 1.7(d) (and in no case later than two and a
half months after the end of the calendar year in which the Earnout Amount is
finally determined in accordance with Section 1.11); provided, however, if a
Continuing Employee is no longer employed by Buyer or one of its Affiliates in
connection with the Business as of the last day of the Earnout Period, then
the amount of the Earnout Bonus to which such holder of Remaining Awards has
the right to receive pursuant to this Section 9.2(b) shall be automatically
forfeited. Schedule 9.2(a) sets forth the Remaining Awards for all Company
Employees as of the date hereof, which Schedule 9.2(a) shall be updated by
Seller and delivered not later than ten (10) Business Days following the
Closing Date. Buyer shall be entitled to set off against the Earnout Amount an
amount in cash equal to (x) the aggregate amount of such Earnout Bonuses paid
to the applicable Continuing Employees pursuant to this Section 9.2(b) and (y)
the employer portion of any payroll, employment or other Taxes, if any,
required to be paid thereon.

9.3 Severance.

(a) Subject to Section 9.1(a), from and after the Closing Date and continuing
until the expiration of the applicable Post-Closing Protected Period, Buyer
shall, or shall cause an Affiliate to, provide any Continuing Employee who
experiences an actual termination of employment by Buyer or its applicable
Affiliate under circumstances that would have entitled such Continuing
Employee to severance benefits had he or she remained an employee of Seller or
one of its Affiliates under the severance plans of the applicable Seller
Entity or Acquired Company, as applicable, effective immediately prior to the
date hereof and set forth on Schedule 9.1(a) (each, a "Seller Severance Plan"
and collectively, the "Seller Severance Plans"), with severance benefits no
less favorable than those set forth in such applicable Seller Severance Plan
that would apply in the event of a termination of employment "In Connection
with a Change in Control" (as defined in the applicable Seller Severance
Plan), with all such severance benefits to be conditioned upon execution by
each such Continuing Employee of a valid release of claims for the benefit of
Seller and Buyer, on a form acceptable to Seller and Buyer. Buyer shall
provide Seller with notice of all such terminations and provide documentation
of compliance with this Section 9.3(a), including copies of executed releases
of claims, within sixty (60) days of each such termination of employment. With
respect to the obligation in the Seller Severance Plans to provide
compensation to a Continuing Employee for any Remaining Awards, Buyer will
provide such compensation directly as part of Buyer's discharge of its
severance obligations under this Section 9.3(a), subject to reimbursement from
Seller within thirty (30) days of Buyer providing such documentation, which
reimbursement shall include (x) the aggregate amount of such compensation paid
to the applicable Continuing Employee pursuant to this Section 9.3(a) and (y)
the employer portion of any payroll, employment or other Taxes, if any,
required to be paid thereon.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall reimburse Buyer or its
Affiliates within thirty (30) days of Buyer or its Affiliates providing
documentation of the payment of the [****].

9.4 Service Credit; Welfare Payments. From and after the Employee Transfer
Date, and where applicable with respect to any benefit plan or compensation
arrangement of Buyer, with respect to each Transferred Employee and Continuing
Employee (other than those described in Section 9.13), and without limiting
the employment obligations or terms set forth above in Article 9: (a) Buyer
shall recognize and honor, or cause to be recognized and honored, any service
credit accrued or recognized by Seller or any Affiliate thereof as of such
date for purposes of determining eligibility and vesting, as well as for
purposes of determining the amount of paid time off or severance to which a
Transferred Employee or Continuing Employee is entitled (but not for purposes
of determining the amount of benefits under any Buyer Employee Benefit Plan
and, for the avoidance of doubt, not for purposes of crediting any service
under Buyer's Creating Greater Value executive compensation plan) to the
extent that such credit would be recognized for participants generally under
the analogous Buyer plan; (b) Buyer shall recognize and honor, or cause to be
recognized and honored, vacation, sick leave, and other paid time off that was
accrued or recognized by Seller or any Affiliate thereof as of such date with
respect to such Continuing Employee; and (c) Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the applicable group health plan maintained by
Buyer to recognize and credit amounts paid by such employees under an
applicable Seller Employee Benefit Plan towards satisfying deductible expense
requirements and out-of-pocket expense limits during the portion of the
calendar year prior to the applicable Employee Transfer Date, for purposes of
an analogous welfare benefit plan maintained by Buyer in which an employee
participates, as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such Buyer
plan for the same plan year; provided that the applicable plan administrator
under each such Seller Employee Benefit Plan shall have timely provided Buyer
with validated information that allows Buyer to recognize and credit such
amounts with respect to each applicable group health plan maintained by Buyer.
Buyer and Seller agree that where applicable with respect to any medical or
dental benefit plan of Buyer, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause such Buyer plan to waive, with respect to each Transferred Employee
and Continuing Employee, any pre-existing condition exclusion to the extent
such exclusion was inapplicable, waived or satisfied by such employee under
the applicable Seller Employee Benefit Plan prior to such employee's Employee
Transfer Date. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 9.4 to the
contrary, Buyer and its Affiliates will not credit service where giving such
credit would result in a duplication of benefits for the same period of
service, be prohibited by applicable Law, or to the extent such service is
with respect to a plan newly established by Buyer or its Affiliates for which
similarly situated employees of Buyer or its Affiliates do not receive past
service credit.

9.5 COBRA. Buyer shall provide continuation health care coverage to all
Continuing Employees (and their respective qualified beneficiaries) who
experience a "qualifying event" after the applicable Employee Transfer Date
while employed with Buyer, in accordance with and to the extent required under
the continuation health care coverage requirements of COBRA. Except as
required to be provided by Buyer pursuant to the prior sentence, Seller shall
be responsible for providing continuation coverage and all related notices to
the extent required by applicable Law to any Business Employee and any
Acquired Company Employee (and their respective qualified beneficiaries) who
experience a "qualifying event" under COBRA on or before the applicable
Employee Transfer Date and to whom Seller, as of immediately prior to the
applicable Employee Transfer Date, is: (a) providing COBRA coverage; or (b)
under an obligation to provide such coverage at the election of such
individual (or his or her qualified beneficiary) based on a termination of
employment on or prior to the applicable Employee Transfer Date.

9.6 401(k) Plan. With respect to each Transferred Employee who participates in
the Cree, Inc. 401(k) plan (the "401(k) Plan"), Buyer shall permit (or shall
cause its Affiliates to permit) each such Transferred Employee to make
rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the
meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code including loans) in an amount equal
to the full account balance (including loans) distributable to such
Transferred Employee from the 401(k) Plan to a 401(k) plan of Buyer or its
Affiliates.

9.7 Standard Procedure. With respect to Transferred Employees eligible to
receive a Form W-2 and pursuant to the "Standard Procedure" provided in
Section 4 of Revenue Procedure 2004‑53, 2004‑2 C.B. 320, (a) Buyer and Seller
shall report on a predecessor/successor basis as set forth therein, (b) Seller
will not be relieved from filing a Form W‑2 with respect to any Transferred
Employees and (c) Buyer will undertake to file (or cause to be filed) a Form
W‑2 for each such Transferred Employee with respect to the portion of the year
during which such Transferred Employee is employed by Buyer, excluding the
portion of such year that such Transferred Employee was employed by Seller.



9.8 WARN Act and Other Laws. Buyer and Seller shall comply with all applicable
Laws relating to the hiring of Company Employees by Buyer, including, all
applicable discrimination and leave laws and all applicable international
counterparts thereof. Buyer shall provide any required notice under, and
otherwise comply with, the WARN Act, or any similar Laws, with respect to
employment losses of Continuing Employees that occur after the Closing Date.
In accordance with 29 U.S.C. 2101(b)(1), Seller shall provide any required
notice under, and otherwise comply with, the WARN Act, or any similar Laws,
with respect to employment losses of Business Employees or Acquired Company
Employees that occur on or prior to the Closing Date, provided that Seller and
Buyer acknowledge that in light of Buyer's obligation to make offers of
employment to all of the Business Employees listed on Schedule 9.1(a), it is
their intent that no such employee will suffer an "employment loss" within the
meaning of the WARN Act or analogous Laws; and provided further, that Seller
represents and warrants that the Business Employees working in Wisconsin who
are listed on Schedule 9.1(a) represent "Substantially All" of the Seller's
"Affected Employees" in Wisconsin (as those terms are defined in Chapter DWD
sections 279.01(1)(L) and 279.01(1)(a) of the Wisconsin Administrative Code).

9.9 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. The provisions of this Article 9 are solely
for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no Transferred Employee
or any other Business Employee shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-
party beneficiary of this Agreement, and no provision of this Article 9 shall
create such rights in any such persons. Nothing herein shall (a) guarantee
employment for any period of time or preclude the ability of Buyer or any of
its Affiliates to terminate the employment of any Transferred Employee at any
time and for any reason, and (b) subject to Buyer's obligations to provide the
benefits specified in Article 9, (i) require Buyer or any of its Affiliates to
continue any Employee Benefit Plans, or other employee benefit plans or
arrangements or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof
after the Closing or (ii) amend any Employee Benefit Plans or other employee
benefit plans or arrangements of Seller, Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates.

9.10 International Employees. Promptly following the date hereof, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to agree upon the employment arrangements
pertaining to the Transferred Employees located outside the United States (the
"International Transferred Employees") to treat such International Transferred
Employees in a manner consistent with the Transferred Employees located in the
United States as set forth in this Article 9.

ARTICLE 12 

MISCELLANEOUS

12.1 Press Releases and Public Announcements. Each Party agrees not to issue
any press release or make any other public announcement relating to this
Agreement or the other Ancillary Agreements without the prior written consent
of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, except that, notwithstanding the confidentiality
obligations set forth in Section 5.3, each Party reserves the right, without
the other Party's prior consent, to make any public disclosure (a) it believes
in good faith after consultation with legal counsel is required by applicable
securities Laws or securities listing standards, including the filing of this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (in which case the disclosing Party shall advise the other Party
prior to making such disclosure) or (b) that is substantially similar to
disclosure that has previously been made by either Party in compliance with
the terms of this Section 12.1. Prior to Closing, the Parties will consult
with each other concerning the means by which any employee, customer or
supplier of a Seller Entity or Acquired Company or any other Person having any
business relationship with a Seller Entity or Acquired Company will be
informed of the Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt, after the Closing
each Party shall be permitted to issue press releases, make public
announcements and communicate with its employees, customers and suppliers
without the consent or participation of the other Party.

12.2 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement, whether express
or implied, shall be construed to give any Person (other than the Parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns) any legal or equitable
right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any covenants,
conditions or provisions contained herein, as a third party beneficiary or
otherwise; provided, that (i) Buyer Indemnitees and Seller Indemnitees who are
not otherwise a Party to this Agreement shall be third party beneficiaries of
Article 7 of this Agreement; (ii) the Debt Financing Sources are third party
beneficiaries of Sections 12.2, 12.8, 12.9, 12.15, 12.16, 12.17 and 12.18 and
such Sections shall be enforceable by each Debt Financing Source, their
respective Affiliates and their respective successors and permitted assigns;
and (iii) Seller Counsel is a third party beneficiary of Section 12.19.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, for the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in Article 9 (whether express or implied) shall be deemed to make any
employee (or dependent thereof) of any Seller Entity or Acquired Company a
third-party beneficiary to Article 9 or any other provision of this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement.

12.3 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the documents referred to
herein) constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties and supersedes
any prior understandings, agreements, or representations by or among the
Parties, written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to the subject
matter hereof.

12.4 Succession and Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the Parties named herein and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval
of the other Party; provided, however, that Buyer may (a) assign any or all of
its rights and interests under this Agreement to one or more of its Affiliates
and designate one or more of its Affiliates to perform its obligations under
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement (in any or all of which cases Buyer
nonetheless shall remain responsible for the performance of all of its
obligations hereunder and thereunder), (b) assign its rights under this
Agreement for collateral security purposes to any lenders providing financing
to Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or (c) assign its rights
under this Agreement to any Person that acquires Buyer or all or substantially
all of its assets.

12.5 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts
(including by means of facsimile, portable document format (.PDF) or other
means of electronic transmission), each of which shall be deemed an original
but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.

12.6 Headings. The section headings contained in this Agreement are inserted

interpretation of this Agreement.

hereunder will be in writing. Any notice, request, demand, claim, or other
communication hereunder shall be deemed duly given (a) when delivered

arising out of or related to this Agreement, any of the Transactions, the
relationship of the parties, or the interpretation and enforcement of the
rights and duties of the Parties, whether arising in contract,



tort, equity or otherwise, shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the domestic Laws of the State of Delaware (including in respect of the
statute of limitations or other limitations period applicable to any such
claim, controversy or dispute), without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of Law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the foregoing, each of the Parties hereto agrees that, except as
specifically set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters, all claims or causes of
action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against
any of the Debt Financing Sources in any way relating to the Debt Commitment
Letters or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby,
shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the

or permit the application of laws of another jurisdiction.

12.9 Amendments and Waivers. No amendment of any provision of this Agreement
shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Parties.
No waiver by any Party of any provision of this Agreement or any default,
misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether
intentional or not, shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and
signed by the Party making such waiver nor shall such waiver be deemed to
extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or breach of
warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by
virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in the foregoing, none of Sections 12.2, 12.8, 12.9, 12.15,
12.16, 12.17 or 12.18 may be amended, restated, supplemented or modified in
any matter adverse to a Debt Financing Source without the prior written
consent of such Debt Financing Source.

12.10 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction.



12.11 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each Party
will bear its own costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses)
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions (it being
understood that all Transaction Expenses shall be the responsibility of
Seller); provided, however, that Buyer and Seller shall each be responsible
for 50% of any Transfer Taxes.

12.12 Construction. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of
the provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to any Law shall be deemed
also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the
context requires otherwise. The word "including" shall mean including without
limitation. The word "or" means "and/or," unless the context requires
otherwise. All references to a Seller Entity or the Seller Entities shall be
interpreted to mean both (a) the Seller Entities as a whole, as well as (b)
each Seller Entity individually. All references to an Acquired Company or the
Acquired Companies shall be interpreted to mean both (i) the Acquired
Companies as a whole, as well as (ii) each Acquired Company individually.
Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule with respect to particular
documents or materials, the phrases "provided to Buyer", "made available to
Buyer," "delivered to Buyer" and any other similar phrases as used in this
Agreement shall mean that the subject documents or materials were posted to
the "Project Hawk" data room at merrillcorp.com established by the Seller (the
"Dataroom") or its agents at least two (2) Business Days prior to the date of
this Agreement or, with respect to matters arising following such date, on or
before the Closing Date.

12.13 Incorporation of Exhibits and Disclosure Schedule. The Exhibits and
Disclosure Schedule identified in this Agreement are incorporated herein by
reference and made a part hereof.

12.14 Disclaimer.

(a) Except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in
Article 3 (as modified by the Disclosure Schedule), in any certificate
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, neither Seller nor any other Person has
made or makes any other express or implied representation or warranty, either
written or oral, on behalf of Seller, including any representation or warranty
as to the (i) accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the
Business, the Acquired Assets or the Assumed Liabilities provided, furnished,
made available or otherwise disclosed to Buyer and its Representatives
(including any information, documents or materials made available to Buyer in
the "Project Hawk" data room at merrillcorp.com, management presentations or
in any other form in expectation of the Transactions) or as to the future
revenue, projections, prospects, profitability or success of the Business
(collectively, the "Evaluation Materials"), (ii) the Acquired Assets or the
Assumed Liabilities, including warranties of fitness for a particular use,
warranties of merchantability, warranties of non-infringement and strict
liability rights, all of which are hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
waived by Buyer, or (iii) any other representation or warranty arising from
statute or otherwise in Law, and Seller expressly disclaims any and all such
representations or warranties (and, to the extent applicable, any and all
Liability therefor), other than those representations and warranties expressly
set forth in Article 3 (as modified by the Disclosure Schedule) or in any
certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

(b) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that (i) in making its decision to enter
into this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions, Buyer has relied
solely upon its own investigation and the express representations and
warranties of Seller set forth in Article 3 (as modified by the Disclosure
Schedule), any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement and any
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement; (ii) neither Seller nor
any other Person has made any representation or warranty as to Seller, any
Affiliate of Seller, the Business, the Existing Business Products, the
Acquired Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the accuracy or completeness of
the Evaluation Materials, except as expressly set forth in Article 3 (as
modified by the Disclosure Schedule) or any certificate delivered pursuant to
this Agreement; (iii) except as specifically and expressly provided in the
representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Article 3 (as modified
by the Disclosure Schedule) or any certificate delivered pursuant to this
Agreement, that the Acquired Assets and the Assumed Liabilities are being
transferred on an "as is, where is" basis "with all faults"; and (iv) except
as expressly set forth in the representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement, neither
Seller nor any other Period shall have any Liability whatsoever relating to or
resulting from the use of the Evaluation Materials.

12.15 Specific Performance. The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that
irreparable injury for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy would occur if any Party fails to perform its agreements
and covenants set forth hereunder, including its failure to take all actions
necessary to consummate the Transactions in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, and that the Parties shall be entitled to specific performance in
such event (in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity, including
injunctive relief). The right to specific performance shall include the right
to cause the other Party or Parties to cause the Transactions to be
consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions and obligations set
forth in this Agreement. It is accordingly agreed that, in addition to and
without limiting any other remedy or right it may have, each Party shall be
entitled to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in any court of
competent jurisdiction, without any necessity of proving damages or any
requirement for the posting of a bond or other security, enjoining any such
breach or threatened breach by the other Party, and enforcing specifically the
terms and provisions of the Agreement. The Parties further agree not to assert
that a remedy of specific performance is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to
law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary
damages would provide adequate remedy. Each of the Parties acknowledges and
agrees that the right to specific performance and the other relief
contemplated herein is an integral part of the Transactions and without such
right, none of the Parties would have entered into this Agreement.

12.16 No Recourse. Subject to the rights of the parties to the Debt Commitment
Letters under the terms thereof, none of the Parties, nor any of their
respective Affiliates, solely in their respective capacities as parties to
this Agreement, shall have any rights or claims against any Debt Financing
Source, solely in their respective capacities as lenders, arrangers, investors
or initial purchasers in connection with the Debt Financing, whether at law or
equity, in contract in tort or otherwise.

12.17 Disclosure Schedule. The Disclosure Schedule and all other Schedules and
Exhibits referred to herein are intended to be and hereby are specifically
made a part of this Agreement. Matters reflected on the Disclosure Schedule
are not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be
reflected therein and the inclusion of such matters shall not be deemed an
admission that such matters were required to be reflected on the Disclosure
Schedule. Such additional matters are set forth for informational purposes
only and do not necessarily include other matters of a similar nature. The
sections of the Disclosure Schedule have been arranged for purposes of
convenience in separately titled sections corresponding to the Sections of
this Agreement; provided, however, each section of the Disclosure Schedule
shall be deemed to incorporate by reference all information disclosed in any
other section of the Disclosure Schedule to the extent it is reasonably
apparent on the face of such disclosure that the disclosure of such matter is
applicable to such other section(s) of the Disclosure Schedule.

12.18 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES WAIVES THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS
TO A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION (INCLUDING ANY CLAIM OR
CAUSE OF ACTION INVOLVING ANY OF THE DEBT FINANCING SOURCES UNDER THE DEBT
FINANCING) BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR OTHER LITIGATION OF ANY TYPE BROUGHT BY ANY OF THE
PARTIES AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY OR ANY AFFILIATE OF ANY OTHER SUCH PARTY,
WHETHER WITH RESPECT TO CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES
AGREE THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE TRIED BY A COURT TRIAL
WITHOUT A JURY. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT
THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IS WAIVED BY OPERATION OF THIS
SECTION AS TO ANY ACTION, COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHER PROCEEDING WHICH SEEKS, IN
WHOLE OR IN PART, TO CHALLENGE THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY PROVISION HEREOF. THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT
AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT.

12.19 Exclusive Venue. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES, LEGAL ACTIONS,
SUITS AND PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT MUST BE
BROUGHT EXCLUSIVELY IN THE STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN NEW CASTLE
COUNTY, DELAWARE (COLLECTIVELY THE "DESIGNATED COURTS"). EACH PARTY HEREBY
CONSENTS AND SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE DESIGNATED COURTS.
NO LEGAL ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE
BROUGHT IN ANY OTHER FORUM. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL CLAIMS OF
IMMUNITY FROM JURISDICTION AND ANY OBJECTION WHICH SUCH PARTY MAY NOW OR
HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN ANY
DESIGNATED COURT, INCLUDING ANY RIGHT TO OBJECT ON THE BASIS THAT ANY DISPUTE,
ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN THE DESIGNATED COURTS HAS BEEN BROUGHT
IN AN IMPROPER OR INCONVENIENT FORUM OR VENUE. EACH OF THE PARTIES ALSO AGREES
THAT DELIVERY OF ANY PROCESS, SUMMONS, NOTICE OR DOCUMENT TO A PARTY HEREOF IN
COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 12.7 OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE EFFECTIVE SERVICE OF
PROCESS FOR ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING IN A DESIGNATED COURT WITH RESPECT
TO ANY MATTERS TO WHICH THE PARTIES HAVE SUBMITTED TO JURISDICTION AS SET
FORTH ABOVE. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, each
of the Parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any action,
suit or Proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise against any Debt Financing Source
or any other Persons party to the Debt Commitment Letter in any way related to
this Agreement or any of the Transactions, including any dispute arising out
of the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, in any forum other
than any state or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in the
City and State of New York and any appellate court from any of the foregoing.

12.20 Waiver of Conflicts; Privilege.

(a) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that Smith, Anderson, Blount, Dorsett,
Mitchell and Jernigan, L.L.P. and other special outside counsel (collectively,
"Seller Counsel") have acted as counsel to the Seller Entities and the
Acquired Companies in connection with the negotiation



of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. Buyer hereby consents and
agrees to, and agrees to cause each Affiliate of Buyer (including each
Acquired Company) to consent and agree to, Seller Counsel representing Seller
and any of its Affiliates (collectively, the "Seller Parties") or any
director, shareholder, officer, employee or other representative (other than
Continuing Employees) of the Seller Parties after the Closing, including with
respect to disputes in which the interests of the Seller Parties may be
directly adverse to Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Acquired
Companies). In connection with the foregoing, Buyer hereby irrevocably waives
and agrees not to assert, and agrees to cause each Affiliate of Buyer
(including each Acquired Company) to irrevocably waive and not to assert, any
conflict of interest arising from (i) Seller Counsel's prior representation of
the Seller Parties, the Acquired Companies or the Business or (ii) Seller
Counsel's representation of the Seller Parties from and after the Closing.
Buyer represents that Buyer's attorney has explained and helped Buyer evaluate
the implications and risks of waiving the right to assert a future conflict
against Seller Counsel and Buyer's consent with respect to this waiver is
fully informed.

(b) Buyer further agrees, on behalf of itself and, after the Closing, on
behalf of each Affiliate of Buyer (including each Acquired Company), that all
pre-Closing communications subject to any attorney-client privilege, attorney
work-product protection or other similar protection for the benefit of the
Seller Parties, in any form or format whatsoever between or among Seller
Counsel, on one hand, and Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (including any
Acquired Company), or any of their respective directors, officers, employees
or other representatives, on the other hand, solely to the extent related to
the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the Transactions or any
dispute arising under this Agreement (collectively, the "Privileged Deal
Communications") shall be deemed to be retained and owned collectively by the
Seller Parties, shall be controlled by Seller on behalf of the Seller Parties
and shall not pass to or be claimed by Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer
(including any Acquired Company).

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a dispute arises between Buyer or any
Affiliate of Buyer (including any Acquired Company), on the one hand, and a
third party other than a Seller Entity on the other hand, Buyer shall, and
shall cause its applicable Affiliate to, assert the attorney-client privilege,
attorney work-product protection or other similar protection for the benefit
of Seller, Buyer and their respective Affiliates to prevent the disclosure of
the Privileged Deal Communications to such third party; provided, further,
that neither Buyer nor any Affiliate of Buyer (including any Acquired Company)
may waive such privilege without the prior written consent of Seller. If Buyer
or any Affiliate of Buyer (including any Acquired Company) is legally required
by order of any Governmental Body or otherwise to access or obtain a copy of
all or a portion of the Privileged Deal Communications following the Closing,
Buyer shall as soon as reasonably practicable notify Seller in writing
(including by making specific reference to this Section 12.20) so that Seller
can seek a protective order, and Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts, at Seller's expense, to assist therewith.

(d) To the extent that files or other materials maintained by Seller Counsel
that contain Privileged Deal Communications constitute property of its
clients, only the Seller Parties shall hold such property rights and Seller
Counsel shall have no duty to reveal or disclose any Privileged Deal
Communications contained in such files or other materials or any other
Privileged



Deal Communications by reason of any attorney-client relationship between
Seller Counsel, on the one hand, and any Acquired Company, on the other hand.

(e) This Section 12.20 is intended for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, Seller Counsel. This Section 12.20 shall be irrevocable, and
no term of this Section 12.20 may be amended, waived or modified, without the
prior written consent of Seller Counsel. This Section 12.20 shall not limit in
any manner Section 1.4(a)(iv)
