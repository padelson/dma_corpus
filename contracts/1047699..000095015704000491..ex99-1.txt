respective corporations and stockholders that the parties hereto consummate

with the Merger (the "Stock Issuance"); and

          WHEREAS, Parent, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, has approved
this Agreement and the Merger; and

                                  ARTICLE II

                EFFECTS OF THE MERGER; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

          SECTION 2.1 EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any shares of common stock, no par value, of the Company (together
with any associated Company Rights (as defined in Section 3.1(b)(i)), "Company
Common Stock"):

               (a) CONVERSION OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK. Each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to
Section 2.1(c), shall be automatically converted into the right to receive
0.9000 (the "Exchange Ratio") fully paid and nonassessable shares of common
stock, par value $0.50 per share (together with any associated Parent Rights
(as defined in Section 3.2(b)(i),"Parent Common Stock"), of Parent (the
"Merger Consideration") upon surrender of the Certificate (as defined in
Section 2.2(b)), which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
such share of Company Common Stock, in the manner provided in Section 2.2(b)
(or, in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, Section 2.2(i)).
As a result of the Merger, at the Effective Time, each holder of a Certificate
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Certificate immediately prior to the
Effective Time, any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to
Section 2.1(e) and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.2(c), all to be issued or paid, without interest, in consideration
therefor upon the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section
2.2(b).

               (b) CAPITAL STOCK OF MERGER SUB. Each issued and outstanding
share of common stock, no par value, of Merger Sub shall be converted into one
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.

               (c) CANCELLATION OF CERTAIN SHARES. Each share, if any, of
Company Common Stock owned by the Company or Parent shall automatically be
extinguished without any conversion, and no consideration shall be delivered
in respect thereof.

               (d) COMPANY OPTIONS. All options to purchase Company Common
Stock (each, a "Company Option") issued and outstanding under each Company
Stock Plan (as defined in Section 3.1(b)(i)) shall be assumed by Parent in
accordance with Section 5.12(a).

                                      3

<PAGE>


               (e) FRACTIONAL SHARES. No fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock will be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof Parent shall
pay to each holder of shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be
entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating
all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received
by such holder), upon surrender of such holder's Certificate(s), an amount of
cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the
product of: (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the average closing price of
one share of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE")
Composite Transactions Reporting System, as reported in The Wall Street
Journal, for the 10 most recent trading days ending on the trading day one day
prior to the Effective Time.

               (f) ADJUSTMENTS TO EXCHANGE RATIO. The Exchange Ratio shall be
adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate effect of any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with
respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock having a record date on
or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

          SECTION 2.2 EXCHANGE OF SHARES AND CERTIFICATES.

               (a) EXCHANGE AGENT. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall engage a nationally-recognized institution reasonably satisfactory to
the Company to act as exchange agent in connection with the Merger (the
"Exchange Agent"). At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, certificates
representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section
2.1(a). In addition, Parent shall make available by depositing with the
Exchange Agent, as necessary from time to time after the Effective Time, cash
in an amount sufficient to make the payments in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any dividends or distributions to which holders
of shares of Company Common Stock may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c).
All cash and Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent shall
hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund."

               (b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. Promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates"),
which at the Effective Time were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof, (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section
2.1(e) and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section
2.2(c). Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent
or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto,


                                      4

<PAGE>


and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent,
the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor a certificate or certificates representing that number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all
Certificates surrendered by such holder) to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.1 (which shall be in uncertificated book entry form
unless a physical certificate is requested), payment in lieu of fractional
shares which such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and
any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c), and the
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, a certificate representing the proper number
of shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued to a Person (as defined in
Section 8.3(jj)) other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such
issuance shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.2(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (and any amounts to be paid pursuant to Section 2.1(e) or
Section 2.2(c)) upon such surrender. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue
on any amount payable pursuant to Section 2.1(e) or Section 2.2(c).

               (c) DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED SHARES. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be
paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.1(e) hereof, until such
Certificate has been surrendered in accordance with this Article II. Subject
to Applicable Law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be
paid to the recordholder thereof, without interest, (i) promptly after such
surrender, the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in
exchange therefor pursuant to this Article II, together with any cash payable
in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to such
surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock,
less the amount of any withholding Taxes (as defined in Section 3.1(k)(xii))
that may be required thereon.

               (d) NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN COMPANY COMMON STOCK. All
shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II and any cash paid
pursuant to Section 2.1(e) or Section 2.2(c) shall be deemed to have been
issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares
of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective

                                      5

<PAGE>


Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II.

               (e) TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates six months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article II
shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any dividends or distributions pursuant to
Section 2.2(c).

               (f) NO LIABILITY. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or
the Exchange Agent or any of their respective directors, officers, employees
and agents shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Parent
Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from
the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate shall not have
been surrendered prior to five years after the Effective Time, or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which any shares of Parent Common Stock, any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or any dividends or
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock issuable in respect of such
Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 3.1(c)(v)), any such shares, cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation,
free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

               (g) INVESTMENT OF EXCHANGE FUND. The Exchange Agent shall
invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily
basis; provided that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the
amounts payable to former stockholders of the Company after the Effective Time
pursuant to this Article II. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess
of the amounts payable pursuant to this Article II shall promptly be paid to
Parent.

               (h) WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any Person who was a holder of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time such amounts as Parent or the Exchange
Agent may be required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code or any other provision of federal, state, local or
foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the
Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such consideration
would otherwise have been paid.

               (i) LOST, STOLEN OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES. In the event any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of
Parent Common Stock as may be required pursuant to Section 2.1(a), cash for
fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any dividends or distributions

                                      6

<PAGE>


payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c); provided, however, that Parent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver an agreement of
indemnification in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or a bond in such sum
as Parent may reasonably direct as indemnity, against any claim that may be made
against Parent or the Exchange Agent in respect of the Certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

               (j) AFFILIATES. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, no certificates
representing shares of Parent Common Stock shall be delivered to a Person who
may be deemed an "affiliate" of the Company in accordance with Section 5.13
hereof for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Securities Act"), and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") thereunder until such Person
has executed and delivered an Affiliate Agreement (as defined in Section 5.13)
to Parent.


                                 ARTICLE III

                        REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

          SECTION 3.1 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY. Except as
set forth in (x) the disclosure letter dated as of the date of this Agreement
and executed and delivered by the Company to Parent concurrently with or prior
to the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement (the "Company
Disclosure Letter") or (y) all registration statements, prospectuses, reports,
schedules, forms, statements, certifications and other documents (including
exhibits and all other information incorporated by reference therein) publicly
filed by the Company since January 1, 2001 and prior to the date hereof with
the SEC ("Company Public Filings"), the Company represents and warrants to

     has the requisite corporate (or similar) power and authority and all
     government approvals necessary to own, lease and operate its properties
     and to carry on its business as currently conducted, except for those
     jurisdictions in which the failure to have such power, authority and
     government approvals and to be so organized, existing or in good standing
     are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a
     Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 8.3(f)). Each of
     the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to
     do business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions which

<PAGE>


     properties makes such qualification, licensing or good standing
     necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so
     qualified or licensed or to be in good standing is not, individually or
     in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
     Effect.

                    (ii) CHARTER DOCUMENTS. The Company has delivered or made
     available to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement complete and

     this Agreement, approve the Merger and consummate the Merger and the
     other transactions contemplated hereby.

     Agreement by the Company do not, and the consummation by the Company of
     the transactions contemplated hereby and compliance by the Company with
     the provisions of this Agreement will not, conflict with, result in any
     violation or breach of or default (with or without notice or lapse of

     such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, rights, losses,
     restrictions or Liens, or failure to obtain consents, waivers or
     approvals, (x) except for Key Products Contracts, which are not,
     individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company
     Material Adverse Effect, and (y) with respect to Key Products Contracts,
     which are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to
     materially and adversely affect the related Key Product (as defined in
     Section 8.3(s)).

                    (v) REQUIRED FILINGS OR CONSENTS. No consent, approval,

               and any applicable filings or notifications under the

               (1)  a proxy statement relating to the Company Stockholder

                    statement relating to the Parent Stockholder Approval (as
                    defined in Section 3.2(c)(iii)), in each case as amended
                    or supplemented from time to time, the "Joint Proxy
                    Statement");

               (2)  such reports under Sections 13, 15(d) and 16 of the
                    Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange

               the failure of which to be made, obtained, performed or given
               are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to
               have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

          (d)  SEC DOCUMENTS; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

                    (i) The Company has filed with the SEC all registration
     statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements,
     certifications and other documents (including exhibits and all other
     information incorporated by reference therein) required to be so filed by
     the Company since January 1, 2001 (excluding the Joint Proxy Statement,
     the "Company SEC Documents"). As of its respective date, each Company SEC
     Document complied in all material respects with the requirements of the

                                      12

<PAGE>


     Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, the
     Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("SOX") and the rules and regulations of the
     SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Document, in
     each case to the extent in effect on the date of filing. Each Company SEC
     Document did not, when filed, contain any untrue statement of a material
     fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
     necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
     circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except to the
     extent corrected by a subsequently filed Company SEC Document filed with
     the SEC prior to the date hereof. No Subsidiary of the Company is subject
     to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.

                    (ii) Each of the principal executive officer of the
     Company and the principal financial officer of the Company (or each
     former principal executive officer of the Company and each former
     principal financial officer of the Company, as applicable) has made all
     certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act
     or Sections 302 and 906 of SOX and the rules and regulations of the SEC
     promulgated thereunder with respect to the Company SEC Documents, and to
     the Knowledge of the Company, the statements contained in such
     certifications are true and correct. For purposes of the preceding
     sentence and Section 3.2(d)(ii) hereof, "principal executive officer" and
     "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms
     in SOX. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding,
     or has arranged any outstanding, "extensions of credit" to directors or
     executive officers within the meaning of Section 402 of SOX.

                    (iii) The consolidated financial statements of the Company
     included in the Company SEC Documents comply as to form, as of their
     respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with
     applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
     regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in
     accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles
     ("GAAP") (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by
     Form 10-Q or 8-K or the applicable rules of the SEC) applied on a
     consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
     in the notes thereto) and fairly present the consolidated financial
     position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates
     thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows
     for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements,
     to normal year-end audit adjustments which are not material). The books
     and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being,
     maintained in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and
     accounting requirements and reflect only actual transactions.

                    (iv) Except as adequately reflected or reserved against in
     the balance sheet of the Company, dated December 31, 2003, included in
     the Form 10-K filed by the Company with the SEC on March 15, 2004 (such
     Form 10-K, the "Company 10-K" and such balance sheet, including the notes
     thereto, the "Company Balance Sheet"), neither the Company nor any of its
     Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether
     absolute, accrued,

                                      13

<PAGE>


     contingent or otherwise) required by GAAP to be set forth on a
     consolidated balance sheet or notes thereto of the Company and its
     consolidated Subsidiaries, except for liabilities or obligations (A)
     incurred since December 31, 2003 in the ordinary course of business
     consistent with past practice which are not, individually or in the
     aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or
     (B) liabilities and obligations incurred in connection with this
     Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

                    (v) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
     party to, or has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture,
     off-balance sheet, partnership or any similar contract or arrangement
     (including any contract or arrangement relating to any transaction or
     relationship between or among the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on
     the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate (as defined in Section
     8.3(a)), including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
     purpose entity or Person, on the other hand or any "off-balance sheet
     arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC),
     where the result, purpose or intended effect of such contract or
     arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving,
     or material liabilities of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the
     Company's or such Subsidiary's published financial statements or other
     Company SEC Documents.

                    (vi) The Company maintains a system of internal accounting
     controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions
     are executed in accordance with management's general or specific
     authorizations; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
     preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to
     maintain asset accountability; (iii) access to assets is permitted only
     in accordance with management's general or specific authorization; and
     (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing
     assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with
     respect to any differences.

                    (vii) The Company has and will have in place the
     "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
     15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) required in order for the Chief Executive
     Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company to engage in the
     review and evaluation process mandated by the Exchange Act and the rules
     promulgated thereunder. The Company's "disclosure controls and
     procedures" are reasonably designed to ensure that all information (both
     financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by the Company in
     the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
     processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
     the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is
     accumulated and communicated to the Company's management as appropriate
     to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
     certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
     of the Company required under the Exchange Act with respect to such
     reports.

                    (viii) Since December 31, 1998, the Company has not
     received any oral or written notification of a (x) "reportable condition"
     or (y) "material weakness" in the Company's internal controls. For
     purposes of this Agreement, the terms "reportable condition" and
     "material weakness" shall have the meanings assigned to them in the
     Statements of Auditing Standards 60, as in effect on the date hereof.

               (e) INFORMATION SUPPLIED. None of the information supplied or
to be supplied by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in (i) the registration statement on Form S-4 to be filed with
the SEC by Parent in connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock in
the Merger (including any amendments or supplements, the "Form S-4") will,
when filed or at any time it is amended or supplemented or at the time the
Form S-4 becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or
(ii) the Joint Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the
Company's stockholders or at the time of the Company Stockholders' Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The Joint Proxy Statement and the Form S-4 will comply as to
form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, except that no
representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect to information
or statements with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries made or
incorporated by reference therein supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger
Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement
or the Form S-4.

               (f) ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS.

                    (i)  Since March 31, 2004 through the date hereof:

          (A)  except as permitted under Section 4.1 of this Agreement and the
               Sections of the Company Disclosure Letter relating thereto, the
               Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their business only
               in the ordinary course consistent with past practice;

          (B)  there has not been any split, combination or reclassification
               of any of the Company's capital stock or any declaration,
               setting aside or payment of any dividend on, or other
               distribution (whether in cash, stock or property) in respect
               of, in lieu of, or in substitution for, shares of the Company's
               capital stock;

          (C)  except as required by a change in GAAP, there has not been any

          are no representation or certification proceedings or petitions
          seeking a representation proceeding presently pending or, to the

<PAGE>


                    (ii) None of the material approvals, clearances,
     authorizations, registrations, certifications, permits, filings or
     notifications that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has received or

     Knowledge, any other of the Company's products have been or are being

     Knowledge (or has been notified by a Company Partner (as defined below))
     of any pending regulatory action of any sort (other than non-material
     routine or periodic inspections or reviews) against any of the Company,
     its Subsidiaries or any Person which manufactures, develops or
     distributes products pursuant to a development, commercialization,
     manufacturing, supply or other collaboration arrangement with the Company
     or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a "Company Partner") by the FDA or any
     Drug Regulatory Agency or any other duly authorized governmental
     authority which regulates the sale of drugs in any jurisdiction, except
     for such regulatory actions as are not, individually or in the aggregate,
     reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, or are not
     reasonably likely to limit in any material way or restrict in any
     material way the ability of the Company or its Subsidiaries to market
     existing products. None of the Company, its Subsidiaries or, to the
     Knowledge of the Company, any Company Partner, has knowingly committed or
     permitted to exist any material violation of the rules and regulations of
     the FDA or any Drug Regulatory Agency or any other duly authorized
     governmental authority which regulates the sale of drugs which has not
     been cured by the Company or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any
     Company Partner, or waived by the FDA or any such regulatory authority.
     To the Knowledge of the Company, the Company has remediated the issues

     applicable requirements of Good Laboratory Practices (as defined in
     Section 8.3(m)) or Good Clinical Practices (as defined in Section
     8.3(l)), as applicable, and all applicable requirements relating to
     protection of human subjects contained in 21 C.F.R. Parts 50, 54, and 56,
     except for such noncompliance which is not, individually or in the
     aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                    (v) The manufacture of products by the Company and its
     Subsidiaries is, or, in the case of any products manufactured by a
     Company Partner, to the Knowledge of the Company is, being conducted in

     (as defined in Section 8.3(n)) regulations for drug and biological
     products, except for such noncompliance which is not, individually or in
     the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
     Effect. In addition, the Company and its Subsidiaries and, to the
     Knowledge of the Company, their respective Company Partners, are in
     compliance with all applicable registration and listing requirements set
     forth in 21 U.S.C. Section 360 and 21 C.F.R. Part 207 and all similar
     Applicable Law, except for such noncompliance which is not, individually
     or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
     Effect.

                    (vi) None of the Company, its Subsidiaries or, to the
     Knowledge of the Company, any of their respective agents or
     subcontractors, has been convicted of any crime or engaged in any conduct
     which could result in debarment or disqualification by the FDA or any
     Drug Regulatory Agency, and there are no proceedings pending or, to the
     Knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing that reasonably might be
     expected to result in criminal liability or debarment or disqualification
     by the FDA or any Drug Regulatory Agency.

               (j) BENEFIT PLANS.

                    (i) Section 3.1(j)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter
     sets forth a true and complete list of each bonus, pension, profit
     sharing, deferred compensation, incentive compensation, stock ownership,
     stock purchase, stock option or other equity compensation, phantom stock,
     stock-related or performance award, retirement, vacation, severance or
     termination pay, change in control, retention, disability, death benefit,
     hospitalization, medical, life insurance, loan, fringe benefit,
     disability, sabbatical and other similar plan, arrangement, agreement or
     understanding, including each "employee benefit plan" within the meaning
     of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
     as amended ("ERISA"), maintained or contributed to, or required to be
     maintained or contributed to, by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
     or Company ERISA Affiliates (as defined in Section 3.1(j)(v)) for the
     benefit of any current or former employee, officer or director of the
     Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Company ERISA Affiliates (except
     any plan which is a Multiemployer Plan, the "Company Benefit Plans") and
     any employment agreement, consulting agreement or termination or
     severance agreement between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on
     the one hand, and any current or former employee, officer or director of
     the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, with respect
     to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may have obligations or
     liabilities (the "Company Benefit Agreements"). With respect to the
     Company Benefit Plans, no event has occurred and there exists no
     condition or set of circumstances which is reasonably likely to have a
     Company Material

                                      20

<PAGE>


     Adverse Effect under ERISA, the Code or any other Applicable Law. The
     Company has no commitment to modify, change or terminate any Company
     Benefit Plan, other than with respect to a modification, change or
     termination required by ERISA or the Code. The Company has delivered or
     made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of all Company
     Benefit Plans and Company Benefit Agreements (or, if not so delivered,
     has delivered or made available to Parent a written summary of their
     material terms) and, with respect thereto, has used reasonable best
     efforts to make available to Parent all amendments, trust agreements,
     insurance Contracts, and the most recent determination letters issued by
     the Internal Revenue Service, the most recent annual reports (Form 5500
     series) filed with the Internal Revenue Service, and the most recent
     actuarial report or other financial statement relating to such Company
     Benefit Plan.

                    (ii) Each Company Benefit Plan and Company Benefit
     Agreement has been administered and operated in accordance with its
     terms, the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other Applicable
     Law and the terms of all applicable collective bargaining agreements,
     except where the failure to be so administered or operated is not,
     individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company
     Material Adverse Effect. Each Company Benefit Plan that is an "employee
     pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) and that is
     intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has obtained a
     favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service that the
     Company Benefit Plan is so qualified and all related trusts are exempt
     from U.S. federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code, and,
     to the Knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred, whether by action
     or by failure to act, which could reasonably be expected to cause the
     loss of such qualification or exemption.

                    (iii) To the Knowledge of the Company, no oral or written
     representation or commitment with respect to any material aspect of any
     Company Benefit Plan has been made to an employee or former employee,
     officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by an
     authorized Company employee that is not materially in accordance with the
     written or otherwise pre-existing terms and provisions of such Company
     Benefit Plans.

                    (iv) Except as is not, individually or in the aggregate,
     reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, there are no
     unresolved claims or disputes under the terms of, or in connection with,
     any Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement (other than routine
     undisputed claims for benefits), and no action, legal or otherwise, has
     been commenced or threatened with respect to any claim or otherwise in
     connection with a Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement.

                    (v) None of the Company Benefit Plans is subject to
     Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. None of the

                                      21

<PAGE>


     Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person under common control
     within the meaning of Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code with
     the Company (a "Company ERISA Affiliate") participates in, or is required
     to contribute to, any Multiemployer Plan. As of the date of this
     Agreement, none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Company ERISA
     Affiliates has, with respect to any Multiemployer Plan, (1) incurred,
     during the last five years, a "complete withdrawal" or a "partial
     withdrawal" (as such terms are defined in Sections 4203 and 4205,
     respectively, of ERISA) or (2) received any written notice or
     communication from the plan administrator of such Multiemployer Plan that
     could reasonably be expected to result in any liability of the Company,
     any of its Subsidiaries or Company ERISA Affiliates under Title IV of
     ERISA in connection with any withdrawal from such Multiemployer Plan.

                    (vi) No Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement
     provides health benefits (whether or not insured) with respect to
     employees or former employees (or any of their beneficiaries) of the
     Company or any of its Subsidiaries after retirement or other termination
     of service (other than coverage or benefits (A) required to be provided
     under Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or similar Applicable Law or (B) the
     full cost of which is borne by the employee or former employee (or any of
     their beneficiaries)).

                    (vii) Neither the negotiation and execution of this
     Agreement, the Company Stockholder Approval, nor the consummation of the
     transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or upon the
     occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an event
     under any Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement that will or
     may result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise),
     acceleration of payment, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting,
     distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits with
     respect to any current or former employee, officer or director of the
     Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There is no contract, agreement, plan
     or arrangement with any current or former employee, officer or director
     of the Company to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
     as of the date of this Agreement, that, individually or collectively and
     as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby (whether alone or
     upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) or otherwise,
     is reasonably likely to give rise to the payment of any amount that would
     not be deductible pursuant to Sections 280G or 162(m) of the Code or any
     corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax
     law.

                    (viii) All Company Benefit Plans and Company Benefit
     Agreements that are subject to the laws of any jurisdiction outside the
     United States (i) have been operated in accordance with their terms in
     all respects, except for those failures to operate the Company Benefit
     Plans and Company Benefit Agreements in accordance with their terms that
     are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a
     Company Material Adverse Effect, and (ii) are in compliance with all such
     applicable laws, including relevant tax laws,

                                      22

<PAGE>


     except for those failures to comply with such applicable laws that are
     not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a
     Company Material Adverse Effect.

                    (ix) The Company has provided to Parent true, complete and
     correct copies of all indemnification agreements with its officers and
     directors and the officers and directors of its Subsidiaries.

               (k) TAXES.

                    (i) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has (A) duly
     and timely filed (or there have been filed on its behalf) all material
     Tax Returns (as defined below) required to be filed by it (taking into
     account all applicable extensions) with the appropriate Tax Authority (as
     defined below), (B) paid all Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns, and
     (C) complied in all material respects with all Applicable Laws relating
     to the payment and withholding of Taxes.

                    (ii) Except for such Liens as are not, individually or in
     the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
     Effect, there are no Liens for Taxes upon any property or assets of the
     Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except for liens for Taxes not yet
     due and payable or for which adequate reserves have been provided in
     accordance with GAAP in the most recent financial statements contained in
     the Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement.

                    (iii) The most recent financial statements contained in
     the Company SEC Documents reflect an adequate reserve in accordance with
     GAAP for all Tax liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all
     taxable periods and portions thereof accrued through the date of such
     financial statements.

                    (iv) There is no audit, examination, deficiency, refund
     litigation or proposed adjustment with respect to any Taxes other than
     those which if determined adversely are not, individually or in the
     aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
     Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice in
     writing of any claim made by a Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction
     where the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, does not
     file a Tax Return, that the Company or such Subsidiary is or may be
     subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

                    (v) There are no outstanding written requests, agreements,
     consents or waivers to extend the statutory period of limitations
     applicable to the assessment of any Taxes or deficiencies against the
     Company or any of its Subsidiaries except, in each case, with respect to
     Taxes or deficiencies, as the case may be, that are not, individually or
     in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
     Effect, and no power of attorney granted by

                                      23

<PAGE>


     either the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any
     material Taxes is currently in force.

                    (vi) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a

     of its Subsidiaries or, with respect to any or all of the Key Products,
     by any of their licensors and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there is
     no basis for any Action regarding any of the foregoing.

     such Intellectual Property, and (B) with respect to (1) any or all of the
     Key Products and (2) to the extent material, any other Company
     Intellectual Property, there is no basis for any Action regarding any of

     Property has been or is being used or enforced by the Company or its
     Subsidiaries or, with respect to any or all of the Key Products, by any

<PAGE>


     of their licensors in a manner that, individually or in the aggregate, is
     reasonably likely to result in the cancellation, invalidity or
     unenforceability of such Intellectual Property.

                    (vi) All patents and patent applications, trademark
     registrations and applications and all other applications, registrations

     Intellectual Property stand under final rejection before the United
     States Patent and Trademark Office or any equivalent foreign governmental
     entity; the Company and its Subsidiaries have taken all commercially
     reasonable measures to obtain patent rights worldwide, to the extent
     commercially reasonable to do so, under Company Owned Intellectual
     Property and Company Licensed Intellectual Property as to which they have
     the necessary prosecution rights, and have not forfeited or otherwise
     lost any right to file any material patent applications or obtain any
     material patents in any country in North America or the European Union or
     in Japan, such as by failing to meet any filing deadline or otherwise;
     the Company and its Subsidiaries have no reason to believe that the scope
     of any issued claims under any patents under the Company Intellectual
     Property should be less than the scope reflected as of the date hereof in
     such patents or that the scope of any issued claims under any patent
     applications under the Company Intellectual Property will or should be
     materially less than the scope reflected as of the date hereof in such
     patent applications.

                    (viii) The Company has provided Parent with access to all
     IP Contracts related to any or all of the Key Products, other than (i)

     of any Company Intellectual Property relating to any or all of the Key
     Products or to bring or defend any Actions with respect to Company
     Intellectual Property relating to any or all of the Key Products.

<PAGE>


                    (x) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
     entered into any consents, judgments, orders, indemnifications,
     forbearances to sue, settlement agreements, licenses or other
     arrangements in connection with the resolution of any disputes or Actions
     which (A) restrict the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' right to use
     any material Intellectual Property, (B) restrict the Company's or any of
     its Subsidiaries' businesses in any material manner in order to
     accommodate any Person's Intellectual Property, or (C) permit any Person

     permitted under an IP Contract.

                    (xi) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have
     implemented commercially reasonable measures to maintain the
     confidentiality of the trade secrets and other proprietary information
     under the Company Intellectual Property. No current or former employee or
     contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries owns or retains any
     material rights or interests in or to any of the Company Intellectual
     Property. There has not been any disclosure of any material confidential
     information of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including any such
     information of any other Person disclosed in confidence to the Company or
     its Subsidiaries) to any Person in a manner that has resulted or is
     likely to result in the loss of trade secret or other rights in and to
     such information.

               (o) LITIGATION.

                    (i) There are no suits, claims, actions, proceedings,
     hearings, notices of violation, demand letters or investigations (each,
     an "Action") pending, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened,
     against or affecting the Company or its Subsidiaries or any executive
     officer or director of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their
     respective properties, including Intellectual Property, except as is not,
     individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company
     Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries are
     subject to any outstanding order, writ, injunction or decree of any
     Governmental Entity specifically applicable to, or having a
     disproportionate effect on, the Company and its Subsidiaries except as is
     not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a
     Company Material Adverse Effect.

                    (ii) In connection with the manufacture, sale, marketing
     or distribution of the products set forth in Section 3.1(o)(ii) of the

     resolved, and (D) the Company and its Subsidiaries have never been
     notified that a user of any of the products set forth in Section
     3.1(o)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter intends to make a claim or
     commence litigation, in each case except for any Actions, claims,
     requests, payments, notices or other

                                      29

<PAGE>


     items described under clauses (A) through (D) which are not, individually
     or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
     Effect.

               (p) INSURANCE.

                    (i) The Company has provided or made available to Parent
     true, correct and complete copies of its director and officer and
     employee and officer insurance policies and all policies of insurance
     material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to which
     the Company or its Subsidiaries is a party or is a beneficiary or named
     insured. The Company and its Subsidiaries maintain insurance coverage
     with reputable insurers in such amounts and covering such risks as are
     appropriate and reasonable, considering the Company's and its
     Subsidiaries' properties, business and operations.

                    (ii) Except for such matters as are not, individually or
     in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
     Effect, no event relating specifically to the Company or its Subsidiaries
     (as opposed to events affecting the pharmaceuticals industry in general)
     has occurred that is reasonably likely to result, after the date of this
     Agreement, in an increase in premiums under any insurance policies they
     maintain. Excluding insurance policies that have expired and been
     replaced in the ordinary course of business, as of the date of this
     Agreement, no excess liability or protection and indemnity insurance
     policy has been cancelled by the insurer since January 1, 2001, and to
     the Company's Knowledge, no threat in writing has been made to cancel
     (excluding cancellation upon expiration or failure to renew) any such
     insurance policy of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company during
     the period of one year prior to the date hereof. As of the date hereof,
     to the Company's Knowledge, no event has occurred, including the failure
     by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to give any notice or
     information or by giving any inaccurate or erroneous notice or
     information, which materially limits or impairs the rights of the Company
     or any Subsidiary of the Company under any such excess liability or
     protection and indemnity insurance policies.

                    (iii) As of the date of this Agreement, the Company has
     provided any and all correspondence, documents, and other materials which
     in any way limit or reserve the rights of the Company's insurers for
     material Actions against or affecting the Company. All self-insured
     retention for all product liability Actions against or affecting the
     Company is limited in the aggregate sum for each policy year as specified
     in Section 3.1(p)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

               (q) STATE TAKEOVER STATUTES. Assuming that neither Parent nor
Merger Sub is an "interested shareholder" within the meaning of the TBCA, the
Company has taken all necessary action so that no "investor protection act,"
"business combination," "control share acquisition" or other anti-takeover
statute or regulation, in each case under the TBCA, nor any takeover provision
in the Company Organizational Documents, would (i) prohibit or restrict the
Company's ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or the
Articles of Merger or its ability to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, (ii) have the effect of invalidating or voiding this
Agreement or the Articles of Merger, or any provision hereof or

                                      30


<PAGE>


     thereof, or (iii) subject Parent to any impediment or condition in
     connection with the exercise of any of its rights under this Agreement or
     the Articles of Merger.

               (r) BROKERS AND ADVISORS. Except for fees payable to Goldman,
Sachs & Co. ("Goldman"), no broker, investment banker, financial advisor or
other Person is entitled to any broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or
other similar fee or commission in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of
the Company. The Company has provided to Parent copies of all agreements
relating to the engagement by the Company of advisors in connection with the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, including all agreements with
respect to the engagement of Goldman, lawyers, accountants and other advisors.

               (s) OPINION OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR. The Company has received the
opinion of its financial advisor, Goldman, which opinion will be delivered in
written form dated the date of this Agreement, to the effect that, as of such
date, the Exchange Ratio is fair, from a financial point of view, to the
holders of Company Common Stock. The Company will provide a copy of this
opinion to Parent solely for informational purposes promptly following the
date of this Agreement and, as of the date of this Agreement, such opinion has
not been withdrawn, revoked or otherwise modified.

               (t) FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE
SANCTIONS. To the Company's Knowledge, neither the Company, nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective directors, officers, agents,
employees or any other Persons acting on their behalf has, in connection with
the operation of their respective businesses, (i) used any corporate or other
funds for unlawful contributions, payments, gifts or entertainment, or made
any unlawful expenditures relating to political activity to government
officials, candidates or members of political parties or organizations, or
established or maintained any unlawful or unrecorded funds in violation of
Section 104 of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the
"FCPA"), or any other similar applicable foreign, Federal or state law, (ii)

or gifts, or (iii) violated or operated in noncompliance with any export

Material Adverse Effect.

          Contract with an employee or former employee, officer or director of
          the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company (other than any
          unwritten Contract for the employment of any such employee or former
          employee implied at law) which will require the payment of amounts
          by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, as applicable,
          after the date hereof in excess of $150,000 per annum;

          contract, a "Key Products Contract").

                    (ii) NO BREACH. All Company Material Contracts are valid
     and in full force and effect and enforceable in accordance with their
     respective terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
     reorganization, moratorium or other laws relating to or affecting the
     rights and remedies of creditors generally and to general principles of
     equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at
     law), except to the extent that (x) they have previously expired in
     accordance with their terms, (y) in the case of Company Material
     Contracts that are not Key Products Contracts, any failures to be in full
     force and effect which, individually or in the aggregate, are not
     reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, and (z) in
     the case of Company Material Contracts that are Key Products Contracts,
     any failures to be in full force and effect which, individually or in the
     aggregate, are not reasonably likely to materially and adversely affect
     the related Key Product. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries,
     nor, to the Company's Knowledge, any counterparty to any Company Material
     Contract (excluding the Key Products Contracts), has violated any
     provision of, or committed or failed to perform any act which, with or
     without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default under
     the provisions of, any Company Material Contract, except in each case for
     those violations or defaults which, individually or in the

                                      33

<PAGE>


     aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
     Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the
     Company's Knowledge, any counterparty to any Key Products Contract has
     (A) violated any provision of, or committed or failed to perform any act
     which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a
     default under the provisions of any Key Products Contract or (B) notified
     the Company, either orally or in writing, of any intent to breach, fail
     to perform, terminate, or not renew any Key Products Contract, other
     than, in the case of (A) and (B) above, any such violations, commissions,
     failures or notifications that, individually or in the aggregate, are not
     reasonably likely to materially and adversely affect the related Key
     Product.

               (v) REAL PROPERTY. With respect to each parcel of Material
Owned Real Property: (A) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case
may be, has good and marketable indefeasible fee simple title, free and clear
of all liens, charges, mortgages, security interests and encumbrances, except
(a) Permitted Liens; (b) easements for the erection and maintenance of public
utilities exclusively serving the properties; or (c) other easements and
encumbrances affecting the properties so long as same do not render title to
the Material Owned Real Property unmarketable or uninsurable; (B) neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, has leased or
otherwise granted to any Person the right to use or occupy such Material Owned
Real Property or any portion thereof; (C) other than the right of Parent and
Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement and as set forth in Section 3.1(v)(i)(C)
of the Company Disclosure Letter, there are no outstanding options, rights of
first offer, rights of reverter or rights of first refusal to purchase such
Material Owned Real Property or any portion thereof or interest therein; and
(D) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
agreement or option to purchase any real property or interest therein, other
than, in the case of (A), (B), (C) and (D) above, for any such case where
there is no current or reasonably likely material interference with the
operations conducted at the Material Owned Real Property as presently
conducted (or as would be conducted at full capacity).

                    (ii) With respect to each Material Leased Real Property,
     the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, has delivered
     or made available to Parent and Merger Sub a true and complete copy of
     the Lease for such Material Leased Real Property. With respect to each of
     the aforementioned Leases: (A) such Lease is legal, valid, binding,
     enforceable and in full force and effect; (B) the transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement do not require the consent of any other
     party to such Lease, will not result in a breach of or default under such
     Lease, or otherwise cause such Lease to cease to be legal, valid,
     binding, enforceable and in full force and effect on identical terms
     following the Closing; (C) there are no disputes with respect to such
     Lease; (D) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, as the case
     may be, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
     as the case may be, any other party to the Lease is in breach or default
     under such Lease, and no event has occurred or failed to occur or
     circumstance exists which, with the delivery of notice, the passage of
     time or both, would constitute such a breach or default, or permit the
     termination, modification or acceleration of rent under such Lease; (E)
     no security deposit or portion

                                      34

<PAGE>


     thereof deposited with respect to such Lease has been applied in respect
     of a breach or default under such Lease which has not been redeposited in
     full; (F) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, as the case
     may be, owes, nor will it owe in the future, any brokerage commissions or
     finder's fees with respect to such Lease; (G) the other party to such
     Lease is not an affiliate of, and otherwise does not have any economic
     interest in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (H) neither the
     Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, has subleased,
     licensed or otherwise granted any Person the right to use or occupy such
     Material Leased Real Property or any portion thereof; (I) neither the
     Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, has collaterally
     assigned or granted any other security interest in such Lease or any
     interest therein; and (J) there are no Liens on the estate or interest
     created by such Lease, other than, in the case of (A) through (J) above,
     for any such case where there is no current or reasonably likely material
     interference with the operations conducted at the Material Leased Real
     Property as presently conducted (or as would be conducted at full
     capacity).

                    (iii) The present use of the land, buildings, structures
     and improvements on the Material Real Property are, in all material
     respects, in conformity with all material Applicable Laws, rules,
     regulations and ordinances, including all material applicable zoning
     laws, ordinances and regulations and with all material registered deeds
     or other restrictions of record, and neither the Company nor any of its
     Subsidiaries, as the case may be, has received any written notice of
     violation thereof. There exists no material conflict or dispute with any
     regulatory authority or other Person relating to any Material Real
     Property or the activities thereon, other than where there is no current
     or reasonably likely material interference with the operations at the
     Material Real Property as presently conducted (or as would be conducted
     at full capacity). All buildings, structures and improvements on the
     Material Real Property are located within the lot lines (and within the
     mandatory set-backs from such lot lines established by zoning ordinance
     or otherwise) and not over areas subject to easements or rights of way,
     other than where there is no current or reasonably likely material
     interference with the operations conducted at the Material Real Property
     as presently conducted (or as would be conducted at full capacity).

                    (iv) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, as
     the case may be, has received any notice from any insurance company of
     any material defects or inadequacies in the Material Real Property or any
     part thereof, which would materially and adversely affect the
     insurability of the same or of any termination or threatened (in writing)
     termination of any policy of insurance.

               (w) COMPANY RIGHTS AGREEMENT. The Company has taken all action
so that the execution of this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not result in the
grant of any rights to any Person under the Company Rights Agreement or
enable, require or cause the Company Rights to be exercised, distributed or
triggered thereunder.

                                      35

               (x) NO IMPAIRMENT. To the Knowledge of the Company, as of the
date of this Agreement, no event has occurred and there is no circumstance
that impairs in any material respect the ability of the Company to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or is reasonably likely to prevent or
materially delay the consummation by the Company of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

               (y) STATEMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTIGATIONS. Each
communication by the Company or its representatives to Parent or its
representatives, whether oral, written, electronic or otherwise, relating to
the Investigations did not when made, and does not, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact, or omit to state a material fact necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

               SECTION 3.2 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER
SUB. Except as set forth in (x) the disclosure letter dated as of the date of
this Agreement and executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub to the
Company concurrently with or prior to the execution and delivery by Parent and
Merger Sub of this Agreement (the "Parent Disclosure Letter") or (y) all
registration statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements,
certifications and other documents (including exhibits and all other
information incorporated by reference therein) publicly filed by Parent since
January 1, 2001 and prior to the date hereof with the SEC ("Parent Public
Filings"), Parent and Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company as set
forth below.

               (a) ORGANIZATION, STANDING AND CORPORATE POWER; CHARTER
DOCUMENTS; SUBSIDIARIES.

                    (i) ORGANIZATION, STANDING AND CORPORATE POWER. Parent and
     each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation or other legal entity duly
     organized, validly existing and in good standing (with respect to
     jurisdictions which recognize such concept) under the laws of the
     jurisdiction in which it is incorporated or otherwise organized, and has
     the requisite corporate (or similar) power and authority and all
     government approvals necessary to own, lease and operate its properties
     and to carry on its business as currently conducted, except for those
     jurisdictions in which the failure to have such power, authority and
     government approvals and to be so organized, existing or in good standing
     are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a
     Parent Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 8.3(gg)). Each of
     Parent and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do
     business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions which
     recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction in which the nature or
     conduct of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its
     properties makes such qualification, licensing or good standing
     necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so
     qualified or licensed or to be in good standing is not, individually or
     in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse
     Effect.

     of incorporation and bylaws or like organizational documents of each of

     general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a
     proceeding in equity or at law).

     majority of the votes cast by holders of outstanding shares of Parent
     Common Stock at a meeting duly called and held for approval of the Stock
     Issuance in favor of the Stock Issuance and pursuant to Rule 312.03 in
     the Listed Company Manual of the NYSE (the "Parent Stockholder

     Parent capital stock necessary to approve the Stock Issuance, and no
     other vote of the holders of any class or series of Parent capital stock
     is necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement, approve the Merger and
     consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

                    (iv) NO CONFLICT. The execution and delivery of this
     Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by Parent
     and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby and compliance by
     Parent and Merger Sub with the provisions of this Agreement will not,
     conflict with, result in any violation or breach of or default (with or
     without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, require any consent,
     waiver or approval under, give rise to any right of termination or
     cancellation or acceleration of any right or obligation or loss of a
     benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
     properties or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any

     violations, breaches, defaults, rights, losses, restrictions or Liens, or
     failure to obtain consents, waivers or approvals which are not,
     individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Parent
     Material Adverse Effect.

     consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated
     hereby, except for:

          (A)  compliance with, and filings under, the HSR Act and any
               applicable filings or notifications under the antitrust,
               competition or similar laws of any foreign jurisdiction;

          (B)  the filing with the SEC of:

               (2)  such reports under Sections 13, 15(d) and 16 of the
                    Exchange Act as may be required in connection with this

               qualified to do business and such filings as may be required
               under state securities or other "blue sky" laws; and

          (D)  such consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, permits,
               actions, registrations, declarations, filings or notifications,
               the failure of which to be made, obtained, performed or given
               are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to
               have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

                    (d) SEC DOCUMENTS; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

                    (i) Parent has filed with the SEC all registration
     statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements,
     certifications and other documents (including exhibits and all other
     information incorporated by reference therein) required to be so filed by
     Parent since January 1, 2001 (excluding the Joint Proxy Statement, the
     "Parent SEC Documents"). As of its respective date, each Parent SEC
     Document complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
     Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, SOX and the rules
     and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such
     Parent SEC Documents, in each case to the extent in effect on the date of
     filing. Each Parent SEC Document did not, when filed, contain any untrue
     statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to
     be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein,
     in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,
     except to the extent corrected by a subsequently filed Parent SEC
     Document filed with the SEC prior

                                      42

<PAGE>

     to the date hereof. No Subsidiary of Parent is subject to the periodic
     reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.

                    (ii) Each of the principal executive officer of Parent and
     the principal financial officer of Parent (or each former principal
     executive officer of Parent and each former principal financial officer
     of Parent, as applicable) has made all certifications required by Rule
     13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act or Sections 302 and 906 of SOX
     and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder with
     respect to the Parent SEC Documents, and to the Knowledge of Parent, the
     statements contained in such certifications are true and correct.

                    (iii) The consolidated financial statements of Parent
     included in the Parent SEC Documents comply as to form, as of their
     respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with
     applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
     regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in
     accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as
     permitted by Form 10-Q or 8-K or the applicable rules of the SEC) applied
     on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
     indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present the consolidated
     financial position of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the
     dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash
     flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited
     statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments which are not material).
     The books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries have been, and are
     being, maintained in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal
     and accounting requirements and reflect only actual transactions.

                    (iv) Except as adequately reflected or reserved against in
     the balance sheet of Parent, dated March 31, 2004, included in the Form
     10-K filed by Parent with the SEC on June 14, 2004 (such balance sheet,
     including the notes thereto, the "Parent Balance Sheet"), neither Parent
     nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any
     nature (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) required by
     GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated balance sheet or notes thereto of
     Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries, except for liabilities or
     obligations (A) incurred since March 31, 2004 in the ordinary course of
     business consistent with past practice which are not, individually or in
     the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect
     or (B) liabilities and obligations incurred in connection with this
     Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

                    (v) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
     to, or has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture,
     off-balance sheet, partnership or any similar contract or arrangement
     (including any contract or arrangement relating to any transaction or
     relationship between or among Parent and any of its Subsidiaries, on the
     one hand, and any unconsolidated

                                      42


<PAGE>

     Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
     purpose entity or Person, on the other hand or any "off-balance sheet
     arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)),
     where the result, purpose or intended effect of such contract or
     arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving,
     or material liabilities of, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in Parent's
     or such Subsidiary's published financial statements or the other Parent
     SEC Documents.

                    (vi) Since April 1, 2001, Parent has not received any oral
     or written notification of a (x) "reportable condition" or (y) "material
     weakness" in Parent's internal controls.

               (e) INFORMATION SUPPLIED. None of the information supplied or
to be supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, when filed or at any time
it is amended or supplemented or at the time the Form S-4 becomes effective
under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement
will, at the date it is first mailed to Parent's stockholders or at the time
of the Parent Stockholders' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Joint Proxy
Statement and the Form S-4 will comply as to form in all material respects
with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder, except that no representation or warranty is made
by Parent with respect to information or statements with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries made or incorporated by reference therein
supplied by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4.

               (f) ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS.

                    (i) Since March 31, 2004 through the date hereof:

          (A)  Parent and its Subsidiaries have conducted their business only
               in the ordinary course consistent with past practice;

          (B)  there has not been any split, combination or reclassification
               of any of Parent's capital stock or any declaration, setting
               aside or payment of any dividend on, or other distribution
               (whether in cash, stock or property) in respect of, in lieu of,
               or in substitution for, shares of Parent's capital stock;

          (C)  except as required by a change in GAAP, there has not been any
               change in accounting methods, principles or practices by Parent
               materially affecting the consolidated financial position or
               results of operations of Parent; and

                                      43

<PAGE>

          (D)  no action has been taken by Parent or its Subsidiaries to amend
               or waive any performance or vesting criteria or accelerate
               vesting, exercisability or funding under any Parent Benefit
               Plan (as defined in Section 3.2(i)(i)) or Parent Option.

                    (ii) Since March 31, 2004 through the date hereof, there
     have not been any changes, circumstances or events that, individually or

     Material Adverse Effect.

     franchises, variances, exemptions, orders, consents, registrations,
     approvals and clearances of all Governmental Entities (including all
     authorizations under the FDCA and the regulations of the FDA promulgated
     thereunder) and third Persons which are required for Parent and its
     Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate its properties and other assets
     and to carry on their respective businesses in the manner described in
     the Parent SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof and as they are
     being conducted as of the date hereof (the "Parent Permits"), and all
     Parent Permits are valid, and in full force and effect, except where the
     failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation of, or the failure to
     be valid or in full force and effect of, any such Parent Permits is not,
     individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Parent
     Material Adverse Effect.

                    (ii) Parent and its Subsidiaries are, and have been at all
     times since January 1, 2001, in compliance with the terms of the Parent
     Permits and all Applicable Law relating to Parent and its Subsidiaries or
     their respective businesses, assets or properties, except where the
     failure to be in compliance with the terms of the Parent Permits or such
     Applicable Law is not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
     likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2001,
     neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notification
     from any Governmental Entity (A) asserting that Parent or any of its
     Subsidiaries is not in material compliance with, or at any time since

          and safety alerts conducted by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
          whether or not required by the FDA, and any request from the FDA or
          any Drug Regulatory Agency requesting Parent or any of its
          Subsidiaries to cease to investigate, test or market any product,
          and (C) any criminal, injunctive, seizure or civil penalty actions
          begun or threatened by the FDA or any Drug Regulatory Agency against

     Parent's material products have been or are being revoked.

                    (iii) None of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has
     Knowledge (or has been notified by a Parent Partner (as defined below))
     of any pending regulatory action of any sort (other than non-material
     routine or periodic inspections or reviews) against any of Parent, its
     Subsidiaries or any Person which manufactures, develops or distributes
     products pursuant to a development, commercialization, manufacturing,
     supply or other collaboration arrangement with Parent or any of its
     Subsidiaries (each, a "Parent Partner") by the FDA or any Drug Regulatory
     Agency or any other duly authorized governmental authority which
     regulates the sale of drugs in any jurisdiction, except for such
     regulatory actions as are not, individually or in the aggregate,
     reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, or are not
     reasonably likely to limit in any material way or restrict the ability of
     Parent or its Subsidiaries to market existing products.

                    (iv) All preclinical studies and clinical trials being
     conducted by Parent or its Subsidiaries are, or, in the case of such

     requirements of Good Laboratory Practices or Good Clinical Practices, as
     applicable, and all applicable requirements relating to protection of
     human subjects contained in 21 C.F.R. Parts 50, 54, and 56, except for
     such noncompliance which is not, individually or in the aggregate,
     reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

     its Subsidiaries and, to the Knowledge of Parent, their

                                      45

<PAGE>

     respective Parent Partners, are in compliance with all applicable
     registration and listing requirements set forth in 21 U.S.C. Section 360
     and 21 C.F.R. Part 207 and all similar Applicable Law, except for such
     noncompliance which is not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
     likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

                    (vi) None of Parent, its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge
     of Parent, any of their respective agents or subcontractors has been
     convicted of any crime or engaged in any conduct which could result in
     debarment or disqualification by the FDA or any Drug Regulatory Agency,
     and there are no proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
     threatened in writing that reasonably might be expected to result in
     criminal liability or debarment or disqualification by the FDA or any
     Drug Regulatory Agency.

               (i) BENEFIT PLANS.

                    (i) Each benefit plan, arrangement, agreement and
     understanding maintained or contributed to, or required to be maintained
     or contributed to, by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any other
     Person under common control within the meaning of Section 414(b), (c),
     (m) or (o) of the Code with Parent (a "Parent ERISA Affiliate") for the
     benefit of any current or former employee, officer or director of Parent
     or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent ERISA Affiliates (except any plan
     which is a Multiemployer Plan, the "Parent Benefit Plans") and each
     employment agreement, consulting agreement and termination or severance
     agreement between Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and
     any current or former employee, officer or director of Parent or any of
     its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, with respect to which Parent or any
     of its Subsidiaries has any obligations or liabilities (the "Parent
     Benefit Agreements") has been administered and operated in accordance
     with its terms, the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other
     Applicable Law and the terms of all applicable collective bargaining
     agreements, except where the failure to be so administered or operated is
     not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Parent
     Material Adverse Effect. With respect to the Parent Benefit Plans, no
     event has occurred and there exists no condition or set of circumstances
     which is reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect under
     ERISA, the Code or any other Applicable Law.

                    (ii) None of the Parent Benefit Plans is subject to
     Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. None of
     Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any Parent ERISA Affiliate

     As of the date of this Agreement, none of Parent, any of its Subsidiaries
     or Parent ERISA Affiliates has, with respect to any Multiemployer Plan,
     (1) incurred, during the last five years, a "complete withdrawal" or a
     "partial withdrawal" (as such terms are defined in Sections 4203 and
     4205, respectively, of ERISA) or (2) received any written notice or
     communication from the plan administrator of such Multiemployer Plan that

                                      46

<PAGE>

     could reasonably be expected to result in any liability of Parent, any of
     its Subsidiaries or Parent ERISA Affiliates under Title IV of ERISA in
     connection with any withdrawal from such Multiemployer Plan.

                    (iii) Neither the negotiation and execution of this
     Agreement, the Parent Stockholder Approval, nor the consummation of the
     transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or upon the
     occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an event
     under any Parent Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Agreement that will or
     may result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise),
     acceleration of payment, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting,
     distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits with
     respect to any current or former employee, officer or director of Parent
     or any of its Subsidiaries.

               (j) TAXES.

                    (i) Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has (A) duly and
     timely filed (or there have been filed on its behalf) all material Tax
     Returns required to be filed by it (taking into account all applicable
     extensions) with the appropriate Tax Authority, (B) paid all Taxes shown
     as due on such Tax Returns, and (C) complied in all material respects
     with all Applicable Laws relating to the payment and withholding of
     Taxes.

                    (ii) Except for such Liens as are not, individually or in
     the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse
     Effect, there are no Liens for Taxes upon any property or assets of
     Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except for liens for Taxes not yet due
     and payable or for which adequate reserves have been provided in
     accordance with GAAP in the most recent financial statements contained in
     the Parent SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement.

                    (iii) The most recent financial statements contained in
     the Parent SEC Documents reflect an adequate reserve in accordance with
     GAAP for all Tax liabilities of Parent and its Subsidiaries for all
     taxable periods and portions thereof accrued through the date of such
     financial statements.

                    (iv) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
     to any agreement providing for the allocation, indemnification or sharing
     of material amount of Taxes other than such an agreement exclusively
     between or among Parent and its Subsidiaries, and neither Parent nor any
     of its Subsidiaries (A) has been a member of an affiliated group (or
     similar state, local or foreign filing group) filing a material
     consolidated income Tax Return (other than a group the common parent of
     which is Parent) or (B) has any material liability for the income or
     franchise Taxes of any Person (other than Parent or any of its
     Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation ss. 1.1502-6 (or any similar
     provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or successor,
     by contract, or otherwise.

                    (v) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has: (A)
     agreed to make nor is required to make any material adjustment for a
     taxable period ending after the Effective Time under Section 481(a) of
     the Code by reason of a change in method of accounting or otherwise
     except where any such adjustments are not, individually or in the
     aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect;
     (B) constituted either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled
     corporation" (within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in
     a distribution of stock qualifying for tax-free treatment under Section
     355 of the Code (I) in the two years prior to the date of this Agreement
     or (II) in a distribution which could otherwise constitute part of a
     "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the meaning of Section

          SECTION 4.2 NO SOLICITATION.

               (a) The Company shall not, nor permit any of its Subsidiaries
to, nor authorize or permit any of its officers, directors or employees or any
investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other
representative retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries to, directly, or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way of furnishing
any information to any Person), or take any other action to, or which is
designed or intended to, facilitate, induce or encourage, any inquiries with
respect to, or the making, submission or


                                      56

announcement of, any Alternative Transaction Proposal (as defined in Section
8.3(c)), (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding,
furnish to any Person any information with respect to, otherwise cooperate in
any way with or knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or
implement any Alternative Transaction Proposal (except to disclose the
existence of the provisions of this Section 4.2), (iii) approve, endorse or
recommend any Alternative Transaction (except to the extent specifically
permitted pursuant to Section 4.2(d)), or (iv) enter into any letter of intent
or similar document or any contract, agreement or commitment (whether binding
or not) contemplating or otherwise relating to any possible or proposed
Alternative Transaction Proposal. The Company and its Subsidiaries will
immediately cease, and will cause their respective officers, directors and
employees and any investment banker, financial adviser, attorney, accountant
or other representative retained by them to cease, any and all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any third parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any possible or proposed Alternative Transaction.

               (b) NOTIFICATION OF ALTERNATIVE TRANSACTIONS. As promptly as
reasonably practicable (and in any event within 48 hours) after receipt of any
Alternative Transaction Proposal or any request for nonpublic information or
any inquiry relating in any way to any Alternative Transaction Proposal, the
Company shall provide Parent with oral and written notice of the material
terms and conditions of such Alternative Transaction Proposal, request or
inquiry, and the identity of the Person or group of Persons making any such
Alternative Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry. In addition, the Company
shall keep Parent informed in all material respects of the status and details
(including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such Alternative
Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry, and the Company and Parent shall
cause their respective outside legal counsel to establish a regular schedule
as reasonably agreed by Parent and the Company for telephonic conversations
between the Company's outside legal counsel and Parent's outside legal counsel
for the purpose of providing updates of such status and details. In addition,
the Company shall cause its outside legal counsel to endeavor to provide
reasonable advance notice to Parent's outside legal counsel of any meeting of
the Company's Board of Directors at which it is reasonably likely that the
Company's Board of Directors will consider or otherwise discuss any
Alternative Transaction Proposal or Alternative Transaction.

               (c) COMPANY SUPERIOR PROPOSALS. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, in the event that the Company receives
an unsolicited, bona fide written Alternative Transaction Proposal at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and it is determined in
good faith by the Company's Board of Directors (after receipt of advice from
its outside legal counsel and its independent financial advisors) that such
Alternative Transaction Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead
to a Company Superior Proposal (as defined in Section 8.3(h)), it may then
take the following actions (but only if the Company has given Parent at least
24 hours prior written notice of its intention to take any of the following
actions and of the identity of the Person or group of Persons making such
Alternative Transaction Proposal and the terms and conditions of such
Alternative Transaction Proposal and if the Company shall not have breached
any of the provisions of this Section 4.2 in any material respect):


                                      57


<PAGE>


                    (i) furnish information (including nonpublic information)
     to the Person or group of Persons (and its or their advisors and
     representatives) making such Alternative Transaction Proposal, provided
     that (A) prior to furnishing any such nonpublic information, it receives
     from such Person or group of Persons an executed confidentiality
     agreement containing terms at least as restrictive as the terms contained
     in the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of March 17, 2004, between
     Parent and the Company (the "CDA") and (B) contemporaneously with
     furnishing any such nonpublic information to such Person or group of
     Persons, it furnishes such nonpublic information to Parent (or, with
     respect to any such nonpublic information that has previously been
     furnished to Parent or its advisors or representatives, a list
     identifying such nonpublic information delivered to such Persons and its
     or their advisors and representatives); and

                    (ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with such
     Person or group of Persons with respect to such Alternative Transaction
     Proposal.

               (d) Company Change of Recommendation.

                    (i) The Board of Directors of the Company may withhold,
     withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation in favor of this Agreement
     and the Merger if (A) the Company has complied in all material respects
     with the procedures set forth in Sections 4.2(d)(ii) and 4.2(d)(iii)
     below and (B) the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably determines
     in good faith after consultation with outside counsel and independent
     financial advisors that a Parent Material Adverse Effect has occurred and
     that as a result thereof such action is consistent with their fiduciary
     duties under Applicable Law (a "Company Change of Recommendation").

                    (ii) The Company shall cause its outside counsel to
     endeavor to provide Parent's outside counsel with reasonable advance
     telephonic notice (which notice may be delivered to Parent's outside
     counsel's voicemail mailbox) of any meeting of the Company Board of
     Directors at which the Company's Board of Directors is reasonably likely
     to consider (x) whether any change, event, violation, circumstance or
     effect would constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (y) a Company
     Change of Recommendation. The Company shall cause its outside counsel to
     keep Parent's outside counsel informed in all material respects of the
     status and details of the Company's Board of Directors' consideration of
     such Company Change of Recommendation or such change, event, violation,
     circumstance or effect, including a reasonably detailed summary of
     material facts and circumstances being considered by the Company in such
     connection, and the Company shall cause its outside counsel to establish
     a regular schedule reasonably agreed by Parent and the Company for
     telephonic conversations with Parent's outside counsel to provide updates
     of such status and details.


                                      58


<PAGE>


                    (iii) The Company shall notify Parent in writing no less
     than four business days prior to any meeting at which the Company's Board
     of Directors determines (x) that any change, event, violation,
     circumstance or effect constitutes a Parent Material Adverse Effect or
     (y) to make a Company Change of Recommendation, attaching to such notice
     a current description of summaries of the material facts and information
     which the Company's executive officers, outside counsel, and independent
     financial advisors expect the Company's Board of Directors to consider as
     the basis for or in connection with making any such determination. After
     receipt of such notice, and prior to the meeting of the Company's Board
     of Directors, Parent shall be entitled to (i) submit written information,
     opinions and analyses, including those of Parent's outside counsel and
     independent financial advisors, to the Company's executive officers for
     their good faith review and consideration and (ii) meet with the
     Company's executive officers and the Company's outside counsel and
     independent financial advisors who have advised the Company's Board of
     Directors on the relevant matters, who shall engage in good faith
     discussions with Parent and its outside counsel and independent financial
     advisors regarding the consideration by the Company Board of Directors of
     such determination; provided, however, that nothing in this Section
     4.2(d) shall require the Company to disclose any information, opinions or
     analyses that would result in the loss of attorney-client privilege.

               (e) PARENT CHANGE OF RECOMMENDATION.

                    (i) The Board of Directors of Parent may withhold,
     withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation in favor of the Stock
     Issuance if (A) Parent has complied in all material respects with the
     procedures set forth in Sections 4.2(e)(ii) and 4.2(e)(iii) below and (B)
     the Board of Directors of Parent reasonably determines in good faith
     after consultation with outside counsel and independent financial
     advisors that a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred and that as
     a result thereof such action is consistent with their fiduciary duties
     under Applicable Law (a "Parent Change of Recommendation").

                    (ii) Parent shall cause its outside counsel to endeavor to
     provide the Company's outside counsel with reasonable advance telephonic
     notice (which notice may be delivered to Company's outside counsel's
     voicemail mailbox) of any meeting of the Parent Board of Directors at
     which the Parent Board of Directors is reasonably likely to consider (x)
     whether any change, event, violation, circumstance or effect would
     constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect or (y) a Parent Change of
     Recommendation. Parent shall cause its outside counsel to keep the
     Company's outside counsel informed in all material respects of the status
     and details of the Parent Board of Directors' consideration of such
     Parent Change of Recommendation or such change, event, violation,
     circumstance or effect, including a reasonably detailed summary of
     material facts and circumstances being considered by Parent in such
     connection, and Parent shall cause its outside counsel to establish a
     regular schedule reasonably agreed by


                                      59


<PAGE>


          Parent and the Company for telephonic conversations with the
          Company's outside counsel to provide updates of such status and
          details.

                    (iii) Parent shall notify the Company in writing no less
     than four business days prior to any meeting at which Parent's Board of
     Directors determines (x) that any change, event, violation, circumstance
     or effect constitutes a Company Material Adverse Effect or (y) to make a
     Parent Change of Recommendation, attaching to such notice a current
     description of summaries of the material facts and information which
     Parent's executive officers, outside counsel, and independent financial
     advisors expect the Parent Board of Directors to consider as the basis
     for or in connection with making any such determination. After receipt of
     such notice, and prior to the meeting of Parent's Board of Directors, the
     Company shall be entitled to (i) submit written information, opinions and
     analyses, including those of the Company's outside counsel and
     independent financial advisors, to Parent's executive officers for their
     good faith review and consideration and (ii) meet with Parent's executive
     officers and Parent's outside counsel and independent financial advisors
     who have advised the Parent Board of Directors on the relevant matters,
     who shall engage in good faith discussions with the Company and its
     outside counsel and independent financial advisors regarding the
     consideration by the Parent Board of Directors of such determination;
     provided, however, that nothing in this Section 4.2(e) shall require
     Parent to disclose any information, opinions or analyses that would
     result in the loss of attorney-client privilege.

               (f) COMPLIANCE WITH TENDER OFFER RULES. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or Parent or their respective Boards
of Directors from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act to
the extent applicable; provided that the Company shall not effect, or disclose
pursuant to such Rules or otherwise take a position which constitutes, a
Company Change of Recommendation unless specifically permitted pursuant to the
terms of Section 4.2(d) and provided further that Parent shall not effect, or
disclose pursuant to such Rules or otherwise take a position which
constitutes, a Parent Change of Recommendation unless specifically permitted
pursuant to the terms of Section 4.2(e).


                                  ARTICLE V

                             ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

          SECTION 5.1 PREPARATION OF SEC DOCUMENTS; STOCKHOLDERS' MEETINGS.

               (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the
Joint Proxy Statement, and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the Form
S-4, in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each
of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the
Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as


                                      60


<PAGE>


practicable after such filing. Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to Parent's stockholders, and the
Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the Company's stockholders, in each case as promptly
as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities
Act. Parent shall also take any action (other than qualifying to do business
in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or to file a general
consent to service of process) required to be taken under any applicable state
securities laws in connection with the issuance of shares of Parent Common
Stock in the Merger and the conversion of Company Options into options to
acquire Parent Common Stock, and the Company shall furnish all information
concerning the Company and the holders of Company Common Stock as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action. No filing of, or
amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement will be
made by Parent or the Company without the other party's prior consent (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and without providing the other
party the opportunity to review and comment thereon. Parent will advise the
Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Form
S-4 has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the
issuance of any stop order, or the suspension of the qualification of the
Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction, and each party will advise the other promptly of any
request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4
or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for
additional information. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
information (including any Company Change of Recommendation or Parent Change
of Recommendation) relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their
respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should become known to Parent or
the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of
the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated to the
stockholders of Parent and the Company.

               (b) Each of the Company and Parent shall, as promptly as
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act,
take all action necessary in accordance with Applicable Law and the Company
Organizational Documents, in the case of the Company, and the Parent
Organizational Documents, in the case of Parent, to duly give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as practicable to
consider, in the case of Parent, the Stock Issuance (the "Parent Stockholders'
Meeting") and, in the case of the Company, the adoption and approval of this
Agreement and the Merger (the "Company Stockholders' Meeting"). Unless there
has been a Company Change of Recommendation (in the case of the Company) or
Parent Change of Recommendation (in the case of Parent), as the case may be,
each of the Company and Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to solicit
from its stockholders proxies in favor of, in the case of Parent, the Stock
Issuance, and, in the case of the Company, the adoption and approval of this
Agreement and the Merger, and will take all other action necessary or
advisable to secure the vote or consent of its stockholders required by the
rules of the NYSE or Applicable Law to obtain such approvals. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company or Parent
may adjourn or postpone


                                      61


<PAGE>


the Company Stockholders' Meeting or Parent Stockholders' Meeting, as the case
may be, to the extent necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or
amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement is provided to its respective
stockholders in advance of a vote on, in the case of Parent, the Stock
Issuance, and, in the case of the Company, the approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the Merger, or, if, as of the time for which the Company
Stockholders' Meeting or Parent Stockholders' Meeting, as the case may be, is
originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock or
Parent Common Stock, as the case may be, represented (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such
meeting. Unless there has been a Company Change of Recommendation (in the case
of the Company) or a Parent Change of Recommendation (in the case of Parent),
each of the Company and Parent shall ensure that the Company Stockholders'
Meeting and the Parent Stockholders' Meeting, respectively, is called,
noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited in
connection with the Company Stockholders' Meeting or Parent Stockholders'
Meeting, as the case may be, are solicited in compliance with Applicable Law,
the rules of the NYSE and, in the case of the Company, the Company
Organizational Documents, and, in the case of Parent, the Parent
Organizational Documents. Without the prior written consent of Parent,
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger is the only matter
which the Company shall propose to be acted on by the Company's stockholders
at the Company Stockholders' Meeting. Without the prior written consent of the
Company (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), approval of the Stock
Issuance is the only matter which Parent shall propose to be acted on by
Parent's stockholders at the Parent Stockholders' Meeting.

               (c) Unless there has been a Company Change of Recommendation
(in the case of the Company) or a Parent Change of Recommendation (in the case
of Parent), each of the Company and Parent will use its reasonable best
efforts to hold the Company Stockholders' Meeting and Parent Stockholders'
Meeting, respectively, on the same date as the other party and as soon as
reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement.

               (d) Unless there has been a Company Change of Recommendation
(in the case of the Company) or a Parent Change of Recommendation (in the case
of Parent): (i) the Board of Directors of each of the Company and Parent shall
recommend that its stockholders vote in favor of, in the case of the Company,
the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger at the Company
Stockholders' Meeting, and, in the case of Parent, the Stock Issuance at the
Parent Stockholders' Meeting, (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement shall include a
statement to the effect that the Board of Directors of (A) Parent has
recommended that Parent's stockholders vote in favor of the Stock Issuance at
the Parents' Stockholder Meeting and (B) the Company has recommended that the
Company's stockholders vote in favor of approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the Merger at the Company Stockholders' Meeting and (iii)
neither the Board of Directors of the Company or Parent nor any committee
thereof shall withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw,
amend or modify in a manner adverse to the other party, the recommendation of
its respective Board of Directors that the respective stockholders of the
Company or Parent vote in favor of, in the case of the Company, the approval
and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger, and, in the case of Parent, the
Stock Issuance.

<PAGE>


          SECTION 5.2 ACCOUNTANT'S LETTERS AND CONSENTS.

               (a) Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause to be delivered to the other party two letters from
their respective independent accountants, one dated approximately as of the
date the Form S-4 is declared effective and one dated approximately as of the
Closing Date, each addressed to the other party, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the other party and customary in scope and
substance for comfort letters delivered by independent public accountants in
connection with registration statements similar to the Form S-4.

               (b) Parent and the Company will each use its reasonable best
efforts to cause to be delivered to each other consents from their respective
independent auditors, dated the date on which the Form S-4 shall become
effective or a date not more than two days prior to such date, in form
reasonably satisfactory to the recipient and customary in scope and substance
for consents delivered by independent public accountants in connection with
registration statements on Form S-4 under the Securities Act.

          SECTION 5.3 ACCESS TO INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY. Subject to the
CDA and Applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and its officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, financial advisors and other representatives, full access at all
reasonable times on reasonable notice during the period prior to the Effective
Time to all their properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and
records (provided, that such access shall not unreasonably interfere with the
business or operations of the Company) and, during such period, the Company
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent
(i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document
filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or
state securities laws, and (ii) all other information concerning its business,
properties, litigation matters and personnel as Parent may reasonably request
provided, that nothing in Section 5.3(a), (b)or (c) shall require the Company
to provide any access, or to disclose any information, if permitting such
access or disclosing such information would (a) violate Applicable Law, (b)
violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality (provided that
the Company shall, upon the request of Parent, use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain the required consent of any third party to such access or
disclosure), or (c) result in the loss of attorney-client privilege (provided
that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such
access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in a loss of
attorney-client privilege). The Company also will consult with Parent
regarding its business in a prompt manner and on a regular basis. In addition,
the Company and its officers and employees shall reasonably cooperate with
Parent in Parent's efforts to comply with the rules and regulations affecting
public companies, including SOX. No review pursuant to this Section 5.3 shall
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained herein,
the covenants or agreements of the parties hereto or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties hereto under this Agreement.

          (b) In addition, without limiting the foregoing, prior to the first
date on which both the Company Stockholder Approval and the Parent Stockholder
Approval have been obtained, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
(x) to provide Parent with sufficient advance notice of intended written or
electronic communications with the Investigating Entities, plaintiff's counsel
in the Shareholder and Derivative Actions and the Company's insurers regarding
coverage of any claims or potential claims related either to the
Investigations or the


                                      63


<PAGE>


Shareholder and Derivative Actions ("Intended Communications") to allow Parent
to review and comment upon such communications, and (y) to permit one outside
lawyer for Parent (who shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company) to
attend, solely in a monitoring capacity, proposed in-person or telephonic
communications ("Proposed Meetings") with the Investigating Entities and/or
plaintiff's counsel in the Shareholder and Derivative Actions, unless in
either case the Company reasonably believes that such advance notice or such
attendance would adversely affect its ability to resolve such matters on
favorable terms. From and after the first date on which both the Company
Stockholder Approval and the Parent Stockholder Approval have been obtained,
(x) the Company shall be required to provide Parent with sufficient advance
notice of Intended Communications to allow Parent to review and comment upon
such communications (provided that the Company shall not be required to delay
any Intended Communication pending comment from Parent in the event that the
Company reasonably believes that such delay would significantly impact its
ability to resolve the relevant matter), and (y) the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to give Parent advance notice of any Proposed Meetings
and to permit Parent and its representatives approved in advance by the
Company to attend and participate in a reasonable manner in such meetings
(provided that Parent shall not insist on attendance at Proposed Meetings if
the Investigating Entities have requested in writing that Parent not
participate). The Company shall consider in good faith the views and comments
of Parent and its Representatives with respect to all Intended Communications
and Proposed Meetings. To the extent that the Company shall not have been
required by this Section 5.3(b) to have afforded Parent advance notice of any
Intended Communication or an opportunity to attend any Proposed Meeting, the
Company shall without unreasonable delay inform Parent of all communications
(whether oral, in writing, electronic, or otherwise) with (1) the
Investigating Entities in connection with the Investigations of the Company;
(2) plaintiffs' counsel in the Shareholder and Derivative Actions; and (3) the
Company's insurers regarding coverage of any claims or potential claims
related either to the investigations by the Investigating Entities or the
Shareholder and Derivative Actions. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything
else in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to
take any action that would violate any Applicable Law or to make any
disclosure to Parent or any other Person that would result in a loss of the
protection of the attorney client and work product privileges. In connection
with this Section 5.3(b), Parent represents that, based upon all information
made available to it as of the date of this Agreement, it currently expects to
cooperate with the Investigating Entities in a manner substantially consistent
with the cooperation afforded the Investigating Entities by the Company, but
nothing in this sentence shall in any way limit Parent's discretion with
respect to the Investigating Entities after the Closing Date.

          (c) Upon reasonable request and notice, Parent will provide the
Company reasonable access to its properties, books, contracts, commitments,
personnel and records, and Parent will respond to reasonable inquiries from
the Company regarding its business operations on a regular basis; provided,
that the foregoing shall not require Parent to respond, or to disclose any
information if responding or disclosing such information would (a) violate
Applicable Law, (b) violate any of its obligations with respect to
confidentiality (provided that Parent shall, upon the request of the Company,
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required consent of any third
party to such access or disclosure), or (c) result in the loss of
attorney-client privilege (provided that Parent shall, upon the request of the
Company, allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not result
in a loss of attorney-client privilege).


                                      64


<PAGE>


          (d) Each of Parent and the Company will hold, and will cause its
respective officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and
other representatives and Affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information in
accordance with the terms of the CDA.

          SECTION 5.4 ANTITRUST FILINGS; REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS.

               (a) Each party shall make or cause to be made, in cooperation
with the other parties and to the extent applicable and as promptly as
practicable, (i) an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
and (ii) all other necessary filings, forms, declarations, notifications,
registrations and notices with other Governmental Entities under Competition
Laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby. "Competition Laws" mean
the HSR Act, the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, as amended, the Clayton Act of
1914, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other
United States federal or state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations,
orders, decrees, administrative or judicial doctrines or other laws that are
designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade. Each party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to respond at the earliest practicable date to any
requests for additional information made by the Federal Trade Commission (the
"FTC"), the United States Department of Justice (the "DOJ") or any other
Governmental Entities, and act in good faith and reasonably cooperate with the
other party in connection with any investigation of any Governmental Entity.
Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to each other all
information required for any filing, form, declaration, notification,
registration and notice. Each party shall give the other party reasonable
prior notice of any communication with, and any proposed understanding or
agreement with, any Governmental Entity regarding any filings, forms,
declarations, notifications, registrations or notices, and permit the other to
review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the
other in connection with, any proposed communication, understanding or
agreement with any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement. None of the parties shall independently
participate in any meeting, or engage in any substantive conversation, with
any governmental authority in respect of any filings or inquiry without giving
the other party prior notice of the meeting and, unless prohibited by such
Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend and/or participate. The parties
will consult and cooperate with one another in connection with any information
or proposals submitted in connection with proceedings under or relating to any
Competition Law. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall
each use its reasonable best efforts: (i) to avoid the entry of any judgment
that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing; (ii) to eliminate every
impediment under any Competition Law that may be asserted by any Governmental
Entity so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible
(and in any event no later than the Outside Date); and (iii) vigorously to
contest and resist any such action or proceeding, including any administrative
or judicial action.

               (b) Subject to Section 5.4(c), each of the parties to this
Agreement agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties to this Agreement in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this


                                      65


<PAGE>


Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of all other necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers, consents, licenses, permits, authorizations, orders and
approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all other necessary
registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Entities, if
any), (ii) the obtaining of all consents, approvals or waivers from third
parties related to or required in connection with the Merger that are
necessary to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iii) the preparation of the Joint Proxy Statement and the Form
S-4, (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments reasonably
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry
out the purposes of, this Agreement, and (v) the providing of all such
information concerning such party, its subsidiaries, its Affiliates and its
subsidiaries' and Affiliates' officers, directors, employees and partners as
may be reasonably requested in connection with any of the matters set forth in
Section 5.4(a) or this Section 5.4(b). Each of Parent and the Company agrees
that it will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain prior to the Effective
Time each of the consents that are listed in Section 5.4(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

               (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
5.4, neither Parent nor the Company shall be required in order to resolve any
objections asserted under Competition Laws by any Governmental Entity with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to divest any of
its businesses, product lines or assets, or take or agree to take any other
action or agree to any limitation or restriction, that is reasonably likely to
result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect (determined, for purposes of this
clause, after giving effect to the Merger) or a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

               (d) The Company and Parent shall not, and shall not permit any
of their respective subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to acquire by merging or
consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or
equity in, or by any other manner, any business or any corporation,
partnership, association or other business organization or division thereof,
or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets if the entering into of a
definitive agreement relating to or the consummation of such acquisition,
purchase, merger or consolidation is reasonably expected to (i) impose any
delay (other than an immaterial delay) in the obtaining of, or increase the
risk (other than an insignificant increase) of not obtaining, any
authorizations, consents, orders, declarations or approvals of any
Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting
period, (ii) increase the risk (other than an insignificant increase) of any
Governmental Entity entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or commencing litigation seeking
such an order, (iii) increase the risk (other than an insignificant increase)
of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise, (iv) delay
(other than an immaterial delay) or prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (v) increase the risk (other
than an insignificant increase) of any of the conditions to the Merger set
forth in VI not being satisfied.

               SECTION 5.5 INDEMNIFICATION. (i) From and after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify, defend and
hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the
date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") against
all losses, claims, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys'


                                      66


<PAGE>


fees), liabilities, judgments and, subject to the proviso of this
sentence, settlement amounts that are paid or incurred in connection with any
pending, threatened or completed claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time) that is
(i) based on, or arises out of, the fact that such Indemnified Party is or was
a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) based
on, or arising out of, or pertaining to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, in each case to the fullest extent a corporation is
permitted under Applicable Law to indemnify its own directors or officers, as
the case may be ("Indemnified Liabilities"). Without limiting the foregoing,
in the event that any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation is
brought against any Indemnified Party (whether arising prior to or after the
Effective Time), (x) the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume
the defense thereof with legal counsel of Parent's choosing and neither Parent
nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to such Indemnified Party for
any legal expenses of other counsel or any expenses subsequently incurred by
such Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof; provided,
however that such Indemnified Party may employ counsel of its own choosing,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay such Indemnified Party
for reasonable legal expenses of such counsel, if under applicable standards
of professional conduct the counsel selected by Parent would have a conflict
representing the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Party in the
conduct of the defense of an action; (y) the Indemnified Party shall cooperate
with the Surviving Corporation in the defense of any such matter; and (z) the
Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement of any claim
effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed). Any Indemnified Party wishing to obtain indemnification
under this Section 5.5(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof; provided,
however, the failure of any Indemnified Party to give such notice shall not
waive any rights of the Indemnified Party under this Section 5.5 except to the
extent that the rights of the Surviving Corporation or Parent are actually
materially prejudiced thereby). In the event the Surviving Corporation does
not assume the defense of an action in accordance with this Section 5.5(a),
(A) the Indemnified Parties as a group seeking indemnification with respect to
the same or a substantially related matter may retain only one law firm with
respect to such matter except to the extent that under applicable standards of
professional conduct, such counsel would have a conflict representing such
Indemnified Party and any other Indemnified Party or Indemnified Parties; (B)
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay all expenses of the
disposition of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation to
each Indemnified Party to the full extent permitted by Applicable Law promptly
after statements therefor are received and otherwise advance to such
Indemnified Party upon request reimbursement of documented expenses reasonably
incurred, in either case to the extent not prohibited by the TBCA; provided,
however, that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking
required by Applicable Law to repay such advance if it is ultimately
determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification; (C) the
Indemnified Parties shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Surviving Corporation; (D) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay
all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties
and all costs and expenses of the Indemnified Parties in connection with
seeking and obtaining indemnification from the Surviving Corporation, in each
case promptly as statements therefor are received; and (E) Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to use reasonable best efforts to assist in the


                                      67


<PAGE>


defense of any such matter. In the event of any dispute as to whether an
Indemnified Party's conduct complies with the standards set forth under the
TBCA and the Company Charter or Company Bylaws, a determination shall be made
by independent counsel mutually acceptable to the Company following the
Effective Time and the Indemnified Party (the "Independent Counsel");
provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). Without limiting the foregoing, to the
extent that any Indemnified Party is, by reason of the fact that such
Indemnified Party is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, a witness in any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation to which such Indemnified Party is not a party, such Indemnified
Party shall be indemnified and held harmless against all costs and expenses in
connection therewith.

                    (ii) The Surviving Corporation shall not enter into any
     settlement of any claim in which the Surviving Corporation is jointly
     liable with an Indemnified Party (or would be if joined in such claim)
     unless such settlement provides for a full and final release of all
     claims asserted against such Indemnified Party.

               (b) Except to the extent required by Applicable Law, neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall take any action so as to amend,
modify, limit or repeal the provisions for indemnification of Indemnified
Parties contained in the certificates or articles of incorporation or bylaws
(or other comparable charter documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries (which as of the Effective Time shall be no more favorable to
such individuals than those maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries on
the date hereof) in such a manner as would adversely affect the rights of any
Indemnified Party to be indemnified by such corporations in respect of their
serving in such capacities prior to the Effective Time. The Surviving
Corporation shall honor all of its indemnification obligations existing as of
the Effective Time.

               (c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause to be maintained in effect the policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company as of the date of this
Agreement; provided, however, that Parent may substitute therefor policies of
at least the same coverage containing terms that are no less advantageous with
respect to matters occurring prior to or at the Effective Time, or Parent may
expand its own directors' and officers' liability insurance policy to provide
the same coverage as maintained by the Company as of the date of this
Agreement and on terms that are no less advantageous with respect to matters
occurring prior to or at the Effective Time, in each case to the extent such
liability insurance or additional coverage can be maintained annually at a
cost to the Surviving Corporation not greater than 300% for annual premiums
for such directors' and officers' liability insurance, which existing premium
costs are set forth in Section 5.5(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter;
provided, further, that if such insurance or additional coverage cannot be so
maintained or obtained at such cost, the Company shall maintain or obtain as
much of such insurance as can be so maintained or obtained at a cost equal to
300% of the current annual premiums of the Company for its directors' and
officers' liability insurance.

               (d) The provisions of this Section are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and each party
entitled to insurance


                                      68


<PAGE>


coverage under Section 5.5(c), respectively, and his or her heirs and legal
representatives, and shall be in addition to, and shall not impair, any other
rights an Indemnified Party may have under the Company Charter, the Company
Bylaws or the comparable organization documents of the Surviving Corporation
or any of its Subsidiaries, under the TBCA or otherwise. Parent shall ensure
that the Surviving Corporation complies with all of its obligations under this
Section 5.5.


          SECTION 5.6 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.

               (a) Immediately following the Effective Time and until December
31, 2005, Parent will provide, or will cause to be provided, to each person
who is employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Effective Time and who continues to be employed by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, or any of their Subsidiaries (the "Continuing Employees") (i)
compensation and benefits which in the aggregate are no less favorable than
those provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time under the applicable Company Benefit
Plans, Company Benefit Agreements and compensation practices of the Company
and its Subsidiaries and (ii) eligibility for periodic increases in
compensation and/or promotions generally consistent with then current policies
of Parent and its Subsidiaries for employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries
who are employed in comparable positions.

               (b) For a period of two years following the Effective Time,
Parent will provide, or will cause to be provided, severance benefits (based
on the change in control that will occur at the Effective Time in accordance
with the terms of the Company's severance policy) to Continuing Employees
which are no less favorable than those provided under the Company's severance
policy attached to Section 5.6(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the
"Company Severance Policy"); provided, however, that notwithstanding anything
in the Company Severance Policy to the contrary, equity awards granted to any
Continuing Employee following the Effective Time shall be governed by the
terms and conditions of the award agreement(s) issued under the applicable
Parent equity plans. Parent will comply, and will cause the Surviving
Corporation to comply, with the obligations set forth in Section 5.6(b) of the
Company Disclosure Letter.

               (c) From and after the Effective Time, each Continuing Employee
shall be eligible to participate in Parent's vacation policies; provided,
however, that the amount of vacation days per year for each Continuing
Employee shall be no less than the amount of vacation days such Continuing
Employee would have been entitled to as of Effective Time under the applicable
Company Benefit Plans or Company Benefit Agreements.

               (d) For a period of two years following the Effective Time, the
Continuing Employees will be eligible to participate in all stock option,
bonus, profit-sharing and similar plans of Parent and/or its Subsidiaries to
the same extent as employees of Parent and/or its Subsidiaries who are
employed in comparable positions.

               (e) With respect to each benefit plan of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate
following the Effective


                                      69


<PAGE>


Time, for purposes of determining vesting and entitlement to benefits,
including for severance benefits and vacation entitlement (but not for
purposes of defined benefit pension accruals), service with the Company and
its Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company and its
Subsidiaries recognize such past service) shall be treated as service with
Parent and its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that such service shall not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication
of benefits or to the extent that such service was not recognized under the
applicable Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement.

               (f) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause
its Subsidiaries to (i) waive any pre-existing conditions, exclusions,
actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any benefit plan
maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for each Continuing Employee
and his or her eligible dependents (except to the extent that such
pre-existing conditions, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting
periods would have been applicable under the comparable benefit plans of the
Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time) and (ii)
provide each Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents with full
credit for any co-payments and deductibles incurred prior to the Effective
Time (or any later transition date to new welfare benefit plans) for the
calendar year in which the Effective Time (or such later transition date)
occurs, in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements
under any welfare benefit plans that such persons participate in after the
Effective Time.

               (g) Parent will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, honor, in
accordance with their respective terms, the Company Benefit Plans and Company
Benefit Agreements, including any rights or benefits arising as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in
combination with any other event); provided, however, that, subject to
compliance with their obligations in this Section 5.6, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and their Subsidiaries may amend or terminate the Company Benefit
Plans and Company Benefit Agreements in accordance with their terms as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

               (h) Parent agrees that certain employee matters shall be
governed in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.6(h) of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

          SECTION 5.7 FEES AND EXPENSES. Except as set forth in this Section
5.7 and in Section 7.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the
Merger is consummated, except that each of the Company and Parent shall bear
and pay one-half of the costs and expenses incurred by Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company (other than attorneys' fees, accountants' fees and related
expenses) in connection with (i) the filing, printing and mailing of the Form
S-4 (including financial statements and exhibits), the Joint Proxy Statement
(including SEC filing fees) and any preliminary materials related thereto and
(ii) the filings of the premerger notification and report forms under the
Antitrust Laws (including filing fees).

          SECTION 5.8 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. The Company and Parent will
consult with each other before issuing, and will provide each other the
opportunity to review,


                                      70


<PAGE>


comment upon and concur with, and use reasonable best efforts to agree on, any
press release or other public statements with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except as either party may determine is required by Applicable
Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with
any national securities exchange or stock market. The parties agree that the
initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by
the parties.

          SECTION 5.9 LISTING. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Parent Common Stock issuable under Article II, and those shares of
Parent Common Stock required to be reserved for issuance in connection with
the Merger (including under the Company Stock Plans), to be authorized for
listing on the NYSE, upon official notice of issuance.

          SECTION 5.10 TAX-FREE REORGANIZATION TREATMENT. Parent and the
Company hereby adopt this Agreement as a plan of reorganization within the
meaning of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a). Parent and
the Company intend that the Merger will qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and each shall, and shall cause its
respective Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Merger to so qualify and to obtain the opinions of counsel referred to in
Section 6.1(g), including the execution of the certificates referred to
therein. Neither Parent nor the Company shall take any action, or fail to take
any action, that is reasonably likely to cause the Merger to fail to qualify
as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

          SECTION 5.11 CONVEYANCE TAXES. The Company and Parent shall
cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all returns,
questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real property
transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp
taxes, any transfer, recording, registration and other fees or any similar
taxes which become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement that are required or permitted to be filed on or before the
Effective Time. The Company shall pay on behalf of its stockholders any such
Taxes or fees which become payable in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement for which such stockholders are primarily
liable and in no event shall Parent pay such amounts.

          SECTION 5.12 EQUITY AWARDS.

               (a) At the Effective Time, each Company Option outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not exercisable at the
Effective Time, will be assumed by Parent. Each Company Option so assumed by
Parent under this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to, the same
terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Company Option (including any
applicable stock option agreement or other document evidencing such Company
Option) immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any repurchase
rights or vesting provisions), except that (i) each Company Option will be
exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the
number of shares of Company Common Stock


                                      71


<PAGE>


that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time (disregarding any vesting schedule applicable to such
option) multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole
number of shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) the per share exercise price
for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed
Company Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of such Company Option by the
Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. The Company shall take
all corporate action necessary, including amending any Company Option or
Company Benefit Plan, to effectuate the foregoing. Each assumed Company Option
shall be exercisable immediately following the Effective Time as to the same
percentage of the total number of shares as to which it was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except to the extent such Company
Option (either by its terms or by the terms of another agreement) provides for
automatic acceleration of vesting. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient
number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery in connection with the
exercise of the converted Company Options.

               (b) The parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to
ensure that the conversion of any Company Options which are intended to be
"incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) as provided
for in this Section 5.12 shall be effected in a manner consistent with Section
424(a) of the Code.

               (c) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent
shall deliver to the holders of Company Options appropriate notices setting
forth such holders' rights pursuant to the respective Company Stock Plans and
the agreements evidencing the grants of such Company Options shall continue in
effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required
by this Section 5.12 after giving effect to the Merger).

               (d) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall file a
registration statement on an appropriate form with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to such Company Options and shall use reasonable
best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as such Company Options remain outstanding.

               (e) Parent and the Company agree that, in order to most
effectively compensate and retain Company Insiders (as defined below) in
connection with the Merger, both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is
desirable that the conversion of Company Common Stock and Company Options into
shares of Parent Common Stock and Parent Options in connection with the Merger
be exempted from risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to
the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, and for that compensatory and
retentive purpose Parent and the Company agree to the provisions of this
Section 5.12(e). Assuming that the Company delivers to Parent the Section 16
Information (as defined below) in a timely fashion, the Board of Directors of
Parent, or a committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof (as such term is
defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a
resolution providing that the receipt by Company Insiders of Parent Common
Stock in exchange for Company Common Stock, and of Parent Options upon
conversion of Company Options, in each case pursuant to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to the


                                      72


<PAGE>


extent such securities are listed in the Section 16 Information, are intended
to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act
in accordance with the procedures set forth in Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act and the Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP SEC
No-Action Letter (January 12, 1999). "Section 16 Information" shall mean
information accurate in all material respects regarding Company Insiders, the
number of shares of Company Common Stock held by each such Company Insider and
expected to be exchanged for Parent Common Stock in the Merger, and the number
and description of the Company Options held by each such Company Insider and
expected to be converted into Parent Options in connection with the Merger;
provided that a description of any Company Options shall not be required if
copies of all Company Stock Plans under which such Company Options have been
granted, and forms of agreements evidencing grants thereunder, have been made
available to Parent. "Company Insiders" shall mean those officers and
directors of Company who may be subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act on or following the Effective Time and who
are listed in the Section 16 Information.

          SECTION 5.13 AFFILIATES. Not less than 45 days prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to Parent a letter identifying all
Persons who, in the judgment of the Company, may be deemed at the time this
Agreement is submitted for adoption by the stockholders of the Company,
"affiliates" of the Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act
and applicable SEC rules and regulations, and such list shall be updated as
necessary to reflect changes from the date thereof. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause each Person identified on such list to
deliver to Parent not less than 30 days prior to the Effective Time, a written
agreement substantially in the form attached as Exhibit 5.13 hereto (an
"Affiliate Agreement").

          SECTION 5.14 NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS. Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company and the Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent, as the case may be, of the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any
event, which occurrence or failure to occur is reasonably likely to cause
(a)(i) any representation or warranty of such party contained in this
Agreement that is qualified as to "materiality" or "Company Material Adverse
Effect" or "Parent Material Adverse Effect", as the case may be, to be untrue
or inaccurate in any respect or (ii) any other representation or warranty of
such party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect, in each case at any time from and after the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time or (b) any material failure of Parent and
Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement. In addition, Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company
and the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, as the case may be, of any
change or event having, or which is reasonably likely to have, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect or Company Material Adverse Effect, as the case may
be, on such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or which would be
reasonably likely to result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth
in Article VI to be satisfied. Notwithstanding the above, the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 5.14 will not limit or otherwise affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties, the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the
conditions to such party's obligation to consummate the Merger.

          SECTION 5.15 RIGHTS PLANS; STATE TAKEOVER LAWS.

               (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not redeem
the Company Rights or amend, modify (other than to delay any "distribution
date" as defined in the Company Rights Agreement or to render the Company
Rights inapplicable to the Merger or any action set forth in this Agreement)
or terminate the Company Rights Agreement unless required to do so by order of
a court of competent jurisdiction.

               (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not take any
action to render inapplicable or to exempt any third Person (other than Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries) from, any state takeover law or state law that
purports to limit or restrict business combinations or the ability to acquire
or vote shares of capital stock unless required to do so by order of a court
of competent jurisdiction.

          SECTION 5.16 RESERVATION OF PARENT COMMON STOCK. Effective at or
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall reserve (free from preemptive
rights) out of its reserved but unissued shares of Parent Common Stock, for
the purposes of effecting the conversion of the issued and outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement, sufficient shares of
Parent Common Stock to provide for such conversion as well as the issuance of
Parent Common Stock upon the exercise of Company Options assumed by Parent
under Section 5.12.

          SECTION 5.17 STOCKHOLDER LITIGATION. The Company shall provide
Parent with the opportunity to participate to the extent reasonably possible
in the defense or settlement of any stockholder Action against the Company and
its directors relating to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; provided, however, that no such settlement shall be agreed to

               (b) ANTITRUST WAITING PERIODS. The waiting periods (and any
extensions thereof) applicable to the Merger under the HSR Act shall have been
terminated or shall have expired. The waiting periods (and any extensions
thereof) applicable to the Merger under any applicable foreign antitrust laws,
rules or regulations shall have been terminated or shall have expired, other
than any such waiting periods the failure of which to terminate or expire are
not reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect (determined,
for purposes of this clause, after giving effect to the Merger) or a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

               (c) GOVERNMENTAL CONSENTS AND APPROVALS. Other than as required
by Section 6.1(b), all filings with, and all consents, approvals and
authorizations of, any Governmental Entity required to be made or obtained by
Parent, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries to consummate the Merger,
except for those the failure of which to be made or obtained are not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect (determined, for purposes of this clause, after giving effect
to the Merger), shall have been made or obtained.

               (d) NO INJUNCTIONS OR RESTRAINTS. No judgment, order, decree,
statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation, or other legal restraint or
prohibition, entered, enacted, promulgated, enforced or issued by any court or

the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

               (e) FORM S-4. The Form S-4 shall have become effective under
the Securities Act prior to the mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement by each
of Parent and the Company to their respective stockholders, and no stop order

               (f) LISTING. The shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to the
stockholders of the Company as provided for in Article II and under the
Company Stock Plans shall have been authorized for listing on the NYSE upon
official notice of issuance.

               (g) TAX OPINIONS. The Company and Parent shall have received a
written opinion of its respective legal counsel, Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP
in the case of the Company, and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP in
the case of Parent ("Tax Counsel"), in a form reasonably satisfactory to the
Company and Parent (each such opinion, a "Tax Opinion"), respectively, dated
as of the Effective Time, substantially to the effect that, on the basis of
facts, representations and assumptions set forth in such opinion which are
consistent with the state of facts existing at the Effective Time, the Merger
will be treated as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the
Code. In rendering such Tax Opinion, Tax Counsel may require and rely upon
customary representations and covenants, including those contained in
certificates of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and others, reasonably
satisfactory in form and substance to such Tax Counsel.

waiver at or prior to the Closing of the following conditions:

warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement and in any

contained any qualification or limitation as to "materiality" or "Parent
Material Adverse Effect" or "Parent Material Adverse Change," shall be true
and correct as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date, as
though made on and as of the Closing Date, except to the extent expressly
given as of a specified earlier date (in which case, as of such specified

to be true and correct as so made does not have and is not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably likely to have, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

               (b) PERFORMANCE OF OBLIGATIONS OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB. Each
of Parent and Merger Sub shall have performed, or complied with, in all
material respects the obligations required to be performed or complied with by

any of their respective Subsidiaries to dispose of or hold separate any
material portion of the business or assets of Parent or the Company (whether
held directly or through Subsidiaries) in any such case which is reasonably
likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect (determined, for purposes of
this clause, after giving effect to the Merger).

warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement and in any certificate

or limitation as to "materiality" or "Company Material Adverse Effect" or
"Company Material Adverse Change," shall be true and correct as of the Closing
Date, as though made on and as of the Closing Date, except to the extent
expressly given as of a specified earlier date (in which case, as of such
specified earlier date), except where the failure of such representations and
warranties to be true and correct as so made does not have and is not,

held directly or through Subsidiaries), or to compel Parent or the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries to dispose of or hold separate any
material portion of the business or assets of Parent or the Company (whether
held directly or through Subsidiaries) in any such case which is reasonably
likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect (determined, for purposes of
this clause, after giving effect to the Merger) or a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

               (e) OFFICERS' CERTIFICATE. Parent shall have received an
officers' certificate duly executed by each of the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer of the Company to the effect that the conditions set

                                 TERMINATION

          SECTION 7.1 TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to the Effective Time by action taken or authorized by the Board of
Directors of the terminating party or parties, which in the case of Sections
7.1(a), (b)(i) and (b)(ii), (c) and (d), may be taken before or after the
Parent Stockholder Approval or the Company Stockholder Approval, as the case
may be:

               (a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent, if the
Board of Directors of each so determines;

               (b) by written notice of either the Company or Parent:

                    (i) if the Merger shall not have been consummated by
     February 28, 2005 (the "Outside Date"); provided, however, that the right
     to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b)(i) shall not be
     available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this
     Agreement has been the primary cause of, or resulted in, the failure to
     consummate the merger prior to the Outside Date;

                    (ii) if a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction
     shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action
     (including the failure to have taken an action), in any case having the
     effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
     Merger, which order, decree, ruling or other action is final and
     nonappealable; provided, however, that the right to terminate this
     Agreement under this Section 7.1(b)(ii) shall not be available to a party
     which has not used its reasonable best efforts to resist, resolve or lift
     as applicable (as contemplated by Section 5.4) any such order, decree,
     ruling or other action;

<PAGE>


                    (iii) if the Parent Stockholder Approval shall not have
     been obtained at the Parent Stockholders' Meeting, or at any adjournment
     or postponement thereof, at which the vote was taken; provided, however,
     that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b)(iii)
     shall not be available to Parent if the failure to obtain the Parent
     Stockholder Approval shall have been caused by the action or failure to
     act of Parent and such action or failure to act constitutes a material
     breach by Parent of this Agreement;

                    (iv) if the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have
     been obtained at the Company Stockholders' Meeting, or at any adjournment
     or postponement thereof, at which the vote was taken; provided, however,
     that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b)(iv)
     shall not be available to the Company if the failure to obtain the
     Company Stockholder Approval shall have been caused by the action or
     failure to act of the Company and such action or failure to act
     constitutes a material breach by the Company of this Agreement;

                    (v) at any time prior to the Parent Stockholder Approval,
     if there shall have been a Company Material Adverse Effect and a Parent
     Change of Recommendation, or

                    (vi) at any time prior to the Company Stockholder

     Company Change of Recommendation;

               (c) by the Company upon a breach or violation of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent set
forth in this Agreement, which breach or violation would result in the failure
to satisfy either of the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section
6.2(b) and in any such case, such breach or violation shall be incapable of
being cured by the Outside Date, or Parent shall not be using on a continuous
basis its reasonable best efforts to cure in all material respects such breach
or violation after the giving of written notice thereof by the Company to
Parent of such violation or breach;

               (d) by Parent upon a breach or violation of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or violation would result in the failure to satisfy
the conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b) and in any such
case, such breach or violation shall be incapable of being cured by the
Outside Date, or the Company shall not be using on a continuous basis its
reasonable best efforts to cure in all material respects such breach or
violation after the giving of written notice thereof by Parent to the Company
of such violation or breach;

               (e) by Parent, at any time prior to the Company Stockholder
Approval, if (i) the Company Board of Directors determines in accordance with
Section 4.2(c) and Section 8.3(h) that an Alternative Transaction Proposal
constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and (ii) the Company notifies Parent
in writing that it intends to enter into a binding agreement for a Company
Superior Proposal; or

receipt of the Company's written notification of its intention to enter into a
binding agreement for a Company Superior Proposal, an offer that the Board of
Directors of the Company determines, in good faith after consultation with a

favorable to the Company's stockholders as the Company Superior Proposal, it
being understood that the Company shall not enter into any such binding
agreement during such four business day period, and (iii) the Company, at or

survive termination of this Agreement and (ii) that nothing herein shall
relieve any party from liability for any breach of any covenant or agreement

Agreement and (c) waive compliance by the other party hereto with any of the
agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the

forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Any

insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other failure.

          SECTION 8.5 INTERPRETATION. When a reference is made in this
Agreement to an Article, Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an
Article or Section of, or an Exhibit to, this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar
import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole
and not to any particular


                                      92


<PAGE>


provision of this Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have
the defined meanings when used in any certificate or other document made or
delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions
contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the
plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and
neuter genders of such term. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or
referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to
herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time
amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of agreements or
instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession
of comparable successor statutes and references to all attachments thereto and
instruments incorporated therein. References to a Person are also to its
permitted successors and assigns.

          SECTION 8.6 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement
and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties and delivered to the other parties.

          SECTION 8.7 ENTIRE AGREEMENT; NO THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES. This
Agreement (including the CDA and the documents and instruments referred to
herein) (a) constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and (b) except for the
provisions of Section 5.5 (which are intended to benefit the Indemnified
Parties, including Indemnified Parties who or which are not parties hereto),
is not intended to confer, nor shall it confer, upon any Person other than the
parties hereto any rights or remedies or benefits of any nature whatsoever.

          SECTION 8.8 GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflict
of laws thereof, except for such provisions where Tennessee law is mandatorily
applicable, which provisions shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of Tennessee, and provided, that the Merger shall
be governed by the TBCA.

          SECTION 8.9 ASSIGNMENT. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in
whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by either of the parties
hereto without the prior written consent of the other party. Any assignment in
violation of the preceding sentence shall be void. Subject to the preceding
two sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of,
and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

          SECTION 8.10 CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. Each of the parties hereto (a)
consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any federal court
located in the State of New York or any New York state court for the purpose
of any action or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court, and (c) agrees that it will not bring
any action relating to this Agreement or any


                                      93


<PAGE>


of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than a
federal court located in the State of New York or a New York state court.

          SECTION 8.11 HEADINGS, etc. The headings and table of contents
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The
disclosure of any matter in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent
Disclosure Letter shall expressly not be deemed to constitute an admission by
the Company or Parent, respectively, or to otherwise imply, that any such
matter is material for the purpose of this Agreement.

          SECTION 8.12 SEVERABILITY. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect, insofar as the foregoing
can be accomplished without materially affecting the economic benefits
anticipated by the parties to this Agreement. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

          SECTION 8.13 FAILURE OR INDULGENCE NOT WAIVER; REMEDIES CUMULATIVE.
No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any
right hereunder shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or
acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement
herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights and
remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive
of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

          SECTION 8.14 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND
THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, MERGER SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

          SECTION 8.15 SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. The parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any
federal court located in the State of New York or in New York state court,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity.
