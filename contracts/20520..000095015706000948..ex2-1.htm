**AGREEMENT  AND PLAN OF MERGER**

 

 

AGREEMENT  AND PLAN OF MERGER dated as of September 17, 2006 among
COMMONWEALTH  TELEPHONE ENTERPRISES, INC., a Pennsylvania corporation (the "
**Company** "),  CITIZENS COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY, a Delaware corporation ("
**Parent** "),  and  CF MERGER CORP., a Delaware corporation (" **Merger 
Subsidiary** ").

 

 

WHEREAS,  the respective Boards  of  Directors of Parent, Merger Subsidiary
and the Company have approved this  Agreement, and deem it advisable and in
the best interests of their respective  stockholders to consummate  the
merger of the Company and Merger Subsidiary on the terms and  conditions set
forth herein.

 

 

NOW,  THEREFORE, in consideration for the various representations,
warranties,  covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
agree as  follows:

 

 

 

ARTICLE  1

 

The  Merger

 

 

Section  1.01. _The  Merger._   (a) At  the Effective Time, Merger
Subsidiary shall be merged (the " **Merger** ")  with  and into the Company
in accordance with the Pennsylvania Business Corporation  Law ("
**Pennsylvania  Law** ")  and  the Delaware General Corporation Law ("
**Delaware  Law** "),  whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary
shall cease, and the  Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "
**Surviving  Corporation** ").  For  purposes hereof, the closing of the
Merger is referred to herein as the " **Closing** ",  and  the date of the
Closing is referred to herein as the " **Closing  Date** ".

 

 

(b) The  Closing will take place on the first Business Day after satisfaction
or, to  the  extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the
Merger (other than  those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing and  will in fact be satisfied at the Closing). As soon as
practicable on the Closing  Date, the Company and Merger Subsidiary will file
articles of merger with the  Department of State of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania and a certificate of  merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware, and make all other  filings or recordings required by
Pennsylvania Law or Delaware Law in connection  with the Merger. The Merger
shall become effective on the Closing Date at such  time as the articles of
merger and the certificate of merger are duly filed  as  described in this
paragraph or at such later time as is specified therein by  agreement of
Parent and the Company (the " **Effective  Time** ").  For  purposes of
this Agreement, " **Business  Day** " means  a  day, other than Saturday,
Sunday or other day on which commercial banks in  New York, New York, are
authorized or required by Applicable Law to  close. For purposes of this
Agreement, " **Applicable  Law** " means,  with respect to any Person, any
federal, state or local law (statutory, common  or otherwise), constitution,
treaty, convention, ordinance, code, rule,  regulation, order, injunction,
judgment, decree, ruling or other similar  requirement enacted, adopted,
promulgated or applied by a Governmental Authority  that is binding upon or
applicable to such Person, its properties or assets  or  its business or
operations, as amended unless expressly specified  otherwise.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

Table  of Contents

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) From  and  after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all the  rights, privileges, powers and franchises, and be subject to
all of the  obligations, liabilities, restrictions, disabilities and duties,
of the Company  and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Pennsylvania Law
and Delaware  Law.

 

 

Section  1.02. _Conversion  of Shares._   At the  Effective Time:

 

 

(a) each  Common Share held by the Company as treasury stock (the "
**Treasury  Shares** "),  including each Grantor Trust Share, if any,
distributed to the Company pursuant  to Section 1.04(a)(v), or owned by
Parent or Merger Subsidiary immediately  prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled, and no payment shall be made  with  respect thereto;

 

 

(b) each  Common Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(which, for  the  avoidance of doubt, will not include any Common Shares
canceled pursuant to  Section 1.04(a)(iii)) shall, except as otherwise
provided in  Section 1.02(a), be converted into the following:

 

 

(i) the  right  to receive 0.768 shares of common stock, par value $0.25 per
share  (" **Parent  Stock** "),  of  Parent (the " **Stock  Merger
Consideration** ");  and

 

 

(ii) the  right  to receive $31.31 in cash, without interest (the " **Cash 
Merger Consideration** ",  and  together with the Stock Merger
Consideration, the " **Merger  Consideration** ");  and

 

 

(c) each  share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to  the  Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share
of common stock  of  the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers
and privileges as the  shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital  stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

Section  1.03. _Surrender  and Payment._   (a)  Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably acceptable  to the Company
(the " **Exchange  Agent** ")  for  the purpose of exchanging certificates
representing Common Shares for the Merger  Consideration and shall deposit
with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of  the  holders of Common Shares,
for exchange in accordance with this Article 1,  the aggregate Merger
Consideration, consisting of (i) certificates  representing Parent Stock to
be issued as Stock Merger Consideration and  (ii) cash sufficient to pay the
aggregate Cash Merger Consideration. In  addition, Parent shall deposit with
the Exchange Agent, as necessary from time  to time after the Effective Time,
cash sufficient to pay any dividends or other  distributions and cash in lieu
of any fractional shares of Parent Stock payable  pursuant to Section
1.03(b). Promptly (and in any event, within two  Business Days) after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will send,  or  will cause the
Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record of Common Shares  at the
Effective Time (and make customary arrangements for the prompt delivery  to
each such holder) a letter of transmittal (" **Letter  of Transmittal** ") 
for  use in such exchange, which shall specify that the delivery shall be
effected,  and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of the  certificates representing Common Shares to the Exchange Agent.

 

 

(b) Each  holder of Common Shares that have been converted into a right to
receive the  Merger Consideration, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a
certificate  or  certificates representing such Common Shares, together with
a properly completed  Letter of Transmittal covering such Common Shares, will
be entitled to receive  therefor (i) the Cash Merger Consideration payable in
respect of such  Common Shares, (ii) a certificate or certificates
representing that number  of whole shares of Parent Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to  Section 1.02(b) and (iii) any dividends or
distributions, and any cash  in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Stock, payable at the time of such  surrender pursuant to Section 1.03(f),
and the certificate or certificates  representing such Common Shares shall
forthwith be canceled. Until so  surrendered, each such certificate shall,
after the Effective Time, represent  for all purposes, only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration payable  in  respect of the Common Shares
represented thereby and any such dividends or  distributions and cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Stock,  _subject_ ,  _however_ ,  to the 
Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay all dividends that may have been 
declared by the Company in accordance with Section 5.01 and that remain 
unpaid at the Effective Time. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any 
cash payable as Merger Consideration, in lieu of any fractional shares of
Parent  Stock or otherwise pursuant to this Article.

 

 

(c) If  any  portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the  registered holder of the Common Shares represented by the
certificate or  certificates surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a
condition to such  payment that the certificate or certificates so
surrendered shall be properly  endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and that the Person  requesting such payment shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other  taxes required as a result of such
payment (and the payment of any other amounts  referred to in Section
1.03(b)) to a Person other than the registered  holder of such Common Shares
or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange  Agent that such tax has
been paid or is not payable. For purposes of this  Agreement, " **Person**
" means  an individual, a corporation, a limited liability company, a
partnership, an  association, a trust or any other entity or organization,
including a government  or political subdivision or any agency or
instrumentality thereof.

 

 

(d) After  the  Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Common  Shares. If, after the Effective Time, certificates
representing Common Shares  are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they
shall be canceled and exchanged  for the consideration provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set  forth, in this Article 1.

 

 

(e) Any  portion of the Merger Consideration or other funds made available to
the  Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 1.03(a) that remains unclaimed by
the  holders of Common Shares six months after the Effective Time shall be
returned  to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged
his Common  Shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this
Section prior to  that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment
of the Merger  Consideration in respect of his Common Shares, and any
dividends and  distributions with respect thereto, without any interest
thereon.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation,
the Company,  Merger Subsidiary, Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be liable
to any holder  of  Common Shares for any amount paid or any shares of Parent
Stock delivered to  a  public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property laws. Any amounts  or  shares remaining unclaimed by holders of
Common Shares two years after the  Effective Time (or such earlier date
immediately prior to such time as such  amounts or shares would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any  Governmental Authority) shall, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law, become  the property of Parent free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person  previously entitled thereto.

(f) No  dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Stock with a
record  date  after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered  certificate for Common Shares with respect to the shares of
Parent Stock  represented thereby and no cash payment in lieu of fractional
shares shall  be  paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 1.06, in each
case, until the  surrender of such certificate in accordance with this
Section. Subject to the  effect of Applicable Laws, following surrender of
any such certificate, there  shall be paid to the holder of the certificate
representing whole shares of  Parent Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) at the time  of such surrender, the amount of any cash
payable in lieu of a fractional share  of Parent Stock to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Section 1.06  and the amount of all dividends or
other distributions with a record date after  the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent  Stock, and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or  other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to  such surrender, and
with a payment date subsequent to such surrender, payable  with respect to
such whole shares of Parent Stock.

 

 

(g) With  respect to any certificate representing Common Shares properly
surrendered  to  the Exchange Agent, the Exchange Agent shall, subject to
the provisions of  this  Agreement, including Section 1.03(e), mail or
otherwise transmit the Merger  Consideration in respect thereof to the
applicable holder or transferee thereof  within five Business Days (or as
promptly thereafter as practicable) of the  date  such certificate
representing Common Shares is properly  surrendered.

 

 

Section  1.04. _Treatment  of Equity Compensation  Awards. _(a)  Prior 
to the Effective Time, the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company 
(or,  if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall take all action necessary
so that  (or, in the case of clause (v) below, shall use reasonable best
efforts so  that)  immediately prior to the Effective Time:

 

 

(i) each  outstanding compensatory stock option to purchase Common Shares
granted under  the Amended and Restated Equity Incentive Plan or the Non-
Management Directors' Stock Compensation Plan of the Company (together, the "
**Company  Stock Plans** "),  any  other compensatory agreement, plan,
arrangement or policy of the Company or  otherwise (an " **Option** ") 
shall  be canceled, and Parent shall pay, or cause the Surviving Corporation

do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing  in each

and  maintained a system of internal control over financial reporting (as
defined  in  Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) (" **internal  controls**

provide reasonable  assurance regarding the reliability of the Company's
financial reporting and the  preparation of Company financial statements for
external purposes in accordance  with GAAP. The Company has disclosed, based
on its most recent evaluation of  internal controls prior to the date hereof,
to the Company's auditors and audit  committee (x) any significant

controls which are reasonably likely to  adversely affect the Company's

by Title IV of ERISA or (2) any liability under  Section 4971 of the Code
that, in each case, could become a liability of  Parent or any of its ERISA
Affiliates after the Effective Time. None  of  the Company nor any of its
ERISA Affiliates makes contributions to, or has  any  liability under, any
multiemployer plan (as defined in Section 3(37) of  ERISA).

 

 

(c) Each  Employee Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section

pending or has time  remaining in which to file an application for such
determination letter from  the  Internal Revenue Service, and the Company is
not aware of any reason why any  such determination letter should be revoked
or not be reissued. The Company  has  made available to Parent true and
complete copies of the most recent Internal  Revenue Service determination
letters with respect to each such Employee Plan.  Each Employee Plan has been
maintained in compliance with its terms and with  the  requirements

such Person's employment on or after  the Closing or (ii) any compensation or
benefits related to or contingent  upon, or the value of which will be
calculated on the basis of, any of the  transactions contemplated hereby
(alone or in combination with any other event).  The execution and delivery

hereby (alone or in combination with any other event)  and compliance by the
Company with the provisions hereof do not and will not  require the funding
(whether through a grantor trust or otherwise) of, or  increase the cost of,

aggregate, constitute more  than 15% of the consolidated assets of the

the Company or any such Subsidiary is merged into another entity, of  the 
surviving entity in such merger; _provided_   that for  purposes of Section
10.04(b)(ii)(C), each reference to "15%" in this  definition shall be deemed
to be a reference to "35%". For purposes of this  Agreement, the term "
**Third  Party** " means  any Person, including as defined in Section 13(d)
of the 1934 Act, other  than Parent or any of its Affiliates.

information (other than  material nonpublic information), in each case, in
the ordinary course of  business consistent with past practice in connection
with existing commercial  arrangements (and not in connection with any

clause (ii)); _provided_   that,  prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, nothing contained in this  Section 5.03 shall prevent the Company
from furnishing nonpublic  information to, or entering into discussions or
negotiations with, any Person  in  connection with an unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal received  from such Person if the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good  faith, after consultation with
its outside counsel and financial advisors,  that  to engage in such
discussions or negotiations or disclose such nonpublic  information would
reasonably be likely to result in a Superior Proposal,  _provided,  however_
,  that  (A) prior to furnishing nonpublic information to, or entering
into  discussions or negotiations with, such Person, the Company receives
from such  Person an executed confidentiality agreement with terms not
materially less  favorable to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement,  except that such confidentiality agreement may
contain less favorable standstill  provisions so long as the Company offers
Parent the opportunity to amend the  Confidentiality Agreement to contain the
same standstill provisions, and  (B) all such nonpublic information has
previously been provided to Parent  or is provided to Parent on a
substantially concurrent basis. The Company will  promptly notify, orally and
in writing, Parent of the receipt of (and the  material terms and conditions
thereof and the identity of the Person making  the  same) any inquiry, offer
or proposal in connection with an Acquisition Proposal  or any request (other
than in the ordinary course of business and not related  to  an Acquisition
Proposal) for nonpublic information relating to the Company  or  any
Subsidiary of the Company or for access to the properties, books or records 
of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company by any Person that the
Company  believes may be considering making, or has made, an Acquisition
Proposal. The  Company will (1) keep Parent reasonably informed of the status
and details  (including any material change to the terms thereof) of any such
inquiry, offer,  proposal or request and any discussions and negotiations
concerning the material  terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal and
(2) provide to Parent  as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery
thereof copies of all draft  agreements and all other material written
correspondence and documents sent  by  or provided to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries in connection therewith.  Nothing contained in this

taking and disclosing to the Company's shareholders a  position (or issuing a
"stop, look and listen" announcement) with respect to a  tender offer for the
Common Shares by a Third Party pursuant to Rules 14d-9  and 14e-2 promulgated
under the Exchange Act, (ii) making such disclosure  to the Company's
shareholders as, in the judgment of the Board of Directors of  the Company,
with the advice of outside counsel, may be required under  Applicable Law or
under the rules of the NASDAQ National Stock Market System  (" **NASDAQ**
"),  or  (iii) responding to any unsolicited proposal or inquiry by advising
the  Person making such proposal or inquiry of the terms of this Section
5.03  (it being understood, however, that nothing in this sentence shall be
deemed  to  permit the Board of Directors of the Company to make an Adverse
Recommendation  Change or take any of the actions referred to in clause (ii)
of  Section 5.02(b) except, in each case, to the extent permitted by 
Section 5.02(b); it being understood that any accurate disclosure of  factual
information to the shareholders of the Company that is required to  be  made
to such shareholders under Applicable Law shall not be an action prohibited 
by Section 5.02(b)). The Company will immediately cease, and cause its 
advisers and agents to cease, any and all existing activities, discussions 
or  negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal with any parties
previously  contacted ( _provided_   that the  Company may inform such
parties that this Agreement has been entered into)  and  will request the
prompt return or destruction of all confidential information  previously
furnished to any such parties.

interruption or deferment, the obligations of the Company and  its 
Subsidiaries under all Employee Plans in existence on the Closing Date in 
accordance with the terms thereof; _provided_ ,  that  nothing in this
Agreement shall be interpreted as limiting the power of Parent,  the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries to amend or terminate 
any  Employee Plan in accordance with its terms or as requiring Parent, the
Surviving  Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries to offer to continue
(other than as  required by its terms) any written employment contract or to
continue the  employment of any given employee; _provided_ ,  _further_ , 
_however_ ,  that,  until the first anniversary of the Closing Date, (i)
Parent shall continue  the Company's past practice with respect to severance
as set forth in  Section 6.06 of the Company Disclosure Schedule) and (ii) no
amendment  to or termination of the Company's Key Employee Severance Plan
shall be made  without the consent of Eligible Employees (as defined in
such  plan).

 

 

(b) To  the  extent any benefit plan of Parent (or any plan of the Surviving
Corporation  or  any of Parent's other Subsidiaries) shall be made
applicable to any employee of  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent
shall (or shall cause the  Surviving Corporation and Parent's other
Subsidiaries to) grant to such  employees credit for service with the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or  predecessors prior to the Effective Time for
all purposes under such plan,  except for purposes of benefit accrual under
any defined benefit pension plans  and except to the extent a duplication of
benefits would thereby result. In  addition, to the extent any benefit plan
of Parent (or any plan of the Surviving  Corporation or any of Parent's other
Subsidiaries) that constitutes an "employee  welfare benefit plan," as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, shall be made  applicable to any employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent  shall (or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and Parent's other Subsidiaries  to) waive all
preexisting condition exclusions and waiting periods otherwise  applicable to
such employees, except to the extent any such limitations or  waiting periods
in effect under comparable plans of the Company and its  Subsidiaries have
not been satisfied as of the date such plan is made so  applicable.

 

 

(c) If  at any  time between the Closing and December 31, 2007, the
employment of any  person who was an employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately  prior to Closing is terminated without Cause or for
Good Reason (as each such  term is defined in the Company's Key Employee
Severance Plan), Parent shall (or  shall cause the Surviving Corporation or
one of Parent's other Subsidiaries to)  pay to such employee promptly after
such termination of employment, in addition  to any other amounts due, a 
cash  amount equal to a prorated portion of such employee's target 2007 bonus
(having  terms and in amounts consistent with past practice), with such
proration based  upon the portion of the 2007 calendar year that has elapsed
at the time of  such  termination.

shall be  included) with the SEC, and Parent and the Company shall cooperate
with each  other and use their respective reasonable best efforts in
connection with the  foregoing. In addition, Parent and the Company shall use
their respective  reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement
to become effective  under the Securities Act and the Proxy Statement to be
cleared by the SEC,  in  each case as soon after such filing as practicable,
and to keep the Registration  Statement effective as long as is necessary to
consummate the Merger. The  Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Proxy Statement  to be  mailed to the Company's stockholders as
promptly as practicable after the  Registration Statement becomes effective.
Parent and the Company shall promptly  provide to each other copies of,
consult with each other regarding and together  prepare written responses
with respect to any written comments received from  the  SEC with respect to

thereof, of the time of the  effectiveness of the Registration Statement, the
filing of any supplement or  amendment thereto, the issuance of any stop
order relating thereto, the  suspension of the qualification of Parent Stock
issuable in connection with  the  Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or of any SEC request for  amendment to the Proxy Statement or
the Registration Statement, SEC comments  thereon and each party's responses
thereto or SEC request for additional  information. No amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement or the  Registration Statement shall be
filed without the approval of each of Parent  and  the Company, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;  _provided_  
that,  with respect to documents filed by the Company or Parent which are
incorporated  by reference in the Proxy Statement and/or the Registration
Statement, this  right of approval shall apply only with respect to
information relating to  the  other party or its business, financial
condition or results of  operations.

 

 

(c) If,  at  any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent or the Company
should discover  any  information relating to either party, or any of their
respective Affiliates,  officers or directors, that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement  to  the Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement, so that such documents would  not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material  fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances  under which they were
made, not misleading, the party that discovers such  information shall
promptly notify the other party hereto and an appropriate  amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed  with  the
SEC and, to the extent required by Applicable Law, disseminated to the 
stockholders of the Company.

action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper  or
advisable under Applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in the most expeditious manner

use their respective reasonable best efforts to  obtain all authorizations,
consents, orders and approvals of Governmental  Authorities and non-
governmental third parties that may be or become necessary  to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or for performance  of their
respective obligations pursuant to this Agreement, and will cooperate  fully

authorizations, consents, orders and approvals; _provided_   that the 
Company and Parent will not be permitted or required to agree or proffer to 
divest or hold separate any assets or business of the Company, Parent or any 
of  their respective Subsidiaries, or to take any other action (including
agreeing  to any condition in respect of, or any amendment to, any License or
any other  concession), that, in each case, individually or in the aggregate,
would  reasonably be expected to have an impact (whether affecting the
Company, Parent  or any of their respective Subsidiaries) equivalent to a
Company Material  Adverse Effect. The Company shall have primary
responsibility, with the  assistance and cooperation of Parent, for obtaining
all authorizations,  consents, orders and approvals with respect to the
Company's and its  Subsidiaries' Licenses; _provided_   that the  Company
and Parent will have joint responsibility with respect to the joint

are filed within  ten Business Days of the date hereof, except that PPUC
transfer of control  notifications that do not require affirmative approval
may be filed within  20  Business Days of the date hereof. Without
limitation, the Company and Parent  shall each make an appropriate filing of
a Notification and Report Form pursuant  to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly  as practicable but in no event
later than ten Business Days from the date hereof  (and each such filing
shall request early termination of the waiting period  imposed by the HSR
Act), supply as promptly as practicable any additional  information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the  HSR  Act and
take all other actions necessary to cause the expiration or termination  of
the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable.

consents, rights, certificates, orders, franchises, determinations, 
permissions, licenses, authorities or grants issued, declared, designated or

(b) Any  application to any Governmental Authority for any authorization,
consent, order  or approval necessary for the transfer of control of any
License of the Company  or any of its Subsidiaries shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Company and  Parent. Without limiting the obligations of
the Company and Parent under  Section 7.03(a), each of the Company and Parent

available for attendance  at  meetings and hearings before applicable
Governmental Authorities in connection  with the transfer of control of any
such License.

 

 

(c) The  Company and Parent shall cooperate with one another (i) in

in connection  with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and  (ii) in seeking any such actions, consents, approvals or
waivers, or making  any such filings, furnishing information required in

such actions, consents,  approvals or waivers.

investors or analysts with respect to this Agreement and the  transactions
contemplated hereby, and will not issue any such press release,  make any
such public statement or schedule any such press conference or  conference
call without the consent of the other party, which shall not be  unreasonably
withheld; _provided_   that  Parent and the Company may, without the prior
consent of the other party, issue  such press release or make such public
statement if such party has used all  reasonable efforts to consult with the
other party and to obtain the prior  consent of the other party but has been
unable to do so prior to the time such  press release or public statement is
required to be released pursuant to  Applicable Law or any listing agreement
with any applicable national securities  exchange or association.

 

 

Section  7.05. _Notices  of Certain Events._ Each  of the Company and
Parent shall promptly notify the other of:

would have been  required to have been disclosed pursuant to any Section of
Article 3 or 4,  as the case may be, or that relate to the consummation of
the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement;

 

 

_provided_   that,  the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 7.05
shall not limit or  otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the
party receiving such  notice or constitute an admission that any event
communicated is material or  could give rise to a Company Material Adverse
Effect or a Parent Material  Adverse Effect.

 

 

Section  7.06. _Further  Assurances._ At  and  after the Effective Time,
the officers and directors of the Surviving  Corporation will be authorized

take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or  Merger Subsidiary,
any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm  of  record or
otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and  interest
in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company 
acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or 
in  connection with, the Merger.

Parent, its counsel,  financial advisors, auditors and other authorized
representatives reasonable  access, during regular business hours and upon

financial advisors, auditors and other  representatives of the Company and
its Subsidiaries to cooperate with Parent  in  its investigation of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, _provided_   that  Parent shall reimburse the
Company and its Subsidiaries for any reasonable  third  party expenses
incurred by them in connection with the foregoing. Without  limiting
generality of the foregoing, the Company shall provide to Parent,  as 
promptly as practicable after the completion of each fiscal month of the 
Company, copies of the final financial and operating monthly reports
described  in Section 7.07(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. No 
access  to or disclosure of information shall be required to the extent such
access  or  disclosure would jeopardize the work product privilege or the
attorney-client  privilege of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
violate any binding  agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement (it  being  agreed that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use
their reasonable best  efforts to cause such access or disclosure to be
provided in a manner that  does  not cause such jeopardization or
violation).  Any  investigation pursuant to this Section shall be conducted
in such manner as  not  to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of

other representations or warranties, whether express or implied, other  than
the express representations and warranties contained herein or in the 
certificates to be delivered at the Effective Time. The fact that any item

Section  10.14. _Severability. _ If  any  term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is determined by  a  court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, void, illegal or incapable of  being enforced by
any rule of law, or public policy, the remainder of the terms,  provisions,
covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall nevertheless  remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance  of  the
transactions contemplated herein is not affected in any manner materially 
adverse to any party hereto. Upon such determination that any term,
provision,  covenant or restriction is invalid, void, illegal or incapable of
being  enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify
this  Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely
as  possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions 
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest 
extent possible.

C. The  undersigned has been advised that the issuance of Parent Common
Shares to the  undersigned pursuant to the Merger will be registered with the
SEC under the  Securities Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4. The
undersigned has  also  been advised that, because, at the time the Merger is
submitted for a vote  of  the stockholders of the Company, the undersigned

the  Securities Act or to take any other action necessary in order to enable
the  undersigned to make such sale, transfer or other disposition in
compliance  with  an exemption from such registration.

 

 

E. The  undersigned also understands and agrees that there will be placed on
the  certificates for the Parent Common Shares issued to the undersigned, or

LETTER AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE  REGISTERED HOLDER HEREOF AND CITIZENS
COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY, A COPY OF WHICH  AGREEMENT IS ON FILE AT THE
PRINCIPAL OFFICES OF CITIZENS COMMUNICATIONS  COMPANY."**

 

 

F. The  undersigned also understands and agrees that, unless the transfer by
the  undersigned of the undersigned's Parent Common Shares has been
registered under  the Securities Act or a sale is made in conformity with the
provisions of Rule  145 (and Parent receives the foregoing evidence of
compliance therewith), Parent  reserves the right to put the following legend

On   , the undersigned sold the shares of common stock, par value $0.25 per
share  of Citizens  Communications Company,  a  Delaware corporation
("Parent"), described below in the space provided for that  purpose (the
"Parent Common Shares"). The Parent Common Shares were received by  the
undersigned in connection with the merger of Commonwealth  Telephone
Enterprises, Inc.,  a  Pennsylvania corporation, and CF  Merger  Corp., 
a  Delaware corporation.

 

 

Based  upon the most recent report or statement filed by Parent with the
Securities  and  Exchange Commission, the Parent Common Shares sold by the
undersigned were  within the prescribed limitations set forth in paragraph
(e) of  Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Securities Act").

 

 

The  undersigned hereby represents that the Parent Common Shares were sold
in "brokers' transactions" within the meaning of Section 4(4) of the 
Securities Act or in transactions directly with a "market maker" as that term
is  defined in Section 3(a)(38) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended. The undersigned further represents that the undersigned has not 
solicited or arranged for the solicitation of orders to buy the Parent
Common  Shares, and that the undersigned has not made any payment in
connection with  the  offer or sale of the Parent Common Shares to any
person other than to the broker  who executed the order in respect of such
sale.

 

 

Very  truly yours,
