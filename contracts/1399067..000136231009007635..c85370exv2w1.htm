BACKGROUND 

   

The board of directors of each of TM and HMDF have declared this Agreement
advisable and approved the Transactions, including the acquisition by TM of
the HMDF Shares from the HMDF Shareholders through a share exchange
transaction (the " _Share Exchange_ ") pursuant to which TM will initially

Shares. 

  

The HMDF Shareholders are the direct owners of all of the outstanding capital
stock of HMDF (all such shares of capital stock are referred to as the "
_HMDF Shares_ "). 

  

The Share Exchange requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority

Stock exercise their Conversion Rights.

AGREEMENT 

   

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 

   

Share Exchange 

   

Section 1.1 _Share Exchange_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
hereof, at the Closing, each of the HMDF Shareholders shall sell, transfer,
convey, assign and deliver to TM free and clear of all Liens, all of the
right, title and interest of each such HMDF Shareholder in and to the HMDF
Shares set forth opposite such HMDF Shareholders name on _Schedule A_.
In exchange for the HMDF Shares, TM shall sell, issue and deliver to the HMDF
Shareholders free and clear of all Liens, the number of TM Shares set forth
opposite each such HMDF Shareholders name on  _Schedule B_ as well as the
other consideration set forth in Section 1.2 hereof. 

  

Section 1.2 _Payments_. 

  

(a) _Payment_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, TM shall
pay by wire transfer in immediately available funds to HMDF $150,000 on the
later of (i) the date hereof and (ii) the date that HMDF furnishes TM with
the HMDF Financial Statements; provided that (x) the HMDF Financial
Statements shall have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are
covered by an audit report issued by an independent certified public
accounting firm reasonably acceptable to TM and are suitable for inclusion
the Proxy Statement, as determined by TM; (y) the Net Income of the HMDF
Entities for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008 (the " _HMDF FY2008 Net
Income_ "), as derived from the HMDF Financial Statements, is not less than
$15,000,000 and (z) the HMDF Financial Statements shall have been furnished
to TM no later than five (5) days after the date hereof. 

  

(b) _Initial Equity Payment_. Subject to Section 1.2(d) below, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions hereof, at the Closing, TM shall issue and
deliver to each HMDF Shareholder the number of TM Shares set forth opposite
such HMDF Shareholders name on _Schedule B_ in the column entitled "Initial
Equity Payment," representing, in the aggregate, 19,500,000 TM Shares (the "
_Initial Equity Payment_ "). 

  

(c) _Initial Cash Payment_. Subject to Section 1.2(d) below, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions hereof, at the Closing, TM shall pay by wire
transfer in immediately available funds to each HMDF Shareholder the amount
set forth opposite such HMDF Shareholders name on _Schedule B_ in the column
entitled "Initial Cash Payment," representing, in the aggregate,
$20,000,000 (the " _Initial Cash Payment_ "). 

  

(d) _Adjustment to Initial Equity Payment and Initial Cash Payment_.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that the HMDF
FY2008 Net Income, as derived from the HMDF Financial Statements, is less
than $25,000,000, the Initial Equity Payment and Initial Cash Payment payable
by TM at Closing shall each be reduced to an amount computed by multiplying
the Initial Equity Payment and Initial Cash Payment, respectively, by a
fraction, of which (x) the numerator is the actual HMDF FY2008 Net Income and
(y) the denominator is $25,000,000; provided, however, in no event shall such
numerator be less than $15,000,000. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(e) Earn-Out Share Payments. The Company shall issue and deliver up to an
aggregate of 15,000,000 TM Shares (the " _Earn-Out Shares_ ") to the HMDF
Shareholders in accordance with the terms set forth below. 

  

(i) _Targeted Net Income Threshold Achieved_. If the Adjusted Net Income of
the Company, as derived from its annual report on Form 10-K (" _Form 10-K_")
for FY2009, FY2010 or FY2011, as applicable, equals or exceeds the Targeted
Net Income Threshold for such fiscal year, as certified in writing by the
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, then
the Company shall issue and deliver to each HMDF Shareholder, the number of
Earn-Out Shares set forth opposite such HMDF Shareholders name in the
applicable column of _Schedule B_ with respect to such fiscal year. Such
delivery of Earn-Out Shares is referred to herein as the " _Earn-Out
Share Payment_." Subject to Section 1.2(e)(ii) below, the applicable portion
of the Earn-Out Shares shall be issued and delivered to the HMDF Shareholders
within thirty (30) days following the filing by the Company of its Form 10-K
with the SEC for such fiscal year, which contains audited
financial statements for such applicable year that are prepared in accordance
with U.S. GAAP and that indicates that the Targeted Net Income Threshold for
such fiscal year has been achieved. 

  

(ii) _Targeted Net Income Threshold Not Achieved_. If the Companys Adjusted
Net Income, as derived from its Form 10-K for FY2009, FY2010 or FY2011, as
applicable, does not equal or exceed the Targeted Net Income Threshold for
such fiscal year, as certified in writing by the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer of the Company, then the Company will not issue
any Earn-Out Shares applicable to such fiscal year (the " _Non-Achieving
Fiscal Year_ "); provided, however, that if the Companys Adjusted Net Income
in the fiscal year immediately succeeding the Non-Achieving Fiscal Year, as
derived from the Companys Form 10-K for such immediately succeeding fiscal
year, exceeds the sum of (x) the Targeted Net Income Threshold for such
immediately succeeding fiscal year and (y) the shortfall amount by which
Adjusted Net Income failed to achieve the Targeted Net Income Threshold for
the Non-Achieving Fiscal Year, as certified in writing by the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, then the Company shall
issue and deliver to each HMDF Shareholder, the number of Earn-Out Shares set
forth opposite such HMDF Shareholders name in the applicable column of
_Schedule B_ with respect to the Non-Achieving Fiscal Year within thirty
(30) days following the filing by the Company of its Form 10-K with the SEC
for such immediately succeeding fiscal year. 

  

(iii) _Earn-Out Share Number_. The aggregate number of Earn-Out Shares to be
issued and delivered to the HMDF Shareholders if the Adjusted Net Income of
the Company achieves or exceeds the applicable Targeted Net Income Threshold
is (A) 1,000,000 shares for FY2009 threshold, (B) 7,000,000 shares for FY2010
threshold and (C) 7,000,000 shares for FY2011 threshold. 

  

(iv) _Filing of Form 10-K_. From the Closing until it has filed a Form 10-K
(or any successor form) for FY2012 (unless the Earn-Out Shares applicable to
FY2011 have been issued and delivered), the Company shall file its Form 10-K
within the time-frames specified by the SEC for the filing of such form.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company is no longer required or
eligible to file a Form 10-K, then for purposes of determining whether
Targeted Net Income Thresholds have been achieved under Sections
1.2(e)(i)-(ii), the Adjusted Net Income of the Company for any
particular fiscal year shall be as derived from the audited financial
statements of the Company for such fiscal year. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(f) _Lock-Up and Registration Rights_. The TM Shares (including the Earn-Out
Shares, if any) issued and delivered to the HMDF Shareholders shall be
subject to Lock-Up Agreements that are substantially in the form of _Exhibit
A_ and shall be entitled to customary registration rights pursuant to the
Registration Rights Agreement substantially in the form of _Exhibit D_. 

  

(g) _Warrants Payment_. Within fifteen (15) days after the end of the first
full fiscal quarter ending after the Closing Date and each fiscal quarter
ending thereafter, the Company shall pay to the HMDF Shareholders, by wire
transfer in immediately available funds, the cash proceeds received by the
Company from the exercise of the Publicly Held TM Warrants during such fiscal
quarter; provided, however, that in no event shall that aggregate amount paid
by the Company under this Section 1.2(g) exceed $20,888,888. The amounts to
be paid by the Company under this Section 1.2(g) shall be paid to each HMDF
Shareholder in accordance with the percentage ownership set forth opposite
such HMDF Shareholders name on _Schedule A_ in the column entitled
"Percentage Ownership Interest."

Adverse Effect on the HMDF Parties. No breach or default under any of the
Structure Agreements by any HMDF Party will occur as a result of the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document. Except as set forth in Section 3.18 of the HMDF
Disclosure Schedule, consummation of the transactions contemplated by this

Person a right to) terminate or modify any rights of, or accelerate or
augment any obligation of, any HMDF Party under any Structure Agreement.

share capital of TM; and (ii) there are no disputes, arbitrations or
litigation proceedings involving TM with respect to the share capital of
TM. 

  

(b) Except as set forth in Section 4.1(b) of the TM Disclosure Schedule: (i)
no shares of capital stock or other voting securities of TM were issued,
reserved for issuance or outstanding and there have not been any issuances of

similar right under any provision of the DGCL, the TM Constituent Instruments
(as defined below) or any Contract to which TM is a party or otherwise bound;
and (iii) there are no outstanding contractual obligations of TM to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of TM.

(c) Except as set forth in Section 4.1(c) of the TM Disclosure Schedule, as of
the date of this Agreement: (i) there are no bonds, debentures, notes or
other indebtedness of TM having the right to vote (or convertible into, or
exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on
which holders of Common Stock may vote (" _Voting TM Debt_ "); and (ii) there
are no options, warrants, rights, convertible or exchangeable securities,
"phantom" stock rights, stock appreciation rights, stock-based performance
units, commitments, Contracts, arrangements or undertakings of any kind to
which TM is a Party or by which it is bound (A) obligating TM to
issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional
shares of capital stock or other equity interests in, or any security
convertible or exercisable for or exchangeable into any capital stock of or
other equity interest in, TM or any Voting TM Debt, or (B) obligating TM
to issue, grant, extend or enter into any such option, warrant, call, right,
security, commitment, Contract, arrangement or undertaking. 

  

(d) Except as set forth in Section 4.1(d) of the TM Disclosure Schedule, TM is
not a party to any agreement granting any security holder of TM the right to
cause TM to register shares of the capital stock or other securities of TM
held by such security holder under the Securities Act. The stockholder list
provided to HMDF is a current shareholder list generated by TMs stock
transfer agent, and such list accurately reflects all of the issued and
outstanding shares of TMs capital stock. 

  

Section 4.2 _Organization and Standing_. TM is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. TM is
duly qualified to do business in each of the jurisdictions in which the
property owned, leased or operated by TM or the nature of the business which
it conducts requires qualification, except where the failure to so qualify
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on TM. TM
has the requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its tangible
assets and properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted
and, subject to necessary approvals of the relevant Government
Authorities, as presently contemplated to be conducted. TM has delivered to
HMDF true and complete copies of the certificate of incorporation of TM, as
amended to the date of this Agreement and the bylaws of TM, as amended to the
date of this Agreement (the " _TM Constituent Instruments_ "). 

  

Section 4.3 _Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability_. TM has all
requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and the Transaction Documents to which it is a Party and to consummate the
Transactions. The execution and delivery by TM of this Agreement and the
consummation by TM of the Transactions have been duly authorized and approved
by the TM Board and no other corporate proceedings on the part of TM are
necessary to authorize this Agreement and the Transactions. All action,
corporate and otherwise, necessary to be taken by TM to authorize the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the Transaction
Documents and all other agreements and instruments delivered by TM in
connection with the Transactions have been duly and validly taken. Each of
this Agreement and the Transaction Documents to which TM is a party has been
duly executed and delivered by TM and constitutes the valid, binding, and
enforceable obligation of TM, enforceable in accordance with its terms,
except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or similar laws of general
application now or hereafter in effect affecting the rights and remedies of
creditors and by general principles of equity (regardless of
whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity). 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 4.4 _No Subsidiaries or Equity Interests_. TM does not own, directly
or indirectly, any capital stock, membership interest, partnership interest,
joint venture interest or other equity interest in any Person. 

  

Section 4.5 _No Conflicts_. Except as set forth in Section 4.5 of the TM
Disclosure Schedule, the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any of
the Transaction Documents by TM and the consummation of the Transactions and
compliance with the terms hereof and thereof will not, (a) conflict with, or
result in any violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse
of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation
or acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a material benefit under, or
result in the creation of any Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) upon any of
the assets and properties of TM, under, any provision of: (i) any TM
Constituent Instrument; (ii) any TM Material Contract (as defined in Section
4.23(a) hereof) to which TM is a party or to or by which it (or any of its
assets and properties) is subject or bound; or (iii) any Material Permit; (b)
subject to the filings and other matters referred to in Section 4.6, conflict
with any material Judgment or Law applicable to TM, or its properties
or assets; (c) result in any suspension, revocation, impairment, forfeiture
or nonrenewal of any Permit applicable to TM; (d) terminate or modify, or
give any third party the right to terminate or modify, the provisions or
terms of any Contract to which TM is a party; or (e) cause any of the assets
owned by TM to be reassessed or revalued by any Governmental Authority,
except, in the case of clauses (a)(ii), (a)(iii), (b), (c), (d) and (e)
above, any such items that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
TM. 

  

Section 4.6 _Consents and Approvals_. Except as set forth in Section 4.6 of
the TM Disclosure Schedule, no Consent of, or registration, declaration or
filing with, or permit from, any Governmental Authority is required to be
obtained or made by or with respect to TM in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions, other than (i) the filing with, and clearance by the SEC of a
preliminary proxy statement (the " _Proxy Statement_ ") pursuant to which
TMs stockholders must vote at a special meeting of stockholders to approve,
among other thing, this Agreement and the Transactions; (ii) the filing of a
Form 8-K with the SEC within four (4) business days after the execution of
this Agreement and of the Closing Date; (iii) any filings as required under
applicable securities laws of the United States and the securities laws of
any foreign country; (iv) any filing required with the AMEX; and (v) the
procurement of such other consents, authorizations, filings, approvals
and registrations which, if not obtained or made, would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on TM and would not prevent, or materially alter or delay
consummation of any of the Transactions. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 4.7 _SEC Documents_. TM has filed all reports, schedules, forms,
statements and other documents required to be filed by TM with the SEC since
October 17, 2007, pursuant to Sections 13(a), 14(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange
Act (the " _TM SEC Documents_ "). As of its respective filing date, each TM
SEC Document complied in all material respects with the requirements of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder applicable to such TM SEC Document, and did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Except to the
extent that information contained in any TM SEC Document has been revised or
superseded by a later filed TM SEC Document, none of the TM SEC Documents
contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. The consolidated financial statements of TM included in
the TM SEC Documents comply as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP
(except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by the rules and
regulations of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present
the consolidated financial position of TM as of the dates thereof and
the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows as at the
respective dates of and for the periods referred to in such financial
statements (subject, in the case of unaudited financial statements, to normal
year-end audit adjustments and the omission of notes to the extent
permitted by Regulation S-X of the SEC). 

  

Section 4.8 _Internal Accounting Controls_. TM maintains a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (a)
transactions are executed in accordance with managements general or specific
authorizations, (b) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles and to maintain asset accountability, (c)
access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements general or
specific authorization, and (d) the recorded accountability for assets is
compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate
action is taken with respect to any differences. TMs officers have
established disclosure controls and procedures for TM and designed such
disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information
relating to TM is made known to the officers by others within those
entities. 

  

Section 4.9 _Solvency_. Based on the financial condition of TM as of the
Closing Date (and assuming that the Closing shall have occurred and the
monies in the Trust Fund are released to TM), (i) TMs fair saleable value of
its assets exceeds the amount that will be required to be paid on or in
respect of TMs existing debts and other liabilities (including known
contingent liabilities) as they mature, (ii) TMs assets do not constitute
unreasonably small capital to carry on its business for the current fiscal
year as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted, including its capital
needs taking into account the particular capital requirements of the
business conducted by TM and projected capital requirements and capital
availability thereof, and (iii) the current cash flow of TM, together with
the proceeds TM would receive, were it to liquidate all of its assets, after
taking into account all anticipated uses of the cash, would be sufficient to
pay all amounts on or in respect of its debt when such amounts are required
to be paid. TM does not intend to incur debts beyond its ability to pay such
debts as they mature (taking into account the timing and amounts of cash to
be payable on or in respect of its debt).

advances and other advances made in the ordinary course of its business;

Disclosure Schedule sets forth all financial and contractual obligations and
liabilities (including any obligations to issue capital stock or other
securities of TM) due after the date hereof. 

  

Section 4.12 _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is no Action which (a)
adversely affects or challenges the legality, validity or enforceability of
any of this Agreement or (b) could, if there were an unfavorable decision,

form, report and document containing financial statements that has been filed
with or submitted to the SEC since inception, was accompanied by the

Tax Returns, examination reports, and statements of deficiencies filed by,
assessed against or agreed to by TM from its inception. 

  

(c) The TM financial statements reflect an adequate reserve for all Taxes
payable by TM (in addition to any reserve for deferred Taxes to reflect
timing differences between book and Tax items) for all taxable periods and
portions thereof through the date of such financial statements. TM is neither
a party to nor is it bound by any tax indemnity, tax sharing or similar
agreement and TM currently has no material liability and will not have any
material liabilities for any Taxes of any other Person under any agreement or
by the operation of any Law. No deficiency with respect to any Taxes has been
proposed, asserted or assessed against TM, and no requests for waivers of

on their behalf) knows or has reason to believe is in the process of
considering any Acquisition Proposal relating to any of the HMDF Entities;
(iv) to participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, furnish any
material non-public information with respect to, assist or participate in, or

(including the HMDF Disclosure Schedule) or in any certificate delivered by
the HMDF Entities pursuant to this Agreement; (ii) any breach by any HMDF
Entity of its covenants, agreements or obligations in this Agreement to be
performed or complied with by such HMDF Entity; (iii) any breach of any
Basic Representation made by such HMDF Shareholder in this Agreement
(including the HMDF Disclosure Schedule) or in any certificate delivered by
such HMDF Shareholder pursuant to this Agreement; and (iv) any breach by such
HMDF Shareholder of any of its covenants, agreements or obligations in
this Agreement to be performed or complied with by such HMDF Shareholder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, the representations, warranties,
covenants and obligations contained in this Agreement that relate
specifically and solely to a particular HMDF Shareholder are the
obligations of that particular HMDF Shareholder only and the other HMDF
Shareholders shall not be responsible therefor. 

  

(b) The amount of any and all Damages suffered by TM Indemnified Parties shall
be paid in cash, or, at the option of the HMDF Shareholders, may be recovered
by delivery of a specified number of TM Shares owned by the HMDF Shareholders
(the " _Returned Shares_ ") for repurchase by TM on terms set forth in this
Section 10.2(b). If TM suffers Damages and Damages are paid by the
HMDF Shareholders through the delivery of Returned Shares in lieu of a cash
payment, then such Returned Shares shall be cancelled. If the HMDF
Shareholders opt to deliver Returned Shares instead of cash hereunder, the
number of Returned Shares to be returned by the HMDF Shareholders shall be
equal to the aggregate amount of the indemnifiable Damages agreed to be paid
by the HMDF Shareholders, divided by $8.00. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(c) Pursuant to the provisions of this Article X, if any claim for
indemnification is to be brought against the HMDF Shareholders on behalf of
or by right of TM, such claim shall be determined and approved by a committee
of directors comprised of (i) all Independent Directors, and (ii) a director
nominated by the TM Representatives, each as elected pursuant to Section
8.4(a) (the " _Independent Committee_ "). Any settlement of any claim
described in the immediately preceding sentence shall be determined and
approved by the Independent Committee. Any determination or approval of the
Independent Committee made pursuant to the provisions of this Article X shall
be by majority vote. 

  

Section 10.3 _Indemnification by TM_. 

  

(a) The Company shall, subject to the terms hereof, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless each of the HMDF Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns (the " _HMDF Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any
Damages arising from: (i) any breach of any Basic Representation made by TM
in this Agreement (including the TM Disclosure Schedule) hereof or in any
certificate delivered by TM pursuant to this Agreement; or (ii) any breach by
TM of its covenants, agreements or obligations in this Agreement to be
performed or complied with by TM. 

  

(b) The amount of any and all Damages suffered by the HMDF Indemnified Parties
shall be paid in cash or, at the option of the Company, newly issued TM
Shares. The number of TM Shares to be issued to the HMDF Indemnified Parties
shall be equal to the aggregate amount of the indemnifiable Damages agreed to
be paid by the Company, divided by $8.00. 

   

Section 10.4 _Limitations on Indemnity_. 

  

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
TM Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
Section 10.2(a)(i) or 10.2(a)(iii), unless and until the aggregate amount of
Damages to the TM Indemnified Parties with respect to such matters under
Sections 10.2(a)(i) and (a)(iii) exceeds $1,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ "),
and then only to the extent such Damages exceed the Deductible; provided that
the aggregate amount of Damages payable by the HMDF Shareholders to the TM
Indemnified Parties pursuant to Sections 10.2(a)(i) and 10.2(a)(iii) shall
not exceed $25,000,000 (the " _Cap_ ") . 

  

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
HMDF Parties shall not be liable to, or indemnify the TM Indemnified Parties
for any Damages (i) resulting from any nonfulfillment or breach of any such
representations, warranties, covenants, and obligations of which HMDF
disclosed to TM on or prior to the date hereof; or (ii) that are punitive
(except to the extent constituting third party punitive claims), special,
consequential, incidental, exemplary or otherwise not actual damages. This
Article X constitutes TMs sole and exclusive remedy for any and all Damages
or other claims relating to or arising from this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, no
HMDF Party shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 10.3,
unless and until the aggregate amount of Damages with respect to such matters
under Section 10.3 exceeds the Deductible, and then only to the extent such
Damages exceed the Deductible; provided that the aggregate amount of
Damages payable by the Company to the HMDF Indemnified Parties pursuant to
Section 10.3(a)(i) shall not exceed the Cap. 

  

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Company shall not be liable to, or indemnify any HMDF Party for any Damages
(i) resulting from any nonfulfillment or breach of any such representations,
warranties, covenants, and obligations of which TM disclosed to the HMDF
Parties on or prior to the date hereof; or (ii) that are punitive (except to
the extent constituting third party punitive claims),
special, consequential, incidental, exemplary or otherwise not actual
damages. This Article X constitutes the HMDF Parties sole and exclusive
remedy for any and all Damages or other claims relating to or arising from
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

Section 10.5 _Defense of Third Party Claims_. If the Independent Committee
determines to make a claim for indemnification under Section 10.2 or any HMDF
Party makes a claim for indemnification under Section 10.3 (each as
applicable an " _Indemnitee_ "), the Independent Committee or such HMDF Party
as applicable shall notify the indemnifying party (an " _Indemnitor_ ") of the
claim in writing promptly after receiving notice of any action, lawsuit,
proceeding, investigation, demand or other claim against the Indemnitee (if
by a third party), describing the claim, the amount thereof (if known and
quantifiable) and the basis thereof in reasonable detail (such
written notice, an " _Indemnification Notice_ "). Any Indemnitor shall be
entitled to participate in the defense of such action, lawsuit, proceeding,
investigation or other claim giving rise to an Indemnitees claim for
indemnification at such Indemnitors expense, and at its option shall
be entitled to assume the defense thereof ; provided, that the Indemnitee
shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such claim and to employ
counsel of its choice for such purpose; provided, however, that the fees and
expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the Indemnitee and shall
not be recoverable from such Indemnitor under this Article X. If
the Indemnitor shall control the defense of any such claim, the Indemnitor
shall be entitled to settle such claims; provided, that the Indemnitor shall
obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before entering into
any settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend such claim if, such settlement
does not expressly and unconditionally release the Indemnitee from all
liabilities and obligations with respect to such claim. If the Indemnitor
assumes such defense, the Indemnitor shall not be liable for any
amount required to be paid by the Indemnitee that exceeds, where the
Indemnitee has unreasonably withheld or delayed consent in connection with
the proposed compromise or settlement of a third party claim, the amount for
which that third party claim could have been settled pursuant to that
proposed compromise or settlement. In all cases, the Indemnitee shall provide
its reasonable cooperation with the Indemnitor in defense of claims or
litigation, including by making employees, information and documentation
reasonably available. If the Indemnitor shall not assume the defense of any
such action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim, the
Indemnitee may defend against such matter as it deems appropriate; provided
that the Indemnitee may not settle any such matter without the written
consent of the Indemnitor (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) if the Indemnitee is seeking or will seek
indemnification hereunder with respect to such matter. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 10.6 _Determining Damages_. The amount of Damages subject to
indemnification under Section 10.2 or Section 10.3 shall be calculated net of
(i) any Tax Benefit inuring to the Indemnitee on account of such Damages,
(ii) any reserves set forth in any of the HMDF Financial Statements or the
HMDF Interim Financial Statements relating to such Damages and (iii)
any insurance proceeds or other amounts under indemnification agreements
received or receivable by the Indemnitee on account of such Damages. If the
Indemnitee receives a Tax Benefit on account of such Damages after an
indemnification payment is made to it, the Indemnitee shall promptly pay to
the Person or Persons that made such indemnification payment the amount of
such Tax Benefit at such time or times as and to the extent that such Tax
Benefit is realized by the Indemnitee. For purposes hereof, " _Tax Benefit_ "
shall mean any refund of Taxes to be paid or reduction in the amount of
Taxes which otherwise would be paid by the Indemnitee, in each case computed
at the highest marginal tax rates applicable to the recipient of such
benefit. To the extent Damages are recoverable by insurance, the Indemnitees
shall take all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain maximum recovery
from such insurance. In the event that an insurance or other recovery is made
by any Indemnitee with respect to Damages for which any such Person has been
indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the
recovery shall be made promptly to the Person or Persons that provided such
indemnity payments to such Indemnitee. The Indemnitors shall be subrogated to
all rights of the Indemnitees in respect of Damages indemnified by the
Indemnitors. The Indemnitees shall take all commercially reasonable efforts
to mitigate all Damages upon and after becoming aware of any event which
could reasonably be expected to give rise to Damages. For Tax purposes, the
Parties agree to treat all payments made under this Article X as adjustments
to the consideration received for the HMDF Shares. 

  

Section 10.7 _Right of Setoff_. To the extent that any Party is obligated to
indemnify any other Party after Closing under the provisions of this Article
X for Damages reduced to a monetary amount, such Party after Closing shall
have the right to decrease any amount due and owing or to be due and owing
under any agreement with the other Party, whether under this Agreement or any
other agreement between such Parties on the one hand, and any of the other
Party or any of their respective Affiliates, Subsidiaries or controlled
persons or entities on the other. 

   

Section 10.8 _Limitation on Recourse; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. 

  

(a) No claim shall be brought or maintained by any Party or its respective
successors or permitted assigns against any officer, director, partner,
member, agent, representative, Affiliate, equity holder, successor or
permitted assign of any Party which is not otherwise expressly identified as
a Party, and no recourse shall be brought or granted against any of them, by
virtue of or based upon any alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or
breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or obligations of
any Party set forth or contained in this Agreement or any exhibit or schedule
hereto or any certificate delivered hereunder. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) Except as set forth in Section 10.3, the provisions of this Article X are
for the sole benefit of the Parties and nothing in this Article X, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or
equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Article X (it being understood that only the
Independent Committee and not TM, any Person acting on its behalf or any
other Person, may exercise any indemnity rights under Section 10.2 or any
other provision of Article XIV). 

  

Section 10.9. _Liquidated Damages_. Notwithstanding any other provision in
this Agreement to the contrary, in the event a committed Permitted Financing
contemplated by Section 9.1(m)(i) shall not have been consummated at or prior
to the Closing and the amount of cash and cash equivalents owned by the
Company at the Closing shall be less than approximately $10 million (after
making the payments required pursuant to Sections 1.2(c) and 12.7 hereof (and
any and all other fees and expenses associated with the Transactions for the
account of TM) and to repay, perform or satisfy any Permitted Financing
(other than periodic interest payments) due by its terms within the thirty-
six (36) months following the Closing), then in the event the closing and
funding of such Permitted Financing or any other Permitted Financing that
would have satisfied such condition had commitments therefor been in
place prior to the Closing does not take place for any reason by the sixtieth
(60th) calendar day following the Closing, (i) the TM Representatives shall
transfer the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by them as
of the Closing and held pursuant to existing escrow arrangements to the
Company for no consideration and the Voting Agreement shall be of no
further force and effect with respect to such shares of Common Stock. The
provisions of this Section 10.9 are intended to compensate the HMDF
Shareholders for the damages for which no reasonable estimate can be made
that will result from the lack of adequate financing for the Company after the
Closing, in light of its future development, and are not intended as a
penalty. At or prior to the Closing, the escrow arrangements pursuant to
which the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the TM Representatives
are held shall be modified accordingly to reflect the obligations of the
TM Representatives under this Section 10.9. 

  

ARTICLE XI 

   

Termination  

  

Section 11.1 _Methods of Termination_. Unless waived by the Parties hereto in

(b) by the HMDF Parties, if the Closing has not occurred by the Termination
Date; 

 

    #####

warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement which has
prevented the satisfaction of the conditions to the obligations of the HMDF

the HMDF Parties;

been waived by TM or cured by the HMDF Parties, to the extent capable of
being cured, within ten (10) business days after written notice thereof
from TM; 

  

(e) by TM, if the actual HMDF FY2008 Net Income, as derived from the HMDF
Financial Statements, is less than $15,000,000; 

  

(f) by any HMDF Party, if the TM Board (or any committee thereof) shall have
failed to recommend or shall have withdrawn its approval or recommendation of
this Agreement and the Transactions; or 

  

(g) by either TM or the HMDF Parties, if, at the Stockholders Meeting
(including any adjournments thereof), this Agreement and the Share Exchange
and payments contemplated hereby shall fail to be approved and adopted by the
affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding Common Stock
cast at the meeting in accordance with TM Constituent Instruments and the DGCL
or if the aggregate number of shares of Publicly Held Common Stock held by
Public Stockholders who exercise their Conversion Rights with respect to

constitute thirty percent (30%) or more of the Publicly Held Common Stock.

other Party hereto, and each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses.

execution hereof, to the Party furnishing the same; and

to the business of the other Party hereto shall be treated in accordance with
Section 8.2 hereof, which shall survive such termination or abandonment. The

ARTICLE XII 

   

Miscellaneous  

  

Section 12.1 _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other

pages hereto (or at such other address for a Party as shall be specified in
writing to all other Parties). 

  

Section 12.2 _Amendments; Waivers; No Additional Consideration_. No provision
of this Agreement may be waived or amended except in a written instrument
signed by all of the Parties hereto. No waiver of any default with respect to
any provision, condition or requirement of this Agreement shall be deemed to
be a continuing waiver in the future or a waiver of any subsequent default or
a waiver of any other provision, condition or requirement hereof, nor shall
any delay or omission of any Party to exercise any right hereunder in any
manner impair the exercise of any such right. 

  

Section 12.3 _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip for any such
fractional shares shall be issued. Any holder of TM Shares who would
otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a TM Share on the Closing Date
(after aggregating all fractional TM Shares issuable to such holder) shall,
in lieu of such fraction of a share, be paid in cash the dollar amount
(rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, determined by
multiplying such fraction by the closing bid price of a TM Share on the AMEX,
or such other public trading market on which TM Shares may be trading at such
time, at the Closing Date. 

  

Section 12.4 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
certificates representing the HMDF Shares or TM Shares shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, HMDF or TM, as applicable, shall issue in exchange for

applicable; provided, however, that HMDF or TM, as applicable, may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to deliver a bond in
such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against HMDF or TM, as applicable, with respect to the
certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

  

Section 12.5 _Adjustments to Initial Equity Payment_. In addition to any
adjustments pursuant to Section 1.2(d), the Initial Equity Payment and the
payment of any Earn-Out Shares shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the
effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, extraordinary
cash dividends, reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to TM Shares, occurring prior to the date thereof. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 12.6 _Withholding Rights_. TM shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the number of TM Shares and any other consideration otherwise
deliverable under this Agreement, such amounts as TM reasonably determines
are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to such delivery and
payment under the Code or any provision of state, local, provincial or
foreign tax law. To the extent that any amounts are so withheld all
appropriate evidence of such deduction and withholding, including any
receipts or forms required in order for the person with respect to whom such
deduction and withholding occurred to establish the deduction and withholding
and payment to the appropriate authority as being for its account with the
appropriate authorities shall be delivered to the Person with respect to whom
such deduction and withholding has occurred, and such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes as having been delivered and paid to the Person
otherwise entitled to the TM Shares or such other consideration in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by TM. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, TM, at its option, may require any such amounts required to be
deducted and withheld to be reimbursed in cash to TM prior to the issuance of
the TM Shares or such other consideration. 

  

Section 12.7 _Expenses_. The Company shall pay for and/or reimburse TM for all
fees and Expenses (including the reasonable, documented fees and expenses of

Transaction Documents and the Transactions contemplated hereby in
amounts consistent with the estimates provided by TM to HMDF prior to the
date hereof. 

  

Section 12.8 _Interpretation_. The titles and subtitles used in this Agreement
are used for convenience only and shall not be considered in the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Except where the context clearly requires
to the contrary or is otherwise stated: (i) when a reference is made in this

Section 12.9 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any Party (it being understood that if any provision of Section
11.3 hereof is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or
public policy, it will be deemed to be a change to the economic and legal
substance of the Transactions that is materially adverse to the Parties and
will entitle either the HMDF Parties or TM to terminate the Agreement without
penalty and none of the Parties and their respective shareholders and
Affiliates will have recourse against any other Parties). Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that Transactions are
fulfilled to the extent possible. 

  

Section 12.10 _Counterparts; Facsimile or Electronically Transmitted
Execution_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all

Parties and delivered to the other Parties. Facsimile or other electronically
transmitted execution and delivery of this Agreement is legal, valid and
binding for all purposes. 

  

Section 12.11 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,
taken together with all Exhibits, Annexes and Schedules hereto (a) constitute
the entire agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the Transactions and
(b) are not intended to confer upon any Person other than the Parties any
rights or remedies. 

  

Section 12.12 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts

or relating to this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or any respective
obligations thereunder, may be brought in any State court of competent
jurisdiction in the State of New York, County of New York, or any Federal
court of competent jurisdiction in the Southern District of New York. By
executing and delivering this Agreement, each Party, for itself and in
connection with its properties, irrevocably (i) accepts generally and
unconditionally the nonexclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts, (ii)
waives any defense of _forum non coveniens_ , (iii) agrees that service of
all process in any such proceeding in any such court may be made by
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to such Party at its
address provided in accordance with Section 12.1 hereof or other address in
the possession of the sending Party, (iv) agrees that service as provided in
clause (iii) above is sufficient to confer personal jurisdiction over such
Party in any such proceeding in any such court, and otherwise constitutes
effective and binding service in every respect and (v) agrees that the rights
to serve process and bring proceedings provided above shall be in addition to
any other rights to serve process in any other manner permitted by law and to
bring proceedings in the courts of any other jurisdiction. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) _Waiver of Trial By Jury_. EACH PARTY HERETO WAIVES THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY

RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AFTER CONSULTATION WITH SUCH COUNSEL. 

  

Section 12.14 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the Parties without the
prior written consent of the other Parties. Any purported assignment without
such consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences,
this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and assigns. 

  

Section 12.15 _Governing Language_. This Agreement shall be governed and
interpreted in accordance with the English language.
