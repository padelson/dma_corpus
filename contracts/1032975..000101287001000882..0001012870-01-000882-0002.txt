                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

     This Agreement and Plan of Merger (as the same may be amended, supplemented
or modified in accordance with the terms hereof, this "Agreement") dated
February 7, 2001 is among Labtec Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (together
with its successor and assigns, the "Company"), for the purposes of Sections
1.1(b) and 11.7 only, Logitech International S.A., a Swiss corporation (together
with its successor and assigns, "Parent"), Logitech Inc., a California
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (together with its
successors and assigns, "Logitech Subsidiary"), and Thunder Acquisition Corp., a
Massachusetts corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Logitech
Subsidiary (together with its successor and assigns, "Merger Sub").

                                    Recitals
                                    --------

     The parties desire that Logitech Subsidiary acquire the Company, upon the
terms and conditions set forth herein and in accordance with the Massachusetts
Business Corporation Law and Chapter 156B of the Massachusetts General Laws
(collectively, the "MBCL").

     In furtherance of such acquisition, it is proposed that Merger Sub shall,
and Logitech Subsidiary shall cause Merger Sub to, make an exchange offer (as it
may be amended from time-to-time as permitted under this Agreement, the "Offer")
to acquire, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and
the Offer, all of the issued and outstanding shares (each, a "Share" and
collectively, the "Shares") of the Company's common stock, par value $.01 per
share ("Company Common Stock"), at a price for each Share of (i) $11.00 in cash
(such price, or such higher price per share in cash that may be made pursuant to
the Offer, is referred to as the "Cash Portion"), and (ii) a fraction of an
American depositary share (each, a "Parent ADS") of Parent equal to the Stock
Portion (as defined in Section 1.1(d) below) (each Parent ADS representing one-
tenth of a registered share, par value CHF 10 per share, of Parent and evidenced
by an American depositary receipt ("Parent ADR") issued in accordance with the
Deposit Agreement dated as of March 27, 1997 among Parent, The Bank of New York,
as depositary, and all owners from time to time of Parent ADSs, as amended on
July 5, 2000 (as so amended, the "Deposit Agreement").

     Also in furtherance of such acquisition, it is proposed that, following the
consummation of the Offer, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the
"Merger") and that the Shares not tendered and accepted pursuant to the Offer
will thereupon be converted into the right to receive both cash and a fraction
of a Parent ADS in the amounts set forth in Section 2.4(c) hereof.

     The respective boards of directors of the Company, Parent, Logitech
Subsidiary and Merger Sub have authorized, adopted and approved this Agreement
and deem this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger desirable and in the best
interests of their respective corporations and stockholders.

     This Agreement and the Merger have been adopted and approved by Logitech
Subsidiary as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub and will be submitted to the
stockholders of the Company for their adoption and approval.
<PAGE>

     Concurrently herewith, Logitech Subsidiary and two stockholders of the
Company have entered into a Stockholder Agreement (the "Stockholder Agreement")
in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, providing that, among other things,
such stockholders will tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer and vote their
Shares and those Shares over which they have voting power in favor of the
adoption and approval of this Agreement, and that the Parent ADSs to be received
by such stockholders shall be subject to a contractual lock-up as provided
therein.

                                   Agreement
                                   ---------

     Logitech Subsidiary, Merger Sub and the Company agree as follows:

                                   Article I
                                   The Offer
                                   ---------
     Section 1.1  The Offer.
                  ---------

     (a)  Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated and
subject to the provisions of this Agreement and the conditions set forth on
Annex A hereto, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, but in no
event later than ten business days following the public announcement of the
terms of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Logitech Subsidiary shall cause
Merger Sub to, commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), the Offer. The obligation
of Merger Sub to, and of Logitech Subsidiary to cause Merger Sub to, accept for
payment any Shares tendered in the Offer shall be subject to the satisfaction of
only those conditions set forth on Annex A. The initial expiration date of the
Offer shall be the 20th "business day" (as such term is defined in Rule 14d-
1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) following the commencement of the Offer
(determined using Rules 14d-1(g)(3) and 14d-2 under the Exchange Act). Merger
Sub and Logitech Subsidiary expressly reserve the right to waive any condition
to the Offer or modify the terms of the Offer, except that, without the consent
of the Company, Merger Sub shall not, and Logitech Subsidiary shall not cause
Merger Sub to, (i) reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Cash Portion or reduce the Stock Portion, (iii)
waive or change the Minimum Condition (as defined in Annex A), (iv) modify in
any manner adverse to the holders of Company Common Stock or add to the
conditions to the obligation of Merger Sub to, or Logitech Subsidiary to cause
Merger Sub to, accept for payment any Shares tendered in the Offer set forth in
Annex A, (v) except as provided in the next two sentences, extend the Offer or
(vi) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Merger Sub may, and Logitech Subsidiary may cause Merger Sub to,
without the consent of the Company, (x) extend the Offer for any period required
by any rule, regulation, interpretation of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") or the staff thereof; (y) from time to time extend the
Offer, if at the scheduled expiration date of the Offer any of the conditions to
the Offer shall not have been satisfied or waived, until such time as such
conditions are satisfied or waived; or (z) extend the Offer for any reason on
one or more occasions for an aggregate period of not more than 10 business days
beyond the latest expiration date that would otherwise be permitted under clause
(x) or (y) of this sentence if on such expiration date there shall not have been
tendered (and not properly withdrawn) at least 90%

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

of the outstanding Shares on a Fully Diluted Basis. Logitech
Subsidiary and Merger Sub agree that, if any one or more of the conditions
to the Offer set forth on Annex A are not satisfied then, provided that
such conditions are reasonably capable of being satisfied, Merger Sub
shall, at the request of the Company, extend the Offer from time to time
unless any such condition is no longer reasonably capable of being
satisfied or any such event has occurred; provided, however, that in no
event shall Merger Sub be required to extend the Offer beyond July 15,
2001.  Following expiration of the Offer, Merger Sub may, and Logitech
Subsidiary may cause Merger Sub to, make available a "subsequent offering
period" in accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act.  On the terms
and subject to the conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Merger Sub
shall, and Logitech Subsidiary shall cause Merger Sub to, accept for
payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant
to the Offer as soon as practicable after the expiration of the Offer.
With respect to any such Shares the Cash Portion shall be net to the seller
thereof in cash, subject to reduction only for any applicable federal back-
up withholding or stock transfer taxes payable by such seller.

     (b)  On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent shall file with the
SEC a Registration Statement on Form F-4, which will include a preliminary
prospectus containing the information required under Rule 14d-4(b) under the
Exchange Act to register the offer and sale of Registered Parent Shares
represented by Parent ADSs pursuant to the Offer (as the same may be
supplemented or amended, the "Form F-4"). On the date of commencement of the
Offer, Logitech Subsidiary and Merger Sub shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer
Statement on Schedule TO (together with any communications filed with the SEC
under cover of Schedule TO prior to commencement of the Offer in accordance with
Rule 14d-2(b) under the Exchange Act, and as such Schedule TO may be
supplemented or amended, the "Schedule TO") with respect to the Offer, which
shall contain an offer to purchase and a related letter of transmittal and
summary advertisement (such Schedule TO, the Form F-4 and the documents included
therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with any supplements
or amendments thereto, the "Offer Documents"). Each of Logitech Subsidiary,
Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any information provided by it
for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect, and each of Logitech
Subsidiary and Merger Sub shall, upon becoming aware that such information shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect, take all steps
necessary to amend or supplement the Offer Documents and to cause the Schedule
TO and Form F-4 as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and for
the other Offer Documents, as so amended or supplemented, to be disseminated to
the Company's stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable federal securities laws. Logitech Subsidiary and Merger Sub shall
give the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on the Offer Documents prior to their being filed with the SEC or disseminated
to the stockholders of the Company. Logitech Subsidiary and Merger Sub shall
provide the Company and its counsel in writing with any comments Logitech
Subsidiary or Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments
and shall provide the Company and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the response of Logitech Subsidiary and/or Merger Sub to such
comments. Parent shall not issue certificates or scrip representing fractional
Parent ADSs

                                      -3-

pursuant to the Offer. Logitech Subsidiary will pay cash in lieu of fractional
Parent ADSs in accordance with the provision set forth in the last two sentences
of Section 2.4(d) hereof.

     (c)  Logitech Subsidiary and Merger Sub shall, and Logitech Subsidiary
shall cause Merger Sub to, provide or cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent
(as defined in Section 2.6 below) on, prior to or promptly after the expiration
of the Offer (and thereafter on a timely basis) Parent ADRs and funds necessary
to make payment for any Shares that Logitech Subsidiary or Merger Sub become
obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

     (d)  The "Stock Portion" shall be determined as follows:

           (i)  if the Average Market Price (as defined below) is equal to a
     price that is not more than $31.34 or not less than $25.64, the Stock
     Portion shall be equal to (x) $7.00 divided by (y) the Average Market
     Price;

          (ii)  if the Average Market Price is more than $31.34, the Stock
     Portion shall be equal to 0.2234; and

          (iii) if the Average Market Price is less than $25.64, the Stock
     Portion shall be equal to 0.2730.

     (e)  "Average Market Price" means the average closing bid price for a
Parent ADS as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets (or such other source as
the parties hereto shall agree in writing), on the 20 consecutive trading days
ending on and including the trading day that is three business days prior to the
day on which the Offer actually expires.

Company (subject to applicable law) and (z) each committee of each such board of
directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall use its commercially

     Section 2.4  Conversion of Shares.  At the Effective Time by virtue of the
                  --------------------
Merger and without any action on the part of Logitech Subsidiary, Merger Sub or
any holder of Shares:

     (a)  Each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury
stock and each Share owned by Parent, Logitech Subsidiary, Merger Sub or any
other subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist and no payment shall be
made with respect thereto.

     (b)  Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

     (c)  Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.4(a), or as provided in
Section 2.5 with respect to Shares as to which appraisal rights shall have been
exercised, each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into the right to receive (x) the Cash Portion in cash per Share
from the Surviving Corporation, without any interest thereon and (y) a fraction
of a Parent ADS equal to the Stock Portion (the Cash Portion and the Stock
Portion are collectively referred to as the "Merger Consideration"). From and
after the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist and each holder of
a certificate (a "Certificate") representing any such Shares shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration therefor upon the surrender thereof in accordance with Section 2.6
hereof.

     (d)  No certificates or scrip representing fractional Parent ADSs shall be
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates pursuant to this Article

                                      -8-
<PAGE>

fractional Parent ADSs to which a single record holder would be entitled shall
be aggregated and calculations shall be rounded to four decimal places. Logitech
Subsidiary shall pay to each former holder of Company Common Stock an amount in
cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the fractional interest to
which such former holder (after taking into account all Shares held at the
Effective Time by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (y) (i) the
Average Market Price if the Average Market Price is not more than $31.34 or not
less than $25.64, (ii) $31.34 if the Average Market Price is more than $31.34,
or (iii) $25.64 if the Average Market Price is less than $25.64. Logitech
Subsidiary will deposit or will cause to be deposited a sufficient amount of
cash with the Exchange Agent to cover the payments required to be made pursuant
to this Section 2.4(d).

     Section 2.4A  Adjustments to the Stock Portion and the Cash Portion.  The
                   -----------------------------------------------------
Stock Portion and the Cash Portion shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect
the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including
any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common
Stock), extraordinary cash dividends, reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to the Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time.  The Stock Portion shall be adjusted appropriately
to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent
Registered Shares or Parent ADSs), extraordinary cash dividends, reorganization,

     Section 2.5  Dissenters' Rights
                  ------------------

     (a)  Any Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and that are held by a holder of Shares who has not voted such Shares to
adopt and approve this Agreement and who has properly exercised, preserved and
perfected dissenters' rights with respect to such Shares in accordance with the
MBCL, including Sections 86 through 98 thereof (the "Dissenting Provisions")
and, as of the Effective Time, has neither effectively withdrawn nor lost its
right to exercise such dissenters' rights ("Dissenting Shares"), will not be
converted into or represent a right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant
to Section 2.4(c), but the holder thereof will be entitled to payment of the
fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the Dissenting
Provisions.

     (b)  If any holder of Shares who demands dissenters' rights with respect to
such holder's Shares under the MBCL effectively withdraws or loses (through
failure to perfect or otherwise) its dissenters' rights, then as of the
Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, whichever later occurs, such
holder's Shares will automatically be converted into and represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.4(c), without
interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates formerly
representing such Shares.

     (c)  The Company will give Logitech Subsidiary (x) prompt notice of any
written intent to demand payment of the fair value of any Shares, withdrawals of
such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the MBCL received by
the Company and (y) the opportunity to direct

                                      -9-
<PAGE>

all negotiations and proceedings with respect to dissenters' rights under the
MBCL. The Company may not voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
exercise of dissenters' rights and may not, except with the prior written
consent of Logitech Subsidiary, settle or offer to settle any such dissenters'
rights.

     Section 2.6  Exchange of Certificates
                  ------------------------

     (a)  Prior to the Effective Time, Logitech Subsidiary shall (i) designate,
or shall cause to be designated, a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable
to the Company to act as exchange agent for the payment of the Merger
Consideration (the "Exchange Agent") upon surrender of Certificates, (ii)
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent (A) an amount in cash
equal to the product of the Cash Portion and the number of Shares that are
issued and outstanding at the Effective Time and (B) ADRs representing a number
of Parent ADSs equal to the product of the Stock Portion and the number of
Shares outstanding at the Effective Time, and (iii) the cash amount payable in
lieu of fractional Shares in accordance with Section 2.4(d). For purposes of
determining the aggregate Merger Consideration to be so deposited, Parent shall
assume that, other than with respect to stockholders of the Company with respect
to whom the Company has been informed intend to exercise their appraisal rights
(the Company shall give Parent prompt notice of the receipt by the Company of
its receipt of notice of any such intent), Parent shall assume that no
stockholder of the Company shall perfect any right of appraisal of his, her or
its shares. If for any reason the Exchange Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts
to which holders of Shares shall be entitled under this Section 2.6(a), Logitech
Subsidiary shall take all steps necessary to enable or cause the Surviving
Corporation promptly to deposit additional cash with the Exchange Agent
sufficient to make all payments required under this Agreement, and Logitech
Subsidiary and the Surviving Corporation shall in any event be liable for
payment thereof. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose except as
expressly provided in this Agreement.

     (b)  As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a Certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Shares whose shares were converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.4(c):


          (i)  a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall
     be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such
     person shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
     Agent and shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as
     Logitech Subsidiary may reasonably specify); and

          (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
     Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

     (c)  Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange
Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor an amount equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the

                                      -10-
<PAGE>

number of Shares represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares that is not registered in the stock transfer books of the
Company, the proper amount of cash and Parent ADSs may be paid in exchange
therefor to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment
shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a
person other than the registered holder of such Certificate the Merger
Consideration or establish to the satisfaction of Logitech Subsidiary that such
tax has been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall
accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

     Section 2.7  No Further Ownership Rights in Shares. The Merger
                  -------------------------------------
Consideration paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the
terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate.
At the Effective Time the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed,
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
for transfer or any other reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Article II.

     Section 2.8  No Liability. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable
                  ------------
law, none of Parent, Logitech Subsidiary, Merger Sub, the Company or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash or Parent
ADSs from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificates shall
not have been surrendered prior to six years after the Effective Time (or
immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration would
otherwise escheat to or became the property of any Governmental Entity (as
defined in Section 4.3 below)), any such Merger Consideration in respect thereof
shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of
the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interests of any
person previously entitled thereto.

     Section 2.9  Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any
                  --------------------------------------
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Surviving Corporation
or Exchange Agent shall pay the Merger Consideration in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the holder thereof in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Surviving Corporation or Exchange Agent, as the case may be; provided, however,
that the Surviving Corporation may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to deliver a bond in such sum as the
Surviving Corporation may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect
to such Certificate.

     Section 2.10  Withholding Rights. Logitech Subsidiary shall be entitled to
                   ------------------
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as Logitech Subsidiary is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment

                                      -11-
<PAGE>

under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by Logitech Subsidiary, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Logitech Subsidiary.

     Section 2.11  Termination of Exchange Fund; Charges and Expenses.
                   --------------------------------------------------

     (a)  Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the
holders of Shares for six months after the Effective Time shall be returned to
Logitech Subsidiary, upon demand, and any holder of Shares shall look as a
general creditor only to Logitech Subsidiary for payment of such cash and Parent
ADSs to which such holder may be due subject to applicable law.

     (b)  The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses,
including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the exchange of cash
and Parent ADSs for Shares.

     Section 2.12  Treatment of Company Options. Logitech Subsidiary and the
                   ----------------------------
Company shall take all actions necessary to provide that each outstanding
employee and/or director stock option to acquire shares of Company Common Stock
granted under or governed by the Company's Amended and Restated 1997 Stock
Option Plan, the Company's Amended and Restated Director Option Plan and the
Company's Amended and Restated 1993 Option Plan (collectively, the "Company
Option Plans"), whether or not such options are then exercisable and vested
(each such option a "Company Option"), shall, effective as of the consummation
of the Offer or the Effective Time, as the case may be (in accordance with the
terms of the Company Option Plan pursuant to which such Company Options were
granted), (a) become fully exercisable and vested, (b) represent an option
solely to acquire a unit consisting of (i) the Cash Portion and (ii) the Stock
Portion, and (c) have an exercise price per such unit equal to the exercise
price of such Company Option per share of Company Common Stock immediately prior
to the Effective Time. Unless exercised prior thereto, all of the Company
Options shall terminate at the Effective Time.

     (a)  The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and has all
corporate power and authority to own its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as presently conducted. The Company is duly qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction
where the character of the property owned or leased by it or the nature of its
activities makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect.

     (b)  The Company has previously furnished to Logitech Subsidiary a complete

date (together, the "Company Charter Documents"). The Company Charter Documents
and the organizational documents of each Company Subsidiary (as defined in

10-Q), and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial

     such Returns which are not, individually or in the aggregate, material to
     the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. All such Returns were
     correct and complete in all material respects, and the Company and each
     Company Subsidiary have paid all Taxes shown to be due on such Returns,
     other than any Taxes being contested in good faith through appropriate
     procedures.

     respect to its employees or other persons all federal and state income
     Taxes, Taxes pursuant to the Federal Insurance Contribution Act, Taxes
     pursuant to the Federal Unemployment Tax Act and other Taxes required to be

          (iii)  There is no material Tax nor is there any material Tax
     deficiency outstanding, proposed or assessed against the Company or any

     of any Return of the Company or any Company Subsidiary by any Tax authority
     is presently in

                                      -18-

     pursuant to Sections 280G, 404 or 162(m) of the Code. There is no contract,

     Section 4.11  Employee Benefit Plans; Employee Matters.
                   ----------------------------------------

     (a)  Except as set forth in the Company Filings or on Schedule 4.11(a), all
employee benefit plans that have ever been maintained, contributed to, or
required to be contributed to, by the Company or any Company Subsidiary for the
benefit of employees or former employees of the Company or any Company
Subsidiaries ("Plans") have been administered substantially in accordance with
their respective terms and, to the extent subject to the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder ("ERISA") and, to the extent applicable, the Code and all
other applicable laws, and are in material compliance with ERISA, the Code and
all other applicable laws. Each Plan which is an "employee pension benefit plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (each, a "Company Pension Plan") and
which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received
a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service and such
Company Pension Plan has been administered in substantial compliance with Code
Section 401(a). Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has engaged in a
transaction with respect to any Company Pension Plan that would subject the
Company or any of Company Subsidiary to a material tax or material penalty
imposed by either Sections 4975 through 4980 of the Code or Section 502(i) of
ERISA. Each Plan (other than any stock option plan) can be amended, terminated,
or otherwise discontinued after the Effective Time, without material liability
to Parent, the Company or any Company Subsidiary (other than ordinary
administration expenses). There are no audits, inquiries, or proceedings pending
or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened by the Internal Revenue Service,
Department of Labor, or any other governmental agency or entity with respect to
any Plan. Neither a Plan, nor the Company or any Company Subsidiary has
represented provided, or has any liability to provide retiree health to any
person for any reason, except as required by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended.

     (b)  No material liability under Subtitles C or D or Title IV of ERISA has
been or is expected to be incurred by the Company or any Company Subsidiaries
with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated Company Pension Plan,
currently or formerly maintained, contributed to, or required to be contributed
to by any of them, or the Plans of any person which is considered one employer
with the Company under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code. No
legal or administrative action has been taken by the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation ("PBGC") to terminate or to appoint a trustee to administer the
Company Pension Plan and no liability to the PBGC under Title IV of ERISA has
been incurred by the Company or any Company Subsidiary that has not been
satisfied in full. Each Company Pension Plan is fully-funded on a termination
basis and no pension Plan has incurred a reportable event within the meaning of
Section 4043 of ERISA and no Company Pension Plan has incurred any event
described in Section 4041, 4062, or 4063 of ERISA.

                                      -20-
<PAGE>

     (c)  Neither any Company Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan of the
Company or any Company Subsidiaries has incurred an "accumulated funding
deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the
Code or Section 302 of ERISA.

     (d)  Except to the extent set forth on Schedule 4.11(d) or as may result
from the termination of the 401(k) plan referred to, and as contemplated by,
Section 6.4 below, the execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and
the performance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
(either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events),
constitute an event under any of the Plans that will result in any payment
(whether of severance or otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness,
vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits (such
resulting events being collectively referred to as the "ERISA Obligations") with
respect to any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which ERISA
Obligations could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     (e)  (i) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a party to a collective
bargaining agreement or other labor union contract applicable to individuals
employed by the Company or any Subsidiary, (ii) there is no pending or, to the
Company's knowledge, threatened union organizational effort, material labor
dispute, strike or similar work stoppage against the Company or any Company
Subsidiary and (iii) to the Company's knowledge, there is no pending or
threatened charge or complaint against the Company or any Company Subsidiaries
by the National Labor Relations Board or any comparable state agency.

     (f)  Each Plan that has been adopted or maintained by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, whether informally or formally, or with respect to which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary will or may have any liability, for the
benefit of current or former employees who perform services outside the United
States (collectively, the "International Employee Plan") has been established,
maintained and administered in compliance with its terms and conditions and with
the requirements prescribed by any and all statutory or regulatory laws that are
applicable to such International Employee Plan. Furthermore, no International
Employee Plan has unfunded liabilities, that as of the Effective Time, will not
be offset by insurance or fully accrued. Except as required by law, no condition
exists that would prevent the Company or Logitech Subsidiary from terminating or
amending any International Employee Plan at any time for any reason without
liability to Parent, Logitech Subsidiary, the Company or Company Subsidiaries
(other than ordinary administration expenses or routine claims for benefits).

     Section 4.12  Compliance with Laws; Licenses.
                   ------------------------------

     (a)  Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is or has been in
violation of any applicable provisions of any laws, statutes, ordinances or
regulations except where such violations would not have a Material Adverse
Effect.

     (b)  Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has and is in
compliance with all permits, licenses and authorizations (collectively,
"Licenses") which are necessary for it to conduct

                                      -21-
<PAGE>

its business in the manner in which it is presently conducted except where the
failure to have any such permits, licenses and authorizations would not have a
Material Adverse Effect.

     Section 4.13  Environment.
                    ----------

     (a)  Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in conflict with, or
in default or violation of, any Environmental Laws (as defined in Section
4.13(c)(ii) below) or any order, judgment or decree under any Environmental Law,
applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or by which its or any of
their respective properties is bound or affected, except where such conflict,
default or violation does not have a Material Adverse Effect. No investigation
or review by any governmental or regulatory body or authority is pending or, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries, nor has any governmental or regulatory body or authority indicated
to Company an intention to conduct the same, other than, in each such case,
those the outcome of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect.

     (b)  The Company has not disposed of, released, discharged or emitted any
Hazardous Materials (as defined in Section 4.13(c)(i) below) into the soil or
groundwater at any properties owned or leased at any time by the Company, or, to
the knowledge of the Company, at any other property, or exposed any employee or
other individual to any Hazardous Materials or any workplace or environmental
condition in such a manner as would result in any material liability or clean-up
obligation of any kind or nature to the Company. To the knowledge of the
Company, no Hazardous Materials are present in, on, or under any properties
owned, leased or used at any time by the Company, and no reasonable likelihood
exists that any Hazardous Materials will come to be present in, on, or under any
properties owned, leased or used at any time by the Company, so as to give rise
to any material liability or clean-up obligation under any Environmental Laws.

     (c)  Definitions.

          (i)  "Hazardous Material" is any material or substance that is

     Section 4.15  Title to Property.
                   -----------------

     (a)  Neither Company nor any Company Subsidiary owns any material real
property. The Company and each Company Subsidiary has good and defensible title
to all of their material properties and assets, free and clear of all liens,
charges and encumbrances except liens for taxes not yet due and payable and such
liens or other imperfections of title, if any, as do not materially detract from
the value of or materially interfere with the present use of the property
affected thereby.

     (b)  All leases (the "Leases") pursuant to which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary leases from others real or personal property are valid and effective
in accordance with their respective terms, and there is not, under any of such
leases, any existing default or event of default of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or, to the Company's knowledge, any other party (or any event which
with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default and in respect
of which Company or such the Company Subsidiary has not taken adequate steps to
prevent such default from occurring), except for any defaults or events of
default that would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

     (c)  Schedule 4.15 sets forth a list of all real property currently leased
          -------------
by the Company. The Company has provided Logitech Subsidiary with true, complete
and correct copies of each such Lease; no term or condition of any such Lease
has been modified, amended or waived except as shown in such copies; each such
Lease constitutes the entire agreement of the landlord and the tenant
thereunder; and there are no other agreements or arrangements whatsoever
relating to the Company's use or occupancy of any of the premises described in
such Leases. The Company has not transferred or assigned any interest in any
such Lease, nor has the Company subleased or otherwise granted rights of use or
occupancy of any of the premises described therein to any other person or
entity.

     (d)  To the knowledge of the Company, the landlord under each Lease has
complied with all of the requirements, conditions, representations, warranties
and covenants of the landlord thereunder, including, without limitation, the
timely completion of construction of the leased premises in a good and
workmanlike manner and otherwise in accordance with the Leases.

     (e)  There is not pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened
condemnation or similar proceeding affecting any leased property or any portion
thereof.

<PAGE>

     (a)  The Company and the Company Subsidiaries own, or possess, free and
clear of any material liens, adequate licenses or other valid rights to use
(including the right to sublicense to customers, suppliers, or others as
needed), all of the material Company Intellectual Property (as defined below)
that is used in the conduct of Company's or Company Subsidiaries' businesses.
Schedule 4.16 sets forth a complete list of all registered Company Intellectual
Property. Schedule 4.16 lists all material contracts, licenses and agreements to
which Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party: (i) with respect to Company
Intellectual Property licensed or transferred to any third party (other than
agreements relating to the sale or distribution of the Company's products
entered into in the ordinary course); or (ii) pursuant to which a third party
has licensed or transferred any material intellectual property to Company which
is incorporated in the Company's current products.

     (b)  Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has received
from a third party any written notice of infringement or misappropriation of or
conflict with, in any material respects, Company Intellectual Property. To the
knowledge of the Company, the use of such Company Intellectual Property in
connection with the business and operations of the Company and the Company's
Subsidiaries does not infringe, in any material respects, on the rights of any
person or entity. No material claim by any third party contesting the validity,
enforceability, use or ownership of any of the Company Intellectual Property
owned by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, is currently
outstanding or is, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened. The Company has
not received any written notices of any material infringement or
misappropriation by any third party with respect to the Company Intellectual
Property. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is aware of any claim
by any other person or entity that any of the products, processes or business
methods of the Company or any Company Subsidiary infringe or may infringe upon
any intellectual property rights of any other person or entity. The Company and
each of the Company Subsidiaries have taken reasonable actions to maintain and
protect its Company Intellectual Property, except for those actions, which the
failure to take, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material
Adverse Effect.

     (c)  As used herein, "Company Intellectual Property" means all trademarks,
trademark registrations, trademark rights and renewals thereof, trade names,
trade name rights, patent, patent rights, patent applications, industrial
models, inventions, designs, utility models, inventor rights, software, computer
programs, computer systems, copyrights, copyright registrations and renewals

Company Subsidiaries as currently conducted by them, together with all
applications currently pending or in process for any of the foregoing.

     (d)  The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries has taken reasonable
steps to protect the Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' rights in the
Company's confidential information and trade secrets that it wishes to protect
or any trade secrets or confidential information of third parties provided to
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, and, without limiting the foregoing, each
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has and uses commercially

reasonable efforts to enforce a policy requiring each employee and contractor to
execute a proprietary information/confidentiality agreement substantially in the
form provided to Logitech Subsidiary and all current and former employees and
contractors of the Company and any Company Subsidiary have executed such an
agreement, except where the failure to do so is not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably likely to materially impair the Company's or the Company
Subsidiaries' rights in the Company Intellectual Property.

Company shall (x) provide Logitech Subsidiary with notice of any meeting of the

Acquisition Proposal in the same manner and at the same time that such notice is
provided to the Company Board (notwithstanding Section 11.2 hereof) and (y)
provide Logitech Subsidiary with notice of any meeting of the Company Board at
which the Company Board is reasonably expected to recommend a Superior Proposal
to its stockholders in the same manner and at the same time that such notice is
provided to the Company Board (notwithstanding Section 11.2 hereof).

        (c)  Nothing contained in this Section 6.3 shall prohibit (i) the
Company from, in response to an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition
                                             ---- ----
Proposal that the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof)
concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined in Section
6.3(f) below), engaging in discussions or participating in negotiations with,
and furnishing information to, the party making such Acquisition Proposal to the
extent the Company Board (or such committee), after consultation with it legal
counsel, determines in good faith that it is necessary to do so for it to act in
accordance with its fiduciary duties under applicable law or (ii) the Company
Board from taking and disclosing to the Company's stockholders a position with
respect to a tender or exchange offer by a third party required under Rules 14d-
9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure
to the Company's stockholders or otherwise which, in the reasonable judgment of
the Board of Directors after consultation with its legal counsel, may be
required under applicable law, rules or regulations, including, without
limitation, those of any stock exchange.

        (d)  In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in
paragraph (a) of this Section 6.3, prior to the termination hereof, the Company
shall as promptly as practicable, and in any event within one business day after
receipt thereof, advise Logitech Subsidiary orally and in writing of any request
for information which the Company reasonably believes would lead to an
Acquisition Proposal or of any Acquisition Proposal; the material terms and
conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry; and the identity of
the person or group making any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry.
The Company will keep Logitech Subsidiary informed in all material respects of
the status and details (including material amendments or proposed amendments) of
any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry.

        (e)  For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means, other
                                              --------------------

outstanding voting securities, or all or substantially all of the assets, of the

Company Board shall have concluded in good faith (after consultation with
Company's financial advisors) that the acquiring party is reasonably likely to
obtain any necessary financing, and (B) the Company Board shall have concluded
in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors that

                                      -37-
<PAGE>

the Acquisition Proposal would, if consummated, result in a transaction more
favorable from a financial point of view, to the Company and its stockholders
than the Offer and the Merger.

                     --------------------------
immediately preceding the Effective Time, the Company and each Company
Subsidiary, as applicable, shall each terminate any and all group severance,

Subsidiary provides written notice to the Company that such 401(k) plans shall
not be terminated) (collectively, "Company Employee Plans"). Unless Logitech
                                   ----------------------
Subsidiary provides such written notice to the Company, no later than three

        (b)  Logitech Subsidiary agrees that it will vote, or cause to be voted,
all of the Shares then owned by it or any of its other subsidiaries and
affiliates in favor of the approval of the Merger and the adoption of this
Agreement.

        (c)  Each of the Company and Logitech Subsidiary shall notify the other
(and their respective counsel) promptly of the receipt of any comments from the
SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or
supplements to the Post-Effective Amendment or the Proxy Statement for
additional information and shall supply the other with copies of all
correspondence between it or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and
the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Post-Effective
Amendment or the Proxy Statement. Each of the Company and Logitech Subsidiary
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as
practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto. No filing of, or
amendment or supplement to, or correspondence to the SEC or its staff with
respect to, the Post-Effective Amendment or the Proxy Statement will be made by
either party, without providing the other party a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon. Each of the Company and Logitech Subsidiary shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Post-Effective Amendment
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after its
filing. The Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to holders of the Company's capital stock as
promptly as practicable after the Post-Effective Amendment is declared effective
under the Securities Act. Parent shall also take any action (other than
qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so
qualified or to file a general consent to service of process) required to be
taken under any applicable state securities laws in connection with the issuance
of Parent ADSs pursuant to the Offer and the Merger, and the Company shall
furnish all information concerning the Company and its stockholders as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action and the preparation,
filing and/or distribution of the Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time any information relating to the Company or Parent or Logitech
Subsidiary or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should
be discovered by the Company or Logitech Subsidiary which should be set forth in
an amendment or supplement to any of the Post-Effective Amendment or the Proxy
Statement, so that any of such documents would not include a misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties hereto, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by law, disseminated by the Company to holders of the Company's capital
stock.

        (d)  Notwithstanding Section 8.5(a), (b) or (c) hereof, in the event
that Parent, Logitech Subsidiary, Merger Sub or any other subsidiary of Parent
shall acquire at least 90% of the outstanding shares of each class of capital
stock of the Company entitled to vote on the Merger, pursuant to the Offer or
otherwise, the parties hereto agree, at the request of Logitech Subsidiary and
subject to Article 10 hereof, to take all necessary and appropriate action to
cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after such
acquisition, without a meeting of stockholders of the Company, in accordance
with Section 82 of the MBCL.

        Section 10.2  Effect of Termination.  If this Agreement is terminated
                      ---------------------
pursuant to Section 10.1, this Agreement shall become void and have no effect
without any liability or obligation on the part of any party hereto, (a) other
than liabilities and obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement and (b)
except as provided in Section 11.1(b) and Section 11.3 below and except that no
such termination shall relieve any party thereto of any liability for damages
resulting from any willful breach by such party of this Agreement.

                                  Article XI

                                 Miscellaneous
                                 -------------

        Section 11.1  Costs and Expenses.
                      ------------------
        (a)  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby will be paid by the party incurring such expenses; provided,
                                                                       --------
however, that Logitech Subsidiary and the Company shall share equally the costs
and expenses (other than legal and accounting fees) incurred in connection with
the filing, printing and mailing of the Offer Documents and all regulatory
filings.

        (b)  If Logitech Subsidiary shall have terminated this Agreement
pursuant to Section 10.1(d)(iii), the Company shall promptly, but in any event
no later than one business day after the date of such termination, pay Logitech
Subsidiary a fee equal to $4,500,000 in immediately available funds (the
"Termination Fee"). In addition, if this Agreement is terminated by Logitech
 ----------- ---
Subsidiary or the Company, as applicable, prior to the Effective Time pursuant
to Section 10.1(b)(i) without any material failure by Logitech Subsidiary to
fulfill any obligation under this Agreement having been the primary cause of the
failure of Logitech Subsidiary to consummate the Offer, and (i) following the
date of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement, any
Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or shall have become
publicly known, and (ii) within 12 months following the termination of this
Agreement, either a Company Acquisition (as defined below) is consummated, or
the Company shall enter into an agreement providing for a Company Acquisition,
then the Company shall pay Logitech Subsidiary the Termination Fee promptly and
as a condition to so consummating or entering into a definitive agreement. The
Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 11.1(b) are
an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, Logitech Subsidiary would not enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner the
amounts due pursuant to this Section 11.1(b), and, in order to obtain such
payment, Logitech Subsidiary makes a claim that results in a judgment against
the Company, the Company shall pay to Logitech Subsidiary its reasonable costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection
with such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in this Section
11.1(b) at the prime rate Bank of America N. T. and S. A. in effect on the date
such payment was required Logitech Subsidiary to be made. Logitech Subsidiary
agrees that the payment provided for in this Section 11.1(b) shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of Logitech Subsidiary and Merger Sub upon termination of
this Agreement where such fee has been paid, and such remedies shall be limited
to the sum stipulated in this Section 11.1(b), regardless of the circumstances
giving rise to such termination; provided, however, that nothing herein shall
                                 --------  -------
relieve

                                      -47-
<PAGE>

either party hereto from liability for the willful breach of, or fraud in
connection with, any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
set forth in this Agreement.

     For the purposes of this Agreement, "Company Acquisition" shall mean any of
                                          -------------------
the following transactions (other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement):  (i) a sale or other disposition by Company of a business or assets
representing more than 35% of the consolidated net revenues, net income or
assets of the Company immediately prior to such sale; (ii) the acquisition by
any person or group (including by way of a tender offer or an exchange offer or
issuance by the Company), directly or indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a
right to acquire beneficial ownership of shares representing more than 35% of
any class of equity securities of Company; or (iii) a merger, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company (other than a transactions in which the
Company's current stockholders retain more than 65%, directly or indirectly, of
the surviving or successor corporation); it being understood that a widely
distributed offering of Company Common Stock shall not constitute a Company
Acquisition.

which would have the effect of diluting or changing Logitech Subsidiary's rights
hereunder, the number and kind of shares or securities subject to this Agreement
and the price set forth herein at which the Stockholder Shares may be purchased
from the Stockholder pursuant to the Offer shall be appropriately and equitably
adjusted so that Logitech Subsidiary shall receive pursuant to the Offer the

Subsidiary would have received in respect of the Stockholder Shares purchasable
pursuant to the Offer if such purchase had occurred immediately prior to such
event.

      (c)  [The Stockholder shall promptly exercise any rights it has under that
certain letter agreement dated September 28, 2000 among the Stockholder, the
Company and The KB Mezzanine Fund II., L.P. ("KB") to cause KB to tender and/or
                                              --

Logitech Inc.

RE:  Labtec Inc. (the "Company")

Ladies & Gentlemen:

     The undersigned is an owner of record or beneficially of certain shares of
Common Stock of the Company ("Common Stock").  The Company proposes to enter
into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Logitech International S.A.,
("Parent"), Logitech Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, and Thunder
Acquisition Corp. (the "Merger Agreement").  Pursuant to the terms of the Merger
Agreement, Merger Sub will make an exchange offer for all the outstanding shares
of the Company (the "Offer") and subsequently Merger Sub will be merged with and
into the Company with the Company to be the surviving corporation in the merger
(the "Merger").  The undersigned acknowledges that the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement will be of significant benefit to the undersigned and
that you are relying on the representations and agreements of the undersigned
contained in this letter in carrying out and entering into the Merger Agreement.

     As a result of the Offer or the Merger, the undersigned will receive
American Depositary Shares (each a "Parent ADS"), each of which represents one-
tenth of one registered share, par value Chf 10 per share, of Parent (the
"Parent Registered Shares").

     In consideration of the foregoing, the undersigned hereby agrees that from
the date hereof, the undersigned will not offer to sell, contract to sell, or
otherwise sell, dispose of, loan, pledge or grant any rights with respect to
(collectively, a "Disposition") any Parent ADSs now owned or hereafter acquired
directly by such person or with respect to which such person has or hereafter
acquires the power of disposition, otherwise than (i) as a distribution to
partners or shareholders of such person, provided that the distributees thereof
agree in writing to be bound by the terms of this restriction, or (ii)  with the
prior written consent of Parent.  The foregoing restrictions will terminate (i)
with respect to fifty percent (50%) of the number of Parent ADSs received as a
result of the Offer or the Merger on the 60th day after the completion of the
Offer, and (ii) in full 120 days after the Closing of the Offer (the "Lock-Up
Period"). The foregoing restriction has been expressly agreed to preclude the
holder of the Parent ADSs from engaging in any hedging or other transaction
which is designed to or reasonably expected to lead to or result in a
Disposition of any Parent ADSs during the Lock-Up Period, even if such Parent
ADSs would be disposed of by someone other than such holder.  Such prohibited
hedging or other transactions would include, without limitation, any short sale
(whether or not against the box) or any purchase, sale or grant of any right
(including, without limitation, any put or call option)
<PAGE>

with respect to any Parent ADSs or with respect to any security (other than a
broad-based market basket or index) that included, relates to or derives any
significant part of its value from Parent ADSs. The undersigned also agrees and
consents to the entry of stop transfer instructions with the Parent's transfer
agent and registrar against the transfer of Parent ADSs held by the undersigned
except in compliance with the foregoing restrictions.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the restrictions described above in this
letter agreement shall not apply to any Parent Registered Shares (A) now owned
or hereafter acquired directly by the undersigned (including Parent Registered
Shares received from the Depositary for the Parent ADSs upon surrender of the
American Depositary Receipt(s) representing the Parent ADSs) or with respect to
which the undersigned has or hereafter acquires the power of disposition, or (B)
that the undersigned may distribute to the partners or shareholders of such
person, and (ii) the surrender to the Depositary for the Parent ADSs of any or
all Parent ADSs to be received by the undersigned as a result of either the
Offer or the Merger shall not be considered a "Disposition" for purposes of this
letter agreement.

     Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this
Agreement shall terminate upon termination of the Merger Agreement.

                     [The next page is the signature page]
<PAGE>

  This agreement is irrevocable and will be binding on the undersigned and the
respective successors, heirs, personal representatives, and assigns of the
undersigned.  In the event the Offer has not been consummated on or before July
15, 2001, this Lock-Up Agreement shall be of no further force or effect.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     The undersigned has been advised that, as of the date of this letter, the
undersigned may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of Labtec Inc., a Massachusetts

paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the rules and regulations (the "Rules and
Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act").  Pursuant to the terms of

Agreement") among the Company, Logitech International S.A., a Swiss corporation
("Parent"), Logitech Inc., a California corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary
of Parent and Thunder Acquisition Corp., a Massachusetts corporation ("Merger
Sub"), Merger Sub will make an exchange offer for all the outstanding shares of
the Company (the "Offer") and subsequently Merger Sub will be merged with and
into the Company with the Company to be the surviving corporation in the merger
(the "Merger").

     As a result of the Offer or the Merger, the undersigned will receive
American Depository Shares (each a "Parent ADS") of Parent in exchange for
shares owned by the undersigned of common stock, par value $0.01, of the Company
(the "Company Common Stock").  Each Parent ADS represents one-tenth of one
registered share, par value Chf 10 per share, of Parent (the "Parent Registered
Shares", and together with the Parent ADSs, the "Parent Securities").

     The undersigned represents, warrants and covenants to Parent and the
Company that, as of the respective date the undersigned receives any Parent

     A.   The undersigned shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition
of the Parent Securities in violation of the 1933 Act or the Rules and
Regulations.

     B.   The undersigned has read this letter and the Merger Agreement and
discussed, to the extent the undersigned felt necessary with the undersigned's
counsel or counsel for the Company, the requirements of such documents and other
applicable limitations upon the undersigned's ability to sell, transfer or
otherwise dispose of Parent Securities.
<PAGE>

     C.   The undersigned has been advised that the issuance of Parent
Securities to the undersigned pursuant to the Offer or the Merger will be
registered with the SEC under the 1933 Act on a Registration Statement on Form
F-4. The undersigned has also been advised that, because, at the time the Offer
is made to the undersigned or the Merger is submitted for a vote of the
stockholders of the Company, the undersigned may be deemed an affiliate of the
Company, and, if the undersigned is such an affiliate, the undersigned may not
sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Parent Securities issued to the
undersigned in the Offer or the Merger unless such sale, transfer or other
disposition (i) has been registered under the 1933 Act, (ii) is made in
conformity with Rule 145 promulgated by the SEC under the 1933 Act, (iii) in the
opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to Parent, or pursuant to a "no action"
letter obtained by the undersigned from the SEC staff, is otherwise exempt from
registration under the 1933 Act, or (iv) with respect to Parent Securities
issued pursuant to the Offer, to the extent the Company and Logitech Inc. shall
otherwise agree that Rule 145 does not apply to such Parent Securities.

     D.   The undersigned understands that Parent is under no obligation to
register the sale, transfer or other disposition of the Parent Securities by the
undersigned or on the undersigned's behalf under the 1933 Act or to take any
other action necessary in order to enable the undersigned to make such sale,
transfer or other disposition in compliance with an exemption from such
registration.

     E.   The undersigned also understands that there will be placed on the
certificates for the Parent Securities issued to the undersigned, or on any
substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance the following (provided
that, with respect to Parent Securities issued pursuant to the Offer, to the
extent the Company and Logitech Inc. shall otherwise agree that Rule 145 does
not apply to such Parent Securities, such legend shall not be placed on such
certificate):

          "THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A
          TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF

          THE PRINCIPAL OFFICES OF LOGITECH INTERNATIONAL S.A."

     F.   The undersigned also understands that, unless the transfer by the
undersigned of the undersigned's Parent Securities have been registered under
the 1933 Act or is a sale made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145,
Parent reserves the right to put the following legend on the certificates issued
to the undersigned's transferee (provided that, with respect to Parent
Securities issued pursuant to the Offer, to the extent the Company and Logitech
Inc. shall otherwise agree that Rule 145 does not apply to such Parent
Securities, such legend shall not be placed on such certificate):

          "THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN
          REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
<PAGE>

          AND WERE ACQUIRED FROM A PERSON WHO RECEIVED SUCH SECURITIES IN A
          TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF
          1933 APPLIES. THE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN ACQUIRED BY THE HOLDER WITH
          A VIEW TO, OR FOR RESALE IN CONNECTION WITH, ANY DISTRIBUTION THEREOF
          WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND MAY NOT BE SOLD,
          TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE
          REGISTRATION STATEMENT OR IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN EXEMPTION FROM THE
          REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933."

     It is understood and agreed that, except as Parent may otherwise agree, the
legends set forth in paragraphs E and F above shall be removed by delivery of
substitute certificates without such legend if (i) the securities represented
thereby have been registered for sale by the undersigned under the 1933 Act or
(ii) Parent has received either an opinion of counsel, which opinion and counsel
shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or a "no-action" letter obtained by
the undersigned from the SEC staff to the effect that the restrictions imposed
by Rule 145 under the 1933 Act no longer apply to the undersigned.

     G.   The undersigned further understands and agrees that the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the undersigned set
forth herein are for the benefit of Parent, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and will be relied upon by such
firms and their respective counsel and accountants.

     H.   The undersigned understands and agrees that this letter agreement
shall apply to all Parent Securities that are acquired by the undersigned in the
Offer or the Merger.

     Execution of this letter should not be considered an admission on the part
of the undersigned that the undersigned is an "affiliate" of the Company as
described in the first paragraph of this letter, nor as a waiver of any rights
that the undersigned may have to object to any claim that the undersigned is
such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.
