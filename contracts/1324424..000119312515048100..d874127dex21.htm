1 AGREEMENT

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and the covenants,
premises, representations and warranties and agreements contained in this
Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound,
the parties to this Agreement agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE 1

THE MERGER 

1.1 _The Merger_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").
The Merger shall be effected pursuant to the DGCL and shall have the effects
set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all of the
property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company
and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all of the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the necessity
of further action by the Company or any other Person, the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended so as to read in
its entirety in the form set forth as _Exhibit A_ hereto, and as so amended
shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. In
addition, the Company and the Surviving Corporation shall take all necessary
action such that, at the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended so as to read in its entirety in the form set
forth as _Exhibit B_ hereto, and as so amended shall be the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein
or by applicable Law.

(c) At the Effective Time, the Company and the Surviving Corporation shall
take all necessary action such that, by virtue of the Merger and without the
necessity of further action by the Company or any other person, the directors
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time or such other
individuals designated by the Parent prior to the Effective Time shall become
the directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office, from and
after the Effective Time, in accordance with the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors
shall have been duly elected, designated or qualified, or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. The officers of the 

 



2  Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, from and after the
Effective Time, shall continue as the officers of the Surviving Corporation,
each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors shall
have been duly elected, designated or qualified, or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

(d) If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall determine, in its sole discretion, or shall be advised, that any deeds,
bills of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments, assurances or any other
actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest
in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the
Company or Merger Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation
as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out
this Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation
shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of
either the Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, instruments
of conveyance, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and
on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such other actions
and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any
and all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights, properties or
assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

 

(e) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Equity Interests of the
Company, other than as expressly permitted by _Section 5.1(b)_, shall occur
as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including
a reverse stock split), subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment
of shares, or any dividend or distribution with a record date during such
period, the Merger Consideration will be equitably adjusted to reflect such
change.

 

1.2 _Closing and Effective Time of the Merger_. The closing of the Merger (the
" _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on a date
to be specified by the parties (the " _Closing Date_ "), such date to be no
later than the third Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of all of the
applicable conditions set forth in _Article 6_  (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of those conditions at the Closing), at the offices of
Latham and Watkins LLP, 330 North Wabash Avenue, Suite 2800, Chicago, Illinois
60611, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto. On the Closing Date, or on such other date as Merger Sub and
the Company may agree to in writing, Merger Sub or the Company shall cause
a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), to be executed and
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings
required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time the
Certificate of Merger shall have been duly filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware, or such later date and time as is agreed upon by the
parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger (such date and time
hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



3 ARTICLE 2

 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER

 

2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or
the holders of any of the following securities:

(a) _Conversion of Shares_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than Shares to be cancelled or converted
pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_ or Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into
the right to receive $12.00 in cash, without interest (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "), payable net to the holder in cash, subject to any
withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law, upon surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2_. As of the
Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be
paid in accordance with  _Section 2.2_.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Shares and Parent-Owned Shares_. Each Share held
by the Company as treasury stock or held directly by Parent, Purchaser or
Merger Sub, in each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in
respect thereof. Each Share held by any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company or of Parent (other than Purchaser and Merger Sub),
in each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall automatically
be converted into such number of shares of the Surviving Corporation so as to
maintain relative ownership percentages.

(c) _Merger Sub Equity Interests_. All outstanding Equity Interests of Merger
Sub held immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and
become (in the aggregate) 100 shares of newly and validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall designate a
reputable bank or trust company to act as the paying agent (the identity and
terms of designation and appointment of which shall be reasonably acceptable
to the Company) for purposes of effecting the payment of the Merger
Consideration in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ").
The Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, the fees and expenses of the
Paying Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger
Consideration to which holders of Shares shall be entitled at the Effective
Time pursuant to this Agreement. In the event such deposited funds are
insufficient to make the payments contemplated pursuant to _Section 2.1_, the
Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying
Agent such additional funds to ensure that the Paying Agent has sufficient
funds to make such payments. Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent
as directed by Merger Sub, in its sole discretion, pending payment thereof by
the Paying Agent to the holders of the Shares; _provided_ , _however_ , that
any such investments shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United
States government or rated 

 



4  A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investor Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively. Earnings from such investments shall be the sole
and exclusive property of Merger Sub, and no part of such earnings shall
accrue to the benefit of holders of Shares.

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_.

 

(i) _Certificates_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no
event later than three Business Days after the Effective Time), the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person that was,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares
represented by certificates (the " _Certificates_ "), which Shares
were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the
Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (A) a letter of transmittal, which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon receipt of the Certificates by the
Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form as the Parent and the Paying
Agent shall reasonably agree; and (B) instructions for effecting the surrender
of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as
provided in _Section 2.2(e)_ and, if required an indemnity bond) in exchange
for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in _Section 2.2(e)_
and, if required, an indemnity bond) to the Paying Agent or to such other
agent or agents as may be appointed by Merger Sub, and upon delivery of a
letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such
Certificates, the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificates
(after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section
2.5_), any Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment
of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name any surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition
precedent of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered and
shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid. No interest
will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Agreement,
except for Certificates representing Shares held by Dissenting Stockholders,
which shall be deemed to represent the right to receive payment of the fair
value of such Shares in accordance with and to the extent provided by Section
262 of the DGCL.

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, no holder of non-certificated Shares represented by book-
entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall be required to deliver a Certificate or,
in the case of holders of Book-Entry Shares held through The Depository Trust
Company, an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the
Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
_Section 2.1(a)_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more
Book-Entry Shares held through The Depository Trust Company whose Shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall upon
receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents message" (or such other evidence,
if any of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request)

 



5  be entitled to receive, and the Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay
and deliver to The Depository Trust Company or its nominee as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time, in respect of each such Book-Entry
Share a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the Merger
Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 2.5_), and such Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall
at the Effective Time be cancelled. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time (and in no event later than three Business Days after the Effective
Time), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
Person that was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record
of Book-Entry Shares not held through The Depository Trust Company: (A) a
letter of transmittal, which shall be in such form as the Parent and the
Paying Agent shall reasonably agree; and (B) instructions for returning such
letter of transmittal in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon delivery
of such letter of transmittal, in accordance with the terms of such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Book-Entry Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately
available funds equal to the Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in  _Section 2.5_), and such Book-
Entry Shares shall at the Effective Time be cancelled. Payment of the Merger
Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the
Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. No interest will
be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Book-Entry
Shares. Until paid or surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Book-Entry
Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this
Agreement, except for Book-Entry Shares representing Shares held by Dissenting
Stockholders, which shall be deemed to represent the right to receive payment
of the fair value of such Shares in accordance with and to the extent
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records
of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Agreement.

 

(d) _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. Any portion of
the funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made
available to the Paying Agent that remains unclaimed by the holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the first anniversary of the Effective
Time will be returned to the Surviving Corporation or an affiliate thereof
designated by the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any such holder who
has not tendered its Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.2(b)_ prior to such time shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) for delivery of the Merger
Consideration, without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes
required by applicable Law, in respect of such holders surrender of their
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in
_Section 2.2(b)_. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by the holders
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to such time as such
amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental
Entity will,

 



6  to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation or an affiliate thereof designated by the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of any claim or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Parent, Merger
Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or their respective
affiliates will be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the
Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section
2.2(a)_ to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights have been perfected
shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand.

(e)  _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_. Merger
Sub may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the
payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in a reasonable sum as it may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary (but subject to the provisions of this _Section 2.3_), Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
is entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal for such Shares in
accordance with, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the
DGCL (such Shares, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, all
Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and cease to exist, and the holders of
Dissenting Shares shall only be entitled to the rights granted to them under
the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws
or loses his right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or other
applicable Law, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of
such Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed
to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into and shall be
exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law.
The Company shall give Merger Sub prompt notice of any demands received by
the Company for appraisal of Shares and any other instruments served pursuant
to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to rights to be paid the fair
value of Dissenting Shares, and Merger Sub shall have the right to
participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Merger Sub, voluntarily make any payment with
respect to, or settle or compromise, any such demands, or approve any
withdrawal of any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

2.4 _Treatment of Options and Restricted Stock Units_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Options_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
option to purchase Shares (each, a " _Company Option_ ") under any stock
option or other equity or equity-based plan of the Company, including the 2007
Equity and Incentive Plan, as amended and restated effective as of June 11,
2013 (the " _Company Equity Plans_ "), that is unexpired

 



7  and unexercised and vested immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "
_Vested Company Option_ ") (or portion thereof), shall be cancelled and, in
exchange therefor, each former holder of any such cancelled Vested Company
Option shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of
such Vested Company Option and in settlement therefor, a payment in cash
(subject to any applicable withholding or other Taxes required by applicable
Law) of an amount equal to the product of (i) the total number of Shares
subject to such Vested Company Option immediately prior to such cancellation
and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise
price per Share subject to such Vested Company Option immediately prior to
such cancellation (such amounts payable hereunder being referred to as the "
_Option Payments_ "). No holder of a Vested Company Option that, as
of immediately prior to such cancellation, has an exercise price per Share
that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to
any payment with respect to such cancelled Vested Company Option. From and
after the Effective Time, each Vested Company Option shall no longer be
exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only entitle such holder
to the payment of the Option Payment, if any. On or as soon as practicable
following the Closing, but in any event no later than 15 days following the
Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall make, by a payroll payment through
the Companys or Merger Subs payroll provider and subject to withholding, if
any, as described in _Section 2.5_ to each holder of Vested Company Options,
such holders Option Payment.

(b) _Treatment of Restricted Stock Units_. Effective as of the Effective
Time, each outstanding restricted stock unit (including performance-based
restricted stock units and deferred stock units) with respect to the Shares
(each a " _Company RSU_ ") that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be assumed by the Parent (an " _Assumed RSU_ "). Except
as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, each Company RSU so assumed by the
Parent pursuant to this _Section 2.4(b)_ shall continue to have, and be
subject to, the same terms and conditions (including vesting terms) set forth
in the Company Equity Plan and the Company RSU agreements relating thereto, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that such Assumed
RSU shall cover that number of whole shares of Parent common stock, rounded
down to the nearest whole share, equal to the product of the number of Shares
underlying such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time
_multiplied by_ the Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , _however_ , that with
respect to any Company RSU that is subject to performance vesting criteria,
the number of Shares underlying such Company RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall equal the target number of Shares covered by such
Company RSU, and, following the Effective Time, the performance vesting
criteria with respect to the Assumed RSU shall no longer apply and the vesting
of such Assumed RSU shall be subject to continued employment through the end
of the applicable performance period or any later date required under the
terms of the Company RSU in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) _Other Equity Matters_. With respect to each employee of the Company and
its Subsidiaries who is not a party to an employment agreement, offer letter,
or severance plan that provides for acceleration of vesting and whose
employment is terminated in an Acceleration Eligible Termination during the
one-year period immediately following the Effective Time, (i) any
Assumed RSUs (other than Assumed RSUs that were performance-based on the
grant date of the corresponding Company RSU) held by such individual that
would have vested during the one-year period following the date of the
Acceleration Eligible Termination, and (ii) the Pro Rata Portion of any other
Assumed RSUs held by such individual immediately shall vest. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Pro Rata Portion_ " shall mean a number of shares of 

 



8  Parent common stock subject to the Assumed RSU equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (A) the total number of shares of Parent common stock covered
by the Assumed RSU, by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
number of days elapsed from and including the applicable grant date through
and including the date of the Acceleration Eligible Termination and the
denominator of which is the total number of days in the applicable
performance period (or such longer period required under the terms of the
applicable Company RSU in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time).

 

(d) _Termination of Company Equity Plans_. As of the Effective Time, all
Company Equity Plans shall be terminated and no further Shares, Company
Options, Company RSUs, Equity Interests or other rights with respect to Shares
shall be granted thereunder.

(e) _Board Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and
take all other actions necessary and appropriate (including obtaining any
required consents) to effect the transactions described in this _Section
2.4_.

2.5 _Withholding Rights_. Merger Sub, Purchaser, Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement, such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder or any other provision of applicable Law.
To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

shall be deemed to apply to and qualify the representation and warranty set

Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities Act) (each, a " _Significant
Company Subsidiary_ ") and each other Company Subsidiary is a corporation or
other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing

its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Company Subsidiary_ ") is duly qualified to do
business, and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions which
recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or
operation of its properties or assets or the conduct of its business requires
such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or
in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The Company has made available or caused to be made available to Merger
Sub true and complete copies of (i) any amendments to the Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the " _Company Charter_

Shares or shares of Company Preferred Stock subject to or reserved for

the Company Equity Plans (assuming, with respect to any performance-based
awards, maximum performance), and (iii) 4,243,257 Shares reserved for future

subject to issuance under the Company Equity Plans upon issuance prior to the
Effective Time on the terms and conditions specified in the

other Equity Interests other than Shares issued upon the exercise of any
Company Options or settlement of Company RSUs outstanding as of the close of
business on the Capitalization Date in accordance with their terms.

the Company Equity Plans and the related award agreements, there are no

such enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other
similar Laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights
generally and (ii) the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other
forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the
discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought).

the Company Bylaws, the adoption of this Agreement by the affirmative vote of
the holders of Shares representing a majority of the outstanding Shares (the "
_Company Stockholder Approval_ ") constitutes the only vote required of the
holders of any class or series of the Companys capital stock that is required
to adopt this Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger.

Agreement by the Company, the consummation by the Company of the Merger or

result in the creation of a Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of the
respective properties or assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary

party or any

 



12  Company Permit, except, with respect to clauses (b), (c)(d) and (d), for any

would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

3.5 _Required Filings and Consents_. Assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Parent and Merger Sub in _Section 4.4_,
none of the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by the
Company, the consummation by the Company of the Merger or any other

(a) The Company and each Company Subsidiary holds all franchises, grants,
authorizations, licenses, permits, certificates, variances, exemptions,
approvals, Orders, registrations, easements and clearances of any Governmental

"), except where the failure to comply with, to have, or the suspension or
cancellation of, or failure to be valid or in full force and effect of, any of

the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. To the Knowledge
of the Company, no investigation by any Governmental Entity with respect to
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is pending, nor has any Governmental
Entity indicated to the Company an intention to conduct any such
investigation, except for such investigations, the outcomes of which if
determined adversely to the Company or any Company Subsidiary, individually or
in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to be
material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. 

 



13 (c) Since January 1, 2010, neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries, in

(a) Since December 31, 2013 through the date of this Agreement, except for the
discussion and negotiation of this Agreement, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses in all material
respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.

hereof. The Company has made available to Parent or filed with the SEC prior
to the date hereof correct and complete copies of each material Benefit Plan.

reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, each

administered in accordance with its terms and ERISA, the Code and all other
applicable Laws. Each Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination or opinion
letter from the IRS as to its qualified status or may rely upon an opinion
letter for a prototype plan and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no fact or
event has occurred that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
qualified status of any such Benefit Plan. Except as, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, to the Knowledge of the Company, there has not been
any "prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA
or Section 4975 of the Code, other than a transaction that is exempt under a

cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien upon any of the
respective properties or assets of the Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent
Subsidiary pursuant to, any Contract, permit or other instrument or obligation
to which the Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent Subsidiary is a party or by
which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound
or affected, except, with respect to clauses (b) and (c), for any such

Parent Material Adverse Effect.

4.5  _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, (a) there is no Proceeding pending,
or, to the Knowledge of the Parent, threatened that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect or challenges the validity or propriety of the Merger, and (b)
neither the Parent nor Merger Sub is subject to any outstanding Order that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to

4.11 _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Each of the Parent and Merger
Sub has conducted its own independent review and analysis of the business,

5.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) From the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the Effective Time and

Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary to: (i) provide to the
Parent and Merger Sub and their respective officers, directors, employees,
accountants, consultants, legal counsel, investment bankers, advisors and

access during normal business hours in such a manner as not to interfere

any Company Subsidiary, upon prior notice to the Company, to the officers,
employees, properties, offices and other facilities of the Company and each
Company Subsidiary and to the books and records thereof, (ii)
use commercially reasonable efforts to furnish during normal business hours

as the Parent or the Parent Representatives may reasonably request including
monthly, quarterly, and annual unaudited financial statements prepared in the
ordinary course of business and delivered to Parent within 45 days of the
relevant period end, as applicable (" _Interim Financial Reports_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to (or to
cause any Company Subsidiary to) afford such access or furnish such

result in the loss of attorney-client privilege (but the Company shall use its
reasonable efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that
does not result in a loss of attorney-client privilege), (B) result in the
disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any obligations

Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, or (C) breach, contravene or

_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), shall apply with respect to information
furnished under this _Section 5.2_ by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries
and their Representatives, including the provisions therein regarding "Highly
Confidential Information." Prior to the Closing, each of the Parent and its
affiliates shall not, and shall cause their respective Representatives not to,
contact or otherwise communicate with the employees (other than members of
the Companys senior leadership team), customers, suppliers, distributors of
the Company or its Subsidiaries regarding the post-closing operation of the
business of the Company where the purpose of such communication is to
initiate, encourage or solicit a change in such Persons relationship with the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, this Agreement or the Transactions without
the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

5.3 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 5.3(b)_, from and after the date hereof until the
Effective Time or, if earlier, the valid termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article 7_ , (x) the Company shall not, and shall cause the
Company Subsidiaries not to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
the Company Representatives not to on behalf of the Company, directly or
indirectly: initiate, solicit or take any action to knowingly encourage or
take any other action intended to facilitate (including by way of providing
material non-public information) the submission of, any Acquisition Proposal
or engage in any discussions or negotiations with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal (other than informing any Third Party in writing of the existence of
the provisions contained in this _Section 5.3_), _except_ _that_ the Company
may ascertain facts from any Person making an Acquisition Proposal for the
purpose of the Company Board informing itself about such Acquisition Proposal
and the Third Party making it. Neither the Company Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or

publicly disclosed, fail to publicly recommend against any such Acquisition
Proposal within 10 Business Days of the request of Parent and reaffirm the
Company Board Recommendation within such 10 Business Day period upon such
request, (ii) withdraw, change or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw,
change or qualify, in any such case in a manner adverse to the Parent or
Merger Sub, the Company Board Recommendation, (iii) approve or cause the

agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) resolve or agree to do
any of the foregoing (any action set forth in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii)
or (iv) of this sentence (to the extent related to the foregoing clauses (i)
or (ii) of this sentence), a " _Change of Board Recommendation_ "). The
Company shall (A) promptly cease and cause (or in the case of the Company
Representatives, use reasonable best efforts to cause) to be terminated any
discussion or negotiation with any Persons conducted prior to the date hereof
by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of the Company
Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (B) request the
prompt return or destruction of all information previously furnished to any
such Person or its representatives and written certification of such return
or destruction, (C) only waive any "standstill" provisions binding such Person
or its representatives of which the Company is a

 



35  beneficiary on the condition that such Person shall not in any way restrict
the Company or the Company Representatives from complying with its obligations
under this _Section 5.3_, provided that the Company must notify Parent of
any such waiver within 24 hours, and (D) take such action as is reasonably
necessary to enforce against such Person or its representatives any
confidentiality provisions or provisions of similar effect to which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or of which any of them is a
beneficiary.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(a)_,
if at any time following the date hereof and prior to the receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval (i) the Company has received a bona fide
unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party, (ii) the Company
has not breached this _Section 5.3_ in any material respect with respect to
such Acquisition Proposal and (iii) the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel,
based on information then available, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, then the
Company may, subject to providing prior written notice to the Parent of its
decision to take such action and compliance with _Section 5.3(c)_, (A)
furnish information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
to the Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal, its representatives and
potential sources of financing and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal regarding
such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that the Company (x) will not, and will
cause the Company Subsidiaries not to and` will instruct the Company
Representatives not to disclose any information to such Person without first
entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such Person and (y)
will provide to the Parent any material information concerning the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries provided or made available to such other Person which
was not previously provided or made available to the Parent as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within 48 hours).

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify the
Parent in writing in the event that the Company receives any Acquisition
Proposal or of any request for information relating to the making of any
Acquisition Proposal, and shall keep Parent informed of the material proposed
terms (including amendments or proposed amendments thereto) of any
such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall notify the Parent orally and in
writing promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) of the identity of such
Person and provide to Parent a copy of such Acquisition Proposal (or, where no
such copy is available, a reasonable description, including the identity of
the other party and all material terms, of such Acquisition Proposal). Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24
hours after such determination) advise the Parent if the Company determines
to begin providing information or to engage in discussions or negotiations
concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to _Section 5.3(b)_.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(a)_,
if the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did
not result from a breach of this _Section 5.3_ and the Company Board
determines, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, the
Company Board may at any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, (i) effect a Change of Board Recommendation with respect to such
Superior Proposal or fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in
the Proxy

 



36  Statement and/or (ii) terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, in either case subject to
the requirements of this  _Section 5.3(d)_. The Company shall not be
entitled to effect a Change of Board Recommendation pursuant to this _Section
5.3(d)_ or terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 5.3(d)_ and 
_Section 7.1(f)_ unless the Company shall have provided to the Parent at
least three Business Days prior written notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") of
the Companys intention to take such action, which notice shall specify the
material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal (including the
identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal), and shall have
provided to the Parent a copy of the available proposed transaction agreement
and all other definitive agreements to be entered into in connection with
such Acquisition Proposal, and:

(i) during the Notice Period, if requested by Parent, the Company shall have,
and shall have caused its legal and financial advisors to have, engaged in
good faith negotiations with Parent regarding any amendment to this Agreement
proposed in writing by Parent and intended to cause the relevant proposal to
no longer constitute a Superior Proposal; and

(ii) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any adjustments
and/or proposed amendments to this Agreement (including a change to the price
terms hereof) and the other agreements contemplated hereby that may be
irrevocably offered in writing by Parent (the " _Proposed Changed Terms_
") no later than 11:59 a.m., New York City time, on the last day of the
Notice Period and shall have determined in good faith that the Superior
Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such Proposed
Changed Terms were to be given effect.

In the event of any material revisions to such Superior Proposal offered in
writing by the party making such Superior Proposal, the Company shall be
required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to again comply with
the requirements of this _Section 5.3(d)_ with respect to such new written
notice, except that the Notice Period shall be 48 hours with respect to any
such revised Superior Proposal, but no such new written notice shall shorten
the original Notice Period.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(a)_,
in circumstances other than in response to an Acquisition Proposal as provided
in _Section 5.3(d)_, the Company Board may at any time prior to obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval effect a Change of Board Recommendation if
(i) the Company Board determines that an Intervening Event has occurred and is
continuing and (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to effect a Change of
Board Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company, but
such Change of Board Recommendation shall not occur until a time that is
after the third Business Day following the Parents receipt of written notice
from the Company advising the Parent of all available material information
with respect to such Intervening Event and stating that it intends to make a
Change of Board Recommendation, and provided that (A) during such three
Business Day period the Company has negotiated in good faith with the Parent
to the extent the Parent wishes to negotiate to make such adjustments to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Company Board
to proceed with the Company Board Recommendation and (B) at the end of such
three Business Day period,

 



37  the Company Board maintains its determination described in this clause (ii)
(after taking into account any adjustments offered in writing by the Parent to
the material terms and conditions of this Agreement).

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ shall prohibit the Company Board
from (i) disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act; or (ii) making any disclosure to the
stockholders of the Company if the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to make such
disclosure would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties or, based on the advice of outside counsel, violate applicable Law.
The issuance by the Company or the Company Board of a "stop, look and listen"
statement pending disclosure of its position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9
and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, shall not constitute a
Change of Board Recommendation.

5.4 _SEC Filings; Other Actions_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, but no later than within 20 Business Days, the Company
shall prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement relating to the
approval of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders (as amended and
supplemented from time to time, the " _Proxy Statement_ "), which shall,
subject to  _Section 5.3_, include the Company Board Recommendation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence and the 20 Business Day requirement,
the Company shall be permitted to amend the Proxy Statement to provide
additional disclosure required by applicable Law in connection with the
Companys annual meeting of stockholders no later than 10 Business Days after
the initial filing of the Proxy Statement. Parent and Merger Sub, and their
counsel, shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Proxy
Statement before it is filed with the SEC, and the Company shall give due
consideration to any reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by the Parent and Merger Sub or their counsel. The Company shall use
all reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to comments by
the SEC staff in respect of the Proxy Statement and to cause the definitive
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as of the record
date established for the Company Meeting as promptly as practicable after the
date of this Agreement, and in no event more than five Business Days after the
date on which the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall provide Parent and its counsel with copies of
any written comments, and shall provide them a summary of any oral comments,
that the Company or its counsel receive from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable after receipt of such
comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. Parent and its counsel
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such responses and the
Company shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions
or changes suggested thereto by Parent and its counsel. Parent and Merger Sub
shall furnish all information that is customarily included in a proxy
statement prepared in connection with transactions of the type contemplated by
this Agreement concerning themselves and their affiliates as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof.

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall (i)
take all action necessary in accordance with the DGCL, the Company Charter,
and the

 



38  Company Bylaws to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of
its stockholders promptly following the mailing of the Proxy Statement for the
purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (the " _Company
Meeting_ "), with the record date and meeting date of the Company Meeting to
be selected after reasonable consultation with Parent, and (ii) subject to a
Change of Board Recommendation in accordance with _Section 5.3_, shall
include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and use all
reasonable efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including by postponing or adjourning the Company Meeting by up to an
aggregate of 10 Business Days, after consultation with Parent, to allow
additional solicitation of votes if necessary in order to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval). The Company may also postpone or adjourn the
Company Meeting, limited in the case of the following clause (ii) by up to an
aggregate of 10 Business Days (i) with the consent of the Parent, (ii) if a
quorum has not been established, (iii) to allow reasonable additional time
for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the
Company Board has determined in good faith after consultation with outside
legal and financial advisors is necessary under applicable Law and for such
supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the
Companys stockholders prior to the Company Meeting or (iv) if required by
Law.

 

(c) At the Company Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof, the
Parent shall vote, or cause to be voted, all of the Shares, if any, then
owned by the Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective controlled
affiliates in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the
Merger and to deliver or provide, in its capacity as a stockholder of the
Company, any other approvals that are required by applicable Law to effect
the Merger.

5.5 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section_ 5.5(b) the Company, the Parent and Merger Sub shall
use their best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate
action and do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, (ii)
take such actions as may be required to cause the expiration of the notice
periods under Competition Laws with respect to such transactions as promptly
as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, (iii) obtain from any
Governmental Entities any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals,
authorizations or Orders required to be obtained by the Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries in order to effect the
Closing by not later than two Business Days prior to the Outside Date (or if
extended, the Extended Outside Date or Second Extended Outside Date, as then
applicable) and to avoid any action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity
(including those in connection with Competition Laws), in connection with the
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, (iv) cause the
satisfaction of all conditions set forth in _Article 6_ , (v) vigorously

it is a party challenging or affecting this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case until the
issuance of a final, non-appealable Order, (vi) seek to have lifted or
rescinded any injunction or restraining order which may adversely affect
the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, in each case until the issuance of a final, non-appealable

 



39  Order, (vii) as promptly as practicable, make or cause to be made all
necessary applications and filings (and in any event file all required HSR Act
notifications within ten Business Days after the date hereof), and thereafter
make any other required submissions, and pay any fees due in connection
therewith (all such fees to be solely the responsibility of, and to be paid
by, the Parent and Merger Sub), with respect to this Agreement or the Merger
required under any Competition Laws, and (viii) as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof, make all necessary filings, and thereafter
make any other required submissions, and pay any fees due in
connection therewith, with respect to this Agreement, the Merger required
under any Competition Laws and any other applicable Law. The Company, the
Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate with each other in connection with (x)
preparing and filing the Proxy Statement and any Other Filings, (y)
determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any
Governmental Entity is required, in connection with the consummation of the
Merger and (z) seeking any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers or
making any such filings. The Company and the Parent shall furnish to each
other all information required for any application or other filing under the
rules and regulations of any applicable Law in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No parties to this Agreement
shall consent to any voluntary delay of the Closing at the behest of any
Governmental Entity without the consent of the other parties to this
Agreement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. The Parent and the Company shall not, except as may be consented
to in writing by the other party, directly or indirectly through one or more
of their respective affiliates, take any action, including acquiring or
making any investment in any corporation, partnership, limited liability
company or other business organization or any division or assets thereof, that
would reasonably be expected to cause a material delay in the satisfaction of
the conditions contained in _Article 6_ or the consummation of the Merger.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in  _Section 5.5(a)_, the
Parent agrees to use its best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, any and
all steps and to make, or cause to be made, any and all undertakings necessary
to resolve, avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
Competition Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect
to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and in any event, no later than the Second Extended Outside
Date), including (A) proposing, negotiating, committing to, and effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture,
licensing or disposition of any assets, properties or businesses of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (B) accepting any operational
restrictions or otherwise taking or committing to take actions that limit the
Parents or any Parent Subsidiarys freedom of action with respect to, or its
ability to retain, any of the assets, properties, licenses, rights, product
lines, operations or businesses of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
each case, as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
lifting or dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order, or
other Order in any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect
of preventing or delaying the Closing, as applicable; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary shall be required to propose,
negotiate, commit to, effect, or accept any of the actions specified in
_Section 5.5(b)(A) or 5.5(b)(B)_if such actions would reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the
business, operations or financial condition of the Company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole. In addition, Parent shall use its best efforts
to defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted before any court
or administrative body with applicable jurisdiction by any party in order to
avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any Order (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the Closing from
occurring on or prior to the Second Extended Outside Date (as it may be
extended).

 



40 (c) The Company and the Parent shall give (or shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to give) any notices to Third Parties, and use, and cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use, commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
Third Party consents, approvals or waivers identified on _Schedule 5.5(c)_ and
the Company and Merger Sub shall coordinate and cooperate in seeking any such
consents, approvals or waivers. In the event that either party shall fail to
obtain any Third Party consent described in the first sentence of this
_Section 5.5(c)_ such party shall take any such actions reasonably requested
by the other party hereto (at such other partys sole cost and expense), to
minimize any adverse effect upon the Company and the Parent, their respective
Subsidiaries, and their respective businesses resulting, or which would
reasonably be expected to result, after the Effective Time, from the failure
to obtain such consent.

(d) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
5.5_, each party hereto shall: (i) give the other parties prompt notice of the
making or commencement of any request, inquiry, Investigation, action or
Proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) keep the
other parties informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry,
Investigation, action or Proceeding; (iii) promptly inform the other parties
of any communication to or from any Governmental Entity regarding the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iv)
promptly provide to the other parties copies of any written communications
received or provided by such party, or any of its Subsidiaries, from or to any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party hereto will
consult and cooperate with the other parties and will consider in good faith
the views of the other parties in connection with any filing, analysis,
appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal
made or submitted in connection with the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, except as may be
prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any Law, in connection with any
such request, inquiry, Investigation, action or Proceeding, each party hereto
will permit authorized representatives of the other parties to be present at
each meeting or conference relating to such request, inquiry, Investigation,
action or Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in
connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any
Governmental Entity in connection with such request, inquiry, Investigation,
action or Proceeding.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the Parent or Merger Sub,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the
Company prior to the consummation of the Merger. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete unilateral control and supervision over its
business operations.

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Company Representatives to, provide all customary
cooperation, including provision of customary financial information, that is
reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with any third-
party debt financing obtained by Merger Sub for the 

 



41  purpose of financing the Merger (it being understood that the receipt of any
such debt financing is not a condition to the Merger); _provided_ , _however_
, that (i) no such cooperation shall be required to the extent it would (A)
unreasonably disrupt the conduct of the Companys business or (B) require the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries to incur any fees, expenses or other
liability prior to the Effective Time for which it is not promptly reimbursed
or simultaneously indemnified and (ii) the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries shall not be required to execute any credit or security
documentation or similar agreement prior to the Effective Time.

(g) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent and
Merger Sub at least three Business Days (or such later day as shall be
reasonably practicable) prior to the Effective Time a customary payoff letter
with respect to the Credit Agreement, dated as of March 25, 2013, among the
Company, Credit Suisse AG, as administrative agent, collateral agent, L/C
issuer and swingline lender, and the lenders from time to time party thereto
(as amended, supplemented, modified, refinanced or replaced, the " _Existing
Loan Agreement_ "). The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
facilitate the termination and repayment in full of all obligations under the
Existing Loan Agreement, and the release of any liens and termination of all
guarantees in connection therewith, at, and subject to the occurrence of,
the Effective Time; _provided_ that the Company shall have the necessary
funds on hand, or shall have received from Parent the funds necessary, to pay
in full such obligations. Parent shall reimburse the Company for any out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by the Company pursuant to this _Section 5.5(g)_.

(h) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent
and Merger Sub in connection with (i) the replacement, backstopping or
amendment, as of the Effective Date, of outstanding financial guaranties,
letters of credit, letters of guaranty, surety bonds and other similar
instruments and obligations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
including granting any waivers in respect thereof and facilitating the
migration of such financial products to the facilities of Parent or its
affiliates and (ii) the satisfaction or amendment, as of the Effective Date,
of derivative financial instruments or arrangements (including swaps, caps,
floors, futures, forward contracts, option agreements), in each case as
reasonably requested by Parent. Parent shall reimburse the Company for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Company pursuant to this _Section
5.5(h)_.

5.6 _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article 7_ , unless prohibited by applicable Law each party
hereto shall promptly notify the other party hereto of any material change,
effect, development or any event that would reasonably be expected to cause
any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Merger or any
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied. Any
such notice pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ shall not affect any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
and any failure to make such notice (in and of itself) shall not be taken
into account in determining whether the conditions set forth in _Article 6_
have been satisfied or give rise to any right of termination set forth in
_Article 7_.

 

5.7 _Public Announcements_. So long as this Agreement is in effect, the Parent
and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other, shall not,
and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause their respective advisors
not to, issue any press release or make any public statement with respect to
the Merger or this Agreement without the prior written

 



42  consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except (a) to the extent required by
applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable United States
securities exchange or regulatory or governmental body to which the relevant
party is subject, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow
each other party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement
in advance of such issuance, or (b) with respect to any press release or other
public statement by the Company expressly permitted by _Section 5.3_. The
press release announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall
be a joint release of, and shall not be issued prior to the approval of each
of, the Company and the Parent. The Company shall file a current report on
Form 8-K with the SEC attaching its press release and copy of this Agreement
as exhibits.

5.8 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time and for a period ending one year
following the Effective Time, the Parent shall (i) provide or cause the
Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to provide to each
employee of the Company and Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each a " _Continuing Employee_ ") base compensation or wages
and target annual cash bonus opportunity that is not less favorable than the
base compensation and target annual cash bonus opportunity provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide
or cause the Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to
provide benefits (including equity award compensation and long-term
compensation, but excluding severance) to each Continuing Employee that, taken
as a whole, have a value that is not less favorable in the aggregate than the
benefits (including equity award compensation and long-term compensation, but
excluding severance) provided to similarly situated employees of the Parent
Subsidiaries, excluding the Continuing Employees.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Parent shall, or shall cause the
Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to, assume, honor
and continue during the one-year period following the Effective Time or, if
sooner, until all obligations thereunder have been satisfied, all of the
Companys employment, severance, retention and termination plans, policies,
programs, agreements and arrangements (including any change in control or
severance agreement between the Company and any Continuing Employee) set forth
in _Section 3.11(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, in each case, as in
effect at the Effective Time, including with respect to any payments, benefits
or rights arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (either alone or in combination with any other event), without any
amendment or modification, other than (i) any amendment or modification made
in accordance with the terms of the applicable arrangement, (ii) any amendment
or modification required to comply with applicable Law or (iii) as consented
to by the parties thereto.

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.8(a)_, Parent
shall consult in good faith with the Companys senior management team to
reasonably determine the level of payments to Continuing Employees pursuant to
the Companys cash incentive plans with respect to the annual performance
period in which the Effective Time occurs.

 



43 (d) With respect to benefit plans maintained by the Parent or any of the
Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation (including any
vacation, paid time-off and severance plans), for all purposes, including
determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits, vesting, benefit
accruals and early retirement subsidies, each Continuing Employees service
with the Company or any Company Subsidiary, as reflected in the Companys
records, shall be treated as service with the Parent or any of the Parent
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition
would result in any duplication of benefits and the foregoing service credit
shall not apply with respect to any defined benefit plan.

 

(e) The Parent shall, or shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation) to, waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing
condition limitations, exclusions, evidence of insurability, actively-at-work
requirements and waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by
the Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees
(and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and
after the Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing
condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting
periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Benefit
Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Parent shall, or shall cause
the Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to recognize, or
cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and
similar expenses incurred by each Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for
purposes of satisfying such years deductible and co-payment limitations
under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which such Continuing Employee
(and dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective
Time.

 

(f) Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a Continuing Employee
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be credited to such
Continuing Employee following the Effective Time, and shall not be subject to
accrual limits or other forfeiture and shall not limit future accrual;
_provided_ , _however_ , that vacation and paid time off will not carry over
from one year to the next or be cashed out except as required by applicable
Law.

(g) Any Continuing Employee who participates in the Companys Performance-
Based Annual Incentive Plan (" _AIP_ ") and who experiences a Qualifying
Termination on or after the Effective Time and prior to the payment of the
annual bonus in respect of calendar year 2015 shall be entitled to receive
from the Surviving Corporation a bonus in respect of calendar year 2015 under
the AIP equal to the product determined by multiplying (i) the actual bonus
that such individual would have earned for the full calendar year based on
actual performance and results and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is
the lesser of (A) 365 and (B) the total number of days elapsed from and
including January 1, 2015 through and including the date of the Qualifying
Termination, and the denominator of which is 365, with any such bonus paid at
such time as the Surviving Corporation pays annual bonuses to Continuing
Employees generally; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any Continuing
Employee is entitled to a prorated bonus in the event of a Qualifying
Termination under any Benefit Plan, there shall be no duplication of benefits
as a result of this provision.

 



44 (h) The parties agree to the additional items set forth in _Section 5.8(h)_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(i) Without limiting the generality of _Section 8.10_, the provisions of
this  _Section 5.8_ are solely for the benefit of the parties to this
Agreement, and no Continuing Employee (including any beneficiary or dependent
thereof) shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of
this Agreement, and no provision of this _Section 5.8_ shall create such
rights in any such individuals. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall: (i)
guarantee employment for any period of time or preclude the ability of the
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective affiliates to terminate
the employment of any Continuing Employee at any time and for any reason; (ii)
require the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
affiliates to continue any Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plans,
programs or Contracts or prevent the amendment, modification or termination
thereof following the Closing; or (iii) amend any Benefit Plans or other
employee benefit plans, programs or Contracts.

 

5.9 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and the
Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless all past and present directors,
officers and employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (collectively,
the " _Covered Persons_ ") to the same extent such Persons are indemnified as
of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to applicable Law, the
Company Charter, the Company Bylaws, the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws, or equivalent organizational or governing documents, of any Company
Subsidiary and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of
this Agreement and made available prior to the date hereof to the Parent with
any directors, officers and employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
(" _Provided Indemnification Agreements_ ") arising out of acts or omissions
in their capacity as directors, officers or employees of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Parent further agrees, and the Parent will cause
the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless the directors and
officers of the Company to the fullest extent permitted by Law for acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the adoption and approval of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. The
Surviving Corporation and the Parent shall advance expenses (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in the defense of any Proceeding
or investigation with respect to the matters subject to
indemnification pursuant to this _Section 5.9(a)_ in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws, the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or equivalent organizational
documents, of any Company Subsidiary, and Provided Indemnification
Agreements, if any; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Covered Person to whom
expenses are advanced shall undertake to repay such advanced expenses to the
Parent and the Surviving Corporation, if it is ultimately determined by a
final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such
Covered Person is not entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Section
5.9(a)_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after
the Effective Time) is made against such persons with respect to matters
subject to indemnification hereunder on or prior to the sixth anniversary of
the Effective Time, the provisions of this _Section 5.9(a)_ shall continue
in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation.

 



45 (b) For not less than six years from and after the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation,
indemnification of and advancement of expenses to Covered Persons for periods
at or prior to the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company
Charter and the Company Bylaws. Following the Effective Time, the Provided
Indemnification Agreements, if any, shall be assumed by the Surviving
Corporation, without any further action, and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms.

(c) For not less than six years from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and the Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, maintain for the benefit of the Companys directors and
officers, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Effective Time, an
insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events
occurring prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is
substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the
aggregate than the Companys existing policy (true and complete copies which
have been previously made available to Merger Sub) or, if substantially
equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage;
except, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual
premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the last annual premium
paid prior to the date of this Agreement, but in such case shall purchase as
much coverage as is available for such amount. The provisions of the
immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if
prepaid policies have been obtained (whether by Parent, the Company or
otherwise) prior to the Effective Time, which policies provide such directors
and officers with coverage for an aggregate period of at least six years with
respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the
Effective Time, including in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and the Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in full force and effect, and
continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

 

(d) In the event the Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with
or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper
provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or

assigned to such term in _Section 8.4_ , except that the references to "25%"
shall be deemed to be references to 50.01%.

Disclosure Schedule and the Company is not otherwise in Willful and Material
Breach of  _Section 5.5_ of this Agreement) and (ii) all of the other
conditions set forth in _Article 6_ have been satisfied or waived (other than

Companys Receipt of the Parent Termination Fee (if received) shall be the

 



53  Parents and Merger Subs sole and exclusive remedy (in the case of a
Company Termination Fee) and the Companys sole and exclusive remedy (in the
case of a Parent Termination Fee) (whether based in contract, tort or strict
liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or equitable
proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Laws or
otherwise) against the other party and its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective former, current or future direct or indirect equity holders,

Parent and Merger Sub by action taken by or on behalf of their respective
boards of directors at any time prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,

amendment may be made which, by Law or in accordance with the rules of any
relevant stock exchange, requires further approval by the Companys
stockholders unless the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained again with
respect to the effectiveness of such amendment. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.

compliance by the other with any of the agreements or covenants contained
herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that after receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, there may not be any extension or waiver of this Agreement which
decreases the Merger Consideration. Any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or
parties to be bound thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure to
insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other failure.

8.6 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement.

8.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

8.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits, the Parent
Disclosure Schedule and the Company Disclosure Schedule and the other
documents delivered pursuant hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement of the parties and supersede all prior
agreements (except the Confidentiality Agreement) and understandings, 

 



68  both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to
the subject matter hereof and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
are not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies
hereunder.

8.9 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any party by
operation of Law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other
parties.

8.10 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than (a)
any Persons entitled to indemnification under the provisions of _Section 5.9_
(Indemnification of Directors and Officers), with respect to such
provisions, (b) the stockholders of the Company, after the Effective Time,
with respect to the right of such stockholders to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and (c) if the Closing
occurs, the right of holders of Company Options to receive their respective
Option Payments after the Effective Time. The representations and warranties
in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and
are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto
without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the Knowledge of any of the parties hereto, and consequently,
may not accurately characterize actual facts or circumstances.

 

8.11 _Mutual Drafting; Interpretation_. Each party hereto has participated in
the drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result
of extensive negotiations between the parties. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the
singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine gender
shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender shall
include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall include
masculine and feminine genders. As used in this Agreement, the words "include"
and "including" and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of
limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The word "or" shall not be exclusive. Except as
otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to "Sections,"
"Exhibits," "Annexes" and "Schedules" are intended to refer to Sections of
this Agreement and Exhibits, Annexes and Schedules to this Agreement.
The schedules and exhibits attached to this Agreement constitute a part of
this Agreement and are incorporated herein for all purposes. The words
"hereof," "hereto," "hereby," "herein," "hereunder" and words of similar
import, when used in this Agreement, shall refer to this Agreement as a whole
and not to any particular section or article in which such words appear. All
references in this Agreement to "$" are intended to refer to U.S. dollars.
Unless otherwise specifically provided for herein, the term "or" shall not be
deemed to be exclusive. Disclosure of any item on the Company Disclosure
Schedule by reference to any particular Section or Subsection of
this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute disclosure with respect to any
other Section or Subsection of this Agreement if the applicability of such
disclosure to such other Section or Subsection is reasonably apparent from
such disclosure or the context in which such disclosure is made.

 



69 8.12 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury_.

 

(a) This Agreement and all claims and causes of action arising in connection
herewith shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of
the State of Delaware, without regard to Laws that may be applicable under
conflicts of laws principles (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware.

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any Proceeding with
respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising in
connection herewith, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder
brought by any other party hereto or its successors or assigns, will be
brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any
state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the
Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware). Each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such Proceeding
for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to
the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not
bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert as a
defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Proceeding with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (i) any claim that it is
not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any
reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this _Section
8.12_, (ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from the
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law,
any claim that (A) the Proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient
forum, (B) the venue of such Proceeding is improper or (C) this Agreement, or
the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each of
the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such Proceeding shall
be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices
in _Section 8.3_ and agrees that service made in such manner shall have the
same legal force and effect as if served upon such party personally within the
State of Delaware. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any
party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS

 



70  CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
(I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
8.12(c)_.

8.13  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be signed in any number of
counterparts, including by facsimile or other electronic transmission each of
which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto
and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become
effective when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof
signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until and unless each party has
received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto, this
Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation
hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other
communication). The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts
or otherwise) by electronic transmission in .PDF format or by facsimile shall
be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

 

8.14 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no
adequate remedy at Law would exist and damages would be difficult to
determine, and accordingly, (a) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specific
performance of the terms hereof, in each case in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any state or
Federal Court of the United States of America, or any state having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at Law or in equity, (b) the parties waive any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any
specific performance or injunctive relief and (c) the parties will waive, in
any action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at
Law. The Companys or Parents pursuit of specific performance at any time
will not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue
any other right or remedy to which such party may be entitled, including the
right to pursue remedies for liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by
the other party in the case of a breach of this Agreement involving a Willful
and Material Breach.

 _Section 1_. All meetings of the stockholders for the election of directors
shall be held in the City of Bellevue, State of Washington, at such place as

time and place, within or without the State of Delaware, as shall be stated in
the notice of the meeting or in a duly executed waiver of notice thereof.

 

The board of directors may, in its sole discretion, determine that the meeting
shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held solely by means of
remote communication as authorized by Section 211(a)(2) of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. If so authorized, and subject to
such guidelines and procedures as the board of directors may adopt,
stockholders and proxyholders not physically present at a meeting of
stockholders may, by means of remote communication, participate in a meeting
of stockholders and be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of
stockholders whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or
solely by means of remote communication, provided that (i) the corporation
shall implement reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present
and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a
stockholder or proxyholder, (ii) the corporation shall implement reasonable
measures to provide such stockholders and proxyholders a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to
the stockholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of

board of directors, and transact such other business as may properly be
brought before the meeting.

 

 _Section 3_. Written notice of the annual meeting stating the place if any,
date and hour of the meeting, and the means of remote communication, if any,
by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person
and vote at such meeting, shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote
at such meeting not less than ten nor more than 60 days before the date of

_Section 4_. The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the
corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting of
stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the
meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each
stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of
each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any
stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period of at least
ten days prior to the meeting: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic
network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list
is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business
hours, at the principal place of business of the corporation. In the event
that the corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic
network, the corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such
information is available only to stockholders of the corporation. If the
meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at
the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be
inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held
solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to
the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a
reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to
access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.

 

 _Section 5_. Special meetings of the stockholders, for any purpose or
purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by statute or by the certificate of
incorporation, may be called by the president and shall be called by the
president or secretary at the request in writing of a majority of the board of
directors, or at the request in writing of stockholders owning a majority
in amount of the entire capital stock of the corporation issued and
outstanding and entitled to vote. Such request shall state the purpose or
purposes of the proposed meeting.

 

 _Section 6_. Written notice of a special meeting stating the place if any,
date and hour of the meeting, and the means of remote communication, if any,
by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person
and vote at such meeting, and the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is
called, shall be given not less than ten nor more than 60 days before the
date of the meeting, to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting.

_Section 7_. Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders
shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice.

 



-2- _Section 8_. The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding
and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy,
shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the
transaction of business except as otherwise provided by statute or by the
certificate of incorporation. If, however, such quorum shall not be present
or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders entitled
to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have the
power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than
announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present or represented.
At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented,
any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting
as originally notified. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if
after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a
notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record
entitled to vote at the meeting.

_Section 9_. When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders
of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or
represented by proxy shall decide any question brought before such meeting,
unless the question is one upon which by express provision of the statutes or
of the certificate of incorporation, a different vote is required in which
case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such
question.

_Section 10_. Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation,
each stockholder shall at every meeting of the stockholders be entitled to one
vote in person or by proxy for each share of the capital stock having voting
power held by such stockholder, but no proxy shall be voted on after three
years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period.

_Section 11_. Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation,
any action required to be taken, or which may be taken, at any annual or
special meeting of stockholders of the corporation, may be taken without a
meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in
writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of
outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would
be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all
shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Prompt notice of the
taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous
written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in
writing and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been
entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date for such meeting had been
the date that written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to
take the action were delivered to the corporation. Stockholders may, unless
the certificate of incorporation otherwise provides, act by written consent to
elect directors.

 

An electronic transmission, including but not limited to facsimile and
electronic mail, consenting to an action to be taken and transmitted by a
stockholder or proxyholder, or by a person or persons authorized to act for a
stockholder or proxyholder, shall be deemed to be written, signed and dated
for the purposes herein, provided that any such electronic transmission sets
forth or is delivered with information from which the corporation can
determine (i) that the electronic transmission was transmitted by the
stockholder or proxyholder or by a person or persons authorized to act for the
stockholder or proxyholder and (ii) the date on which such

 



3  stockholder or proxyholder or authorized person or persons transmitted such
electronic transmission. The date on which such electronic transmission is
transmitted shall be deemed to be the date on which such consent was signed.
No consent given by electronic transmission shall be deemed to have been
delivered until such consent is reproduced in paper form and until such paper
form shall be delivered in accordance with Section 228 of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, to the corporation by delivery to
its registered office in Delaware, its principal place of business or an
officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which
proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Any copy, facsimile or
other reliable reproduction of a consent in writing may be substituted or used
in lieu of the original writing for any and all such purposes for which the
original writing could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile or other
reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing.

ARTICLE III

and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of
stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of
such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on

When authorizing such issue of a new certificate or certificates or

condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate or certificates, or his or her legal
representative, to advertise the same in such manner as it shall require

record date is adopted by the board of directors. No record date fixed as
described above shall precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the
record date is adopted by the board of directors. A determination of
stockholders of record entitled to notice

 



9  of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of
the meeting; provided, however, that the board of directors may fix a new
record date for the adjourned meeting.

 

 _Section 6_. The corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive
right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive
dividends, and to vote as such owner, and to hold liable for calls and
assessments a person registered on its books as the owner of shares, and shall

INDEMNIFICATION

 

 _Section 1_. _Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings other than
Those by or in the Right of the Corporation_. Subject to Section 3 of this
Article VIII, the corporation

 



10  shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made
a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an
action by or in the right of the corporation), by reason of the fact that such
person is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or is or was a
director or officer of the corporation serving at the request of the
corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses
(including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such
action, suit or proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner
such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests
of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding,
had no reasonable cause to believe such persons conduct was unlawful. The
termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,
conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not,
of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and
in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to
the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal
action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such persons
conduct was unlawful.

 

 _Section 2_. _Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings by or in
the Right of the Corporation_. Subject to Section 3 of this Article VIII, the
corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened
to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by
or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by
reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the
corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the corporation serving at
the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred
by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action
or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any
claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be
liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit
was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication
of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is
fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court
of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.

 

 _Section 3_. _Authorization of Indemnification_. Any indemnification under
this Article VIII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the
corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that
indemnification of the present or former director or officer is proper in the
circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct
set forth in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be.
Such determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is a director
or officer at the time of such determination, (i) by a majority vote of the
directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though
less than a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of such directors designated by a
majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if
there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent
legal counsel in a written opinion or (iv) by the stockholders. Such
determination shall be made, with respect to former 

 



11  directors and officers, by any person or persons having the authority to act
on the matter on behalf of the corporation. To the extent, however, that a
present or former director or officer of the corporation has been successful
on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding
described above, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such
person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees)
actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith,
without the necessity of authorization in the specific case.

 

 _Section 4_. _Good Faith Defined_. For purposes of any determination under
Section 3 of this Article VIII, a person shall be deemed to have acted in
good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of the corporation, or, with respect to any
criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe
such persons conduct was unlawful, if such persons action is based on the
records or books of account of the corporation or another enterprise, or on
information supplied to such person by the officers of the corporation
or another enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of
legal counsel for the corporation or another enterprise or on information or
records given or reports made to the corporation or another enterprise by an
independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert
selected with reasonable care by the corporation or another enterprise. The
provisions of this Section 4 shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit
in any way the circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have met the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or Section 2 of this
Article VIII, as the case may be.

 

 _Section 5_. _Indemnification by a Court_. Notwithstanding any contrary
determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article VIII, and
notwithstanding the absence of any determination thereunder, any director or
officer may apply to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any
other court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware for
indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under Section 1 or Section
2 of this Article VIII. The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be
a determination by such court that indemnification of the director or officer
is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable
standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article VIII,
as the case may be. Neither a contrary determination in the specific case
under Section 3 of this Article VIII nor the absence of any determination
thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a presumption that
the director or officer seeking indemnification has not met any
applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification
pursuant to this Section 5 shall be given to the corporation promptly upon the
filing of such application. If successful, in whole or in part, the director
or officer seeking indemnification shall also be entitled to be paid the
expense of prosecuting such application.

_Section 6_. _Expenses Payable in Advance_. Expenses (including attorneys
fees) incurred by a director or officer in defending any civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by
the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or
proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or
officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such
person is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in
this Article VIII. Such expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by
former directors and officers or other employees and agents may be so paid
upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the corporation deems appropriate.

 



12 _Section 7_. _Nonexclusivity of Indemnification and Advancement
of Expenses_. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or
granted pursuant to, this Article VIII shall not be deemed exclusive of any
other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses
may be entitled under the certificate of incorporation, these bylaws,
agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both
as to action in such persons official capacity and as to action in another
capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of the corporation
that indemnification of the persons specified in Section 1 and Section 2 of
this Article VIII shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law. The
provisions of this Article VIII shall not be deemed to preclude the
indemnification of any person who is not specified in Section 1 or Section 2
of this Article VIII but whom the corporation has the power or obligation to
indemnify under the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware, or otherwise.

_Section 8_. _Insurance_. The corporation may purchase and maintain
insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer of the
corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the corporation serving at
the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person
in any such capacity, or arising out of such persons status as such, whether
or not the corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify
such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article VIII.

 

 _Section 9_. _Certain Definitions_. For purposes of this Article VIII,
references to "the corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting
corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a
constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate
existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its
directors or officers, so that any person who is or was a director or officer
of such constituent corporation, or is or was a director or officer of such
constituent corporation serving at the request of such constituent corporation
as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same
position under the provisions of this Article VIII with respect to the
resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have with respect to
such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued. The term
"another enterprise" as used in this Article VIII shall mean any other
corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan
or other enterprise of which such person is or was serving at the request of
the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent. For purposes of
this Article VIII, references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes
assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references
to "serving at the request of the corporation" shall include any service as a
director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation which imposes duties
on, or involves services by, such director or officer with respect to an
employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who
acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in
the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan
shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests
of the corporation" as referred to in this Article VIII.

 



13 _Section 10_. Survival of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses.
The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted
pursuant to, this Article VIII shall, unless otherwise provided when
authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors
and administrators of such a person.

_Section 11_. Limitation on Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Article VIII to the contrary, except for proceedings to
enforce rights to indemnification (which shall be governed by Section 5 of
this Article VIII), the corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify any
director or officer (or his or her heirs, executors or personal or legal
representatives) or advance expenses in connection with a proceeding (or part
thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof)
was authorized or consented to by the board of directors of the corporation.

_Section 12_. Indemnification of Employees and Agents. The corporation may,
to the extent authorized from time to time by the board of directors, provide
rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to employees and
agents of the corporation similar to those conferred in this Article VIII to
directors and officers of the corporation.

ARTICLE IX

incorporation, at any regular meeting of the stockholders or of the board of
directors or at any special meeting of the stockholders or of the board
