ARTICLE III

THE PURCHASE PRICE; CLOSINGS

Section 3.1 _Purchase Price_.

(a) On and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
consideration for the sale, grant, conveyance, transfer, assignment and
delivery of the Transferred Assets, the Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid,
to the Company, and one or more of the other Sellers as directed by the

(i) $175,000,000;

(ii) _plus_ , the Estimated Cash; 

(iii) _minus_ , the Estimated Indebtedness;

 

(iv) _minus_ , the amount, if any, by which Estimated Working Capital is less

28 (v) _plus_ , the amount, if any, by which Estimated Working Capital
is greater than the Target Working Capital.

The Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment after the Initial
Closing Date as set forth in _Section 3.3_. The Unadjusted Purchase Price,
plus or minus the adjustment amounts determined pursuant to _Section 3.3_
shall be the " _Purchase Price_."

 

(b) No later than five Business Days prior to the Initial Closing Date, the
Company will prepare and deliver to the Buyer (i) a certificate duly executed
by an officer of the Company setting forth the Companys itemized good faith
calculation of (A) Closing Working Capital prepared in accordance with U.S.

Balance Sheet (collectively, the " _Accounting Principles_ ") (such estimate,
" _Estimated Working Capital_ "), (B) Cash (such estimate, " _Estimated Cash_
"), (C) Closing Indebtedness (such estimate, " _Estimated Indebtedness_ "),

_Section 3.1(a)_ as a result of the estimates described in the foregoing
clauses (A) through (C), and (ii) work sheets and other reasonable supporting
documentation showing the calculation of such estimates. Any currency
conversions made in preparation of the foregoing will be made at the Monthly
Average Exchange Rate as of the Initial Closing Date.

Section 3.2 _The Closings_.

 

(a) _The Initial Closing_. On and subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, the closing of the sale and purchase of the Transferred Assets
and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities and the other Contemplated
Transactions with respect to the Material Asset Classes and each other Asset
Class for which the Subsequent Closing Conditions have been satisfied as of
the Initial Closing Date (the " _Initial Closing_ ") shall be held at the
offices of the Company, 1025 West NASA Boulevard, Melbourne, Florida 32919, or
at such other place or places as the parties may agree at 11:00 A.M.,
Florida time, on the date that is the later of (i) the earlier of (x)
February 4, 2013 and (y) the date on which the Buyer delivers written notice
to the Company waiving this clause (i), and (ii) the third Business Day after
the applicable conditions set forth in _Section 8.1_ and _Section 9.1_ (the
" _Initial Closing Conditions_ ") are satisfied or otherwise waived (other
than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Initial
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), or
such other time and date as may be mutually approved by the parties (the date
of the Initial Closing, the " _Initial Closing Date_ "). The parties shall
promptly notify each other in writing of the satisfaction or waiver of the
Initial Closing Conditions and such notice shall specify any Subsequent
Closing Conditions that are not satisfied at such time and which Asset
Classes will accordingly be deemed to be Remaining Asset Classes pursuant to
_Section 3.2(b)_. All transactions contemplated hereunder to occur on the
Initial Closing Date shall be deemed to have occurred simultaneously at 12:01
a.m. on the Initial Closing Date.

(b) _Effect of Partial Closing_. If, at the time of the Initial Closing,
the applicable conditions set forth in _Section 8.2_ and _Section 9.2_ (the
" _Subsequent Closing Conditions_ ") have not been satisfied with respect to
all of the Asset Classes, then: (i) the parties shall consummate at the
Initial Closing the closing of (A) the sale and purchase of the Transferred
Assets, (B) the

 



29  assumption of the Assumed Liabilities and (C) the other Contemplated
Transactions, each with respect to the Material Asset Classes and such other
Asset Classes for which the Subsequent Closing Conditions have been
satisfied; (ii) the parties shall continue to seek to satisfy the Subsequent
Closing Conditions with respect to all remaining Asset Classes (collectively,
the " _Remaining Asset Classes_ "); and (iii) the parties shall effect one or
more subsequent closings (each, a " _Subsequent Closing_ " and together with
the Initial Closing, the " _Closings_ " and any one of them a " _Closing_ ")
for the Remaining Asset Classes in accordance with _Section 3.2(c)_.

(c)  _Subsequent Closings_. As and when the Subsequent Closing Conditions are
satisfied or waived by the parties after the Initial Closing with respect to
any Remaining Asset Class (other than those conditions that by their terms are
to be satisfied at the Subsequent Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions), then on the fifth Business Day thereafter or such
other date as may be mutually approved by the parties, the Company shall, or
shall cause the other Sellers to, sell, grant, convey, transfer, assign and
deliver to the Buyer legal title to the Transferred Assets with respect to
such Remaining Asset Class for which the Subsequent Closing Conditions have
been satisfied or waived. The parties shall promptly notify each other in
writing of the satisfaction or waiver of such Subsequent Closing Conditions.
The date on which any Subsequent Closing occurs is referred to herein as a "
_Subsequent Closing Date_." The Subsequent Closing with respect to the last
Remaining Asset Class for which the Subsequent Closing Conditions have been
satisfied or waived shall be known as the " _Final Closing_." The time and
date of the Final Closing is herein called the " _Final Closing Date_." All
transactions contemplated hereunder to occur on any given Subsequent Closing
Date shall be deemed to have occurred simultaneously at 12:01 a.m. on such
Subsequent Closing Date.

 

(d) _Remaining Asset Classes_.

(i) Unless precluded by applicable Law, beneficial ownership to the Remaining
Asset Classes shall vest with the Buyer on the Initial Closing Date and remain
with the Buyer until legal ownership vests with the Buyer, subject to
_Section 3.2(d)(ix)_. As of the Initial Closing Date, legal title to and
possession of the Remaining Asset Classes shall remain with the applicable
Seller until a transfer of the Remaining Asset Classes can be implemented as
described herein.

(ii) The Company and the Buyer each shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to satisfy all Subsequent Closing Conditions for the Remaining Asset
Classes and complete the Subsequent Closings therefor as soon as possible
after the Initial Closing. Subject to _Section 13.1_, each of the parties
shall bear its own costs and expenses in connection therewith without the
requirement of payment of any further consideration.

 

(iii) The Company and the Buyer further acknowledge that under applicable Law
in certain jurisdictions, the Buyer may not be permitted to market or sell
the Products or provide the services of the Business until such time as one or
more of the Subsequent Closing Conditions have been satisfied.

 

(iv) As to each Remaining Asset Class, the " _Transition Period_ " shall,
subject to  _Section 3.2(d)(ix)_, be the period from the Initial Closing
Date until the earlier of (A)

 



30  the date of the Subsequent Closing with respect to such Remaining Asset
Class or (B) the second anniversary of the Initial Closing Date.

 

(v) For the duration of the Transition Period for each Remaining Asset Class,
the applicable Asset Sellers and/or Transferred Companies shall (i) continue
to operate the Business (including any Business Plans) in the ordinary course
and consistent with past practice, subject to and consistent with _Section
7.5_, (ii) reasonably cooperate in any arrangement, reasonable and lawful as
to the Buyer and the applicable Asset Sellers and/or Transferred Companies,
designed to provide to the Buyer or its Subsidiaries the benefits arising
under such Remaining Asset Class, including consulting with the Buyer as to
the operation of such Remaining Asset Class and accepting and following such
reasonable direction as the Buyer shall provide, and (iii) use commercially
reasonable efforts to enforce at the Buyers reasonable request, or allow the
Buyer and its Affiliates to enforce in a commercially reasonable manner, any
rights of the applicable Asset Seller or Transferred Company with respect to
such Remaining Asset Class; _provided_ that none of the Company, the Asset
Sellers or the Transferred Companies will have any obligation to solicit
customers or potential customers, enter into new customer agreements, renew
customer agreements, accept new purchase orders or otherwise attempt to grow
or maintain the Business, except in each case as specifically directed by the
Buyer (in which case, the Company, the Asset Sellers or the Transferred
Companies, as applicable, shall have such obligation); _provided_ , _further_
, that the Buyer, at the Buyers cost and expense shall provide, or arrange
for such liquidity and working capital as may be necessary to enable the
applicable Asset Sellers and the Transferred Companies to operate the Business
with respect to the Remaining Asset Class(es) during the Transition Period.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, other than with respect to
Excluded Liabilities, the Sellers shall have no obligation to fund any
Liabilities of the Business following the Initial Closing other than from the
proceeds of any financing provided by the Buyer and any revenues generated by
the Business (including any Business Plans) with respect to the Remaining
Asset Class(es) during the Transition Period.

 

(vi) For the duration of the Transition Period for each Remaining Asset Class,
with respect to the Remaining Asset Class(es), all profits and Damages of the
Business shall be solely for the account of the Buyer, and the Buyer shall be
solely responsible for all Damages, costs and expenses (including Taxes (as
adjusted pursuant to any Buyer Reconciliation Period Tax Calculation)) of the
Business during such period and shall bear all Liabilities (including Taxes
(as adjusted pursuant to any Buyer Reconciliation Period Tax Calculation)) of
the Business and all Damages incurred by Sellers, the Transferred Companies
or their Affiliates in the operation of the Business or otherwise arising as a
result of, or in connection with, the continued ownership by Sellers of the
Transferred Assets and the operation of the Business after the Initial
Closing (including those arising as a result of, or in connection with, the
performance of the Sellers and their Affiliates obligations under this
_Section 3.2(d)_), in each case, other than as provided in  _Section 11.1_
or with respect to the treatment of Excluded Liabilities hereunder. Following
the Initial Closing, the Company and the Buyer shall, for each three month
period following the Initial Closing through the Final Closing and for any
shorter period between the last full three month period and the Final Closing
(each such period a " _Reconciliation Period_ "), reconcile the net revenue of
the Business as contemplated by _Exhibit V_  (each a

 



31  " _Reconciliation Calculation_ "). Promptly following the Final Closing and
the determination of the final Reconciliation Report for the last
Reconciliation Period pursuant to  _Section 3.2(d)(vii)_ or _3.2(d)(viii)_ ,
the Company or the Buyer, as the case may be, shall make, or cause to be made
by the appropriate Affiliate thereof, a reconciliation payment to the other,
or its appropriate Affiliate, with respect to the net revenue for the period
from the Initial Closing through the Final Closing (the " _Reconciliation
Payment_ ") based on the final Reconciliation Reports as determined pursuant
to  _Section 3.2(d)(vii)_ or _3.2(d)(viii)_ for each Reconciliation Period
as may be necessary to ensure the Buyer is placed in the same after-tax
economic position as if the Transferred Assets and Assumed Liabilities
had been transferred to the Buyer or its Affiliates on the Initial Closing
Date and that the Sellers have not benefited from any profits or otherwise
nor, subject to _Section 11.1_ and the treatment of Excluded Liabilities
herein, suffered any Damages in connection with the operation of the Business
during the period from the Initial Closing through the Final Closing. Any
Reconciliation Payment payable by the Sellers to the Buyer or its Affiliates
shall be payable only from cash arising out of the operation of the Business
with respect to the Remaining Asset Class(es) after the Initial Closing and
through the Final Closing. Any profits of the Business included in any
Reconciliation Calculation shall be without duplication of any amounts paid
or payable pursuant to _Section 3.5_ by a Seller to the Buyer (or, subject to
_Section 13.8_, an Affiliate of the Buyer) with respect to the benefits of
any Non-assignable Asset. The Reconciliation Calculations shall initially be
prepared by the Company using the actual Tax liabilities incurred by the
Sellers with respect to each Remaining Asset Class during the applicable
Reconciliation Period (the " _Seller Reconciliation Period Tax Calculation_
"), and details of such Tax liabilities shall be included on each
Reconciliation Report. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Reconciliation Calculations shall be adjusted so as to use the
Tax liabilities that would have been incurred by the Buyer and its Affiliates
with respect to each Remaining Asset Class during the applicable
Reconciliation Period (assuming for purposes of such Reconciliation
Calculation that the Remaining Asset Classes were transferred to the Buyer or
any of its Affiliates on the Initial Closing Date) (the " _Buyer
Reconciliation Period Tax Calculation_ "), instead of the Seller
Reconciliation Tax Period Calculation set forth in the Reconciliation
Calculation initially prepared by the Company in the event that Buyer provides
such Buyer Reconciliation Period Tax Calculation, together with supporting
information reasonably necessary to confirm such calculation, to the Company
in a notice of dispute pursuant to _Section 3.2(d)(vii)_.

(vii) The Company shall prepare each Reconciliation Calculation for each
Reconciliation Period in accordance with _Exhibit V_ (a " _Reconciliation
Report_ "). The Company shall provide the Buyer with each Reconciliation
Report as promptly as possible after the applicable Reconciliation Period but
not later than 30 calendar days thereafter. Within the 30 calendar day period
following receipt of each Reconciliation Report, the Buyer shall have the
right to dispute the amounts set forth therein, as set forth in _Section
3.2(d)(viii)_, by delivery to the Company of a notice setting forth, in
reasonable detail, each disputed item or amount (if then determinable) and the
basis for the Buyers disagreement therewith, together with, if applicable,
supporting calculations. If no such notice is received by the Company on or
prior to the end of such 30 calendar day period, or if the Buyer notifies the
Company in writing that it accepts such Reconciliation Report

 



32  as prepared by the Company, such Reconciliation Report shall become final
and binding, and the Buyer shall be barred from disputing the portion of the
Reconciliation Payment Report corresponding to such Reconciliation Report.
The Company shall prepare the calculation of the Reconciliation Payment which
shall be a summation on the final Reconciliation Reports for each
Reconciliation Period (the " _Reconciliation Payment Report_ "). The Company
shall provide the Buyer with the Reconciliation Payment Report within five
Business Days of the final determination of the Reconciliation Report for the
last Reconciliation Period. Within the five Business Day period following
receipt of the Reconciliation Payment Report, the Buyer shall have the right
to dispute the Reconciliation Payment solely in the event that the
Reconciliation Payment Report differs from the sum of the final Reconciliation
Reports. If the Buyer does not dispute the Reconciliation Payment Report
within such five Business Day period, such report shall become final and
binding, and, the Company or the Buyer, as the case may be, shall immediately
thereafter deliver, or cause to be delivered, the Reconciliation Payment.

(viii) Within 30 calendar days after the Companys receipt of a timely
dispute notice pursuant to _Section 3.2(d)(vii)_, unless the matters in such
notice have otherwise been resolved by mutual agreement of the Buyer and the
Company, the Buyer and the Company shall jointly retain the Accountant to
resolve the issues set forth in such notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing if any such determination of any specific
disputed item is more favorable to the Company than the related amount
specified by the Company in the Reconciliation Report, or more favorable to
the Buyer than any related amount specified by the Buyer in the dispute
notice, then such specific disputed item shall be deemed to be such related
amount specified by the Company or the Buyer, as applicable, for all purposes
of this Agreement. The Accountant shall conduct such review of the
Reconciliation Report that are the subject of such notice, such notice and any
supporting documentation as the Accountant in its sole discretion deems
necessary, but shall be limited to resolving the specific remaining disputes
submitted to the Accountant, and the Accountant shall conduct such hearings or
hear such presentations by the parties as the Accountant in its
sole discretion deems necessary. The Accountant shall, as promptly as
practicable and in no event later than 30 calendar days following its
engagement by the Buyer and the Company to resolve such dispute, deliver to
the Buyer and the Company a written report, in which the Accountant shall
resolve only the specific remaining disputes submitted to the Accountant and
shall determine, on that basis, the appropriate amounts in the Reconciliation
Report. Such report shall set forth, in reasonable detail, the Accountants
determination with respect to each of the disputed items or amounts specified
in such notice, and the revisions, if any, to be made to the Reconciliation
Report that are the subject of such notice, together with supporting
calculations. Such Reconciliation Report, as so adjusted by the Accountant,
shall be final and binding on the parties, absent arithmetical error, and
shall be deemed a final arbitration award that is enforceable against each of
the parties hereto in any court of competent jurisdiction. The cost of such
review and report shall be borne by the party against whom the disagreement is
resolved as determined by the Accountant; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
resolution favors both parties or does not favor either party, such costs
shall be borne pro rata by the Company and the Buyer in proportion to the
extent the disagreement is resolved against a particular party as determined
by the Accountant. 

 



33  Upon the resolution of the disputes the Company and the Buyer, as the case
may be, shall immediately thereafter deliver, or cause to be delivered, the
Reconciliation Payment.

 

(ix) With respect to any Remaining Asset Class, in the event that a Subsequent
Closing does not occur within one year from the Initial Closing Date because
applicable Law or a non-appealable Order entered by a Governmental Body of
competent jurisdiction prohibits such Subsequent Closing from occurring with
respect to such Remaining Asset Class (without the reasonable possibility of
obtaining a consent or relief for such Law or non-appealable Order), each of
the Buyer and the Company may, each in its sole discretion, by written notice
to the other party, elect to terminate the Transition Period with respect
to such Remaining Asset Class (such election to terminate, a " _Termination
Option_ "); _provided_ that such party electing to exercise a Termination
Option has complied with its obligations under this Agreement to achieve
a Subsequent Closing with respect to such Remaining Asset Class. With respect
to any Remaining Asset Class, in the event that a Subsequent Closing does not
occur within two years from the Initial Closing Date, (A) each of the Buyer
and the Company may, each in its sole discretion, by written notice to the
other party, exercise a Termination Option or (B) the Buyer and the Company
may mutually agree, in writing, to (I) extend the Transition Period for such
Remaining Asset Class until the earlier of the date each Subsequent Closing
Condition for such Remaining Asset Class has been satisfied or either party
thereafter exercises a Termination Option, or (II) notwithstanding the
conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ and _Article IX_ , cause the Final
Closing to occur for all Remaining Asset Classes. With respect to any
Remaining Asset Class, at any time prior to a Subsequent Closing the parties
may agree in writing to terminate the Transition Period with respect to such
Remaining Asset Class. Upon such agreement to terminate the Transition Period
or upon either partys exercise of a Termination Option, (x) the beneficial
ownership of the applicable Remaining Asset Class(es) shall revert to the
applicable Seller, and the Buyer and its Affiliates will have no further
rights to the profits of and no further obligations with respect to the
Business with respect to such Remaining Asset Class(es), (y) subject to the
next sentence, the Sellers and their respective Affiliates shall have no
further responsibility, obligation or liability to the Buyer with respect to
such Remaining Asset Class(es) and (z) the Company and the Sellers may dispose
of such Remaining Asset Class(es) in any manner, including by sale to a third
party, at their sole discretion. So long as the Buyer has complied with its
obligations under this Agreement to achieve a Subsequent Closing with respect
to a Remaining Asset Class, in the event that the parties agree to terminate
the corresponding Transition Period or upon either partys exercise of a
Termination Option, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within five
Business Days) pay, or cause to be paid, to the Buyer, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by the Buyer, the
portion of the Purchase Price allocated to the applicable Remaining Asset
Class (consistent with the allocations made in accordance with _Section
3.8_), reduced by any Reconciliation Payments made by the Company or caused by
the Company to be made in respect to such Remaining Asset Class and increased
by any Reconciliation Payments made by the Buyer or caused by the Buyer to be
made in respect of such Remaining Asset Class.

Section 3.3 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. (a) Within 90 calendar days after
the Initial Closing Date, the Company will in good faith prepare and deliver
to the Buyer a

 



34  certificate setting forth the Companys itemized good faith calculation of
(i) Closing Working Capital (prepared in accordance with the Accounting
Principles), (ii) Cash, (iii) Closing Indebtedness, and (iv) the amount of
the adjustment(s), if any, calculated in accordance with this _Section 3.3_
(the " _Closing Certificate_ "). Any currency conversions made in preparation
of the foregoing will be made at the Monthly Average Exchange Rate as of the
Initial Closing Date.

(b) The Buyer shall have 90 calendar days from the date on which the Closing
Certificate is delivered to it to review such documents, books and accounting
records used to prepare the Closing Certificate as may be reasonably requested
by the Buyer. If the Buyer in good faith disagrees in any respect with any
item or amount shown or reflected in the Closing Certificate it may, within
such 90-day period, deliver to the Company a notice setting forth, in
reasonable detail, each disputed item or amount and the basis for the Buyers
disagreement therewith, together with, if applicable, supporting calculations
(the " _Dispute Notice_ "). If no Dispute Notice is received by the Company on
or prior to the end of such 90 calendar day period, or if the Buyer notifies
the Company in writing that it accepts such Closing Certificate as prepared by
the Company, such Closing Certificate shall become final and binding and shall
be the " _Final Closing Certificate_ ".

(c) Within 30 calendar days after the Companys receipt of a timely Dispute
Notice, unless the matters in the Dispute Notice have otherwise been resolved
by mutual agreement of the Buyer and the Company, the Buyer and the Company
shall jointly retain Grant Thornton (the " _Accountant_ ") to resolve the
issues set forth in the Dispute Notice. If Grant Thornton does not agree to
be the Accountant, the Buyer and the Company shall mutually agree upon and
jointly retain another independent accounting firm of national reputation. In
such case, if the Buyer and the Company cannot agree on the accounting firm
to be retained, each shall submit the names of two firms (provided that no
such firm has a conflict of interest). Each of the Buyer and the Company may
strike the name of one of the two names submitted by the other and the
Accountant shall be selected by lot from the remaining firms. The Accountant
shall conduct such review of the Closing Certificate, the Dispute Notice and
any supporting documentation as the Accountant in its sole discretion
deems necessary, but shall be limited to resolving the specific remaining
disputes submitted to the Accountant, and the Accountant shall conduct such
hearings or hear such presentations by the parties as the Accountant in its
sole discretion deems necessary.

(d) The Accountant shall, as promptly as practicable and in no event later
than 30 calendar days following its retention by the Buyer and the Company,
deliver to the Buyer and the Company a written report (the " _Adjustment
Report_ "), in which the Accountant shall resolve only the specific remaining
disputes submitted to the Accountant and shall determine, on that basis, the
appropriate Closing Working Capital, Cash, Closing Indebtedness and any
adjustment that, in each case, are the subject of a Dispute Notice; _provided_
, _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing if any such determination of
any specific disputed item is more favorable to the Company than the related
amount specified by the Company in the Closing Certificate, or more favorable
to the Buyer than any related amount specified by the Buyer in the Dispute
Notice, then such specific disputed item shall be deemed to be such related
amount specified by the Company or the Buyer, as applicable, for all purposes
of this Agreement. The Adjustment Report shall set forth, in reasonable
detail, the Accountants determination with respect to each of the disputed
items or amounts specified in such Dispute Notice, and the revisions, if any,
to be

 



35  made to the Closing Certificate, together with supporting calculations. The
Closing Certificate, as so adjusted by the Accountant, shall be the Final
Closing Certificate. The Adjustment Report shall be final and binding on the
parties, absent arithmetical error, and shall be deemed a final arbitration
award that is enforceable against each of the parties hereto in any court of
competent jurisdiction. The cost of such review and report shall be borne by
the party against whom the disagreement is resolved as determined by the
Accountant; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the resolution favors both
parties or does not favor either party, such costs shall be borne pro rata
by the Company and the Buyer in proportion to the extent the disagreement is
resolved against a particular party as determined by the Accountant.

(e) The " _Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be positive or negative, shall mean
(i) the Final Closing Working Capital _minus_ the Estimated Working Capital,
_plus_  (ii) the Estimated Indebtedness _minus_ the Final Closing
Indebtedness, _plus_ (iii) the Final Cash _minus_ the Estimated Cash.

(f) If (i) the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then the Buyer shall
pay the Adjustment Amount within five Business Days of the Determination Date
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in
writing by the Company; and (ii) the Adjustment Amount is a negative number,
then the Company shall pay to the Buyer the absolute value of the Adjustment
Amount within five Business Days of the Determination Date by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the account designated in writing by the
Buyer. Any such payment shall be allocated among and made by and to the
applicable Persons that transferred and received the applicable
Transferred Assets or portions thereof (the applicable Seller and the Buyer
or any applicable permitted assignee of the Buyer). The amount of any payment
to be made pursuant to this _Section 3.3_ shall bear interest from and
including the Initial Closing Date to, but excluding the date of payment, at
a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Rate. Such interest shall be payable
at the same time as the payment to which it relates and shall be calculated
daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days for
which such interest is due.

(g) All matters that are the subject of a Dispute Notice shall be
conclusively settled between the parties for all purposes of this Agreement
(including _Section 11.1_) pursuant to this _Section 3.3_, and no claim may
thereafter be brought under any other provision of this Agreement (including
_Section 11.1_) with respect to such matters.

Section 3.4 _Deliveries at the Closings_.

(a) _Initial Closing Deliveries by the Company_. At or prior to the Initial
Closing, the Company shall execute and deliver, or shall cause to be executed
and delivered, to the Buyer the following, as applicable:

(iv) a certificate executed by an officer of the Company certifying as of the
Initial Closing that the Canadian Pre-Closing Reorganization has been

Company shall execute and deliver, or shall cause to be executed and

(i) the Local Transfer Documents applicable to the Transferred Assets to be
transferred in connection with such Closing, to which a Seller is a party,
duly executed by such Seller;

Companies included in the Asset Class subject to such Closing; and

(iv) validly executed state and local resale or exemption certificates
reasonably required from a Seller to claim any available exemptions from

connection with the Transferred Assets to be transferred in connection with
such Closing.

 

(c) _Initial Closing Deliveries by the Buyer_. At or prior to the Initial
Closing, the Buyer shall execute and deliver, or shall cause to be executed
and delivered, to the Company the following:

(i) the Unadjusted Purchase Price, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds in U.S. dollars to one or more accounts of the Company and one or more
other Sellers, as the Company may direct, designated at least two Business
Days prior to the Initial Closing Date; _provided_ , that $15,000,000 of the
Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be satisfied by the Buyers delivery of a
promissory note issued by the Buyer in favor of the Company in the principal
amount of $15,000,000 in the form of _Exhibit E_ attached hereto (the "
_Promissory Note_ ");

 



37 (ii) a certificate executed by the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of
the Buyer certifying that attached thereto are true and complete copies of
resolutions of the Buyers Board of Directors authorizing the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions, which resolutions have not been modified,
rescinded or revoked; and

(iii) the Transaction Documents (other than Local Transfer Documents, which
are included in subsection (d) below to the extent applicable) to which the

Affiliate of the Buyer) to claim any available exemptions from sales and use,
transfer, documentary or other Taxes otherwise payable in connection with the
Transferred Assets to be transferred in connection with such Closing.

Section 3.5 _Consents of Third Parties_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement
to assign or transfer any Transferred Asset that is not held by a Transferred
Company (other than any Transferred Company within a Remaining Asset Class
for so long as such Asset Class remains a Remaining Asset Class) or any claim
or right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if any
assignment or transfer or attempt to make such an assignment or transfer is
not permitted without the consent, approval or waiver of, or notice to, a
third party or would constitute a breach or violation thereof or affect
adversely the rights of the Buyer or the applicable Seller thereunder (any
assets so described, the " _Non-assignable Assets_ "). The Company and Buyer
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts (including the dedication of
resources thereto, but without any obligation to expend money, commence
litigation or offer or grant any financial or other accommodation to any
third party) to obtain the consent, approval or waiver of, or provide the
required notice to, such third parties to or of the assignment to the Buyer
(or, subject to _Section 13.8_, an Affiliate of the Buyer) of any
Transferred Asset or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or
otherwise transfer the rights and benefits of any Non-assignable Asset to the
Buyer or, subject to _Section 13.8_, an Affiliate of the Buyer, including,
in the case of any non-transferable Permits, to cause the applicable
Governmental Body to issue a new Permit to the Buyer or its Affiliate in place
of such non-transferable Permit. If such consent, approval or waiver is not
obtained, or such notice is not made, or if an attempted assignment thereof
would be ineffective or would adversely affect the rights of the Company, any
Seller or any of its or their Affiliates thereunder so that the Buyer
(or, subject to _Section 13.8_, an Affiliate of the Buyer) would not in fact
receive all such rights, or if such asset is not transferable under applicable
Law with or without such consent, approval, waiver or notice, the Company and
the 

 



38  Buyer will use their commercially reasonable efforts (but without any
obligation to expend money, commence litigation or offer or grant any
financial or other accommodation to any third party) to enter into a mutually
agreeable arrangement under which the Buyer would assume the obligations and
the applicable Seller would provide to the Buyer (or, subject to _Section
13.8_, an Affiliate of the Buyer) the benefits of any Non-assignable Asset,
including sub-contracting, sub-licensing, or sub-leasing to the Buyer (or,
subject to _Section 13.8_, an Affiliate of the Buyer), or under which the
applicable Seller would enforce for the benefit of the Buyer (or, subject to
_Section 13.8_, an Affiliate of the Buyer), with the Buyer (or, subject to
_Section 13.8_, an Affiliate of the Buyer) assuming such Sellers obligations
under such Non-assignable Asset, any and all rights of such Seller against a
third party thereto. In connection with any such arrangement, the Buyer shall
reimburse the Company, the applicable Seller and each of their applicable
Affiliates for any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
actually incurred by the Company, the applicable Seller and each of their
applicable Affiliates in connection with the performance of any mutually
agreeable arrangement or that otherwise would have been incurred by the Buyer
or its Affiliates had such Non-assignable Asset been assigned, transferred or
conveyed as contemplated by this Agreement (such costs and expenses, the "
_Alternative Arrangement Costs_ "). The applicable Seller will promptly pay
to the Buyer (or, subject to _Section 13.8_, an Affiliate of the Buyer) when
received all monies received, after offsetting applicable Alternative
Arrangement Costs owed but not yet paid by the Buyer or its Affiliates, by
such Seller or its Affiliates under such Non-assignable Asset or any claim or
right or any benefit arising thereunder.

 

Section 3.6 _Further Assurances; Wrong Pockets_.

 

(a) From time to time, pursuant to the request of a party delivered to the
other party after a Closing Date, and without further consideration other
than the other partys out-of-pocket expenses, such party shall execute,
deliver and acknowledge such other instruments and documents of conveyance and
transfer or assumption and shall take such other actions and shall execute
and deliver such other documents, certifications and further assurances as the
other party reasonably may request in order to vest and confirm more
effectively in the Buyer title to or to put the Buyer more fully in legal
possession of, or to enable the Buyer to use, any of the Transferred Assets,
or to enable the Buyer to complete, perform or discharge any of the Assumed
Liabilities and to release the Sellers of the Assumed Liabilities or otherwise
enable the parties to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement.

(b) To the extent that right, title or interest to any Excluded Asset, is
acquired by the Buyer or any assignee of the Buyer under this Agreement the
Buyer agrees to, or cause any applicable assignee of the Buyer to, promptly
transfer any such asset, property or right for nominal consideration to such
Seller or Affiliate of the Company as the Company may specify. The Sellers
shall be responsible for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Buyer or its Affiliates in connection with the transfer contemplated by this
_Section 3.6(b)_.

 

Section 3.7 _Performance of Assigned Contracts_. To the extent that an
Assigned Contract is not novated in connection with a Closing, the Buyer and
the Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into novation
agreements or to otherwise have the Asset Sellers be released from all
obligations under such Assigned Contracts. With respect to any Sold Company
included in a Closing which is the transferee, from a Seller or an Affiliate
thereof, of assets, properties or rights used in connection with the Business
for which such transfer was

 



39  made to facilitate the Contemplated Transactions, the Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to enter into novation agreements or to
otherwise have the transferor in such transfer be released from all
obligations under any Contracts transferred in such transfer which have not
been novated on or prior to such Closing.

Section 3.8 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The parties shall allocate all
amounts treated as purchase price for Tax purposes (including any Contingent
Payments) with respect to the Transferred Assets and the Transferred
Companies in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code as set forth on
_Schedule 3.8_. If any amounts treated as purchase price for Tax purposes are
adjusted pursuant to this Agreement, the allocation shall be adjusted as
mutually agreed to by the Buyer and the Company. Subject to the requirements
of applicable Tax Law, such allocation shall be used by the Buyer, the
Company, and each other Seller in preparing any filings required pursuant to
Section 1060 of the Code or any similar provisions of state, local or foreign
Law and all relevant Tax Returns (including IRS Form 8594), and neither the
Buyer nor the Company will take any position before any Taxing Authority or
in any judicial proceeding with respect to Taxes that is inconsistent with
such allocations without the prior written consent of the other party or
parties, as the case may be. The parties shall exercise commercially
reasonable efforts to support such reported allocations in any audit
proceedings initiated by any Taxing Authority; provided, however, that neither
the Company nor the Buyer shall have any obligation to pay for an appraisal or
in any other way incur unreasonable or extraordinary out-of-pocket expenses.
The parties and their Affiliates shall timely file all forms and Tax Returns
required to be filed in connection with the allocation. Not later than 30 days
prior to the filing of their respective IRS Forms 8594 relating to this
transaction, each party shall deliver to the other party a copy of its IRS
Form 8594.

Section 3.9 _Contingent Payments_. The Buyer shall be obligated to pay, and
the Company shall be entitled to receive, one or more Contingent Payments (as
defined on _Exhibit BB_ ) in an aggregate amount up to $50 million to the
extent earned pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions set forth on
_Exhibit BB_. The amount of any Contingent Payment paid by the Buyer to the
Company shall be added to the Purchase Price, as defined in _Section 3.1(a)_.

 

Section 3.10 _Withholding_. The Buyer and its Affiliates shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from consideration deliverable in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement such amounts that the Buyer and
its Affiliates are required to deduct and withhold with respect to any such
deliveries and payments under the Code or any provision of state, local, or
non-U.S. Law. To the extent that the Buyer and its Affiliates withhold such
amounts with respect to any Person and remit such withheld amounts to the
applicable Governmental Body, such withheld amounts shall be treated as
having been paid to or on behalf of such Person. Before making any such
deduction or withholding, the Buyer shall give the Company notice of the
intention to make such deduction or withholding (such notice, which shall
summarize the authority, basis and method of calculation for the proposed
deduction or withholding, shall be given at least fifteen (15) days prior to
the Closing Date); _provided_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
Company or any Seller does not provide an affidavit described in Section
3.4(a)(iii) on or prior to the Closing Date, the Buyer and its Affiliates
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold any Tax required to be deducted and
withheld pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code. The Buyer shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, cooperate with the Company to the extent reasonably
requested in efforts to obtain reduction of or relief from such deduction or

 



40  withholding. The Buyer shall timely provide to the Company withholding tax
receipts, information statements or such other documents required to be filed
or provided under applicable tax law in respect of any such deduction or
withholding.

ARTICLE IV

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule delivered to the Buyer
contemporaneously herewith (the " _Disclosure Schedule_ "), of which the
Schedules referred to below are a part, the Company represents and warrants
to the Buyer as set forth below as of the date of this Agreement and as of the
Initial Closing Date (and, for any Remaining Asset Class, the date of the
applicable Subsequent Closing with respect to  _Sections 4.1_ , _4.2_ , _4.5_
, _4.6(a)_ , _4.7(b)_ and the first sentence of _Section 4.7(a)_ to the
extent the representations in such Sections are made with respect to
the Seller and any Transferred Company that are the subject of such Remaining
Asset Class, in each case subject to any actions taken at the express
direction of the Buyer in accordance with _Section 3.2(d)_).

 

Section 4.1 _Organization; Authority_. Each of the Sellers is a corporation or
other legal entity validly existing and in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions that recognize such concept) under the Laws of the jurisdiction
in which it is organized, except for those jurisdictions where the failure to
be validly existing or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate,
would not materially adversely affect such Sellers performance under this
Agreement or the ability of the Buyer to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions. Each of the Sellers has all necessary corporate or other
applicable entity power, as the case may be, and authority to own or lease
the Transferred Assets, and together with the Transferred Companies, to
operate the Business. Each of the Sellers has all necessary corporate power
and authority to sell, grant, convey, transfer, assign and deliver the
Transferred Assets to the Buyer as contemplated by this Agreement, and to
execute and deliver this Agreement and each Transaction Document to which it
is or will be a party and to perform its obligations hereunder and
thereunder. Each Transferred Company is a corporation or other legal entity
validly existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that
recognize such concept) under the Laws of the jurisdiction in which it is
organized, and has all necessary corporate or other applicable entity power,
as the case may be, and authority to own, operate, lease or encumber its
properties and to carry on its business as currently conducted. Each
Transferred Company is licensed or qualified to do business and in good
standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) in each
jurisdiction in which it owns or leases any Real Property or in which the
character of the properties owned or leased by it otherwise or the nature of
its business makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good standing, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. True, correct and complete copies of all Organizational Documents of
each Transferred Company, in each case as amended to date, have been made
available to the Buyer, no amendments thereto are pending and no Transferred
Company is in default under or in violation of any provision of such
Organizational Documents.

Section 4.2 _Authorization of Transaction_. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents by each of the
Sellers, as applicable, and the consummation by each of them of the
Contemplated Transactions have been, in the case of the Company, and will be
prior to the Initial Closing, in the case of the other Sellers, duly
authorized

 



41  by all necessary corporate or other applicable legal entity action on the
part of such party, and, upon such authorization, no other corporate or
shareholder proceedings or actions are necessary to authorize and consummate
this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby. The Company has duly executed this Agreement and on the
applicable Closing Date each of the Sellers, as applicable, will have duly
executed and delivered the applicable Transaction Documents to which such
Seller will be a party. Assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by
the Buyer, this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the
Company and each such Transaction Document when so executed and delivered
will constitute the valid and binding obligation of each of the Sellers, as
applicable, enforceable against such Seller in accordance with their
respective terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by (a)
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
moratorium or similar Laws from time to time in effect relating to or
affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally, and (b) general
equitable principles with respect to the availability of specific performance
or other equitable remedies (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or
at law) (the " _Insolvency and Equity Exceptions_ "). 

Section 4.3 _No Violations_. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents, and the consummation by the Sellers
of the Contemplated Transactions, do not and will not (a) conflict with or
result in any violation of or constitute a breach of the Organizational
Documents of the Sellers or the Transferred Companies, (b) result in the
creation of any Lien upon any of the Transferred Assets, (c) violate any
material Order against or binding upon the Sellers, the Transferred Companies
or otherwise with respect to the Business or any of the Transferred Assets,
(d) violate any material Law applicable to the Sellers, the Transferred
Companies or otherwise with respect to the Business or the Transferred Assets,
or (e) result in a breach of or a default under, require any Consent of any
Person pursuant to, or give rise to any right of acceleration, modification,
termination or cancellation under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions
of any Material Contract that is an Assigned Contract or to which a
Transferred Company is party, except with respect to the foregoing clauses
(b), (c), (d) and (e) above, as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the Business or to the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions.

Section 4.4 _Governmental Consents and Approvals_. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 4.4_ and except for (a) filings required solely related to the
identity of or any business conducted by the Buyer or its Affiliates, (b)
filings that may be required under applicable securities Laws, (c) notices
that may be required under any Law after any applicable Closing, (d) filings
of this Agreement or any Transaction Documents that may be required under any
Law other than an Antitrust Law in any jurisdictions other than the U.S.,
Canada or the UK, and (e) any other approval, consent, waiver or
authorization of any Governmental Body where the failure to obtain such would
not reasonably be likely to be material, no approval, consent, waiver or
authorization from any Governmental Body (including with respect to the
Investment Canada Act) is required (i) for or in connection with the execution
and delivery by the Company of this Agreement or the Transaction Documents to
which any of the Sellers are or will be a party or the consummation by the
Sellers of the Contemplated Transactions or (ii) for or in connection with the
sale, grant, conveyance, transfer, assignment or delivery of the Transferred

of its Subsidiaries; and (iv) no condemnation or similar proceeding is pending
or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened, that would preclude or materially

conditions and provisions of such Permits are being complied with in all
material respects by the applicable Sellers and the Transferred Companies, or
in the case of Canada Newco will be at the Initial Closing). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 4.7_ shall be deemed to constitute a
warranty, representation or obligation on the part of the Company or any
other Seller that relates to compliance with any (i) zoning ordinances or
building codes, (ii) Environmental Permits or Environmental Laws, or (iii) Law
or Order relating to Sellers Benefit Plans that are not Assumed Plans or

the Contemplated Transactions. None of the Actions listed on _Schedule 4.8_ ,
individually or in the aggregate, would, if determined adversely to the

have a material adverse effect on the Buyers ability to conduct the Business
in a manner substantially consistent with the Sellers and the Transferred
Companies conduct thereof prior to the date hereof, or (ii) prevent the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions.

the Business prior to the date of this Agreement. ___Schedule 4.14(a)_
__identifies, as at the date of this Agreement, each employee of the Asset
Seller of the UK Asset Class who is wholly or mainly assigned to the Business
and who will transfer to the Buyer pursuant to the Transfer Regulations at the
Closing Date applicable to the UK Asset Class, and identifies the UK

Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to provide to Buyer, within
ten (10) days following the applicable Closing, the Employee Data that it
could not set forth on ___Schedule 4.14(a)_ __due to applicable Laws. Within
the six-month period prior to the date of this Agreement, none of Sellers or
any of their respective Affiliates (other than Transferred Companies) has
transferred any person to the Business from another business of the Company
and its Affiliates who is now an Employee. The Sellers have consulted with the

employment court or tribunal or similar employment forum of competent
jurisdiction, material grievances, or disciplinary actions pending or, to the
Companys Knowledge, threatened by or between any Asset Seller or Transferred
Company and any Employee. Within the three-year period prior to the date of
this Agreement, there has been no lock-out, strike, slowdown or work stoppage
by or with respect to any Employee.

(c) No Asset Seller or Transferred Company is obligated by, or subject to, any
Order or decision by any Governmental Body with respect to labor and
employment issues in relation to the conduct of the Business or current or
former employees of the Business. Each Asset Seller and each Transferred
Company has complied in all material respects with all applicable Laws
regarding employment and employment practices with respect to the current
and former employees of the Business.

 



52 (d) No Asset Seller or Transferred Company is a party or subject to any
pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened, labor or civil rights
dispute, controversy or grievance or any unfair labor practice proceeding with
respect to claims of, or obligations to, any current or former employees of
the Business. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.14(d)_ , no works councils
and, with the exception of labor unions and similar labor organizations that
are mandated by Law, no labor union or similar labor organization represents
or has within the three-year period prior to the date of this Agreement
represented the Employees, and no collective bargaining agreement is or has
been, within the three-year period prior to the date of this Agreement,
binding against the Business. No Asset Seller or Transferred Company is or
has been, within the three-year period prior to the date of this Agreement, in
breach of any material provision of any works council, collective bargaining
or other labor agreement applicable to any current or former employees of the
Business. The Company has not received any written notice within the three-
year period prior to the date of this Agreement that any labor representation
request is pending or is threatened with respect to the Employees.

 

(e) Except as set forth on _Schedule 11.1(g)_ , as of the date of this
Agreement neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates has any planned
reductions in force with respect to the Employees.

Section 4.15 _Benefit Plans_. (a) __ _Schedule 4.15(a)_ __separately lists
and identifies (pursuant to the following subsections): (i) each Benefit Plan
that is sponsored by any Transferred Company (" _Transferred Company Plans_
"), and (ii) each Benefit Plan other than a Transferred Company Plan that will
be transferred, in whole or in part, to the Buyer or its Affiliates by
operation of Law (" _Automatically Transferred Plans_ "), and each material
Benefit Plan other than a Transferred Company Plan or Automatically
Transferred Plan that is sponsored or maintained by Sellers or any of their
Affiliates, or in which they participate, on behalf of a current or former
employee of the Business or in which any Employee participates (such plans,
collectively with the Transferred Company Plans and Automatically Transferred
Plans, the " _Sellers  Benefit Plans_"), but in the case of each of (i) and
(ii), ___Schedule 4.15(a)_ __does not need to list or identify any offer
letter, employment agreement or consulting agreement. The Transferred Company
Plans and the Automatically Transferred Plans (including for certainty any
offer letters, employment agreements or consulting agreements maintained by a
Transferred Company or that will be transferred, in whole or in part, to the
Buyer or its Affiliates by operation of Law, including such letters and
agreements that will be maintained by Canada Newco as a result of the Canadian
Pre-Closing Reorganization) are collectively referred to as the " _Assumed
Plans_ ". With respect to each Transferred Company Plan, as of the applicable
Closing Date such plan will not have any obligation or liability to any
individual that is not a current or former employee of the Business.

(b) The Company has made available to the Buyer true and complete copies of
(if applicable) (i) with respect to each Sellers Benefit Plan, (1) that is a
material Assumed Plan or is sponsored or maintained on behalf of a U.S.
Employee, Canadian Employee or UK Employee, the applicable Benefit Plan
document (including all amendments thereto), (2) sponsored or maintained on
behalf of an Other Business Employee (other than an Assumed Plan or that is
an Assumed Plan that is not material), any formal description of such Benefit
Plan, and (3) the most recent summary plan description used in connection with
such Benefit Plan and any material modifications thereto, (ii) with respect
to each Assumed Plan, (1) the most recent actuarial

 



53  valuation and financial statements and (2) any non-routine filings or
correspondence with a Governmental Body that relate to potential violations of
applicable Law and (iii) with respect to the Company Retirement Plan, the
most recent IRS determination letter; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company need not make available to the Buyer pursuant to this _Section
4.15(b)_ any offer letters, employment agreements or consulting agreements

(c) (i) Each Assumed Plan has been administered in all material respects
in accordance with its terms and all applicable Laws, (ii) all contributions
required to be made with respect to any Assumed Plan on or before the date
hereof have been made or, if not yet due, have been properly reflected in the
financial statements prior to the date of this Agreement, other than any
contributions that are not material, and (iii) each Assumed Plan that is
intended to qualify for tax favored status under any applicable Law qualifies
for such status and, to the Companys knowledge, no fact or event has
occurred that could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualified
status. No event has occurred and no condition exists in connection with any
Assumed Plan that could reasonably be expected to subject the Buyer or any
Transferred Company to any Tax, fine, encumbrance, penalty or other similar
Liability as a result of a failure to comply with any applicable Laws.

(d) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.15(d)(i)_ , no Assumed Plan is, and no
Transferred Company contributes to, or has any liability or obligation,
whether actual or contingent, with respect to any, (x) multiemployer plan (as
defined under applicable Law) or (y) defined benefit pension plan (for all
purposes of this Agreement and for the avoidance of doubt, which term shall
exclude any termination or retirement indemnities in France, end of service
gratuities in the United Arab Emirates, TFR indemnities in Italy, long service
award in Australia and any similar indemnities, gratuities, awards or
payments). None of the Seller Canadian Retirement Plans is a
"registered pension plan" as that term is defined in section 248(1) of the
Canadian ITA, a "multi-employer pension plan" or any similar type of plan for
purposes of pension standards legislation of another jurisdiction in Canada.
_Schedule 4.15(d)(ii)_ sets forth, with respect to each Assumed Plan that is
an underfunded defined benefit pension plan (A) the "projected benefit
obligation" of such plan (consistent with how such liability would be reported
on financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP), as of the
applicable date set forth on _Schedule 4.15(d)(ii)_ and (B) the value of any
assets that will transfer to the Buyer or any of its Affiliates at the time of
the applicable Closing Date, as of the applicable date set forth on _Schedule
4.15(d)(ii)_ , which assets shall be cash or readily marketable securities.
Save in respect of the Harris Systems Limited Pension Plan, no Transferred
Company is the employer, or "connected" or "associated" with the employer (as
those terms are understood for the purposes of the UK Pensions Act 2004) with
a UK defined benefit pension plan. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 4.15(d)(iii)_ , no UK Employee is an active member of a defined
benefit pension plan. None of the Transferred UK Employees have rights under
or originally derived from the provisions of an occupational pension scheme
which do not relate to benefits for old age, invalidity or survivors within
the meaning given to those terms under regulation 10 of the TUPE Regulations.

(e) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.15(e)_ , no Assumed Plan provides for,
and no Transferred Company has an obligation to provide any current or former
employee of the Business (or dependent thereof) with, post-employment or
post-retirement medical, dental,

 



54  disability, hospitalization, life or other health or welfare benefits (other
than coverage mandated by applicable Law, including COBRA).

 

(f) With respect to any Assumed Plan, and to the Companys Knowledge, with
respect to any fiduciary thereof or service provider thereto, (i) no actions,
suits or claims (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course) are
pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened, and (ii) to the Companys
Knowledge, no facts or circumstances exist that would reasonably be expected
to give rise to any such actions, suits or claims.

(g) Except as disclosed on _Schedule 4.15(g)_ or with respect to any
accelerated vesting under the Company Retirement Plan or a Seller Canadian
Retirement Plan, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, either alone or in combination
with another event, will result in the acceleration or creation of any rights
of any Transferred Employee to payments or benefits or increases in any
payments or benefits or any accelerated funding or loan forgiveness. 

(h) None of the Transferred Companies provides any guaranty, letter of credit,
performance bond or any other security or similar contractual support for any
Benefit Plan maintained or sponsored by any Seller that is not a Transferred
Company Plan and which guaranty, letter of credit, performance bond or other
security or similar contractual support would remain in effect following the
applicable Closing.

(i) The representations and warranties contained in this  _Section 4.15_
constitute the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of the
Company or any other Seller contained in this Agreement relating to Sellers
Benefit Plans that are not Assumed Plans or other employee benefit matters
that are not Assumed Plans. The representations and warranties contained in
_Section 4.9_, _Section 4.11(j)_, _Section 4.12(b)_, _Section 4.14_ and
this  _Section 4.15_ constitute the sole and exclusive representations and
warranties of the Company or any other Seller contained in this Agreement
relating to Sellers Benefit Plans that are Assumed Plans or other employee
benefit matters that are Assumed Plans.

Section 4.16 _Finders or Brokers_. The Company has not utilized the
services of any investment banker, broker, finder or intermediary in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions who might, based on arrangements
made by or on behalf of, the Company or its Affiliates, be entitled to a fee
or commission from the Buyer or for which the Buyer would be responsible in
connection with this Agreement or upon consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions, other than Morgan Stanley and Co. LLC for which the Company shall
pay all such fees.

AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION DOCUMENT OR ANY CERTIFICATE DELIVERED IN
CONNECTION HEREWITH, (A) NONE OF THE SELLERS MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTY OR EXTENDS ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR VALIDITY
OF PATENT RIGHTS OR CLAIMS, ISSUED OR PENDING, (B) NONE OF THE SELLERS MAKES
ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO ANY FUTURE EVENTS,
PROSPECTS, PROJECTIONS OR ESTIMATES (INCLUDING AS MAY BE SET FORTH IN ANY 

 



55  BUSINESS PLANS) WITH RESPECT TO THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS, THE ASSUMED
LIABILITIES OR THE BUSINESS, (C) THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS AND THE BUSINESS BEING
TRANSFERRED TO THE BUYER AT THE CLOSINGS ARE TO BE CONVEYED "AS IS, WHERE
IS", AND IN THEIR THEN PRESENT CONDITION, AND THE BUYER SHALL RELY UPON ITS
OWN EXAMINATION THEREOF, AND (D) NONE OF THE SELLERS MAKES ANY GUARANTY OF
QUALITY WITH RESPECT TO ANY OF THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS BEING SO TRANSFERRED,
OR AS TO THE CONDITION OR WORKMANSHIP THEREOF OR THE ABSENCE OF ANY DEFECTS
THEREIN, WHETHER LATENT OR OBVIOUS.

Section 5.7 _Buyer s Examination_. The Company has provided the Buyer with
such access to the records, books, documents, facilities and personnel of the
Asset Sellers and the Sold Companies as the Buyer has deemed necessary and
appropriate in order for the Buyer to investigate and examine to its

the Sold Companies sufficient to make an informed decision to purchase the

acquires the UK Asset Class) in carrying on the same kind of business for
which the UK Asset Class is used by the Seller of the UK Asset Class.

(c) There are no arrangements in existence for the transfer by the Buyer (or

apply to the Buyer (or any of its Affiliates to which it has assigned rights

ARTICLE VI

COVENANTS RELATING TO PERSONNEL ARRANGEMENTS

 

Section 6.1 _Employees and Employee Benefits_.

(a) _Transfer and Certain Terms and Conditions of Employment_. The Buyer (or,
subject to _Section 13.8_, an Affiliate of the Buyer) shall offer employment
to each U.S. Employee who remains employed by the Company or a Subsidiary at
the Initial Closing Date, and at the Initial Closing Canada Newco shall
continue the employment of each Transferred Canadian Employee who remains
employed by Canada Newco at such time, in each case, with substantially
comparable terms and conditions of employment, including the same rate of base
salary, wages or other base compensation, the same target bonus opportunity
and substantially comparable aggregate employee benefits to those in
effect for each employee immediately prior to the Initial Closing Date (other
than with regard to equity, retiree medical or defined benefit pension plan
benefits for U.S. Employees or retiree medical or defined benefit pension plan
benefits for Canadian Employees). In the case of each Employee listed on
_Schedule 6.1(a)_ (the " _Specified Employees_ "), the offer or continuation
of employment by the Buyer or its Affiliate must meet the criteria of
Substantially Equivalent Employment. Any offers of employment to the U.S.
Employees shall provide for employment commencing as of the Initial Closing
Date, except (i) as provided in _Section 6.3_ _or_ (ii) with respect to
any offers of employment to any U.S. Employee on an approved short or long
term disability or workers compensation leave of absence as of the Initial
Closing Date (each, a " _U.S. Leave Employee_ "), which shall provide
for employment commencing as of the date that such U.S. Leave Employee
returns to active employment; _provided_ that such U.S. Leave Employee returns
to active employment within six months following the Initial Closing Date. The
Buyer shall communicate with the Company prior to the extension of employment
offers with respect to communicating employment offers to the U.S. Employees.
Sellers shall not interfere with the Buyers extension of employment offers to
Employees and shall direct their officers and directors, and those of their
Affiliates, and any Specified Employee who remains employed at the Initial
Closing, not to discourage Employees from accepting offers of employment and
transfers to the Buyer or one of its Affiliates. Each U.S. Employee who
accepts such offer of employment with the Buyer or an Affiliate of the Buyer
and becomes an employee of the Buyer or an Affiliate of the Buyer is referred
to as a " _Transferred U.S. Employee_." In no event shall a U.S. Leave
Employee or Sponsored

 



59  Employee become a Transferred U.S. Employee for purposes of this Agreement
until such employee begins employment with Buyer or any of its Affiliates.
With respect to U.S. Leave Employees, Sponsored Employees and Canadian
Employees, all references to the "Initial Closing" or "Initial Closing Date"
in this Agreement, except in this _Section 6.1(a)_, the first sentence of 
_Section 6.1(b)_, _Section 6.1(g)_ and _Section 6.1(k)_, shall refer to the
date on which a U.S. Leave Employee, a Sponsored Employee or a Canadian
Employee becomes a Transferred U.S. Employee or a Transferred Canadian
Employee, respectively. Effective as of the Initial Closing, the Companys or
applicable Asset Sellers employment of each U.S. Employee other than a U.S.
Leave Employee or Sponsored Employee, shall cease and, except with respect to
a Contract for employment that is an Assumed Plan, the Buyer will not assume
any Contracts for employment of any U.S. Employee. The Sellers shall be
responsible for all salaries, wages, commissions, contractual incentive
payments, contractual bonuses, employer insurance contributions and similar
obligations (including all related Taxes and social insurance costs), relating
to Transferred U.S. Employees and Transferred Canadian Employees to the extent
that any such payment obligation accrues prior to the Initial Closing Date;
_provided_ that to the extent any of the foregoing is included in the Closing
Working Capital then such obligations shall be assumed by the Buyer and
constitute Assumed Liabilities. For the purpose of the preceding sentence,
and for the avoidance of doubt, "salaries, wages, commissions, contractual
incentive payments, contractual bonuses, employer insurance contributions and
similar obligations" shall exclude (i) any severance or similar obligation
for which the Buyer or its Affiliates have responsibility or Liability
pursuant to _Section 6.1(b)_ or by operation of applicable Law and which is
not an Excluded Employee Liability and (ii) any vacation and other pay for
which the Buyer or its Affiliates have responsibility or Liability pursuant to
_Section 6.1(j)_.

(b) _Severance and Notice_. The Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to,
have in effect for a period of at least 12 months following the Initial
Closing Date a severance plan, practice or policy applicable to each
Transferred U.S. Employee that is not less favorable to the employee than the
severance plan, practice or policy of the Asset Sellers applicable to the
employee and set forth on _Schedule 6.1(b)(i)_ (with credit for service with
the Asset Sellers, Transferred Companies, their Affiliates and their
predecessors as set forth in _Section 6.1(h)_), subject to the requirement
that the applicable Transferred U.S. Employee execute and not revoke
a standard release of all claims. In addition, the Buyer solely shall be
responsible for, and have all Liability with respect to, (i) any severance or
similar obligation with respect to or arising from the termination of
employment with the Buyer or its Affiliates of a Transferred Employee and
(ii) any severance or similar obligation with respect to a Specified Employee,
whether or not a Transferred Employee, that results from the breach by the
Buyer of its obligation under  _Section 6.1(a)_ to provide such Specified
Employee with an offer or continuation of Substantially Equivalent Employment
(in the case of (i) including the severance obligations, and in the case of
(ii) as set forth on  _Schedule 6.1(b)(ii)_ (payable pursuant to the terms of
_Schedule 6.1(b)(ii)_ ) and the employer portion of any payroll, social
security, unemployment or similar Taxes); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall promptly reimburse the Buyer for the excess of (A) the amount
of severance paid by the Buyer to a Specified Employee pursuant to _Schedule
6.1(b)(ii)_ that exceeds six (6) months of the Specified Employees annual
base salary at the time of the Specified Employees separation from the Buyer
and its Affiliates (or, if the Buyer or an Affiliate of the Buyer does not
offer the Specified Employee Substantially Equivalent Employment, of the
Specified Employees annual base salary immediately prior to the Initial
Closing), over (B) the cash severance amount with respect to such Specified
Employee for which

 



60  the Buyer receives indemnification from the Company pursuant to _Section
11.1(g)_. The Buyer agrees that it promptly shall provide notice to the
Company (i) if an Employee listed on _Schedule 6.1(b)(iii)_ (a " _Listed
Employee_ ") or a Specified Employee does not accept the offer or continuation
of employment by the Buyer or its Affiliate; (ii) if the employment of a
Listed Employee who accepts such offer or continuation of employment
terminates within 6 months following the Initial Closing Date; or (iii) if the
employment of a Specified Employee who accepts such offer or continuation of
employment terminates within 12 months following the Initial Closing Date (in
the case of (i), which notice shall specify whether the Buyer or an Affiliate
of the Buyer offered Substantially Equivalent Employment to the Listed
Employee or Specified Employee, and in the case of (ii) and (iii), which
notice shall specify the date of the termination and whether the employment of
the Listed Employee or Specified Employee was terminated by the Buyer or its
Affiliate involuntarily other than for Cause (as defined on _Schedule
6.1(b)(ii)_ ), by the Listed Employee or Specified Employee for Good Reason
(as defined on _Schedule 6.1(b)(ii)_ ), due to the death of the Listed
Employee or Specified Employee, or for other reason).

 

(c) _Tax-Qualified Plans_. Effective as of the Initial Closing Date, each U.S.
Employee shall become fully vested in his or her account balance in the
Company Retirement Plan and each Canadian Employee shall become fully vested
in his or her account balance in the Harris Canada Systems, Inc. Deferred
Profit Sharing Plan. Effective as of the Closing Date applicable to the
UK Asset Class, each UK Employee shall become fully vested in his or her
account balance in the Harris Canada Systems, Inc. Deferred Profit Sharing
Plan. As soon as administratively practicable following the Initial Closing
Date, the Buyer shall have, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to have, in
effect a defined contribution plan that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code and that includes a cash or deferred arrangement
within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (the " _Buyer U.S.
Retirement Plan_ ") in which Transferred U.S. Employees who meet the
eligibility criteria thereof shall be eligible to participate. Effective as of
the Initial Closing Date, the Transferred U.S. Employees shall cease to
participate, contribute or accrue benefits in the Company Retirement Plan and
the Transferred Canadian Employees shall cease to participate, contribute or
accrue benefits in the Benefit Plans that provide for retirement savings,
such as registered retirement savings plans, deferred profit sharing plans or
similar arrangements, that are sponsored or maintained by any Seller or
Transferred Company in connection with the Transferred Canadian Employees
(the " _Seller Canadian Retirement Plans_ "). As soon as administratively
practicable following the Initial Closing Date, the Buyer shall have, or shall
cause one of its Affiliates to have, in effect retirement savings plans such
as registered retirement savings plans, deferred profit sharing plans or
similar arrangements (the " _Buyer Canadian Retirement Plans_ ") that are
substantially comparable to the applicable Seller Canadian Retirement Plans in
which the Transferred Canadian Employees who meet the eligibility criteria
thereof shall be eligible to participate. The Buyer agrees to cause the Buyer
U.S. Retirement Plan to accept eligible cash rollovers by Transferred U.S.
Employees from the Company Retirement Plan, including promissory notes
evidencing outstanding loans, and to cause the Buyer Canadian Retirement Plans
to accept eligible cash rollovers or transfers by Transferred Canadian
Employees from the applicable Seller Canadian Retirement Plans. The Buyer
agrees that it will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the third-
party administrators of the Buyer U.S. Retirement Plan and Buyer Canadian
Retirement Plans to accept any rollover or transfer contemplated pursuant to
this _Section 6.1(c)_ no later than thirty days following the date that such
third-party administrator

 



61  receives the documentation necessary to process such rollover or transfer.
Sellers agree to not place any such loan into default during the period from
the Initial Closing Date until the applicable rollover or transfer is
completed; _provided_ that the participant continues to timely make all
required installment payments with respect to such loan in accordance with the
Sellers reasonable procedures and the rollover or transfer is completed no
later than one hundred twenty (120) days following the date the Buyer U.S.
Retirement Plan or Buyer Canadian Retirement Plan, as applicable, is in
effect.

 

(d) _Certain Welfare Plan Matters_. Effective as of the Initial Closing Date,
the Buyer shall maintain or cause one of its Affiliates to maintain Welfare
Plans, including a group health plan, in which Transferred U.S. Employees and
Transferred Canadian Employees, and their respective spouses, dependents or
other beneficiaries, who meet the eligibility criteria thereof may
participate (the " _Buyer Welfare Plans_ "). Following the Initial Closing
Date, the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that (i)
no waiting periods, exclusions or limitations with respect to any pre-
existing conditions, evidence of insurability or good health or actively-at-
work exclusions are applicable to any Transferred U.S. Employees and
Transferred Canadian Employees covered by Welfare Plans maintained by the
Asset Sellers, Transferred Companies or their Affiliates immediately prior to
the Initial Closing Date (the " _Seller Welfare Plans_ "), or their spouses,
dependents or other beneficiaries, under any similar Buyer Welfare Plans to
the extent such exclusions did not apply under the similar Seller Welfare
Plans, and (ii) any costs or expenses incurred by the Transferred U.S.
Employees and Transferred Canadian Employees (and their spouses, dependents
and other beneficiaries) under the Seller Welfare Plans with respect to the
plan year that includes the Initial Closing Date, up to (and including) the
Initial Closing Date, shall be specifically applied for purposes of satisfying
any similar deductible, maximum out-of-pocket provisions and similar
limitations on coverage under the Buyer Welfare Plans for the applicable plan
year in which the Initial Closing Date occurs. Effective as of the Initial
Closing Date, the Transferred U.S. Employees and Transferred
Canadian Employees shall cease to participate in or accrue benefits under all
Seller Welfare Plans (in the case of the Transferred U.S. Employees, except to
the extent they are eligible for and elect retiree coverage in accordance with
the terms thereof or as required by COBRA).

(e) _COBRA_. The Company and its Affiliates shall be solely responsible for
any and all Liabilities relating to compliance with the requirements of
COBRA, including the provision of continuation coverage, with respect to all
Employees who do not become Transferred U.S. Employees, and their spouses and
dependents, and with respect to Transferred U.S. Employees, and their spouses
and dependents, for whom a qualifying event occurs prior to or on the Initial
Closing Date. The Buyer and its Affiliates shall be solely responsible for any
and all Liabilities relating to compliance with the requirements of COBRA,
including the provision of continuation coverage, with respect to qualifying
events with respect to Transferred U.S. Employees, and their spouses and
dependents, that occur after the Initial Closing Date.

 

(f) _Cafeteria Plan_. The Buyer shall have in effect, or cause to be in
effect, as of the Initial Closing Date, flexible spending reimbursement
accounts under a cafeteria plan qualifying under Section 125 of the Code (the
" _Buyer Cafeteria Plan_ ") in which Transferred U.S. Employees who meet the
eligibility criteria thereof may participate. As soon as practicable
following the Initial Closing Date, the Company shall cause to be transferred
to the Buyer an amount in cash equal to the excess of the aggregate
accumulated contributions to the flexible 

 



62  spending reimbursement accounts under the Companys cafeteria plan in which
such Transferred U.S. Employees participate (the " _Company Cafeteria Plan_ ")
made during the year in which the Initial Closing Date occurs by the
Transferred U.S. Employees over the aggregate reimbursement payouts made for
such year from such accounts to such Transferred U.S. Employees. The Buyer or
an Affiliate of the Buyer shall cause the balance of each Transferred U.S.
Employees accounts under the Company Cafeteria Plan as of the Initial Closing
Date to be credited to the Transferred U.S. Employees corresponding accounts
under the Buyer Cafeteria Plan in which such employee participates following
the Initial Closing Date. On and after the Initial Closing Date, the Buyer
shall assume and be solely responsible for all claims for reimbursement by the
Transferred U.S. Employees, whether incurred prior to, on or after the
Initial Closing Date, that have not been paid in full as of the Initial
Closing Date, which claims shall be paid pursuant to and under the terms of
the Buyer Cafeteria Plan, and the Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Sellers from any and all claims by or with respect to the Transferred U.S.
Employees for reimbursement under the Company Cafeteria Plan that have not
been paid in full as of the Initial Closing Date. The Buyer agrees to cause
the Buyer Cafeteria Plan to honor and continue through the end of the
calendar year in which the Initial Closing Date occurs the elections made by
each Transferred U.S. Employee under the Company Cafeteria Plan in respect of
the flexible spending reimbursement accounts that are in effect immediately
prior to the Initial Closing Date.

(g) _Sick Pay and Disability_. The Asset Seller of the US Asset Class shall
be solely responsible for sick pay and disability (whether long-term or short-
term) coverage of U.S. Leave Employees who do not become Transferred Employees
because they do not return to active employment within six months
following the Initial Closing Date.

(h) _Credited Service_. With respect to each Benefit Plan, including
severance, vacation and paid time-off plans, policies or practices, sponsored
or maintained by the Buyer or an Affiliate of the Buyer, the Buyer or such
Affiliate shall recognize, for all Transferred Employees, credit for all
service with the Sellers, their Affiliates and their respective predecessors,
for all purposes (including eligibility, vesting, level of benefits, benefit
accrual (other than under a defined benefit pension plan), pre-existing
condition limitations and early retirement subsidies);  _provided_ that no
service credit shall be granted to the extent any duplication of benefits
results.

(i)  _Workers  Compensation_. The Sellers shall have the obligation and
Liability for any workers compensation, occupational disease or illness or
similar workers protection claims with respect to any Transferred Employee,
to the extent the injury or illness giving rise to such claim originated

Liability for any workers compensation, occupational disease or illness, or
similar workers protection claims with respect to any Transferred Employee,
to the extent the injury or illness giving rise to such claim originates on or
after the applicable Closing Date.

otherwise required by applicable requirements of Law, the Asset Sellers and
Transferred Companies obligations and Liability with respect to the accrued
and unused vacation days of the Transferred Employees shall be transferred to
and assumed by the Buyer and its Affiliates, and the Buyer and its Affiliates
shall recognize and provide all such unused vacation and pay; _provided_ that
such unused vacation pay is included in the Closing Working Capital.

 



63 (k) _WARN_. The Buyer shall be responsible for all Liabilities under WARN
resulting from or arising after the Initial Closing as a result of actions
taken by the Buyer or its Affiliates.

procedure for predecessors and successors" set forth in Section 4 of Revenue
Procedure 2004 53, 2004 34 IRB 320 with respect to Transferred U.S. Employees,
and without unreasonable delay the Sellers shall provide Buyer with such
information regarding employment taxes paid for the calendar year in which the
Initial Closing Date occurs with respect to the Transferred U.S. Employees as
Buyer may reasonably request. 

(m) _TUPE Regulations_.

(i) The Buyer and the Sellers intend and agree that the sale and purchase of
the Transferred Assets that constitute the UK Asset Class pursuant to this
Agreement will constitute a relevant transfer for the purposes of the TUPE
Regulations and, accordingly, that at the Closing Date applicable to the UK
Asset Class, the contracts of employment of the UK Employees who remain in
employment with an Asset Seller immediately prior to such Closing Date will,
excluding any provisions of an occupational pension scheme which relate to
benefits for old age, invalidity or survivors (within the meaning given to
those terms under regulation 10 of the TUPE Regulations), transfer to the
Buyer (or, subject to _Section 13.8_, an Affiliate of the Buyer) by
operation of Law under the TUPE Regulations.

 

(ii) The Asset Seller of the UK Asset Class shall provide the Buyer with all
such information relating to the UK Employees as set out in regulation 11 of

(iii) Subject to the Asset Seller of the UK Asset Classs compliance with
_Section 6.1(m)(ii)_, the Buyer shall provide the Company and the Asset
Seller of the UK Asset Class with such information relating to the UK
Employees on a timely basis as may be required by regulation 13(4) of the TUPE
Regulations.

 

(iv) The Sellers shall be responsible for all salaries, wages, commissions,
contractual incentive payments, contractual bonuses and employer insurance
contributions made to or on behalf of an employee and Taxes relating to the
Transferred UK Employees (" _UK Employment Costs_ ") to the extent that any
such UK Employment Cost accrues prior to the Closing Date applicable to the
UK Asset Class and the Buyer shall be responsible for UK Employment Costs that
accrue thereafter. That parties agree that all necessary apportionments shall
be made to give effect to this  _Section 6.1(m)_).

(v) The Buyer shall comply with in all material respects its
obligations under the Pensions Act 2004 in relation to pension provision for
the Transferred UK Employees.

(vi) The Buyer and the Sellers shall cooperate regarding the information and
consultation requirements of the TUPE Regulations and the Sellers shall
procure that the

 



64  Buyer and its Affiliates shall be permitted to attend meetings and issue
communications to the UK Employees or their representatives.

 

(vii) The Buyer shall have the obligation and liability for any UK Employee
who is absent from work on long term disability, whether the injury giving
rise to such absence originates prior to, on or after the Closing Date
applicable to the UK Asset Class; provided, that with respect to any UK
Employee who is absent from work on long term disability prior to the Closing
Date applicable to the UK Asset Class, Sellers properly transfer and assign to
Buyer at the Closing Date applicable to the UK Asset Class the related
insurance policies. If such transfer and assignment is restricted due to a
term in any such insurance contract, the Company and the Buyer shall each use
its commercially reasonable efforts to secure consent from the applicable
insurance carrier to such insurance contract to provide such assignment and
transfer and the Buyer shall cooperate with the Company and provide such
assistance as the Company may reasonably request to secure such consent.

(n)  _Labor Agreements_. In connection with the execution of this Agreement
and the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, Sellers shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, comply in all material respects with all
applicable Laws and the terms of any Contract relating to any labor or trade
union, works council, labor organization or other authorized employee
representative representing any employee of the Business, including all
notification and/or consultation requirements. The Buyer and its Affiliates
shall cooperate with Sellers in good faith in connection with any works
council consultations or approvals that are required or that Sellers and the
Buyer reasonably agree in good faith are advisable in connection with
the Contemplated Transactions.

(o) _Employee Communications; Information_. From the date hereof through the
applicable Closing Date, (i) Sellers shall provide the Buyer with reasonable
access during normal business hours to, and shall facilitate meetings with,
employees of the Business who may become Transferred Employees for purposes of
making announcements concerning and preparing for the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions, it being understood that Sellers shall be entitled
to attend any such meetings, and Sellers and the Buyer shall cooperate in good
faith regarding the topics to be discussed at such meetings, and (ii) Sellers
and the Buyer shall cooperate in good faith regarding any broadly distributed
communication to employees of the Business relating to employment, benefits
and compensation with the Buyer and its Affiliates following the applicable
Closing. Sellers shall provide the Buyer with all information which is
reasonably requested by the Buyer that is necessary to permit the Buyer to
perform its obligations under this _Article VI_ , including such information
as may be reasonably requested by the Buyer following the Initial Closing
Date, and Sellers agreement to provide such information shall survive the
Initial Closing Date for so long as the Buyer remains obligated to perform
under this _Article VI_.

(p) _Canadian Notices_. Harris Canada shall provide written notices
to Canadian Employees to affect the continuation of their employment with
Canada Newco, on the same terms and conditions of employment as enjoyed by the
Canadian Employees prior to the closing of the Canadian Pre-Closing
Reorganization. Such notices shall advise Canadian Employees that the Buyer
in this Agreement has agreed that Canada Newco shall continue the employment
of Transferred Canadian Employees following the Initial Closing Date on
substantially comparable 

 



65  terms and conditions of employment in accordance with the requirements of
_Section 6.1(a)_, and that any changes to terms and conditions of employment
effective on and after the Initial Closing Date shall be subsequently
communicated by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer. Following the provision of
such written notices by Harris Canada, Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer shall
communicate to the Transferred Canadian Employees any changes to terms and
conditions of employment with Canada Newco, effective on and after the Initial
Closing Date, which changes shall in all respects be in accordance with the
requirements of _Section 6.1(a)_, and may request that the Transferred
Canadian Employees agree to any such changes in a written agreement with Buyer
or an Affiliate of Buyer; provided, however, that the failure of any
Transferred Canadian Employee to enter into such an agreement will in no way
impact Buyer`s responsibility for Liabilities for severance, separation,
termination or notice period pay or similar payments arising in respect of the
Transferred Canadian Employees on or after the Initial Closing Date as a
result of changes to terms and conditions of employment on and after the
Initial Closing Date or otherwise. The Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate in
good faith in respect of notices, communications and agreements provided to
the Transferred Canadian Employees prior to the Initial Closing Date, and the
Sellers shall not discourage Transferred Canadian Employees from signing
written agreements regarding changes to terms and conditions of employment
with Canada Newco on and after the Initial Closing Date.

the transfer to the Buyer and its Affiliates, (ii) the time or the envisaged
time of the transfer, (iii) the reason for the transfer, (iv) the legal,
economic and social consequences of the transfer, (v) the measures
contemplated with respect to the German Seller Employees, and (vi) the right
to object to the transfer within one month after the receipt of the
notification in sufficient time to ensure the one months objection period has
expired prior to the applicable Closing. To the extent the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates has not already done so prior to the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, without undue delay following the date of this Agreement the
Buyer shall furnish Sellers with all information as reasonably required by
Sellers to prepare the information letters as required by the applicable Laws.
The German Seller shall forward without undue delay to the Buyer, and the
Buyer or its Affiliates shall forward without undue delay to Sellers, copies
of any notices of objection received from any of the German Seller Employees.
Sellers and the Buyer or their respective Affiliates shall coordinate and
agree the content of the information letters in good faith and without undue
delay prior to rendering them to the German Seller Employees.

applicable Closing, the Company and the Buyer will cooperate to identify,
with the assistance of their respective counsel, the Sellers Benefit Plans
that are Automatically Transferred Plans.

Section 6.2 _Other Business Employees and Employee Benefits_. With respect to
any Other Business Employee who remains employed by the Company or a
Subsidiary as of the applicable Closing Date, effective as of such date, the
Buyer or an Affiliate of the Buyer shall offer comparable employment to or
continue the employment of the Other Business Employee at the same rate of
base salary, wages or other base compensation, same target bonus
opportunities and under reasonably comparable employee benefits in the
aggregate, including recognition of past service credit; _provided_ that no
service credit shall be granted to the extent any duplication 

 



66  of benefits results. The Buyer or an Affiliate of the Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide such employees any other terms and
conditions of employment as are made available to such individual immediately
before the applicable Closing Date that must be continued to constitute
comparable employment pursuant to any applicable Law or contractual
obligations. Each Other Business Employee who accepts such offer of
employment and commences employment with the Buyer or an Affiliate of the
Buyer, or continues employment with a Transferred Company or transfers to the
Buyer or an Affiliate of the Buyer under the Transfer Regulations is referred
to as an " _Other Transferred Employee_." To the extent not prohibited by
applicable Law, the applicable Asset Seller shall terminate the employment of
all of the Other Business Employees employed by such Asset Seller immediately
prior to the applicable Closing, except as provided in _Section 6.3_. The
Buyer shall assume all of the Liabilities and obligations of the Sellers and
their Affiliates with respect to, any severance, separation or termination
pay, notice period and similar Liabilities arising from the termination or
transfer of employment of any Other Business Employee which are not Excluded
Employee Liabilities. The Sellers shall be responsible for any severance,
separation or termination pay, notice period and similar Liabilities
(including all related Taxes and social insurance costs) arising from the
termination or transfer of employment of any Other Business Employee which are
Excluded Employee Liabilities, and all salaries, wages,
commissions, contractual incentive payments, contractual bonuses, employer
insurance contributions and similar obligations, including any related taxes
and social insurance costs, relating to Other Transferred Employees to the
extent that any such payment obligation accrues prior to the applicable
Closing Date. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, and for the avoidance
of doubt, "salaries, wages, commissions, contractual incentive payments,
contractual bonuses, employer insurance contributions and similar
obligations" shall exclude (i) any severance or similar obligation for which
the Buyer or its Affiliates have responsibility or Liability pursuant to this
_Section 6.2_ or by operation of applicable Law and which is not an Excluded
Employee Liability, (ii) any vacation and other pay for which the Buyer or its
Affiliates have responsibility or Liability pursuant to _Section 6.1(j)_, and
(iii) any termination or retirement indemnities in France, end of service
gratuities in the United Arab Emirates, TFR indemnities in Italy, long service
award in Australia and any similar indemnities, gratuities, awards or
payments.

 

Section 6.3 _Sponsored Employees_. Any offer of employment by the Buyer or its
Affiliate to an employee of the Business working on a Seller-sponsored visa
or work permit as of the applicable Closing Date (each, a " _Sponsored
Employee_ "), shall provide for employment commencing as of the date that
sponsorship of the applicable visa or work permit is lawfully transferred or
granted to the Buyer or its Affiliate. The applicable Asset Seller shall
terminate the employment of the Sponsored Employee immediately prior to the
date on which the Buyer or its Affiliate will become the sponsor. Promptly
following the applicable Closing Date, the Buyer or its Affiliate shall
petition the applicable Governmental Body for the transfer of each Sponsored
Employees visa or grant of a new work permit, and the Buyer or its Affiliate
shall use commercially reasonable efforts (including the use of premium or
similar methods of expedited processing) to complete the sponsorship process
within 90 days following the applicable Closing Date. The Buyer and the
Sellers will cooperate with each other and with the applicable Governmental
Body with respect to the visa or work permit sponsorship process for the
Sponsored Employees. The Buyer agrees to pay all costs and expenses related to
the transfer or grant of the visa or work permit sponsorship of the Sponsored
Employees, excluding expenses related to Sellers advisors, and assume all
immigration-related rights and obligations for the

 



67  Sponsored Employees, to the extent permitted by applicable Law. During the
period between the applicable Closing Date and the date on which the visa or
work permit is transferred or granted to the Buyer or its Affiliate, the
Sponsored Employees shall provide services to the Buyer or its Affiliate
pursuant to the terms of mutually agreeable leasing agreements. _Schedule 6.3_
sets forth the name, type of visa or work permit and issuing country and
country of citizenship of each employee of the Business working on a Seller-
sponsored visa or work permit as of the date of this Agreement.

Section 6.4 _No Third Party Beneficiaries/Limitation of Restrictions on Buyer
s Post-Closing Business Operations_. No provision contained in this _ARTICLE
VI_ shall (i) be treated as an amendment of any particular employee benefit
plan or compensation arrangement maintained or to be maintained by the
Sellers, the Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates, (ii) except as
expressly provided herein (other than _Sections 6.1(a)_ and _6.2_ ) or under
applicable Law, obligate the Buyer or any of its Affiliates to (A) maintain
any particular benefit plan or compensation arrangement or (B) retain the
employment, or terms of employment, of any particular employee, after the
applicable Closing Date or (iii) except as expressly provided herein (other
than _Sections 6.1(a)_ and _6.2_ ) or under applicable Law, prevent the
amendment or termination of any employee benefit plan or compensation
arrangement after the applicable Closing Date or interfere with the right or
obligation of the Buyer or its Affiliates to make changes to such a plan or
arrangement. Without limiting the generality of _Section 13.5_, the Sellers
and the Buyer acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this
_ARTICLE VI_ are included for the sole benefit of the Sellers, the Buyer and
their respective Affiliates, and that nothing in this _ARTICLE VI_ , whether
express or implied, shall create any third party beneficiary or other rights
in any other Person, including any Transferred Employee or any other employee,
former employee, or participant in any employee benefit plan or compensation
arrangement (or any spouse, dependent or other beneficiary thereof), of the
Sellers, the Buyer or their respective Affiliates.

opportunity to attend and/or participate. Subject to applicable Law, the
parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another in connection with
any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,

hereto relating to proceedings under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws.
Either party may, as it deems advisable and necessary, reasonably, designate
any competitively sensitive material provided to the other party under this
_Section 7.1_ as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers, or directors of the recipient, unless express written permission is
obtained in advance from the source of the materials.

(b) Each of the Company and the Buyer shall use its best efforts to resolve
such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Body with
respect to the Contemplated Transactions under the Antitrust Laws. In
connection therewith, if any Action is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) challenging that any Contemplated Transaction is in violation of
any Antitrust Law, each of the Company and the Buyer shall cooperate and use
its best efforts to contest and resist any such Action, and to have vacated,
lifted, reversed, or overturned any Order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, or restricts
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, including by pursuing all
available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal, unless, by
mutual agreement, the Company and the Buyer decide that litigation is not in
their respective best interests. Each of the Company and the Buyer shall use

with respect to such transactions as promptly as possible after the execution
of this Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each
of the Company and the Buyer agree to use its best efforts to take promptly
any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment
under any Antitrust Laws that may be asserted by any federal, state and local

parties to close the Contemplated Transactions as expeditiously as possible,
including committing to or effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders,
trust or otherwise, the sale or disposition of such of its assets or
businesses as are required to be divested in order to avoid the entry of, or
to effect the dissolution of, any Order in any Action, that would otherwise
have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions. 

(c) The Buyer and the Company shall reasonably cooperate with one another (i)
in determining whether any other action by or in respect of, or filing with,
any Governmental Body is required in connection with the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions and (ii) in taking such actions or making any such
filings, in furnishing such information as may be 

 



69  required in connection therewith. Subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing,
all things necessary, proper or advisable, as promptly as practicable, to
transfer (or, if not transferable, reissue) to Buyer any Environmental

Business as of the Initial Closing Date.

 

Section 7.2 _Representations and Updates_. From the date hereof to the Final

other in writing (a) if it has Knowledge that any information set forth in any
of the representations or warranties made by it herein is no longer materially
correct, or (b) if it gains Knowledge that any of its representations or
warranties made by it herein were incorrect in any material respect when made.
No such disclosures shall be deemed to modify, amend or supplement the
representations or warranties of the Company or the Buyer contained herein or
to prevent or cure any misrepresentation, breach of warranty, or breach of
covenant or for any other purpose whatsoever (including satisfaction of the
conditions), and, for the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall any such
disclosure modify, reduce or otherwise affect the Companys or the Buyers
indemnity obligations hereunder.

Section 7.3  _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_. The Company and the Buyer
shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all of the conditions
to the obligations of the other to consummate the Contemplated Transactions
that are within its control to be met as soon as reasonably practicable after

or country in which each Asset Class is located so that each Closing can take
place without delay.

Section 7.4 _Access to Premises and Information; Customers_.

 

(a) From the date hereof to the Final Closing Date, the Company shall give to,
or cause to be made available for, the Buyer and its other Representatives

Companies businesses, to inspect during normal business hours all the
properties, documents, Assigned Contracts, and Records of the Asset Sellers or
Transferred Companies relating to the Business; _provided_ that, subject to
the final sentence of this _Section 7.4(a)_, the parties shall maintain the
confidentiality of any disclosed information to the extent set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated June 22, 2012 (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), between an Affiliate of the Buyer and the Company, and the
Buyer and the Company shall not seek or provide access to information if such
disclosure would, in the good faith reasonable belief of the Company, result
in or constitute (i) a waiver of attorney-client privilege or other privilege
of the Company or any of its Affiliates, (ii)a violation of applicable Law or
(iii) a breach of contract, except that, the Company shall be required to
disclose any such information under clauses (i) and (ii) if the Buyer
is willing to enter into a joint defense agreement on customary terms and
conditions with the Company and/or any applicable Affiliates regarding the
matters relating to such disclosure or provide that such information is shared
on an "outside counsel" basis. If such access is restricted due to a term in
an Assigned Contract, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to secure consent from the other party to such an Assigned Contract to
provide such access. The execution of this Agreement shall constitute written
consent by the Company pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement (x) to all

 



70  actions of the Buyer and its Affiliates expressly permitted or contemplated
by this Agreement and the Transaction Documents, (y) to waive the limitations
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement to the extent (and only to the
extent) that such limitations restrict contacting and working with financing

none of the Buyer or any of its individual Representatives working on its
behalf in connection with the Contemplated Transactions will, directly or

withheld, delayed or conditioned.

73 Section 7.6 _Transfer of Assets from Transferred Companies prior to Closing_.
(a) Prior to the applicable Closing, each Transferred Company (including those
with respect to the Asset Classes of Brazil, Cayman Islands, China, Hong Kong,
India, Mexico and Singapore) may sell, grant, transfer and assign all of its
assets, properties and rights that are not primarily used (or primarily held
for use) in the Business or that constitute an Excluded Asset to any Person,
including the Company or any of its Affiliates, such that the Transferred
Company will not hold any Excluded Assets as of the Closing applicable to
such Transferred Company; _provided_ that (a) any such transfer shall be
conducted in compliance with all applicable Laws and Contracts and (b) any
Liabilities resulting from such transfers shall be considered Excluded
Liabilities. The Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such sales, grants, transfers and
assignments to occur as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement.

(b) Subject to _Section 7.6(c)_, no later than fifteen (15) days after the
date of this Agreement, the Company shall provide notice to the Buyer whether
it will take the actions set forth in _Section 7.6(a)_ with respect to the
Hong Kong Asset Class or if it will form a new entity under the Laws of Hong
Kong as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company or of one of its Subsidiaries
(" _Hong Kong Newco_ ") and cause Harris Communications Limited, a local
limited company formed under the laws of Hong Kong (" _Harris Hong Kong_ "),
to sell, grant, transfer and assign all of its assets, properties and rights
that would constitute Transferred Assets under _Article II_ to Hong Kong Newco
and to cause Hong Kong Newco to assume from Harris Hong Kong, and agree to
pay, honor, perform and discharge when due, all Liabilities that would
constitute Assumed Liabilities under _Article II_ , in each case prior to the
Closing applicable to the Hong Kong Asset Class (such transactions, the "
_Hong Kong Pre-Closing Reorganization_ "). Subject to _Section 7.6(c)_, if
the Company elects to consummate the Hong Kong Pre-Closing Reorganization, the
references herein, including those on _Schedules A_ , _B_ , _C_ and _D_ , to
Harris Hong Kong and to the applicable Stock Seller of the Shares of Harris
Hong Kong shall be deemed to be to Hong Kong Newco and to the holder of
Shares of Hong Kong Newco, respectively, and Hong Kong Newco shall be
substituted for Harris Hong Kong as a Sold Company. The Company shall bear any
and all expenses (including Taxes) arising solely as a result of the Hong Kong
Pre-Closing Reorganization that are in excess of the expenses (including
Taxes) that would have arisen if Harris Hong Kong would have been a Sold
Company. Subject to _Section 7.6(c)_, at least ten (10) Business Days prior
to the consummation of the Hong Kong Pre-Closing Reorganization, the Company
shall provide the Buyer with copies of all transaction documents related
thereto and shall accept in good faith any reasonable comments provided by the
Buyer.

 

(c) No later than thirty (30) days after the date of this Agreement, the Buyer
may provide notice to the Company of its election to have the Transferred
Assets that constitute the Hong Kong Asset Class be transferred directly to
the Buyer (or, subject to _Section 13.8_, an Affiliate of the Buyer). If the
Buyer makes such election, then the Company shall cause the Transferred
Assets that constitute the Hong Kong Asset Class to be transferred directly to
the Buyer (or, subject to _Section 13.8_, an Affiliate of the Buyer) at the
Closing applicable to the Hong Kong Asset Class. If such election is made by
the Buyer, Harris Hong Kong will be deemed to be an Asset Seller with respect
to the Hong Kong Asset Class. The Buyer shall bear any and all expenses and
Transfer Taxes arising solely as a result of the Buyers election under this
_Section 7.6(c)_ that are in excess of the expenses and Transfer Taxes that
would have arisen if

 



74  (i) in the case where the Company did not elect pursuant to _Section
7.6(b)_ to consummate the Hong Kong Pre-Closing Reorganization, Harris Hong
Kong would have been a Sold Company or (ii) in the case where the Company
elected pursuant to _Section 7.6(b)_ to consummate the Hong Kong Pre-Closing
Reorganization, the Hong Kong Pre-Closing Reorganization would have been
consummated and Hong Kong Newco would have been a Sold Company (assuming, for
the avoidance of doubt for purposes of this clause (ii), that any Transfer
Taxes imposed in connection with the Hong Kong Pre-Closing Reorganization and
the transfer of Hong Kong Newco are treated as Transfer Taxes). For the
avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, any and all Excluded Liabilities (including Excluded Taxes) arising
as a result of Buyers election pursuant to this  _Section 7.6(c)_ shall be
borne solely by the Company.

Section 7.7 _Transfer of Canadian Assets prior to Initial Closing_. No more
than five (5) Business Days prior to the Initial Closing, the Company may
cause the Transferred Assets that constitute the Canada Asset Class
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any assets, properties and rights
that constitute an Excluded Asset) to be transferred to an entity formed under
the Laws of Alberta as a wholly owned subsidiary of Harris Canada (" _Canada
Newco_ ") in consideration for the assumption by Canada Newco of the
Liabilities of Harris Canada with respect to the Canada Asset Class and common
shares of Canada Newco, and, in connection therewith, Canada Newco will hire
the Canadian Employees (such transactions, the " _Canadian Pre-Closing
Reorganization_ "). The Buyer acknowledges that in connection with the
Canadian Pre-Closing Reorganization, Canada Newco will agree with Harris
Canada to make and file joint elections pursuant to the provisions of (i)
section 22, subsection 20(24) and section 85 of the Canadian ITA, and the
corresponding provisions of any applicable provincial tax statute, in respect
of the Canadian Pre-Closing Reorganization and (ii) if applicable, section 167
of the _Excise Tax Act_ (Canada). The Buyer covenants to cause Canada Newco
to make and file such elections in the forms, and specifying such amounts, as
may be requested by Harris Canada and to otherwise cause Canada Newco to
comply with its obligations in respect of such elections, and any other
Canadian tax elections and its other obligations as provided under the terms
of the Canadian Pre-Closing Reorganization. If the Canadian Pre-Closing
Reorganization is not consummated prior to the Initial Closing Date, the
parties shall cooperate to cause the Transferred Assets that constitute the
Canada Asset Class to be transferred to directly to the Buyer (or, subject to
_Section 13.8_, an Affiliate of the Buyer) at the Initial Closing. The
parties shall also consider whether Harris Canada and the Buyer or Affiliate
can jointly execute an election under section 167 of the _Excise Tax Act_
(Canada) in respect of the transfer of the Transferred Assets that constitute
the Canada Asset Class, provided the Buyer (or its Affiliate) is registered
for goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax purposes on or before the
Initial Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the Buyer (or its Affiliate) shall also indemnify and hold Harris Canada
harmless in respect of any goods and services tax, harmonized sales tax and
50% of any penalties, interest and other amounts which may be assessed against
Harris Canada as a result of the transactions under this Agreement not being
eligible for such election or as a result of the Buyers or its Affiliates
failures to file the election within the prescribed time. If the Company
elects to proceed with the Canadian Pre-Closing Reorganization, the Buyer
shall cause Canada Newco, within two Business Days after the Initial Closing,
to register in the applicable land registry office, a registrable transfer for
all Owned Real Property conveyed to Canada Newco as part of the Canadian Pre-
Closing Reorganization and, in connection therewith, to pay all applicable
land transfer taxes at the time of such registration.

 



75  The Company shall cause Harris Canada to reimburse the Buyer or Canada Newco
for the portion of such land transfer Taxes for which the Company is
responsible pursuant to  _Section 13.6_, except to the extent that (A) such
portion of such land transfer taxes was reflected in any Final Closing
Certificate and (B) the Buyer has already been compensated by reason of the
specific inclusion of such portion of such land transfer Taxes in the
calculation of Closing Working Capital resulting in a reduction of the
Purchase Price relative to what the Purchase Price otherwise would have been
absent such inclusion, and the amount of such reimbursement shall be treated
by the parties for Tax purposes as an adjustment to the portion of the
Purchase Price allocated to the shares of Canada Newco hereunder. At least 10
Business Days prior to the Closing applicable to the Canada Asset Class, the
Company shall inform the Buyer of any election to commence the Canadian Pre-
Closing Reorganization and the progress thereof and shall provide the Buyer
with copies of all transaction documents related thereto.

 

Section 7.8 _Transaction Documents_. The parties shall cooperate to prepare as
soon as reasonably practicable any and all Transaction Documents not prepared
as of the date of this Agreement. In addition, the parties hereby agree that
each agreement, arrangement or other instrument as shall be required under Law
in order to transfer the Transferred Assets or effectuate the assumption of
the Assumed Liabilities in jurisdictions inside or outside of the United
States shall include only those representations, warranties and indemnities
provided for in this Agreement and such other provisions as are required by
Law to give effect to such transfer and in any event such agreement,
arrangement or other instrument will be given the same treatment as Local
Transfer Documents as set forth in _Section 13.9_.

 

Section 7.9 _Letters of Credit; Guarantees and Performance Bonds_. The Parties
acknowledge that (a) the outstanding letters of credit, letters of guaranty
and (subject to the Transition Services Agreement) performance bonds set forth
on _Schedule 4.11(l)_ (except for those noted on such Schedule as expired) to
the extent related to the Transferred Assets transferred as of such Closing
shall be terminated and the applicable Person (including the Sellers and their
Affiliates) shall be released from any obligations thereunder; (b) in
connection with such termination, the Buyer shall arrange for the issuance of
replacement letters of credit and letters of guaranty at or prior to such
Closing and for the issuance of replacement performance bonds within 90 days
after such Closing; and (c) in no event shall any Seller have any obligations
with respect to any such replacement letters of credit, letters of guaranty
or, except as expressly set forth in the Transition Services Agreement,
performance bonds. To the extent a Closing occurs without a termination or
release of the relevant letters of credits, guarantees, performance bonds or
other obligations, the Buyer shall indemnify the Company and its Affiliates
against any Damages of any kind whatsoever with respect to such Liabilities.
The Buyer agrees to continue to use its commercially reasonable efforts after
the Closings to relieve the Company and its Affiliates of all such
Liabilities.

 

Section 7.10 _[Reserved]_.

Section 7.11 _Intercompany Debt_. The Company will cause any Indebtedness or
other accounts of (a) any Transferred Company that is payable to the Company
or any of its Affiliates (other than another Transferred Company) and (b) the
Company or any of its Affiliates (other than a Transferred Company) that is
payable to a Transferred Company, to be cancelled, repaid or otherwise
extinguished at or prior to the Initial Closing. Such Indebtedness will not
be included as Closing Indebtedness to the extent so cancelled, repaid or
otherwise extinguished.

 



76 Section 7.12 _Cooperation with Financing_. The Buyer acknowledges and agrees
that its obligations to consummate the Initial Closing are not subject to a
financing condition under _Article VIII_. Prior to the Initial Closing, the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts to, cooperate with
the Buyer as reasonably requested by the Buyer in connection with any
financing being sought by the Buyer in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions (the " _Financing_ "), including using commercially reasonable
efforts with respect to the following: (a) making the appropriate members of
the senior officers of the Business available at times and locations to be
reasonably agreed upon to participate in a reasonable number of meetings,
presentations, road shows, telephonic due diligence sessions, telephonic
drafting sessions, sessions with rating agencies or other syndication
activities, (b) assisting, by providing customary relevant information or
customary documents, with the preparation of customary materials for rating
agency presentations, offering documents, bank information memoranda and
similar customary documents required in connection with the Financing, (c)
(i) assisting, by providing relevant customary information or customary
documents, and providing customary assistance with the preparation of any
pledge and security documents, any loan agreement, currency or
interest hedging agreement, and other definitive financing documents for the
Financing, (ii) providing customary documents requested by the Buyer or its
financing sources relating to the repayment of the existing Indebtedness of
the Business and the release of related Liens, including customary payoff
letters and (to the extent required) evidence that notice of such repayment
has been timely delivered to the holders of such debt and (iii) providing
customary documentation required by bank regulatory authorities under
applicable "know-your-customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including the Patriot Act, (d) furnishing to the Buyer and its
financing sources, as promptly as practicable, such financial and other
pertinent information regarding the Business (including Business Plans) as may
be reasonably requested by the Buyer; _provided_ that nothing in this clause
(d) shall require the Company to produce or generate financial or
other information or reports that are not readily available or accessible,
(e) furnishing to the Buyer within 15 days of the end of each fiscal month of
the Company ending prior to the Initial Closing, an unaudited balance sheet of
the Business as of the end of such month and unaudited statements of income
and cash flows of the Business for such month, each prepared in accordance
with the accounting records and policies of the Company and with U.S. GAAP
(except that such financial statements may (i) be subject to normal year-end
audit adjustments, (ii) not include provision for income taxes or income tax
accounts and (iii) not contain all notes thereto that may be required by U.S.
GAAP), (f) furnishing to the Buyer within 20 days of the end of each fiscal
quarter of the Company ending prior to the Initial Closing, an unaudited
balance sheet of the Business as of the end of such quarter and unaudited
statements of income and cash flows of the Business for such quarter, each
prepared in accordance with the accounting records and policies of the Company
and with U.S. GAAP (except that such financial statements may (i) be subject
to normal year-end audit adjustments, (ii) not include provision for income
taxes or income tax accounts and (iii) not contain all notes thereto that may
be required by U.S. GAAP), and (g) making the appropriate members of the
senior officers of the Business that will become officers of the Buyer or
its Subsidiaries (including one or more Transferred Companies after the
applicable Closing) available to provide customary officers certificates and
representation letters on behalf of the Buyer or its Subsidiaries (including
the Transferred Companies), including customary authorization letters with
respect to the bank information memoranda (including with respect to the
presence or absence of material non-public information and accuracy of the
information covered therein);  _provided_ , _however_ , that,

 



77  notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (A) nothing
herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it would unreasonably
interfere with the Business or the other businesses or operations of the
Company and its Affiliates and (B) the Company and its Affiliates shall not
(x) be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee, (y) have any
liability or obligation under any loan agreement or any related document or
any other agreement or document related to the Financing ( _provided_ that one
or more Transferred Companies may become subject to such liability or
obligation upon becoming a Subsidiary of the Buyer at the Initial Closing or
a Subsequent Closing), or (z) be required to incur any other liability in
connection with the Financing ( _provided_ that one or more Transferred
Companies may become subject to such liability or obligation upon becoming
a Subsidiary of the Buyer at the Initial Closing or a Subsequent Closing).
The Company hereby consents to the use of the logos of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (including any logos used in the Business) only in connection
with the Financing for display in customary marketing material; _provided_ ,
that such logos shall be used solely in a manner that is not intended or
reasonably likely to harm, disparage or otherwise adversely affect the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, neither this _Section 7.12_ nor the failure of the
Company, its Subsidiaries, its other Affiliates or any of its or their
employees or officers to satisfy any of the covenants or other provisions in
this _Section 7.12_ relieves, in any way, the obligations of the Buyer or the
Fund under this Agreement with respect to consummating the Contemplated
Transactions, except the foregoing shall not limit the effect of any such
breach of this _Section 7.12_ that is the sole and direct cause of the
Buyers inability to obtain the Financing, as determined by a final and
nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction; _provided_ ,
that, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this sentence shall in any way
limit any Buyer Indemnified Persons entitlement to indemnification pursuant
to _Section 11.1_ for a breach of this  _Section 7.12_. The Buyer shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Persons from and against,
and shall reimburse the Seller Indemnified Persons for, all Damages sustained,
incurred or suffered by the Seller Indemnified Persons from any claim,
action, suit, litigation, investigation, inquiry or proceeding from a third
party to the extent resulting from, based upon, arising out of or otherwise
relating to the arrangement of the Financing (including any action taken in
accordance with this _Section 7.12_) and any information (other than
historical information furnished by or on behalf, and relating to, of the
Company or its Subsidiaries which specifically constitute matters for which a
representation and warranty is provided by the Company pursuant to _Article
IV_ ) utilized in connection therewith, except to the extent arising out of
any Seller Indemnified Partys breach. The Buyer shall, promptly upon request
by the Company, from time to time reimburse the Company for all documented and
reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries in
connection with this _Section 7.12_. The Buyer shall be available at
reasonable times on January 8, 2013 and January 24, 2013 to discuss the status
of its financing efforts with the Company and the Buyer shall notify the
Company of any breach by the Company of this _Section 7.12_ of which the
Buyer has Knowledge as of such date. In the event the Buyer does not
consummate a debt financing in connection with the Initial Closing, the Buyer
will notify the Company of any breach by the Company of this _Section
7.12_ of which the Buyer has Knowledge in connection with the Initial
Closing. In the case of any notice from the Buyer of a breach by the Company
of this _Section 7.12_, the Company shall have a reasonable opportunity to
cure such breach.

Section 7.13 _No Solicitation_. From the date hereof to the Final Closing
Date, the Company shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates not to,
and shall use reasonable best

 



78  efforts to cause its and its Affiliates respective Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly, encourage, solicit, initiate or engage in discussions
or negotiations with, or provide any information to or enter into any
agreement with, any Person (other than the Buyer and its Affiliates and
Representatives), concerning any merger, sale of substantial assets, sale of
shares of capital stock, Equity Interests or similar transactions primarily
with respect to any Transferred Company or Transferred Asset, or enter into
any agreement with respect thereto.

 

Section 7.14 _Destruction of Confidential Information_. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof, the Company shall instruct each Person
(other than Buyer and its Representatives) in possession of confidential
information about the Business, the Transferred Companies or the Transferred
Assets that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company in connection with
any actual or potential proposal by such Person to acquire the Business, the
Transferred Companies or the Transferred Assets (or any portion thereof) to
promptly return or destroy all such information, and shall enforce its rights
to receive a certificate from each such Person of such return or destruction.
Prior to the termination of this Agreement, without Buyers prior written
consent, the Company shall not release any third party from, or waive, amend
or modify any provision of, or grant permission under, any confidentiality
agreement to which the Company is a party that was entered into in connection
with its process relating to a sale of the Business, the Transferred Companies
or the Transferred Assets (or any portion thereof).

Section 7.15 _Excess Cash Payments_. If, as of any Subsequent Closing at which
any Specified Transferred Company is transferred, such Transferred Company
holds any Excess Cash, then (i) for a period of ninety (90) days following
such Subsequent Closing, the Buyer will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to,
take such actions within the reasonable control of the Buyer and its
Subsidiaries (excluding any contribution of equity to any Transferred Company,
revaluation of assets, redemption or repurchase of shares or other
extraordinary transaction), as may be reasonably requested by the Company and
at the expense of the Company, to cause such Excess Cash to be legally
distributed to the Buyer in compliance with all material Contracts of the
Buyer and its Subsidiaries within ninety (90) days of such Subsequent Closing
Date out of the distributable reserves or retained earnings (or other
comparable concept) of the Transferred Companies in place as of the Initial
Closing Date, or, to the extent permitted by applicable local Law, profits
generated by such Transferred Company prior to the Initial Closing Date, by
means of one or more dividends or distributions to the Buyer (other than by
intercompany loan or advance or other transaction that results in the creation
of an intercompany receivable) from such Transferred Company (including
through any applicable Subsidiaries of the Buyer of which such Transferred
Company is a Subsidiary) and (ii) to the extent any such Excess Cash is
distributed to the Buyer within such ninety (90)-day period, the Buyer will
pay to the Company (x) the amount of such Excess Cash so distributed to the
Buyer within such ninety (90)-day period, minus (y) the aggregate amount of
all Taxes, out-of-pocket costs and expenses (to the extent not previously
reimbursed by the Company) incurred by the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries
(including any of the Transferred Companies or any of their respective
Subsidiaries) as a result of such distribution of such Excess Cash to the
Buyer.

following conditions precedent (any of which may be waived, in whole or in
part, in writing by the Buyer in its sole discretion):

(a) _Representations and Warranties_. The representations and warranties of
the Company set forth in _ARTICLE IV_ not qualified by "materiality" or
"Material Adverse Effect" shall be accurate in all material respects and the

representations and warranties refers specifically to a date other than the
Initial Closing Date, in which case, such representation or warranty shall
have been accurate as of such other date;  _provided_ that this _Section

83 Section 10.3 _Cooperation in Litigation_.

 

(a) Each party hereto will reasonably cooperate with the other in the defense
or prosecution of any Action (including those set forth on  _Schedules 4.8_ ,
_4.10(c)_ and _11.1(g)_ ) which has been or may be instituted hereafter
against or by such party relating to or arising out of the conduct of the
Business prior to the Final Closing (other than any Action arising out of the
Contemplated Transactions) including by using reasonable efforts to (x)
furnish or cause to be furnished records, information and testimony as
reasonably requested by the other party and (y) cause its current employees
who possess knowledge pertaining to such Actions to make themselves available
(i) to provide such recollections and explanations of events or documents,
(ii) for consultation with respect to litigation and settlement
discussions, (iii) to comply with requests for depositions and for testimony
at trial, (iv) to assist with answering and verifying interrogatory responses,
and (v) to attend strategy sessions and judicial and arbitration proceedings,
each as reasonably requested and to the extent that none of the foregoing

not entitled to indemnification hereunder, shall pay the reasonable expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and disbursements) of the party providing
such cooperation and of its officers, directors, employees and agents
reasonably incurred in connection with providing such cooperation.

(b) The Company hereby covenants and agrees that, with respect to any Action
that is an Excluded Liability that relates to the Business or for which the
Company is defending a claim pursuant to _Section 11.4_ or noted on _Schedule
11.1(g)_ , (i) the Company shall provide, or cause its Affiliates to provide,

Section 10.4 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Tax Returns_.

(i) The Company shall, at its expense, prepare and timely file, or cause to be
prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns of the Transferred Companies and
relating to the Business and the Transferred Assets, in each case, that are
due with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period. Tax Returns prepared by the
Company pursuant to this _Section 10.4(a)(i)_ shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practices of the Transferred Companies or relating to
the Business or the Transferred Assets, as applicable, unless otherwise
required by Law. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company may, in its sole
discretion, include in Canada Newcos Canadian federal income tax return for
its Tax period ending as a result of the sale of the Shares of Canada Newco
hereunder, an election pursuant to subsection 256(9) of the Canadian ITA in
respect of such taxation year. The Company shall provide the Buyer with a copy
of such Tax Returns (and supporting Schedules) (other than Tax Returns
relating to the Business and the Transferred Assets) at least 30 days in
advance of the due date for such Tax Returns. If the due date for filing any
such Tax Return is within 30 days of the Initial Closing Date or the end of
the taxable period with respect to which such Tax Return is being filed, the
Company shall provide the Buyer with a copy of such Tax Return (and supporting

 



84  Schedules) within a reasonable period of time prior to the due date. The
Company will make any revisions to such Tax Returns reasonably requested by
the Buyer prior to filing. The Company shall pay or cause to be paid any
Taxes owed with respect to such Tax Returns, except to the extent (A) Buyer
has already been compensated for such Taxes by reason of the specific
inclusion of such Taxes in the calculation of Closing Working
Capital resulting in a reduction of the Purchase Price relative to what the
Purchase Price otherwise would have been absent such Taxes or (B) such Taxes
are the responsibility of the Buyer pursuant to _Section 13.6_. The amount of
any Taxes of a Transferred Company paid by the Company under this _Section
10.4(a)_ shall be treated by the parties for Tax purposes as an adjustment to
the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to the shares of such
Transferred Company hereunder.

(ii) The Buyer shall be responsible for preparing and filing when due all Tax
Returns of the Transferred Companies (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
Transferred Companies not transferred at the Initial Closing) for all Straddle
Periods and shall pay or cause to be paid when due all Taxes with respect to
any such Tax Returns; provided that the Company shall reimburse the Buyer for
any amount of Tax attributable to a Pre-Closing Straddle Period except to the
extent such Taxes, by reason of the specific inclusion of such Taxes in the
calculation of Closing Working Capital, resulted in a reduction of the
Purchase Price relative to what the Purchase Price otherwise would have been
absent such Taxes or (B) are the responsibility of the Buyer pursuant to
_Section 13.6_. Tax Returns prepared and filed by the Buyer for a Straddle
Period shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practices of the
applicable Transferred Company unless otherwise required by Law. The Buyer
shall provide the Company with a copy of such Straddle Period Tax Returns
(and supporting Schedules) at least 30 days in advance of the due date for
such Tax Returns. If the due date for filing any such Tax Return is within 30
days of the Initial Closing Date or the end of the taxable period with respect
to which such Tax Return is being filed, the Buyer shall provide the Company
with a copy of such Tax Return (and supporting Schedules) within a reasonable
period of time prior to the due date. The Buyer will make any revisions to
such Tax Returns reasonably requested by the Company prior to filing to the
extent such revisions relate to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period.

(b)  _Cooperation_. In connection with the preparation of Tax Returns, audit
examinations, and any administrative or judicial proceedings relating to the
Tax liabilities imposed on the Transferred Companies or the Transferred
Assets, the parties shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, cooperate
fully with each other, including the furnishing or making available during
normal business hours of records, personnel (as reasonably required), books of
account, powers of attorney or other materials necessary or helpful for the
preparation of such Tax Returns, the conduct of audit examinations or the
defense of claims by Tax Authorities as to the imposition of Taxes.

 

(c) _Apportionment of Taxes_. For purposes of this Agreement, the portion of
Tax, (i) with respect to the Transferred Assets and (ii) with respect to the
income, property or operations of the Transferred Companies, in either case
that is attributable to any Tax period that begins on or before the Initial
Closing Date and ends after the Initial Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_
") will be apportioned between the period of the Straddle Period that extends
before the Initial

 



85  Closing Date through the Initial Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Straddle
Period_ ") and the portion of the Straddle Period that extends from the day
after the Initial Closing Date to the end of the Straddle Period (the "
_Post-Closing Straddle Period_ ") in accordance with this _Section 10.4(c)_.
The portion of such Tax attributable to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period
will (i) in the case of any Taxes other than sales or use Taxes, value added
Taxes, employment Taxes, withholding Taxes and any Tax based on or measured by
income, receipts or profits earned during a Straddle Period, be deemed to be
the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Pre-Closing
Straddle Period and denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle
Period, and (ii) in the case of any sales or use Taxes, value added Taxes,
employment Taxes, withholding Taxes and any Tax based on or measured by
income, receipts or profits earned during a Straddle Period, be deemed equal
to the amount that would be payable if the Straddle Period ended on and
included the Initial Closing Date. To the extent that any Tax for a Straddle
Period is based on the greater of a Tax on income, on the one hand, and a Tax
measured by net worth or some other basis not otherwise measured by income,
on the other, the portion of such Tax related to the Pre-Closing Straddle
Period will be deemed to be (1) if the amount of such Tax for the Straddle
Period is measured by net worth or other basis, the amount of such Tax
determined as though the taxable values for the entire Straddle Period equal
the respective values as of the Initial Closing Date and multiplying the
amount of such Tax by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days
during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Straddle Period and
the denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period or (2)
if the amount of such Tax for the Straddle Period is measured by income, the
amount of such Tax determined as though the applicable Tax period terminated
at the end of the day on the Initial Closing Date. The portion of Tax
attributable to a Post-Closing Straddle Period will be calculated in a
corresponding manner.

 

(d) _Certain Controversies_. The Buyer and the Company agree to promptly give
notice to each other of any Tax Matter and any other Action relating to Taxes
of any Transferred Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period;
_provided,_ that the Buyers failure to provide such prompt notice shall not
affect the Companys obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the
Company is actually and materially prejudiced by such failure. The Company
shall have the right to represent the interests of the Transferred Companies
before the relevant Taxing Authority with respect to any Tax Matter
relating solely to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (a " _Pre-Closing Tax Matter_ ")
and shall have the right to control the defense, compromise or other
resolution of any such Pre-Closing Tax Matter, including responding to
inquiries, filing Tax Returns and contesting, defending against and resolving
any assessment for additional Taxes or notice of Tax deficiency or other
adjustment of Taxes of, or relating to, such Straddle Period Tax Matter,
_provided_ that the Company provides the Buyer with written notice of its
election to control such Pre-Closing Tax Matter within 21 days of receipt of
notice thereof (or such earlier date, if the failure to assume the defense on
such earlier date would materially impair the ability of the Buyer to defend
such Pre-Closing Tax Matter). If the Company does not timely elect to control
a Pre-Closing Tax Matter pursuant to this _Section 10.4(d)_, the Buyer shall
be entitled to control such Pre-Closing Tax Matter. With respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Matter that the Company timely elects to control pursuant to this
_Section 10.4(d)_, (i) the Buyer shall have the right (but not the duty) to
participate in the defense of such Pre-Closing Tax Matter and to employ
counsel, at its own expense, separate from counsel employed by the Company,
(ii) the Company shall not enter into any settlement of or otherwise
compromise any such Pre-Closing 

 



86  Tax Matter to the extent that it adversely affects the Tax liability of the
Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Transferred Companies) without
the prior written consent of the Buyer, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed and (iii) the Company will, in good faith,
consider the reasonable direction of the Buyer regarding the conduct of or
positions taken in any such Pre-Closing Period Tax Matter. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, the Buyer shall have the right to represent
the interests of the Transferred Companies before the relevant Taxing
Authority with respect to any Tax Matter that does not relate solely to any
a Pre-Closing Tax Period (a " _Straddle Period Tax Matter_ ") and shall have
the right to control the defense, compromise or other resolution of any such
Straddle Period Tax Matter, including responding to inquiries, filing
Tax Returns and contesting, defending against and resolving any assessment
for additional Taxes or notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes
of, or relating to, such Straddle Period Tax Matter. With respect to any
Straddle Period Tax Matter, (i) the Company shall have the right (but not the
duty) to participate in the defense of such Straddle Period Tax Matter and to
employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from counsel employed by the
Buyer, (ii) the Buyer shall not enter into any settlement of or otherwise
compromise any such Straddle Period Tax Matter to the extent that it adversely
affects the Tax liability of the Company (including any obligation to
indemnify the Buyer for Taxes under this Agreement) without the prior written
consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, and (iii) the Buyer will, in good faith, consider the reasonable
direction of the Company regarding the conduct of or positions taken in any
such Straddle Period Tax Matter. In the event of any conflict between this
_Section 10.4(d)_ and _Article XI_ , this _Section 10.4(d)_ shall control.

 

(e) _Amendment of Tax Returns; No Section 338 Election_. Unless required by
applicable Law, neither Buyer, the Transferred Companies, nor any of their
Affiliates shall amend, refile, revoke or otherwise modify any Tax Return or
Tax election of a Transferred Company with respect to a tax period ending on
or prior to the Initial Closing Date applicable to such Transferred Company
without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Neither Buyer, the Transferred Companies,
nor any of their Affiliates shall make any election under Section 338 of the
Code (or any similar election under state, local or foreign Law) with respect
to the Contemplated Transactions.

(f) _Value Added Tax_.

(i) All amounts payable by the Buyer (or an Affiliate of the Buyer) to the
Company (or an Asset Seller) under this Agreement or any of the Local
Transfer Documents in respect of or otherwise apportioned to any of the
Transferred Assets are exclusive of VAT, goods and services, harmonized sales,
value added, sales, use or other similar transfer Taxes. Subject to _Section
10.4(f)(iii)_, if any such payment constitutes the whole or any part of the
consideration for a taxable supply for the purposes of VAT (whether or not
that supply is taxable pursuant to the exercise of an option or the making of
any election) by an Asset Seller to the Buyer (or an Affiliate of the Buyer),
the Buyer shall, in addition to the amount so payable, pay to the Company (or,
if the Company shall direct, to the relevant Asset Seller) the following
amount upon receipt of an appropriate and valid VAT invoice: (A) in the case
of VAT chargeable in the European Union or Australia, to the extent that the
VAT properly chargeable would not have arisen but for a breach of
the representation in _Section 5.10(a)_ or but for the Buyer (or its
applicable

 



87  Affiliate), not becoming registered under an applicable Law with respect to
VAT on or after the applicable Closing in a manner that would avoid VAT being
imposed, the full amount of such VAT; and (B) in any other case, an amount
equal to 50% of the amount of VAT properly chargeable that is irrecoverable by
the Buyer (or an Affiliate of the Buyer) _plus_ an amount equal to the amount
of VAT properly chargeable that is recoverable by the Buyer (or an Affiliate
of the Buyer).

(ii) Where reimbursement or indemnification for any cost or expenses is
required to be made by a Party under this Agreement or any of the Local
Transfer Documents in respect of or otherwise apportioned to any of the
Transferred Assets, such Party shall reimburse or indemnify for the full
amount of such cost or expense, excluding such part thereof as represents
recoverable VAT.

(iii) Relying on the representations and undertakings of the Company in
_Section 4.12_, the Buyer and, relying on the representations and
undertakings of the Buyer given in _Section 5.10_, the Company each consider
that the sale of the UK Asset Class by the Seller of the UK Asset Class to
the Buyer (or an Affiliate of the Buyer) with a view to the Buyer (or an
Affiliate of the Buyer) carrying on the UK part of the Business is one to
which the provisions of Article 5 of the VAT Order applies and accordingly
the Seller of the UK Asset Class will not seek to charge any VAT in respect of
the sale unless HMRC rules in writing that it is required to do so.

(iv) The Company and the Seller of the UK Asset Class will use all reasonable
endeavors to procure that the sale of the UK Asset Class is treated as a TOGC
by HMRC but will not request (whether formally or informally) from HMRC a
confirmation that the sale under this Agreement is one to which Article 5 of
the VAT Order applies. If the Company or the Seller of the UK Asset Class
becomes aware of any circumstance that indicates that HMRC considers or may
consider that the sale under this Agreement is one to which that Article does
not apply, it shall as soon as practicable after becoming so aware notify the
Buyer of that fact and will take such reasonable action as the Buyer may
request to ensure that HMRC agrees that the sale is one to which that Article
does in fact apply.

(v) The Buyer (or its applicable Affiliate), upon request, shall pay the
Seller of the UK Asset Class an amount equal to the following proportion of
any interest or penalties assessed by HMRC on that Seller as a result of the
transfer of the UK Asset Class not falling within Article 5 of the VAT Order
and that Seller having a liability to account for VAT to HMRC as a result,
except to the extent that such interest or penalties arise from that Sellers
failure to pay the VAT to HMRC promptly after receiving the amount of such
VAT in cash from the Buyer (or its applicable Affiliate): (A) 100%, in the
case of VAT chargeable in the European Union or Australia, where that transfer
would have fallen within Article 5 of the VAT Order but for a breach of the
representation in _Section 5.10(a)_ (or, in respect of the application of
_Section 10.4(f)(viii)_ to this subsection (v), but for the Buyer (or its
applicable Affiliate), not becoming registered under an applicable Law with
respect to VAT on or after the applicable Closing in a manner that would avoid
VAT being imposed); and (B) 50%, in all other cases.

 



88 (vi) If, nevertheless, any VAT is payable on the sale of the UK Asset
Class under this Agreement and HMRC have confirmed the same in writing after
full disclosure of all material facts, the Seller of the UK Asset Class shall
promptly deliver to the Buyer (or its applicable Affiliate) a proper VAT
invoice in respect of the VAT payable and the provisions of _Section
10.4(f)(i)_ shall apply to such VAT payable.

(vii) If the Buyer (or its applicable Affiliate) pays the Seller of the UK
Asset Class an amount in respect of VAT under paragraph (v) above and HMRC
note that all or part of it was not properly chargeable, the Seller of the UK
Asset Class shall repay the amount or relevant part of it to the Buyer (or
its applicable Affiliate). The Seller of the UK Asset Class shall make the
repayment promptly after the ruling, unless it has already accounted to HMRC
for the VAT. In that case, the Seller of the UK Asset Class shall apply for a
refund of the VAT (plus any interest payable by HMRC), use reasonable
endeavours to obtain it as promptly as practicable, and pay to the Buyer (or
its applicable Affiliate) the amount of the refund and any interest as soon
as reasonably practicable after and to the extent received from HMRC.

(viii) Where any relief from VAT on the transfer of assets as a going concern
analogous to that provided in the United Kingdom by Article 5 of the VAT Order
is available in any other of the countries and territories identified on
_Schedule B_ , to the extent consistent with the applicable Law, the
provisions of subparagraphs (iii)  (vii) above shall apply as between the
Company, the Seller of that Asset Class in that jurisdiction and the Buyer
(and any relevant Affiliate of Buyer) to the Asset Class in that jurisdiction
to the same extent as those provision apply as between the Company, the Seller
of the UK Asset Class and the Buyer (and any relevant Affiliate of Buyer) to
the UK Asset Class, and references to HMRC and Article 5 of the VAT Order in
subparagraphs (iii)  (vii) above shall be treated as references to the
relevant Taxing Authority and relevant Law in that jurisdiction respectively.

 

(ix) The Company will preserve (or cause the relevant Asset Seller to
preserve) any VAT Records for such period as may be required by Law (and, in
any event, for not less than six (6) years from the applicable Closing).
Subject to being given reasonable notice by the Buyer, the Company will make
(or cause the relevant Asset Seller to make) those VAT Records available to
the Buyer or its agents for inspection and copying (at the Buyers expense).

Section 10.5 _Bulk Sales Laws_. The Company and the Buyer each waive
compliance with any bulk sales Laws applicable to the sale of the Transferred
Assets or the transfer of the Business to the Buyer and/or its Affiliates.

 

Section 10.6 _Section 56.4 Election_. If requested by the Company, Buyer (or
such Affiliate thereof that purchases the shares of Canada Newco) and Harris
Canada (and/or one or more Affiliates thereof) shall make and file any
elections or amended elections in prescribed form (or such other form as such
Party may reasonably request) and within the prescribed time limits pursuant
to proposed section 56.4 of the Canadian ITA as it reads on the date of this
Agreement or any amended or successor provision hereto, and any analogous
provision of provincial or territorial Tax legislation to ensure that no
amount is included in the income of the Company or any Affiliate in respect
of any "restrictive covenant" pursuant so such provisions

 



89  and no separate amount shall be allocated or payable in respect any such
covenant pursuant to _Section 3.8_ or ___Schedule 3.8_ __.

 

Section 10.7 _Accounts Receivable_. The Company shall, and shall cause the
other Sellers to, promptly forward or cause to be forwarded to the Buyer (or
any Transferred Company designated by the Buyer) any and all proceeds from
accounts receivable of the Business that are received by any of the Sellers or
their Affiliates on or after the Initial Closing (or, in the case of any
Remaining Asset Class, the Subsequent Closing with respect to such Remaining
Asset Class), less any amount of VAT for which any of the Sellers or their
Affiliates are required to account for to the relevant Taxing Authority, and
the Buyer shall promptly forward or cause to be forwarded to the Company any
and all proceeds from accounts receivable to the extent relating to any
business of the Company or its Affiliates other than the Business that are
received by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates after the Closing Date.

Section 10.8 _Insurance Matters_.

 

(a) Following the Initial Closing, the Company agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to make (and to cause its Subsidiaries, including the
Sellers, to make) available to the Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including,
after the Closing, the Transferred Companies) coverage under all insurance
policies maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including the
Sellers) that may provide coverage for any previously unasserted claims
relating in any way to the Business or the Transferred Companies prior to the
Closing and which policies are not Benefit Plans (the " _Seller Insurance
Policies_ "). In the event of an occurrence which may be covered by one or
more Seller Insurance Policies, the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries may,
after consultation with the Company, submit a claim that has not previously
been submitted for such occurrence to the appropriate insurer under the
applicable Seller Insurance Policy (a " _Buyer Insurance Claim_ "). Upon
request of the Buyer, the Company agrees to provide (and to cause each of its
Subsidiaries (including the Sellers) to provide) reasonable assistance in
connection with the pursuit of such Buyer Insurance Claim with each applicable
insurer, including, as requested, submitting such claim on behalf of the
Company or a Seller (as applicable), acting as the direct contact with such
insurer and using commercially reasonable efforts to pursue such claim on
behalf of the Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred
Companies), regardless of any other insurance coverage that may be applicable.
The Buyer shall indemnify the Company and the other Seller Indemnified
Parties for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including
reasonable legal expenses, incurred by the Company and the other Seller
Indemnified Parties in providing such assistance in pursuing such claim for
coverage as directed by and on behalf of the Buyer and its Subsidiaries.
Subject to the next sentence, any proceeds from a Buyer Insurance Claim
received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Sellers)
shall be paid promptly to the Buyer Indemnified Person that caused such Buyer
Insurance Claim to be filed, after the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
taken from such proceeds any of its or their unpaid reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred in pursuing such claim on behalf of such Buyer
Indemnified Person. Without in any way limiting or amending any other rights
that the Buyer or any other Buyer Indemnified Person may have under this
Agreement or any Transaction Document ( _e.g._ , because the matter giving
rise to such claim is a matter for which the Buyer is entitled to
indemnification in accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the matter
giving rise to such claim, the Buyer Indemnified Person that is causing the
Buyer Insurance Claim to be made will be

 



90  responsible for satisfying any applicable deductible, self-insured retention
or similar payment (including by reimbursing the Company or the applicable
Seller for any such deductible, retention or similar payment made thereby
that was not previously satisfied prior to the claim being submitted) owed by
the Company or any Seller under the applicable Seller Insurance Policy for any
claim against the Seller Policies pursued by or at the request of such Buyer
Indemnified Person. In the event that, as a result of a payment of a Buyer
Insurance Claim by an insurer, the applicable Seller Insurance Policy requires
that the insured subrogate its claim to such insurer, the Buyer Indemnified
Person shall take reasonable actions to subrogate such Buyer Insurance Claim
to such insurer. Nothing in this _Section 10.8(a)_ shall (i) be deemed to be
a representation or warranty from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates that insurance coverage is available to the Buyer or the
Transferred Companies following the Initial Closing or (ii) require the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to obtain or renew, or pay
any additional premiums to maintain, any insurance policy. The parties
acknowledge that none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
has solicited or will be required to solicit any consent to assign any such
Seller Insurance Policies to the Buyer or any of its Affiliates.

(b) For a period of six years after the occurrence of the applicable Closing,
the Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any Transferred Company to amend,
repeal or modify any provision in such Transferred Companys articles of
incorporation or bylaws (or such applicable jurisdictional equivalent)
relating to the exculpation or indemnification of any current or former
officer or director (unless required by Law), it being the intent of the
parties that the officers and directors of the Transferred Companies shall
continue to be entitled to such exculpation and indemnification to the
fullest extent of the Law. If the Buyer or any Transferred Company or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall
transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Buyer and the Transferred Company shall assume
all of the obligations set forth in this _Section 10.8(b)_. The provisions of
this _Section 10.8(b)_ are intended for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each current and former officer and director of the
Transferred Companies and his or her heirs and representatives, and are in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such person may have had by contract or otherwise.

ARTICLE XI

INDEMNIFICATION

Section 11.1 _Indemnification by the Company_. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this _ARTICLE XI_ , following the Initial Closing the
Company shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buyer and its Affiliates
and their respective Representatives, successors and permitted assigns
(collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Persons_ ") from and against, and
shall reimburse the Buyer Indemnified Persons for, all Damages sustained,
incurred or suffered by any Buyer Indemnified Person resulting from, based
upon or arising out of:

(a) any misrepresentation, breach, or inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty of the Company contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement or any
certificate delivered to the Buyer (as of the date hereof or at any Closing)
pursuant hereto, which misrepresentation, breach, 

 



91  or inaccuracy shall be determined for purposes of this _Section 11.1_
without regard and without giving effect to any "material", "materiality"
or "Material Adverse Effect" or similar standard or qualification contained
therein (as if such standard or qualification were deleted from such
representation or warranty);

 

(b) any breach or any default or failure in the performance of any agreement,
covenant or obligation of the Company set forth in this Agreement;

(c) any Excluded Liability (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Excluded Liability included in a Transferred Company);

(d) (i) any Taxes of the Transferred Companies attributable to or in respect
of any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Pre-Closing Straddle Period, excluding for
the avoidance of doubt any Taxes of Canada Newco which arise as a result of
any Canadian Tax election described in _Section 7.7_ hereof, and (ii) any
Taxes for which any Transferred Company is liable under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-6 (or under any similar provision of state, local or non-U.S.
Law), as transferee or successor, by Contract or otherwise in each case, (A)
with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Pre-Closing Straddle Period or
(B) by reason of being a member of a consolidated, affiliated, combined or
other group for Tax purposes at any time before the Closing;

 

(e) Any claims arising from any failure by any Asset Seller to comply with its
obligations to inform and consult with Transferred Employees in any
jurisdiction under applicable Transfer Regulations except to the extent that
such claim arises solely by reason of either (i) a failure by the Buyer or any
of its Affiliates to provide details of measures it or its
Affiliates anticipate or propose to take (provided always that the relevant
Asset Seller has provided the Buyer or its Affiliate with the information it
requires to assess what measures it will propose), or (ii) other act or
omission of the Buyer or its Affiliates, in relation to any of the
Transferred Employees;

(f) any Assumed Liabilities under  _Section 2.3(a)(ii)_ in relation to
Environmental Liabilities arising out of or relating to (i) contamination by
Hazardous Substances, existing prior to the Initial Closing Date, on, under or
migrating to or from the Real Property, or (ii) any failure prior to the
Initial Closing Date to be in compliance with Environmental Permits or
Environmental Laws in connection with the operation of the Business at any
Real Property; and

 

(g) with respect to the matters set forth on _Schedule 11.1(g)_.

 

Section 11.2 _Indemnification by the Buyer_. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this _ARTICLE XI_ , following the Initial Closing the
Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Sellers, their Affiliates
and their respective Representatives, successors and permitted assigns
(collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Persons_ ") from and against, and
shall reimburse the Seller Indemnified Persons for, all Damages sustained,
incurred or suffered by the Seller Indemnified Persons resulting from, based
upon or arising out of:

 

(a) any misrepresentation, breach, or inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty of the Buyer contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement or any
certificate delivered to the Company pursuant hereto, which misrepresentation,
breach, or inaccuracy shall be determined

 



92  for purposes of this _Section 11.2_ without regard and without giving
effect to any "material", "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect"
or similar standard or qualification contained therein (as if such standard
or qualification were deleted from such representation or warranty);

(b) any breach or any default or failure in the performance of any agreement,
covenant or obligation of the Buyer set forth in this Agreement;

 

(c) any Assumed Liability (only to the extent, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Company does not have an obligation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Buyer Indemnified Persons pursuant to _Section 11.1_); and

(d) any TUPE Claims. 

Section 11.3 _Direct Claims_. In the event the Company or the Buyer or any
other Person entitled to be indemnified hereunder (the " _Claimant_ ")
desires to make a claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 11.1_ or
_Section 11.2_ hereof against the Company or the Buyer, as applicable,
the Claimant shall give prompt written notice of the claim to the Indemnitor,
describing in reasonable detail the nature of the claim and the basis on which
the Indemnitor has liability for the claim under this Agreement. Failure to
give such notice shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder
except to the extent that such failure shall have actually prejudiced the
Indemnitor as a result thereof.

Section 11.4 _Matters Involving Third Parties, Etc_. (a) If any Action is
instituted or any claim or demand is made by a Person (a " _Third Party Claim_
") against an indemnified party hereunder (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") that
(if prosecuted successfully) would be a matter for which such Indemnified
Party is entitled to indemnification under this _ARTICLE XI_ and a claim for
indemnification under this _ARTICLE XI_ (an " _Indemnification Claim_ ") is to
be made against the party from which indemnification is sought (the "
_Indemnitor_ "), such Indemnified Party shall give written notice as soon as
reasonably practicable to such Indemnitor requesting such indemnification and
specifying in reasonable detail the basis (to the extent then determinable) on
which indemnification is sought. The failure to notify the Indemnitor shall
not relieve the Indemnitor of any duty to indemnify which otherwise might
exist with regard to such claim unless (and only to the extent that) such
failure to notify actually prejudices the Indemnitor as a result thereof. The
Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnitor, as soon as reasonably
practicable, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers)
received from third parties by such Indemnified Party relating to any such
Third Party Claim. 

(b) If a Third Party Claim is made or commenced and an Indemnification Claim
is made with respect thereto, the Indemnitor shall have the right, upon
giving written notice to the Indemnified Party, to participate in the defense
of such claim (to the extent permissible under Law) or to assume the defense
of such Third Party Claim, at its own expense through an attorney selected by
the Indemnitor and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party; _provided_
, that, as a condition to such assumption, the Indemnitor shall deliver
written notice of such assumption to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30)
days of receipt of notice of such claim by the Indemnified Party; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Indemnitor shall not have the right to control such
defense if the claim (i) seeks non-monetary relief, (ii) involves criminal or
quasi-criminal allegations, (iii) the amount of indemnification available to
the Indemnified Party under this _ARTICLE XI_ (after taking into account the
limitations in _Section 11.5_) with respect to such

 



93  Third-Party Claim (net of the amount of any other pending claims against the
Indemnitor) does not exceed 50% of the Damages reasonably likely to arise from
such Third-Party Claim, or (iv) is not being vigorously prosecuted or
defended by the Indemnitor; _provided_ , _further_ that any Indemnitor shall
continue to be entitled to assert any limitation on any claims in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement. If the Indemnitor elects to assume the
defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will be entitled to
participate in the defense of such claim and to employ separate counsel of its
choice; _provided_ that the Indemnitor will not be liable to the Indemnified
Party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with such defense (other than reasonable out-
of-pocket costs of investigation); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Indemnifying Party
shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of separate counsel of the
Indemnified Party (and shall pay such fees, costs and expenses at least
quarterly) if the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that
there may be a conflict of interest (including one or more legal defenses or
counterclaims available to it which are different from or in addition to those
available to the Indemnifying Party) that would make it inappropriate, in the
reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party, for the same counsel to
represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party. For purposes
of determining whether the indemnification available to the Indemnified Party
exceeds 50% of the Damages reasonably likely to arise from such Third Party
Claim under clause (iii) above, the "Damages reasonably likely to arise from
such Third Party Claim" shall include both Damages sought to be obtained from
the Indemnified Party and Damages sought to be obtained from the Indemnifying
Party.

(c) If the Indemnitor elects to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim,
(i) the Indemnified Party will (at the expense of the Indemnitor) reasonably
cooperate and make available to the Indemnitor (and its representatives),
during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice, all employees
and such information, books and records in its possession or under its control
as may be reasonably necessary or useful in connection with such defense and
(ii) the Indemnitor shall have the right to compromise and settle in good
faith any such claim; _provided_ that the Indemnitor must obtain the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party (which will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) prior to entering into any settlement of
any claim or Action, consenting to the entry of any Order with respect to such
claim or Action or ceasing to defend any claim or Action. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have no obligation of any kind
to consent to the entrance of any Order, cessation of the defense of any
claim or a consent to any settlement or the entry of any judgment if (w)
pursuant to or as a result of such settlement, judgment or cessation money
damages would be payable by the Indemnified Party, (x) pursuant to or as a
result of such settlement, judgment or cessation, injunctive or other
equitable relief will be imposed against the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates, (y) such release or settlement does not contain an express and
unconditional release of the Indemnified Party and its applicable Affiliates
from all Liabilities with respect to such claim without prejudice, or (z) such
Order, settlement or cessation would be reasonably expected, in the good
faith judgment of the Indemnified Party, to establish a precedent, custom or
practice materially adverse to the continuing business interests or prospects
of the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates.

 

(d) If the Indemnitor does not elect to assume the defense of a Third Party
Claim, (i) the Indemnified Party shall have the right to conduct such
defense, (ii) the Indemnified Party may only consent to entry of any judgment
upon, or compromise and settle in good faith any

 



94  such Third Party Claim, with the prior written consent of the Indemnitor
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
_provided_ _however_ , that no such consent will be required if the
Indemnified Party waives its right to indemnification with respect to the
Damages arising from such settlement and no liability shall be imposed on the
Indemnitor or any of its Affiliates with respect to such Third Party Claim,
and (iii) if it is ultimately determined that the claim of loss which shall
form the basis of such judgment or settlement is one that is validly an
obligation of the Indemnitor that elected not to assume the defense, then
such Indemnitor shall be bound by any ultimate judgment or settlement as to
the existence and the amount of the claim and the amount of said judgment or
settlement (including the costs and expenses of defending such claims) shall
be conclusively deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to be a liability
on account of which the Indemnified Party is entitled to be indemnified
hereunder, subject to any limits on the right to be so indemnified hereunder.
Upon the determination of liability under and subject to _Section 11.1_ or
_Section 11.2_ hereof, the Indemnitor shall within ten Business Days of such
determination, pay the amount of such claim by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account(s) designated by the Indemnified Party.

Section 11.5 _Limitations, Etc_. (a) Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the liability of the Indemnitor to indemnify the
Indemnified Party against any Damages shall be limited to indemnification
claims with respect to which the Indemnified Party has given to the Indemnitor
written notice thereof at or prior to the expiration of the applicable
survival period, if any, as set forth in _Section 11.12_.

(b) (i) The Company shall not have any Liability under _Section 11.1(a)_
unless and until the aggregate amount of all Damages relating thereto for
which the Company would, but for this sentence, be liable under _Section
11.1(a)_ exceeds on a cumulative basis $1,800,000 in the aggregate (the "
_Threshold Amount_ "), in which case the Company shall be liable for all such
Damages in excess of the Threshold Amount. For purposes of determining any
Liability under _Section 11.1(a)_, including for purposes of calculating
Damages pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall not
have any Liability for any Damages in respect of any misrepresentation,
breach or inaccuracy unless and until the aggregate amount of such Damages
relating to a single claim (or a group of claims relating to the same facts or
circumstances, event or transaction) exceeds $75,000 (the " _Mini-Basket_ ").
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the limitations set forth in
this _Section 11.5(b)(i)_ shall not apply with respect to any
misrepresentation, breach or inaccuracy of any Fundamental Representation or
any representation or warranty in _Section 4.6(d)_.

(ii) The Company shall not have any obligation to pay, in respect of Damages
indemnifiable pursuant to _Section 11.1(a)_, an amount in excess of
$17,500,000 (the " _Cap_ "); _provided_ that the Cap shall not apply with
respect to any misrepresentation, breach or inaccuracy of any Fundamental
Representation. The Company shall not have any obligation to pay, in respect
of Damages indemnifiable pursuant to _Section 11.1(f)_ or  _Section
11.1(g)_, an amount in excess of the Purchase Price.

(iii) Subject to  _Section 11.7_, the Company shall not have any Liability
under _Section 11.1(a)_ with respect to any misrepresentation, breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty in _Section 4.6(d)_ unless and
until the aggregate amount of all Damages for which the Company would, but for
this sentence, be liable under _Section 11.1(a)_ for all misrepresentations,
breaches or inaccuracies of any representation or 

 



95  warranty under _Section 4.6(d)_ exceeds in the aggregate $250,000, in which
case the Company shall be liable for all such Damages.

 

(iv) The Buyer shall not have any obligation to pay, in respect of Damages
indemnifiable pursuant to _Sections 11.2(a)_ or _11.2(b)_ , an amount in
excess of the Purchase Price.

(c) The Indemnified Party shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate damages
in respect of any claim for which it is seeking indemnification and shall use
reasonable efforts to avoid any costs or expenses associated with such claim,
and, if such costs and expenses cannot be avoided, to minimize the amount
thereof.

(d) The Indemnified Partys right to indemnification with respect to any
Damages shall be reduced by (i) the amount actually received by the
Indemnified Party from an unaffiliated third party (including an insurance
company), net of any deductibles, coinsurance or cost of recovery, (ii) the
amount paid by such third party to another for the account or benefit of the
Indemnified Party, with respect to the settlement or resolution of a claim for
which the Indemnified Party was entitled to be reimbursed hereunder, (iii) the
amount of any Tax benefit actually realized by such Indemnified Party in the
taxable year in which such Damages are incurred by way of a reduction in the
amount of Taxes payable by such Indemnified Party, which reduction is directly
attributable to any deduction, loss, credit or other Tax benefit resulting
from or arising out of such Damage, as determined on a "with and without"
basis or (iv) the amount of any reserves or accruals on the books of the
Business as of the Final Closing Date in respect of such matter if and to the
extent (A) such reserves or accruals were reflected in any Final Closing
Certificate and (B) the Buyer has already been compensated by reason of the
specific inclusion of such Damages in the calculation of Cash,
Closing Indebtedness or Closing Working Capital resulting in a reduction of
the Purchase Price relative to what the Purchase Price otherwise would have
been absent such Damages.

(e) UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL THE COMPANY, THE OTHER SELLERS OR THE BUYER
BE LIABLE UNDER THIS _ARTICLE XI_ FOR ANY SPECIAL DAMAGES OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES,
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT SUCH DAMAGES ARE AWARDED TO A THIRD PARTY.

(f) Neither party shall be entitled to recover any indemnification payment or
other amounts due from the other party hereunder by retaining and setting off
the amounts (whether or not such amounts are liquidated or reduced to
judgment) against any amounts due or to become due from such party hereunder
or under any document delivered pursuant hereto or in connection herewith.

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect
to any claim pursuant to _Section 11.1(a) _(with respect to a breach of
_Section 4.13_) and _Section 11.1(f)_ with respect to Response Action costs
incurred in relation to any contamination by Hazardous Substances existing
prior to the Initial Closing on, under or migrating to or from the Real
Property, no Buyer Indemnified Person shall be entitled to recover such costs
otherwise subject to indemnification under _Section 11.1(a) _(with respect
to a breach of _Section 4.13_) and _Section 11.1(f)_ unless such Response
Action is required under applicable Environmental Laws or by Order of a
Governmental Body (including in connection with, or with respect to a
settlement of,

 



96  a Third-Party Claim) to attain compliance with minimum remedial standards
applicable under Environmental Laws for continued industrial or commercial use
(as the case may be) of the relevant property or facility, employing where
applicable risk-based remedial standards, deed restrictions and institutional
and engineering controls, where such restrictions, standards or controls would
not unreasonably restrict, limit, or interfere with operations at the
relevant property or facility and the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall
reasonably cooperate with the Company to execute and file such documents as
may be necessary to implement the foregoing controls and restrictions in
relation to any such Response Action performed by or on behalf of Buyer
Indemnified Persons or by or on behalf of the Company. Furthermore, no Buyer
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to indemnification with respect to any
Damages pursuant to  _Section 11.1(a) _(with respect to a breach of _Section
4.13_) and _Section 11.1(f) _to the extent arising from (i) any contamination
identified through any intrusive or subsurface investigations (including
excavations, drilling, boring and sampling) of soil or groundwater performed
by or on behalf of any Buyer Indemnified Person (or by a Person that is not a
Governmental Body that the Buyer expressly allows to conduct
such investigations) unless such investigation is (A) required to comply with
Environmental Laws or is reasonably necessary to defend against a Third-Party
Claim, (B) required or ordered by a Governmental Body, (C) undertaken in
connection with any maintenance or repair activities conducted at any
facility, or as part of expansion or modification of any facility, but only if
conditions observed during such maintenance, repair, expansion or modification
activities suggest, in the reasonable judgment of the Buyer, the actual
presence of a greater than _de minimis_ amount or release of any Hazardous
Substance or would reasonably and customarily require sampling to protect
construction and maintenance works, (D) reasonably determined by the Buyer in
good faith to be necessary in connection with any closure or shutting down of,
or material suspension or modification of the historical operations at, any
facility or property (or parcel thereof), but only if conditions observed
during such shutting down, material suspension or modification of operations
suggests, in the reasonable opinion of the Buyer, the actual presence of a
greater than _de minimis_ amount or release of any Hazardous Substance or
would reasonably and customarily require sampling to protect construction and
maintenance workers, or (E) approved by the Company in writing, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall have no obligation to approve any such
request where in the reasonable judgment of the Company the primary business
justification for the proposed soil or groundwater sampling would be
to identify Environmental Liabilities that are subject to the Companys
indemnification obligations hereunder, (ii) the solicitation (not otherwise
required under applicable Environmental Laws) by any Buyer Indemnified Person
of any Governmental Body to seek or require any Buyer Indemnified Person to
perform a Response Action at any Real Property that is not otherwise required
under applicable Environmental Laws, or (iii) the incremental increase in
Response Actions costs arising from a Response Action associated with a
change of the current industrial or commercial use (as the case may be) of the
relevant property or facility to a use (such as residential) that is subject
to more stringent cleanup standards than such current use. The Company shall
have no obligation to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Person with respect to
Damages to the extent arising from any contribution of contamination at any
Real Property associated with additional spills and releases occurring after
the Closing Date (provided that any such contribution of contamination after
the Initial Closing Date shall not negate or reduce the Companys
indemnification obligations hereunder to the extent arising from any
contamination existing at any Real Property prior to the Initial Closing
Date). To the extent that on-site groundwater has not been withdrawn at any
Real Property for consumption or for use in any

 



97  process over the past two (2) years, is not currently being withdrawn for
such purposes, and there are no plans as of the date hereof by the Company or
the Business to do so, in no event shall it be deemed reasonable, for
purposes of this _Section 11.5(g)_, for the "industrial" use or operation of
the relevant property or facility to involve the withdrawal of on-site
groundwater for consumption or for use in any process. The Company shall have
the right, in its sole discretion, to control and conduct any such Response
Action and any related communications with any Governmental Bodies or third
parties, including the right, in the Companys sole discretion, to proceed
under any applicable voluntary cleanup program notwithstanding that a Response
Action may not be required under applicable Environmental Laws; _provided_
that no such Response Action or related communications shall unreasonably
interfere with operations at (or impede any Buyer Indemnified Persons ability
to comply with Environmental Laws and Environmental Permits in respect of) the
relevant facility or property or result in any Damages for which any Buyer
Indemnified Person has any liability not subject to indemnification hereunder
(except that any current Response Action at the Quincy, Illinois Real Property
shall be deemed to not unreasonably interfere with operations by any Buyer
Indemnified Person at such Real Property); and _provided_ _further_ that the
Company utilizes environmental contractors reasonably acceptable to the Buyer
(provided that any contractors being used in the six months prior to the
Initial Closing shall be deemed acceptable, subject to any material changes
in facts or circumstances demonstrating that such contractors should be
replaced) and provides the Buyer with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on any proposed Response Action prior to implementation and final
drafts of documents prepared for submission to any Governmental Body or other
third party prior to submittal (and utilizes in good faith reasonable efforts
to accommodate any reasonable comments provided by the Buyer), and the Buyer
Indemnified Persons will provide all reasonable access during normal operating
hours to all of the Real Property, facilities, books and records as the
Company may reasonably request to the extent necessary to complete such
Response Action consistent with applicable Environmental Laws, including use
of any wastewater treatment systems and utilities located at the Real Property
(subject to reimbursement by the Company for the reasonable pro rata costs of
the Companys usage of such systems and utilities, and provided that such use
does not unreasonably interfere with operations at (or impede any Buyer
Indemnified Persons ability to comply with Environmental Laws and
Environmental Permits in respect of) the relevant facility or property). If
any of the Buyer Indemnified Persons sells, leases or transfers any Real
Property or assigns its rights to indemnification hereunder (to the extent
permitted to do so under _Section 13.8_) with respect to any Response Action
at the Real Property, the Company shall have no liability for any Damages to
the extent arising from any activities of such subsequent purchasers, lessees,
transferees or assignees which if performed by any Buyer Indemnified Person
would negate or reduce the Companys indemnification obligations pursuant to
this _Section 11.5(g)_.

Section 11.6 _Specific Performance_. The parties acknowledge and agree that
the breach of this Agreement by a party would cause irreparable damage to the
other party and the party would not have an adequate remedy at law for such
breach. Therefore, the obligations of the parties under this Agreement,
including the Companys obligation to sell the Transferred Assets to the Buyer
and retain the Excluded Liability and the Buyers obligation to purchase the
Transferred Assets and to perform and satisfy the Assumed Liabilities, shall
be enforceable by specific performance, and appropriate injunctive relief may
be applied for and granted in connection therewith without the posting of any
bond. Such remedies shall, however, be

 



98  cumulative and not exclusive and shall be in addition to any other remedies
which a party may have under this Agreement.

Section 11.7 _Transfer of Assets; Sufficiency of Assets Representation_.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, but subject to the
limitations of this  _ARTICLE XI_, following the Initial Closing, the
parties agree that with respect to (a) any material misrepresentation, breach
or inaccuracy of the representation or warranty of the Company contained in 
_Section 4.6(d)_ or (b) any material breach or any material default in the
performance of any covenant or obligation of the Company set forth in _Section
2.1_, prior to seeking to obtain a replacement asset, right or property, the
Buyer shall provide written notice thereof to the Company, and if the
applicable Seller confirms in writing within five (5) Business Days thereafter
its commitment to deliver such asset, right or property and within
a reasonable time transfers to the Buyer such asset, right or property to
cure such material misrepresentation, breach or inaccuracy or such material
breach or material default, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall then be
relieved of any Damages for the cost of such delivered asset, right or
property; _provided_ _however_ , that nothing herein shall relieve the Company
of its obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties for any Damages
arising due to any delay in transferring such assets, rights or properties or
otherwise, except to the extent that Buyer, after obtaining Knowledge of such
breach, unreasonably delays notifying the Company and such unreasonable delay
materially prejudices the Company.

 

Section 11.8 _Liability_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, no claim shall be brought or maintained by any
party or any of their respective Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates
or their respective successors or permitted assigns against any Person who
proposes to lend money in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, " _Lenders_
"), or any Representative or Affiliate of the Buyer or any such Lender, (in
each case other than the Buyer and the Fund) as applicable (each of whom is
an express and intended third-party beneficiary of this _Section 11.8_, and
shall be entitled to rely on and enforce the provisions of this _Section
11.8_), which is not otherwise expressly identified as a party hereto, and no
recourse shall be brought or granted against any of them, by virtue of or
based upon any alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or breach of any of
the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth or
contained in this Agreement or any Transaction Document, Contract, Exhibit,
Schedule or certificate entered into or delivered in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing; _provided_ ,
that this _Section 11.8_ shall not be deemed to limit the rights of the Buyer
arising out of or in connection with the Financing.

 

Section 11.9 _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, following the Initial Closing, the remedies provided for in this
_ARTICLE XI_ and in _Section 10.7_ shall constitute the Buyer Indemnified
Persons and the Seller Indemnified Persons sole and exclusive remedy for any
claims (other than for fraud) made in connection with this Agreement, the
Contemplated Transactions or the ownership or operation of the Business or
Transferred Assets. OTHER THAN FOR FRAUD, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE, WITH
RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS, ALL OTHER RIGHTS
AND REMEDIES ARISING UNDER OR BASED UPON ANY STATUTORY (INCLUDING THE
COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE,

 



99  COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT, 42 U.S.C. § 9601 ET SEQ., AND OTHER
ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS) OR COMMON LAW OR OTHERWISE, AND AGREES NOT TO BRING ANY
ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS AT LAW, IN EQUITY, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING
RESCINDING THE AGREEMENT, IN RESPECT OF ANY BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS,
WARRANTIES OR OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE
CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THIS  _SECTION
11.9_ SHALL NOT OPERATE TO INTERFERE WITH OR IMPEDE THE OPERATION OF THE
PROVISIONS HEREOF PROVIDING FOR THE RESOLUTION OF CERTAIN DISPUTES BY THE
ACCOUNTANT.

 

Section 11.10 _Adjustment to Purchase Price_. Except as otherwise required by
applicable Law, any payment under this  _ARTICLE XI_ shall be treated by the
parties for Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

 

Section 11.11 _GST/HST Gross Up_. If any payment made by the Harris Canada or
Buyer pursuant to this  _ARTICLE XI_ is deemed by the _Excise Tax Act_
(Canada) to include goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax, or is deemed
by any applicable provincial or territorial legislation to include a similar
value added or multi-staged tax, the amount of such payment shall be
increased accordingly so that the party receiving indemnification is not
affected by the incidence of any such Tax.

Section 11.12 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. The
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement (other than the
Fundamental Representations) will survive for a period of fifteen (15) months
following the Initial Closing Date, and the Fundamental Representations shall
survive the Final Closing until 60 days after the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations. All causes of action and liability with respect to
such representations and warranties shall, after the expiration of the
applicable survival period, terminate and be of no further force and effect,
except as to any alleged inaccuracy or breach thereof of which a party prior
to the expiration of such period shall have advised the other party in
writing, specifying in reasonable detail the representation or warranty that
is alleged to be inaccurate or breached. The right of a party to seek
indemnification hereunder with respect to any representation or warranty of
the other party shall remain in effect for the period specified in this
_Section 11.12_ with respect to such representation or warranty. The
covenants of the Buyer and the Company (including the covenants relating to
indemnification in this _ARTICLE XI_) shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Agreement until fully performed; _provided_ , that the right
of the Buyer Indemnified Parties to seek indemnification under _Section
11.1(f)_ shall remain in effect until the date that is ninety (90) days after
the expiration of the latest applicable statute of limitations.

 

ARTICLE XII

 

TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT

Section 12.1 _Termination_. (a) This Agreement and the Contemplated
Transactions may be terminated or abandoned at any time before the Initial
Closing Date: (i) by the mutual written consent of the Company and the Buyer;
(ii) by the Company or the Buyer if any Governmental Body of competent
jurisdiction in a Material Jurisdiction shall have issued any final and
nonappealable Order prohibiting or enjoining the Contemplated Transactions;
_provided_ that either party may only exercise its right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this

 



100    _Section 12.1(a)(ii)_ if it has used commercially reasonable efforts to
prevent the entry of such Order and exhausted its rights to appeal as promptly
as possible any such Order;  _provided_ , _further_ that such right to
terminate shall not arise as a result of any failure of such party to comply
with the covenants set forth in _Section 7.1_; (iii) by the Buyer, by giving
written notice to the Company (A) if there has been a misrepresentation in
this Agreement by the Company that constitutes a Material Adverse Effect when
combined with all other such misrepresentations, or a material breach by the
Company of any of its covenants set forth herein, and such misrepresentation
or breach has not been cured within 30 days following written notice to the
Company, or (B) subject to _Section 12.1(b)_, if the Initial Closing shall
not have occurred on or before June 5, 2013 (the " _Termination Date_ "), by
reason of the failure of any condition precedent under _Article VIII_ hereof
(unless the failure results from the Buyer breaching any representation,
warranty or agreement contained in this Agreement); or (iv) by the Company,
by giving written notice to the Buyer (A) if there has been a
misrepresentation in this Agreement by the Buyer, or a breach by the Buyer of
any of its covenants set forth herein that, in either case, constitutes an
event, change, circumstance or effect that has a material adverse effect on
the ability of the Sellers or Buyer to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions, and such misrepresentation or breach has not been cured within
30 days following written notice to the Buyer, or (B) subject to _Section
12.1(b)_, if the Initial Closing shall not have occurred on or before the
Termination Date, by reason of the failure of any condition precedent under
_Article IX_ hereof (unless the failure results from the Company breaching
any representation, warranty or agreement contained in this Agreement).

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) if a Closing does not occur because it
is enjoined by a Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction or is otherwise
prevented as a consequence of an Action, the Termination Date shall be
extended until the injunction or other Order preventing such Closing is
vacated or becomes final and is either nonappealable or the time for any
such appeal has expired without an appeal having been filed; and (ii) if the
Closing does not occur because the approval of the transaction under the HSR
Act or any other Antitrust Law has not been obtained or the waiting period
pursuant thereto has not expired, either party shall have the right to extend
the Termination Date by providing notice to the other party on or prior to the
then in effect Termination Date until such approval is obtained or denied, or
such waiting period expires. In no event shall the Termination Date be
extended beyond June 5, 2014.

Section 12.2 _Obligations Upon Termination_. If this Agreement shall be
terminated pursuant to _Section 12.1(a)(i)_ or _Section 12.1(a)(ii)_ or
_Section 12.1(b)_ then neither party shall have any further liability
or obligation to the other. If the Company or the Buyer shall have terminated
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 12.1(a)(iii)_ or _Section 12.1(a)(iv)_,
then it is expressly understood and agreed that the terminating partys right
to pursue all legal remedies for breach of contract and Damages also shall
survive such termination unimpaired. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
obligations of the parties under the Confidentiality Agreement and under 
_Section 10.1_, _Section 11.6_, this ___Section 12.2_ __, __ _Section
13.1_ __, __ _Section 13.2_ __ and  __ _Section 13.14_ __, shall survive
such termination.

the purpose of such provision, and the Agreement shall otherwise remain in

Section 13.5 _No Third Party Beneficiary_. Except as provided in ___ARTICLE
XI_ __ dealing with Indemnified Parties and in ___Sections 10.8(b)_ __and __
_11.8_ __, this Agreement shall be for

 



103   the sole and exclusive benefit of the parties hereto, and nothing expressed
or implied in this Agreement is intended, nor shall be construed, to confer
upon or give any Person other than the parties hereto any rights under or by
reason of this Agreement; _provided_ , that the Lenders shall be express third
party beneficiaries of _Sections 13.2_ , _13.8(c)_ and _13.14_ , and shall be
entitled to rely on and enforce the provisions of such Sections. Other than

shall be paid by one-half by the Buyer and one-half by the Company, other than

Affiliates as an input Tax credit or refund, in which case the Buyer shall
pay all of such Taxes. All amounts payable under this Agreement are exclusive
of goods and services, harmonized sales, sales, use or other transfer Taxes
(but, for the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of  __ _Section 10.4(f)_
__shall govern the treatment of any VAT). Any Tax Returns that must be filed
in connection with any Transfer Taxes shall be prepared and timely filed by
the party responsible for filing such Tax Returns under applicable Law;
_provided_ , such party shall provide such Tax Returns to the other party for
review and comment within a reasonable period of time prior to the due date

relevant Tax Return can be timely submitted. 

Section 13.7 _Waiver_. Any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement which
may be lawfully waived may be waived in writing at any time by each party
which is entitled to the benefits thereof. Any waiver of any of the provisions
of this Agreement by any party hereto shall be binding only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Neither the waiver by a
party hereto of a breach of or a default under any one or more of the
provisions of this Agreement, nor the failure of a party, on one or more
occasions, to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise
any right or privilege hereunder shall thereafter be construed as a waiver of
any subsequent breach or default of a similar nature, or as a waiver of any
such provisions, rights or privileges hereunder. Effective as of the Initial
Closing, the Company (on behalf of itself, its Subsidiaries and its and their
successors and assigns) and the Buyer (on behalf of itself as successor to the
Business, the Transferred Companies following the occurrence of the applicable
Closing and its and their successors and assigns), hereby mutually release,
and forever discharge, in the case of the Company, each Employee (other than
with respect to actions involving fraud or for which there would be criminal
liability with respect to the Business), each Transferred Company and each of
its past, present and future Subsidiaries, Representatives (other than with
respect to actions involving fraud or for which there would be criminal
liability with respect to the Business), successors and assigns and their
respective Representatives (collectively, " _Releasees_ "), and in the case of
the

 



104   Buyer, the Buyer, the Company and its Releasees from any and all claims,
demands, proceedings, causes of action, court orders, obligations, contracts,
agreements (express or implied), debts and liabilities under or relating to
the Shares, the Transferred Companies or their respective predecessors in
interest or any of their respective businesses or assets, including any
liability with respect to fiduciary or similar duties or arising under or
pursuant to any shareholder agreement, employment or consulting agreement or
other compensation arrangement (other than agreements and arrangements entered
into between the Transferred Companies and the Company after the Closing Date)
whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, both at Law and in
equity, which the Company or the Buyer (in respect of any of the Transferred
Companies) now has, has ever had or hereafter has against the respective
Releasees as a result of any act, circumstance, occurrence, transaction,
event or omission at or prior to the Initial Closing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Company nor the Buyer shall release, and this
___Section 13.7_ __shall not be deemed to affect, any claim of the Company
or its Affiliates or the Buyer or its Affiliates with respect to any
obligation of the Buyer or Company pursuant to this Agreement or any
Transaction Document.

 

Section 13.8 _Assignment; Amendment_. (a) The Buyer shall not assign any of
its rights or obligations under this Agreement whether by written agreement
or by operation of Law (including by merger or sale of all or substantially
all assets), without the prior written consent of the Company (which consent,
after the Initial Closing, will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed); _provided_ , _however_ , the Buyer is entitled to assign any or all
of (i) its rights and delegate any or all of its obligations hereunder to one
or more of its Affiliates or in connection with the sale or transfer of all
or substantially all of the Business or the Buyer, any business unit of the
Business or any substantial portion of the Business, and (ii) its rights under
this Agreement for collateral security purposes to any Person providing
financing to the Buyer, any of its Affiliates or, after the Closing, the
Transferred Companies, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), without such prior
written consent; _provided_ , that no such assignment will relieve the
Buyer of its obligations hereunder; and _provided_ , _further_ , that no such
assignment shall increase the obligations for which the Company would have
been liable hereunder in the absence of such assignment. Any assignment in
violation of this  __ _Section 13.8_ __ will be void and of no effect.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. 

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Affiliate" when used in the
phrase "subject to  _Section 13.8_, an Affiliate of the Buyer" (or in any
similar phrase) shall mean such Affiliate as may be designated by Buyer or to
which any assignment of rights or obligations hereunder may be made in
accordance with  _Section 13.8(a)_.

(c) This Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented except upon
the execution and delivery of a written agreement executed by the parties
hereto and specifically referencing this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, _Sections 11.8_ , _13.2_ and _13.14_
(and any other provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment,
supplement, waiver or other modification of such provision would modify the
substance of such Sections) may not be amended, supplemented, waived or
otherwise modified in any manner that could reasonably be expected to be
adverse to the interests of the Lenders without the prior written consent of
the Lenders who actually lend money in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



105  Section 13.9 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules and
Exhibits hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement between the parties hereto relating to the subject matter hereof,
and supersede all prior negotiations, representations, understandings and
agreements, both written and oral, between the parties hereto with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement. In the event of any conflict between
this Agreement and any agreement entered into in connection herewith,
including any Local Transfer Document, the provisions of this Agreement will
control. The parties agree that no Local Transfer Document is intended, and no
Local Transfer Document will be construed in any way, to enhance, decrease or
otherwise modify any of the rights or obligations of the Buyer, any Affiliate
of the Buyer, the Company, any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates
from those contained in this Agreement.

Section 13.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument. It shall not be
necessary in making proof of this Agreement or any counterpart hereof to
produce or account for any of the other counterparts.

Section 13.11 _Disclosure Schedule_. For purposes of ___ARTICLE IV_ __, any
matter disclosed in a certain section of the Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed to be disclosed for purposes of all other applicable sections of __
_ARTICLE IV_ __to which the relevance of such disclosure is readily apparent
on the face of such disclosure. The Disclosure Schedule may contain
information that is not specifically required by this Agreement. Any such
information is provided solely for the Buyers general information and is not
separately represented or warranted. The inclusion of any such information in
the Disclosure Schedule shall not be evidence of or constitute an admission
that such information is material for purposes of this Agreement.

Section 13.12 _Independent Contractor; Reliance on Counsel_. Each party hereto
is an independent contractor, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
construed to be inconsistent with this relationship or status. Neither party
owes a fiduciary duty to the other. Nothing in this Agreement shall be in any
way construed to constitute either party as the agent, employee, or
representative of the other. As an independent contractor, each party has
relied on its own expertise or the expertise of its legal, financial,
technical, or other advisors. No party has relied upon any oral representation
or written representation not contained in this Agreement of any other party
in entering into this Agreement. All discussions, estimates, pro forma
financial statements or projections developed by a party during the course of
negotiating the terms and conditions of this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents are by way of illustration only, and are not binding or
enforceable against the other party in law or equity and do not form the basis
of any liability, representation or warranty, except as expressly provided in
this Agreement.

 

Section 13.13 _Litigation Costs_. In the event it becomes necessary for a
party hereto to initiate litigation for the purpose of enforcing any of its
rights hereunder or for the purpose of seeking damages for any violation of
this Agreement, then, in addition to any and all other judicial remedies that
may be granted, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover attorneys
fees and all other costs sustained by it in connection with that litigation.

Section 13.14  _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL

 



106   PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE CONTEMPLATED
TRANSACTIONS (INCLUDING ANY PROCEEDING INVOLVING A LENDER (OR ANY OF SUCH
LENDERS REPRESENTATIVES)).

 

( _Signature Page Follows_ )
