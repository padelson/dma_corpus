subject to the conditions of this Agreement, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any

as and to the extent provided below, their specific portions of (i)
the Initial Merger Consideration, (ii) the Escrow Merger Amount, (iii) the
First Merger Earn-Out Consideration and (iv) the Second Merger Earn-Out
Consideration, in each and every case subject to the applicable provisions of
this Agreement:

(a) _Conversion of Securities_.

(i) Subject to the provisions of this Section 2.2, each share of Company Stock

Dissenting Shares and shares of Company Stock described in Section 2.2(b)),

(ii) From and after the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, each such
share of Company Stock converted pursuant to Section 2.2(a)(i) shall no
longer be outstanding and shall be automatically cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate formerly representing
each such share shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right

 



9  to receive (subject to the terms of this Agreement) the portion of the Total
Merger Consideration payable with respect to such Company Stock, without
interest, upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with the terms
hereof and in the manner provided herein, or, if such share of Company Stock
is eligible under the DGCL to exercise appraisal or dissenters rights and is
held by a holder who has not voted in favor of this Agreement and the Merger
or consented thereto in writing and who has exercised and perfected appraisal
or dissenters rights for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL and has not effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal or dissenters
rights (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), the right, if any, to
receive payment from the Surviving Corporation of the "fair value" or "fair
market value" of such Dissenting Share as determined in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the DGCL.

(b) _Cancellation_. Each share of Company Stock owned by the Company as
treasury stock or owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, cease to be outstanding, be canceled and retired without payment of
any consideration therefor and cease to exist.

(c) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become, and shall represent, one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same
rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute
the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

2.3 _Dissenting Holders_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any Dissenting
Shares shall not be converted into or represent the right to consideration for
Company Stock set forth in Section 2.2(a)(i), but rather such shares shall be
converted into the right to receive such consideration for Company Stock as
may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to
the DGCL.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.3(a), if any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) such holders appraisal rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such
event, such holders shares shall automatically be converted into and
represent only the right to receive the consideration for such shares set
forth in Section 2.2(a)(i), without interest, less the withholdable portion of
the Escrow Amount with respect to such shares (whether or not
actually withheld) as set forth in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.7, upon surrender of
the certificate representing such shares.

(c) The Company shall (i) comply with the requirements of Section 262 of the
DGCL, (ii) give Parent prompt notice of any written demand for appraisal or
payment of the fair value of any shares received by the Company pursuant
to Section 262 of the DGCL and of withdrawals of such demands, and provide
copies of any documents or instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and
received by the Company and (iii) give Parent the opportunity to participate
in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands. Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall not make any payment or settlement
offer with respect to any such demand unless Parent shall have consented in
writing to such payment or settlement offer.

(d) Any amount paid by Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation to any
Person with respect to Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
in excess of the amount that would otherwise be payable pursuant to Section
2.2(a)(i) for each such Dissenting Share (such amount, unless determined in a
final, non-appealable judgment of a court, being subject to the written
approval of the Representative, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or

 



10  delayed), and all interest, costs, expenses and fees as incurred by the
Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation in connection with the exercise
of all rights under Section 262 of the DGCL shall constitute "Damages" for
purposes of this Agreement, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, shall, without limiting any other rights, be entitled to recover
such Damages from the Escrow Funds.

 

2.4 _Options_. The Company shall take all necessary and appropriate action,
and shall cause every holder of an Option to take all necessary and
appropriate action, such that each outstanding and unexercised Option shall be
terminated one Business Day prior to the Closing Date. All Options outstanding
and unexercised at Closing shall be terminated as of the Closing. In
the event that the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby would cause
acceleration of vesting under any Option agreements, the Company shall obtain
waivers and cancellations of such provisions from any Continuing Employees
who hold such Options. All shares of Company Common Stock acquired pursuant to
the exercise of Options, which shares are subject to a right of repurchase by
the Company as of one Business Day prior to the Closing Date shall be
repurchased by the Company at the original price per share at least one
Business Day prior to the Closing Date.

2.5 _Warrants_. The Company shall take all necessary and appropriate action
such that each outstanding and unexercised Warrant shall be terminated one
Business Day prior to the Closing Date. All Warrants outstanding and
unexercised at Closing shall be terminated as of the Closing. Parent (a)
agrees not to exercise any Warrants held by it at any time during the Pre-
Closing Period and (b) acknowledges that all Warrants held by it shall be
automatically terminated and cancelled at the Effective Time without
consideration and without any further action on the part of Parent or the
Company.

2.6 _Earn-Out Consideration_.

(a) _First Earn-Out Consideration_. Subject to Sections 2.3 and 2.8 and the
provisions of this Section 2.6, each share of Company Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Identified
Employee Common Shares and any Dissenting Shares), shall be entitled to
receive by March 31, 2012 (the " _First Earn-Out Consideration Payment Date_
") cash in the amount of the First Earn-Out Per Share Consideration, if any.

 

(b) _Second Earn-Out Consideration_. Subject to Sections 2.3 and 2.8 and the
provisions of this Section 2.6, each share of Company Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Identified
Employee Common Shares and any Dissenting Shares), shall be entitled to
receive by March 31, 2013 (the " _Second Earn-Out Consideration Payment Date_
") cash in the amount of the Second Earn-Out Per Share Consideration, if any.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances shall the sum of (i)
the amount of the Total Optichron Earn-Out Consideration payable by Parent
pursuant to this Section 2.6, plus (ii) the First Earn-Out Warrant Reduction
Amount, plus (iii) the Second Earn-Out Warrant Reduction Amount, exceed
$130,000,000. In the event that such sum would otherwise exceed $130,000,000
upon the accrual of an earn-out, the Nominal First Earn-Out Consideration or
the Nominal Second Earn-Out Consideration, as applicable, shall be deemed to
be reduced to that amount that results in such sum equaling exactly
$130,000,000.

(d) Parent shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and deliver to the
Representative no later than 45 days after the last day of each of the First
Earn-Out Period and Second Earn-Out Period, a calculation of the Net Revenue
of the Surviving Corporation for the respective earn-out period, and a
statement of the amount, if any, of the First Optichron Earn-Out Consideration
and First Merger Earn-Out Consideration or Second Optichron Earn-Out
Consideration and Second Merger Earn-Out Consideration, as applicable, to be
delivered to the Indemnifying Stockholders for the applicable period. In the
event that the Representative determines in good faith that he requires
further information

 



11  in order to evaluate Parents calculations of Net Revenue or the earn-out
amounts, he shall deliver written notice to Parent requesting such additional
information as promptly as practicable, and in any event no later than 30
days, following Parents delivery of such calculations to the Representative
(which additional information, to the extent reasonably necessary in order to
perform such calculations, shall be provided by Parent within 15 days after
Parents receipt of such request). Any claim by the Representative challenging
Parents calculations of the foregoing amounts must be asserted by written
notice to Parent within 15 days after Parents delivery of such calculations
to the Representative or, if applicable, Parents delivery of additional
information to the Representative. During such 15-day period, Parent shall
afford the Representative reasonable access to appropriate personnel of
Parent during normal business hours to meet with the Representative and
discuss Parents calculations. In the event the Representative decides not to
object to Parents calculations, the Representative shall notify Parent
promptly of its decision.

(e) On or before the First Earn-Out Consideration Payment Date (or such later
date as the amount of the First Optichron Earn-Out Consideration has been
determined pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.6(d)), Parent shall deposit
with the Paying Agent cash in the amount the First Merger Earn-Out
Consideration. On or before the Second Earn-Out Payment Date (or such later
date as the amount of the Second Optichron Earn-Out Consideration has been
determined pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.6(d) above), Parent shall
deposit with the Paying Agent cash in the amount of the Second Merger Earn-
Out Consideration. The Paying Agent shall distribute the First Merger Earn-Out
Consideration in cash to the Non-Dissenting Stockholders (according to the
allocation set forth in the Securityholder Schedule) on or before the First
Earn-Out Consideration Payment Date, and shall distribute the Second Merger
Earn-Out Consideration in cash to the Non-Dissenting Stockholders (according
to the allocation set forth in the Securityholder Schedule) on or before the
Second Earn-Out Consideration Payment Date.

(f) The adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger by the
Company Stockholders shall constitute approval of the Earn-Out terms and
conditions specified in this Section 2.6, and the Stockholders Written
Consent shall so provide.

2.7 _Escrow_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver or cause to be
delivered cash in an amount equal to the Escrow Amount to The Bank of New York
Trust Company, N.A., as escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), pursuant to
the provisions of an escrow agreement which shall be entered into prior to or
concurrently with the Effective Time by and among Parent, the Representative,
on behalf of the Indemnifying Stockholders, and the Escrow Agent, and which
shall be in substantially the form attached as _Exhibit B_ hereto, subject to
such modifications and amendments as the parties thereto may agree upon (the "
_Escrow Agreement_ "). The Escrow Agreement shall provide Parent with
recourse against amounts held in escrow by the Escrow Agent (the " _Escrow
Funds_ ") for a period of 18 months from and after the Effective Time (the "
_Escrow Period_ ") with respect to any and all Parent Claims made under
Section 14 of this Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
the Escrow Agreement and in such Section 14\. The Escrow Amount plus any
interest earned prior to distribution (or any portion thereof) shall be
distributed to the Indemnifying Stockholders, and Parent at the times, and
upon the terms and conditions, set forth in the Escrow Agreement. The terms
and provisions of the Escrow Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby are specific terms of the Merger and of the transactions contemplated
by the Common Stock Purchase Agreements, and the approval and adoption of this
Agreement, the Common Stock Purchase Agreements and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger) and thereby by the Indemnifying
Stockholders pursuant to the Stockholders Written Consent shall constitute
approval by such Indemnifying Stockholders, as specific terms of the Merger
and of the transactions contemplated by the Common Stock Purchase Agreements,
and the irrevocable agreement of such Indemnifying Stockholders to be bound by
and comply with, the Escrow Agreement and all of the arrangements and
provisions of this Agreement relating thereto, including, without limitation,
the deposit of the Escrow Amount into escrow, the indemnification obligations
set

 



12  forth in Section 14 hereof and the appointment and sole authority to act on
behalf of the Indemnifying Stockholders of the Representative, as provided for
herein and in the Escrow Agreement. 

2.8 _Surrender of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with The Bank of New York Trust
Company, N.A. (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the benefit of the Indemnifying
Stockholders cash in an amount equal to (a) the Initial Merger Consideration,
plus (b) the amounts payable to the Identified Employees pursuant to the
Common Stock Purchase Agreements at the Stock Purchase Closing (as defined
therein). Such funds shall be invested as directed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the Non-Dissenting
Stockholders. Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive
property of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, and no part of such earnings
shall accrue to the benefit of the Non-Dissenting Stockholders.

(b) _Surrender Procedures_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall instruct the
Paying Agent to mail to each Non-Dissenting Stockholder as of the Effective
Time (A) a letter of transmittal and (B) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of certificate(s) representing all of the shares of Company
Stock held by such Non-Dissenting Stockholder in exchange for such Non-
Dissenting Stockholders portion of the Initial Merger Consideration and the
right to receive future payment of such Non-Dissenting Stockholders portion
of any released Escrow Funds and Total Merger Earn-Out Consideration. The
payment of a Non-Dissenting Stockholders portion of the Initial Merger
Consideration, Escrow Funds and Total Merger Earn-Out Consideration with
respect to each such certificate is conditioned upon (1) the execution and
delivery of such transmittal letter and (2) the delivery of such
certificates related thereto (or an affidavit of loss with respect to such
certificates). As soon as practicable after receipt by the Paying Agent of
such certificate(s), properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for
transfer, for cancellation (or affidavit, as applicable), together with such
duly executed letter of transmittal, the Paying Agent shall, in exchange
therefor, pay to such Non-Dissenting Stockholder cash in the amount of the
portion of the Initial Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares
of Company Stock formerly represented by the certificate(s) surrendered, but
without interest, and the certificate(s) so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. If payment of any portion of the Initial Merger Consideration is to
be made to a person, firm, entity, partnership, association or any business
organization or division thereof (each a " _Person_ ") other than the Person
in whose name the surrendered certificate(s) are registered, it shall be a
condition of payment that the Person requesting such payment (A) shall have
paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of those
amounts to a Person other than the registered holder of the certificate(s)
surrendered, and shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that
such Tax has been paid, or (B) shall have established to the satisfaction of
the Parent that such Tax is not applicable. From and after the Effective Time,
until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.8(b), each certificate
formerly representing shares of Company Stock shall be deemed to represent for
all purposes only the right to receive the portion of the Total Merger
Consideration as provided pursuant to Section 2.2(a) hereof, if any, in
respect of such shares of Company Stock formerly represented thereby in
accordance with the terms hereof and in the manner provided herein.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in the Shares_. The Company
agrees to close its stock transfer books at the close of the Business Day
immediately preceding the Effective Time, and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers of the shares of Company Stock on the
records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
certificates formerly evidencing ownership of the shares of Company
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for
herein or by applicable Legal Requirements. After the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall cancel and exchange, as
provided in this Section 2, any presented certificate representing shares of
Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



13 (d) _Termination of Fund; No Liability_. At any time following the Earn-
Out Distribution Date, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including, without
limitation, any earnings received with respect thereto) that had been made
available to the Paying Agent and that have not been disbursed to Non-
Dissenting Stockholders and thereafter such Non-Dissenting Stockholders shall
be entitled to look only to Parent or the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Legal Requirements) and only as
general creditors thereof with respect to the applicable portion of the Total
Merger Consideration, upon due surrender of their certificates formerly
representing shares of Company Stock or rights to purchase such shares,
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of
a certificate formerly representing shares of Company Stock for any amounts
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Legal Requirement.

(e) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from payment of any
amounts (or any portion thereof) payable pursuant to this Agreement to, or on
behalf of, any Company Securityholder, and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from payment of any Company Securityholders pro rata
portion of the Escrow Amount (or any portion thereof) otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any Company Securityholder, such amounts as may
be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "),
or any other Legal Requirement. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or the Escrow Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Company Securityholder to whom such amounts would otherwise
have been paid.

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
certificate(s) which formerly represented shares of Company Stock shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making and delivery of an affidavit
of that fact by the Non-Dissenting Stockholder thereof in form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and the execution and delivery of a letter of
transmittal in accordance with Section 2.8(b), Parent shall instruct the
Paying Agent to pay such Non-Dissenting Stockholder his, her or its applicable
portion of the Total Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its reasonable discretion, acting
in good faith, and as a condition precedent to issuing such instruction to the
Paying Agent, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate(s) to deliver an agreement of indemnification in form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and a bond in such sum as Parent or its transfer agent
may reasonably direct as indemnity, against any claim that may be made
against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to
the certificate(s) alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

(g) _Dissenting Shares_. The provisions of this Section 2.8 shall also apply
to Dissenting Shares that lose their status as such (which shall be treated as
non-Dissenting Shares for purposes of Section 2.8), except that the
obligations of Parent under this Section 2.8 shall commence on the date of
loss of such status and the holder of such shares shall be entitled to receive
in exchange for such shares the applicable amounts provided in Section 2\.

2.9 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement
and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to
all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company
and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of the Company and Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time are and will remain fully authorized
in the name of the Company and Merger Sub or otherwise to take, and shall
take, all such action.

represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that the statements in this
Section 3 are true, complete and correct as

exceptions provided in the Disclosure Schedule, with specific reference to the

Employee Plan submitted to any governmental agency or distributed to
participants or beneficiaries thereunder in the current or any of the three
preceding calendar years, together with all schedules, attachments, and

Company Employee Plan is currently in compliance with, and has heretofore
been maintained, administered and operated in all material respects in

upon a master and prototype or volume submitter form, the sponsor of such form
has received a current advisory opinion as to the form upon which the Company
is entitled to rely under applicable IRS procedures), and nothing has occurred
as to each which has resulted or is likely to result in the revocation of such
qualification or which requires or could require action under the compliance
resolution programs of the IRS to preserve such qualification.

(e) Neither the Company nor its ERISA Affiliates maintain, sponsor or
contribute to any single employer plan (as such term is defined in Section
4001(b) of ERISA) subject to Title IV of ERISA or contribute to or have ever

including, without limitation, withdrawal liability, with respect to any such
Plan or any such multiemployer plan that remains unsatisfied. Neither
the Company nor its ERISA Affiliates has incurred any liability (contingent

time a multiple employer plan, as described in Section 413(c) of the Code or
Sections 4063 or 4064 of ERISA, or a multiple employer welfare arrangement, as
that term is defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA, and neither the Company nor
any ERISA Affiliate has ever contributed to or had an obligation to contribute

Employee Plan as required to be made under the terms of such plan and
applicable law. The fair market value of the assets of each Sponsored Company
Employee Plan, as of the end of the most recently ended plan year of that
Sponsored Company Employee Plan, equaled or exceeded the present value of all
benefits liabilities under that Sponsored Company Employee Plan. None of the
assets of any Company Employee Plan include any capital stock or other
securities issued by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate.

prohibited transactions imposed by Section 502(i) of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code.

 

(i) There are no legal actions, proceedings, suits, arbitrations, governmental
investigations or claims (other than routine claims for benefits by

of the Company, threatened, with respect to any Company Employee Plan or
any fiduciary, service provider or sponsor of a Company Employee Plan with
respect to their duties under such Company Employee Plan or the assets of any
trust under any such Company Employee Plan nor, to the Knowledge of the
Company, any basis for any such actions, proceedings, suits, arbitrations,
governmental investigations or claims.

ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code or applicable state law.

(l) Neither the negotiation or execution of this Agreement, nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will, either
alone or in combination with another event (regardless of whether that other
event has or will occur), (i) entitle any current or former Employee

additional rights, except as expressly provided in this Agreement, or (ii)

contract, agreement, plan or arrangement covering any person that,
individually or collectively, could give rise to the payment of any amount
that would not be deductible by Parent, the Company or any of their
respective affiliates by reason of Section 280G of the Code or that could be
subject to Section 4999 of the Code.

(n) Each plan, program, arrangement or agreement, including any Company
Employee Plan, that constitutes in any part a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code is
identified as such on _Section 3.13(m)_ of the Disclosure Schedule. Each
plan, program, arrangement or agreement identified or required to be
identified on _Section 3.13(m)_ of the Disclosure Schedule has,
since December 31, 2004 and through December 31, 2008, been operated and
maintained in accordance with a good faith, reasonable interpretation of
Section 409A of the Code and its

 



28  purpose, as determined under applicable guidance of the Department of
Treasury and the IRS, with respect to amounts deferred (within the meaning of
Section 409A of the Code) after December 31, 2004. By December 31, 2008, each
such plan, program, arrangement or agreement was amended to the extent
necessary or appropriate to comply with Section 409A of the Code and the final
regulations promulgated thereunder. 

(o) All Options have been granted or issued at an exercise price at least
equal to the fair market value of the underlying Company Common Stock at the
date of grant or issuance, as determined in accordance with Section 409A of
the Code and the temporary regulations and notices promulgated thereunder, and
none of the Options or any other Company Securities or agreements constitute
"deferred compensation" under Section 409A of the Code. True and complete
copies of the Option Plan and all agreements and instruments relating to or
issued under each such plan (including executed copies of all Contracts
relating to each Option and the shares of Company Common Stock purchased under
such plan), and all agreements and instruments related to the Warrants, have
been made available or provided to Parent, and such plans and Contracts have
not been amended, modified or supplemented since being made available or
provided to Parent, and there are no Contracts or understandings to amend,
modify or supplement such plans or Contracts in any case from those made
available or provided to Parent. Each Option intended to qualify as an
"incentive stock option" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code so
qualifies. Each grant of an Option was duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action no later than the date on which the grant of such Option was
by its terms to be effective. Each Option may be treated in accordance with
the applicable provisions of Section 2.4 without the consent of the holder of
such Option.

 

(p) The Company has no liability, including under any Company Employee Plan,
arising out of the treatment of any service provider as a consultant or
independent contractor and not as an employee.

outside of the United States.

not legally bound) to modify or terminate any Company Employee Plan or adopt
any arrangement or program, which, once established, would come within the
definition of a Company Employee Plan.

 

(s) The Company has not undertaken to maintain any Company Employee Plan for
any period of time and each such Company Employee Plan is terminable at the
sole discretion of the sponsor thereof, subject only to such constraints as
may be imposed by applicable law, and without penalty or cost (other than
routine administrative costs).

applicable Governmental Authority such amendment or supplement.

(d) _Reasonable Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, each of the parties hereto agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing,
all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective,

all reasonable actions necessary to cause the conditions precedent set forth
in Sections 7, 8 and 9 to be satisfied; (ii) obtaining or making all consents,
approvals, orders or authorizations of, or registrations, declarations or

and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and its board of directors
shall, if any takeover statute or similar Legal Requirement is or becomes
applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of any such Legal
Requirement on the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.

6.6 _Advise of Changes_. During the Pre-Closing Period, Parent and the
Company shall promptly advise the other party in writing to the extent it has
Knowledge of (a) any event or circumstance that would reasonably be expected
to result in any representation or warranty made by it (and, in the case of
Parent, made by Merger Sub) in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate in
any material respect, (b) the failure by it (and, in the case of Parent, by
Merger Sub) to comply in any material respect with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement prior to the Effective Time, (c) any
change or event having, or which is reasonably likely to have, a Material
Adverse Effect or (d) any notice or other communication from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no such notification will be deemed to prevent or cure any breach of, or
inaccuracy in, amend or supplement any Section of the Disclosure Schedule, or
otherwise disclose an exception to, or affect in any manner, the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or
remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties or the Indemnifying Stockholders under this Agreement.

6.7 _Cooperation_. Subject to compliance with applicable Legal Requirements,
from the date hereof until the Effective Time, the Companys officers and
other personnel shall make themselves reasonably available to confer on a
regular and frequent basis with one or more representatives of Parent to
report operational matters that are material and the general status of ongoing
operations, in each case with respect to the Company. 

 



44 6.8 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) Unless Parent requests otherwise by written notice to Company prior to the
Closing Date, effective immediately prior to the Closing, the Company will
terminate any and all Company Employee Plans intended to qualify as a
qualified cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code and
effective immediately prior to the Closing, no employee shall have any right
to contribute any amounts to any Company Employee Plan intended to qualify as
a qualified cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code. At
the request of Parent, the Company will provide Parent with evidence that such
Company Employee Plans have been terminated effective immediately prior to
the Closing pursuant to resolutions duly adopted by the board of directors of
the Company. In addition, at the request of Parent, the Company will terminate
any and all other Company Employee Plans, including any group health or
dental plans or programs, effective either immediately prior to the Closing or
thereafter as specified by Parent and, at the request of Parent, the Company
will provide Parent with evidence that such Company Employee Plans have been
so terminated pursuant to resolutions duly adopted by the board of directors
of the Company. The Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance
of terminating such Company Employee Plans as Parent may reasonably require.

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall take all actions necessary to
solicit, in a manner satisfactory to Parent, a vote of the Company
Stockholders that complies with the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5) of the
Code and Regulations § 1.280G-1 thereunder, with respect to payments and
benefits which may be made or provided to any person who, with respect to the
Company, is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined for purposes
of Section 280G of the Code) if such payments or benefits may be deemed to
constitute "parachute payments" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code or could
reasonably be expected to result in the imposition of any excise tax imposed
under Section 4999 of the Code (" _Potential 280G Benefits_ "), or the right
to such payments and benefits shall have been waived by each disqualified
individual whose payments and benefits referred to herein have not been
approved by the Company Stockholders. The Company shall provide to Parent a
reasonable time prior to the Closing evidence satisfactory to Parent that a
vote of the stockholders of the Company entitled to vote was solicited in
accordance with Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code and Regulations § 1.280G-1
thereunder, and either that the requisite stockholder approval was obtained,
or that no Potential 280G Benefits will be payable or retained.

(c) Each new offer for employment would be issued by the Company, the Parent
or another subsidiary of Parent, only following agreement with Parent, and
would be effective upon the Effective Time. Those employees of the Company who
accept such offers of employment (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") shall be
eligible to participate in all benefit plans, programs, practices, policies
and arrangements maintained by Parent and, for purposes of determining
eligibility and vesting (but not with respect to accrual of or entitlement to
benefits, except with respect to severance benefits and vacation entitlement),
service with the Company (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company
provides past service credit) shall be treated as service with Parent;
_provided_ that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or to the extent that
such service was not recognized under the applicable Company Employee Plan; 
_provided further_ that Parent shall not be required to provide employee
benefits (including opportunities to participate in compensation plans and
programs) to Continuing Employees that are any more favorable in the aggregate
than those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent.

(d) Parent and the Company agree that where a Continuing Employee is eligible
to participate in any group health plan, including without limitation a
medical or dental benefit plan, of Parent after the Effective Time, Parent
shall make reasonable commercial efforts to cause such plan to waive any pre
existing condition exclusion and actively at work requirements (provided,
however, that no such waiver shall apply to a pre existing condition of any
Continuing Employee who was, as of the Effective Time, excluded from
participation in a plan maintained by the Company by virtue of such

 



45  pre existing condition) and similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods
and evidence of insurability requirements, to the extent permitted by such
plan. Parent shall make reasonable commercial efforts to cause any such group
health plan to provide that any covered expenses incurred on or before the
Effective Time by the Continuing Employees or such employees covered
dependents under an equivalent group health plan of the Company under which
such Continuing Employees or their dependents were covered prior to the
Effective Time shall be taken into account for purposes of satisfying
applicable deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions after
the Effective Time to the same extent as such expenses are taken into account
for the benefit of similarly situated employees of Parent.

(e) Not less than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall issue RSUs representing the right to acquire shares of Company Common
Stock having an aggregate value of $22,300,000 (collectively, the "
_Retention RSUs_ "), assuming that each such share has a value equal to the
sum of (a) the Base Per Share Common Consideration and (b) the Estimated Fair
Value of the Total Earn-Out Consideration Per Common Share (such sum, the "
_Assumed Value Per Common Share_ ") to those Continuing Employees designated
by Parent prior to the Closing Date. Each Retention RSU will vest over a
maximum of five-years from the Closing Date with the exact vesting schedules,
allocation and other terms and conditions of the issuance of the Retention
RSUs to be determined by Parent. The Retention RSUs shall be granted pursuant
to a newly adopted plan (the " _Retention RSU Plan_ ") acceptable to Parent
that shall have been approved by the Companys board of directors and
stockholders prior to the Effective Time (and no other Company Securities
shall be granted pursuant to such plan). At the Effective Time, Parent
shall assume such plan and, subject to the delivery to Parent of a written
release in substantially the form of the release contained in Section 16
hereof executed by the holder of such Retention RSU, each Retention RSU
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be assumed by Parent
at the Effective Time and converted into a restricted stock unit to acquire,
on substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such
Retention RSU as issued by the Company (except as provided below), the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock rounded down to the nearest whole share,
determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to the Retention RSUs immediately prior to the Effective Time by a fraction,
the numerator of which shall be the Assumed Value Per Common Share, and the
denominator of which shall be the Parent Average Closing Price. It is the
intention of the parties hereto that the assumption by Parent of the Retention
RSUs pursuant to this Section 6.8(e) satisfies the requirements of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D) and the provisions of this Section
6.8(e) shall be interpreted and applied consistently with such intention.

 

(f) At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall enter into separation agreements
(each, a " _Separation Agreement_ ") with each of the Identified Employees
providing that, subject to the execution and delivery of a general release of
the Company, Parent and its affiliates by the Identified Employee, the vesting
schedule for the Retention RSUs issued to the Identified Employee pursuant to
Section 6.8(e) hereof and for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to
the Identified Employee pursuant to his Common Stock Purchase Agreement shall
accelerate in the event that the Identified Employee is terminated by Parent
by Involuntary Termination at any time prior to the vesting of such RSUs and
shares.

(g) On or before the Closing Date, Parent shall file a registration statement
on Form S-8 (or any successor form) or another appropriate form with respect
to all shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Retention
RSUs assumed by Parent.

 

(h) On or before the Closing Date, each Identified Employee shall enter into
and deliver to Parent a Non-Competition Agreement pursuant to which such
Identified Employee shall agree not to compete with the business conducted by
the Company prior to the Closing, and not to solicit or hire any employees of
the Company or the Surviving Corporation, for a period of the lesser of
24 months following the Closing Date and 12 months following the termination
of his employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or another subsidiary
of Parent.

 



46 (i) As of the Closing Date, Parent shall be responsible for providing
continuation coverage for group health insurance plans to all MandA Qualified
Beneficiaries (as such term is defined in Treas. Reg. Section 54.4980B-9, QandA
4).

6.9 _Termination of Certain Agreements_. On or prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall (a) terminate all Contracts with any of the Company
Securityholders or other Related Parties set forth on _Schedule 6.9_ (all
such Contracts with Related Parties to be terminated, the " _Related Party
Agreements_ ") and (b) terminate all of the licensing, distribution and other
agreements set forth on _Schedule 6.9_. 

6.10 _Calculation of Estimated Transaction Expenses, Change in Control
Payments, Company Debt_. Not later than two Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with a certificate executed by
the Companys Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer with the
Companys calculation of, and reasonable supporting documentation for: (a)
Estimated Transaction Expenses, with separate calculations of the amount of
such expenses, (i) paid or to be paid prior to the Closing Date and (ii) to be
paid after Closing Date; (b) any Change in Control Payments that have been
paid or are payable; and (c) outstanding Company Debt.

6.11 _No-Shop_.

 

(a) Except as contemplated by this Agreement and the Common Stock Purchase
Agreements, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its respective
affiliates, directors, officers, employees, representatives or agents
(collectively, the " _Company Representatives_ ") to, directly or indirectly
(i) discuss, encourage, negotiate, undertake, initiate, authorize, recommend,
propose or enter into, whether as the proposed surviving, merged, acquiring or
acquired corporation or otherwise, any transaction, or any understanding,
letter of intent or Contract contemplating any transaction, involving a
merger, consolidation, business combination, reorganization or dissolution
involving the Company or a purchase or disposition of any material amount of
the assets of the Company or any capital stock or other ownership interests of
the Company other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (an "
_Acquisition Transaction_ "), (ii) solicit or initiate discussions,
negotiations or submissions of proposals or offers in respect of an
Acquisition Transaction, (iii) furnish or cause to be furnished, to any
Person, any information concerning the business, operations, properties or
assets of the Company in connection with an Acquisition Transaction, or (iv)
or otherwise consent to, or cooperate with, or assist or participate in,
knowingly facilitate or encourage, any effort or attempt by any other Person
to do or seek any of the foregoing.

(b) The Company shall notify Parent orally and in writing promptly (but in no
event later than 24 hours) after receipt by the Company or any of the Company
Representatives thereof of any proposal or offer from any Person other than
Parent to effect an Acquisition Transaction or any request for non-public
information relating to the Company or for access to the properties, books or
records of the Company by any Person other than Parent.

 

(c) The Company shall (and shall cause its Company Representatives to)
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or
negotiations with any Persons (other than Parent) conducted heretofore with
respect to any Acquisition Transaction. The Company shall not release any
third party from the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any
agreement to which the Company is a party.

6.12 _Operation of Business After Closing_. From the Effective Time through
the end of the First Earn-Out Period and Second Earn-Out Period, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to (i) devote substantially
similar resources (and in no event less than reasonable resources) to the
development, sale, marketing and distribution of Company Products as Parent
devotes to the marketing, distribution and sale of its other products at such
time and (ii) otherwise use commercially

 



47  reasonable efforts in good faith to afford the Company Stockholders the
reasonable opportunity to realize the full potential of the Net Revenue from
which the Earn-out Consideration would be payable to such Company
Stockholders hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and Parent
acknowledge that from the Closing Date through the completion of the First
Earn-Out Period and Second Earn-Out Period, all Company Products will
be subject to reasonable pricing at reasonable net margins as determined by
Parent consistent with the Companys past practices and financial forecasts
previously provided to Parent by the Company.

 

6.13 _Charter Amendment_. Promptly following the approval of such action by
the holders of not less than the minimum number of shares of Company Stock
required to approve such action under the DGCL and the Charter and in any

may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time, by action taken or
authorized by the board of directors of the terminating party or parties:

 

(a) by mutual written consent duly authorized by the Boards of Directors of
Parent and the Company;

 

(b) by either the Company or Parent if the Merger shall not have been
consummated by July 31, 2011 (the " _End Date_ "); _provided_ _further_ that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 12.1(b) shall not be
available to any party whose action or failure to act has been a principal
cause of, or resulted in the failure of, the Merger to occur on or before
such date and such action or failure to act constitutes a breach of this
Agreement;

 



52 (c) by Parent or the Company if a Governmental Authority shall have issued or
enacted any Legal Requirement or taken any other action (including, without
limitation, the failure to have taken an action), in any case having the
effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
Merger, which Legal Requirement is final and nonappealable, as applicable;

(d) by the Company, (i) upon a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, or
(ii) if any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub shall have
become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in Section
9.1 would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time
such representation or warranty shall have become untrue, _provided_ that if
such inaccuracy in Parents or Merger Subs representations and warranties or
breach by Parent or Merger Sub is curable prior to the End Date through the
exercise of reasonable efforts, then the Company may not terminate this
Agreement under this Section 12.1(d) prior to the 30th day following the
receipt of written notice from the Company by Parent of such breach (it being
understood that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 12.1(d) if the Company shall have materially breached this Agreement
or if such breach by Parent or Merger Sub is cured such that such conditions
would then be satisfied);

(e) by Parent, (i) upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement set forth in this Agreement by the Company or the Representative, or
(ii) if any representation or warranty of the Company shall have become
untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in Section
8.1 would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time
such representation or warranty shall have become untrue, _provided_ that if
such inaccuracy in the Companys representations and warranties or breach by
the Company or the Representative is curable by the Company or the
Representative prior to the End Date through the exercise of reasonable
efforts, then Parent may not terminate this Agreement solely by reason of this
Section 12.1(e) prior to the 30 days following the receipt of written notice
from Parent by the Company of such breach (it being understood that Parent may
not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 12.1(e) if Parent shall
have materially breached this Agreement or if such breach by the Company or
the Representative is cured such that such conditions would then be
satisfied);

(f) by Parent, if the Requisite Stockholder Approval shall not have been
obtained within 48 hours following the date of this Agreement; or

 

(g) by Parent, if a Material Adverse Effect shall have occurred, or Parent
first becomes aware of a Material Adverse Effect, after the date hereof, or,
if the Company breaches Section 6.11; _provided_ that if the Company may
through the exercise of reasonable efforts cause such circumstance, condition,
change or effect to cease to constitute a Material Adverse Effect
(and prevent the occurrence of any other Material Adverse Effect), then
Parent may not terminate this Agreement solely by reason of this Section
12.1(g) prior to the 30th day following the receipt of written notice from
Parent by the Company of such breach (it being understood that Parent may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 12.1(g) if Parent shall have
materially breached this Agreement or if such breach by the Company or the
Representative is cured such that such conditions would then be satisfied).

12.2 _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_. If a party wishes to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.1, then such party shall
deliver to the other parties to this Agreement a written notice stating that
such party is terminating this Agreement and setting forth a brief description
of the basis on which such party is terminating this Agreement. Any
termination of this Agreement under Section 12.1 will be effective immediately
upon the delivery of a valid written notice of the terminating party to the
other party hereto. In the event of the termination of this Agreement as
provided in Section 12.1, this Agreement shall be of no further force or
effect, except (i) as set forth in Sections 6.2(a), 6.3, 12.2, 13 and 17, each
of which shall survive the termination of this Agreement, (ii) nothing in
this Section 12.2 shall relieve any party from liability for any breach of
this Agreement or willful failure to fulfill any condition set forth in this
Agreement prior to such termination, and (iii) Parent or Merger

 



53  Sub shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent a
breach of, or specific performance to enforce specifically the provisions of,
any covenant of the Company contained in this Agreement in any court of
competent jurisdiction. No termination of this Agreement shall affect the
obligations of the parties contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of
which obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement in accordance
with their terms.

SECTION 13\. _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, (a) all fees, costs and expenses of Parent or Merger Sub incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including, without limitation, fees and expenses of financial advisors,
financial sponsors, legal counsel and other advisors, shall be paid by Parent
whether or not the Merger is consummated and (b) all Transaction Expenses
shall be paid by the Company whether or not the Merger is consummated.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the total estimated amount
of Transaction Expenses, as set forth in the certificate required pursuant to
Section 6.10 exceeds $600,000, then the excess amount shall constitute
"Damages" for purposes of this Agreement, and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall, without limiting any other rights, be
entitled to recover such Damages solely from the Escrow Funds without
reduction by the threshold amount specified in Section 14.3(b).

 

SECTION 14\. _Indemnification and Claims for Damages_.

14.1 _Parent Claims_. From and after the Effective Time, Each Indemnifying
Stockholder shall be deemed to have agreed, and hereby agrees, that Parent,
Merger Sub, their respective affiliates (including, without limitation,
following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) and their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, successors and
assigns (collectively, the " _Parent Indemnified Parties_ ") shall have full
recourse against, and be entitled to be compensated and reimbursed from, the
Escrow Funds (subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Escrow
Agreement) for any and all Damages arising from or related to any of the
following (each a " _Parent Claim_ "):

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by the
Company or the Representative in this Agreement or in any document,
certificate or other instrument required to be delivered by the Company or the
Representative under this Agreement as of the date hereof or as of the
Closing Date in each case, as such representation or warranty would read if
all qualifications as to Knowledge and materiality, including, without
limitation, each reference to the defined term Material Adverse Effect, were
deleted therefrom (except in the first sentence of Section 3.8 and clause
(iii) of Section 3.21(a)). Such deletions will be made solely for the purposes
of calculating Damages but not for the purposes of determining whether or not
any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty has occurred;

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant or agreement made or to
be performed by the Company or the Representative in this Agreement or in any
agreement or instrument entered into by the Company or the Representative in
connection with this Agreement;

 

(c) any fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful breach by the Company
or the Representative (a " _Fraud Claim_ "); 

(d) any inaccuracy in the updated Securityholder Schedule delivered to Parent
pursuant to Section 10.1(o);

 

(e) any Transfer Taxes for which the Company Stockholders are responsible
pursuant to Section 14.8;

 



54 (f) any fees, commissions or other payments (including indemnity payments) to
any Person having acted or claiming to have acted, directly or indirectly, as
a broker, finder or financial advisor for any Company Securityholder or, prior
to the Closing, the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement to the extent not otherwise included in the Transaction
Expenses; or

(g) regardless of any disclosure on any Schedule, any "excess parachute
payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code) made by the
Company on or prior to the Closing Date or otherwise required to be paid by
the Company or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to agreements or Company
Benefit Plans entered into or adopted on or prior to the Closing Date.

14.2 _Indemnification of Parent Indemnified Parties_. Each Indemnifying
Stockholder shall be deemed to have agreed, and hereby agrees, to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless, severally and not jointly and based on their
respective Pro Rata Portion, the Parent Indemnified Parties from and against,
and such Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to be compensated and
reimbursed for, any and all Damages arising from or related to (i) a Fraud
Claim or (ii) misrepresentation or breach or failure of any of the Extended
Representations, subject to the limitations of this Section 14\. The
Stockholders Written Consents and the Offer Package Agreements shall contain
provisions pursuant to which any Indemnifying Stockholder that executes
such documents shall expressly agree to the foregoing indemnification and the
other terms of this Agreement that are intended to be binding upon the
Indemnifying Stockholders.

14.3 _Limitations of Liability_.

(a) Except in the case of (i) a Fraud Claim or (ii) any inaccuracy in or
breach of any of the Extended Representations, recourse from the Escrow Funds
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent Indemnified Parties for
Parent Claims; _provided_ , that Parent may offset Damages against amounts
otherwise payable to the Indemnifying Stockholders as the First Optichron
Earn-Out Consideration and Second Optichron Earn-Out Consideration if, and to
the extent that, less than the full Escrow Amount is available to Parent as a
result of payments having been made to the Representative out of the Escrow
Expense Allowance in accordance with Section 15.4 hereof and the provisions of
the Escrow Agreement. In the case of a Fraud Claim or an inaccuracy or
breach of any of the Extended Representations, the Parent Indemnified Parties
may also (i) proceed directly against the Indemnifying Stockholders to recover
Damages and (ii) offset Damages against amounts otherwise payable to the
Indemnifying Stockholders as the First Optichron Earn-Out Consideration and
Second Optichron Earn-Out Consideration, _provided_ that any such amounts set-
off against the Total Optichron Earn-Out Consideration reduce the
consideration otherwise payable to every Indemnifying Stockholder by an equal
amount (basing the value of a share of Parent Common Stock issuable to the
Identified Employees for all purposes under this Section 14 on the Parent
Average Closing Price); _provided, however_ , that the liability of each
Indemnifying Stockholder shall not exceed the portion of the Total Optichron
Consideration actually received by such Indemnifying Stockholder; and
_provided further_ that, in the case of a claim for breach of any of the
Extended Representations, the liability of the Indemnifying Stockholders in
the aggregate shall not exceed the amount equal to (x) 25% of the Total
Optichron Consideration minus (y) the amount of Escrow Funds actually
recovered by Parent. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing
in this Section 14 shall in any way limit or qualify any right, claim or cause
of action, or Damages recoverable in connection therewith, that Parent may
have against any person in respect of fraud committed by such person in
respect or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, indemnification shall not
be available, and the Parent Indemnified Parties shall not otherwise have
recourse against the Escrow Funds, for Damages in respect of Parent Claims
made pursuant to Section 14.1(a) unless the total amount of Damages asserted
pursuant to all Parent Claims shall exceed $250,000 (the " _Threshold_ ") in
the 

 



55  aggregate, whereupon the total amount of all such Damages shall be
recoverable in accordance with the terms hereof; _provided, however,_ that the
Indemnifying Stockholders shall only be liable for any individual Damages
(that are not related to any other Damages) in excess of $25,000.

(c) Without limiting the rights of the Parent Indemnified Parties under the
Escrow Agreement or against the Escrow Funds, the liability of each
Indemnifying Stockholder for a Fraud Claim or an inaccuracy or breach of any
of the Extended Representations shall be several and not joint, and in no
event will an Indemnifying Stockholder have liability under this Agreement for
an amount in excess of such Indemnifying Stockholders Pro Rata Portion of the
Damages or in excess of the aggregate amount of Total Optichron Consideration
actually received by such Indemnifying Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement,
including, without duplication, the portion of any Escrow Funds distributed to
Parent that is allocable to such Indemnifying Stockholder based on
the Securityholder Schedule.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
party shall be liable to the other party for any special, punitive or
exemplary damages arising out of this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that
the foregoing shall not be construed to preclude recovery by a Parent
Indemnified Party in respect of any Damages either (i) directly incurred as a
result of a third party Action or (ii) relating to or in connection with any
Damages for which a Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 14.1(c).

 

(e) The maximum aggregate liability of Parent for any and all claims arising
out of this Agreement, other than with respect to (i) Parents payment
obligations under Section 2 and (ii) Parents obligations under Sections
6.2(a), 6.4 and 6.12 hereof, shall be $15,000,000. The maximum liability of
Parent arising out its failure to make any of the payments under Section 2
shall be the amount of such payment. The maximum liability of Parent for any
claim arising out of its breach of Section 6.12 shall be the unpaid portion of
the Total Optichron Earn-Out Consideration to which the claim relates.

The terms and conditions of this Section 14 constitute essential terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Merger, and approval of this Agreement
by the Company Stockholders shall constitute the express agreement of each
Indemnifying Stockholder with respect to the obligations of the Company
Stockholders and the limitations on Parents liability pursuant to this
Section 14\.

14.4 _Notification Certification of Claims_. If a Parent Indemnified Party is
of the opinion that any Parent Claim has occurred or will occur, an authorized
officer or representative of such Parent Indemnified Party, as applicable, may
so notify the Representative. Each such notice shall be in writing and shall
describe with reasonable specificity, and to the extent known by the
applicable Parent Indemnified Party, the nature and amount of such Parent
Claim.

14.5 _Third Party Actions_. In the event any Action is instituted against a
Parent Indemnified Party which involves or appears reasonably likely to
involve a Parent Claim for which indemnification may be sought, Parent will,
promptly after receipt of notice of any such Action, notify the Representative
(or, in the event indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from an
Indemnifying Stockholder, such Indemnifying Stockholder) of the commencement
thereof. The failure to so notify the Representative (or, in the event
indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from an Indemnifying
Stockholder, such Indemnifying Stockholder) of the commencement of any such
Action will not relieve the Indemnifying Stockholders from liability in
connection therewith, except to the extent that such failure materially and
adversely affects the ability of the Indemnifying Stockholders to defend their
interests in such Action. Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion
to assume and control the defense or settlement of such Action; _provided_
that the Representative (or, in the event indemnification is being sought
hereunder directly from an Indemnifying Stockholder, such Indemnifying
Stockholder) and its counsel (at such partys sole expense) may participate in
(but not control the conduct of) the defense of such Action; _provided
further_ that, no settlement of any such Action with third party
claimants shall be made without the written consent of the Representative
(or, in the event indemnification is being sought

 



56  hereunder directly from an Indemnifying Stockholder, such Indemnifying
Stockholder), which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. In the event
that the Representative has consented to any such settlement, the
Indemnifying Stockholders shall have no power or authority to object under any
provision of this Section 14 to the amount of any such Parent Claim against
the Escrow Funds, or against the Indemnifying Stockholders directly, as the
case may be, with respect to such settlement.

14.6 _Definition of Damages_.

 

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Damages_ " shall mean the
amount of any loss, claim, Tax, demand, damage, deficiency, liability,
judgment, fine, penalty, diminution in value, cost or expense (including,
without limitation, costs of investigation and reasonable attorneys,
consultants and experts fees and expenses) incurred, paid, accrued or
sustained by the Parent Indemnified Parties, whether or not involving an
Action, including, without limitation, any costs of defending any Actions or
enforcing the Parent Indemnified Partys rights under this Agreement.

 

(b) In the event that an Indemnifying Stockholder or Stockholders pay Damages
to a Parent Indemnified Party that are subsequently recovered pursuant to any
insurance policy by such Parent Indemnified Party, such Parent Indemnified
Party shall reimburse the Indemnifying Stockholder(s) the amount of such
recovery (up to the total amount paid with respect to such claim by
the Indemnifying Stockholder(s)). The indemnification amount with respect to
any Damages will be reduced by the Tax benefits actually realized by Parent in
respect of such Damages during the calendar year in which the Damages arise.

 

14.7 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. The Company Stockholders and
Parent agree to treat (and cause their affiliates to treat) any payments
received pursuant to Section 14 as adjustments to the Total Merger
Consideration for all Tax purposes, to the maximum extent permitted by Legal
Requirements.

 

14.8 _Transfer and Similar Taxes_. Any sales, use, transfer, gains, stamp,
duties, recording and similar Taxes incurred by the Company Stockholders as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, "
_Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be borne by the Company Stockholders.

 

14.9 _Exclusive Remedy_. Claims for indemnification, compensation and
reimbursement brought in accordance with and subject to this Section 14 shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy of any Parent Indemnitee for monetary damages
from and after the Closing with respect to this Agreement. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall
limit the rights of any Parent Indemnitee to seek or obtain injunctive relief
or any other equitable remedy to which such Parent Indemnitee is otherwise
entitled.

14.10 _Dispute Resolution_. Any dispute, controversy, or claim between Parent,
on the one hand, and the Indemnifying Stockholders or the Representative, on
the other hand, arising out of or relating to the provisions of this
Agreement that relates to Taxes or the amount of Earn-Out Consideration
payable pursuant to Section 2.6 that cannot be resolved by negotiations
between Parent and the Representative shall be submitted to Deloitte LLP (or
if such firm will not otherwise accept such engagement, such nationally
recognized accounting firm as may be mutually agreed by the parties) (the "
_Accounting Firm_ ") for resolution. The Accounting Firm shall control
the proceedings related to the dispute resolution and may request such
evidence and information as it deems necessary. The resolution reached by the
Accounting Firm shall be binding on the Indemnifying Stockholders, the
Representative, Parent and their respective affiliates. The expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by the Indemnifying Stockholders, on
the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 14.9, in the event of an alleged violation or breach
of this Agreement by a party (including, without limitation, unauthorized
disclosure of Confidential Information), the other party

 



57  may seek temporary injunctive relief from any court of competent
jurisdiction. In no event shall any such temporary injunctive relief continue
for more than 30 days. In addition, any claim by the Indemnifying
Stockholders or the Representative challenging the amount of Earn-Out
Consideration must be asserted by written notice to Parent within 30 days
after the delivery of the calculation specified in Section 2.6 to the
Representative. 

14.11 _Investigation; No Company Recourse_.

(a) The right to indemnification or any other remedy based on representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company or the Representative in
this Agreement, or any document, certificate or other instrument required to
be delivered by the Company or Representative under this Agreement shall not
be affected by any investigation conducted by any Parent Indemnified Party or
any other Person at any time, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being
acquired) by any Parent Indemnified Party or any other Person at any time,
whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
Effective Time, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of, or
compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

(b) An Indemnifying Stockholder shall have no right of contribution or other
recourse against the Company, or any of its respective directors, officers,
employees, affiliates, agents, attorneys, representatives, assigns or
successors, for any indemnification claims asserted by any Parent
Indemnified Parties, it being acknowledged and agreed that the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company are
solely for the benefit of the Parent Indemnified Parties.

 

SECTION 15\. _Representative_.

15.1 _Powers of the Representative_.

(a) The Representative shall have and may exercise all of the powers

to each Indemnifying Stockholder individually, as applicable), and to take any
and all action for and on behalf of the Indemnifying Stockholders, and each of
them, under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any other such agreement,
document or instrument; provided, however, that the Representative shall not

(vii) The power to take any actions in regard to such other matters as are
reasonably necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or as the Representative reasonably believes are in the best interests
of the Indemnifying Stockholders.

 

(b) The Representative represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that:

 

(i) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Representative
and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement
by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company and the subsequent approval of the

stockholders of the Company to the appointment of the Representative,
constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of the Representative,
enforceable against the Representative in accordance with its terms, subject
to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws of general
application affecting the rights and remedies of creditors, and to general
equity principles; and

(ii) The Escrow Agreement, when executed by the Representative following the

by the stockholders of the Company to the appointment of the Representative,
will be duly executed and delivered by the Representative and, assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery of the Escrow Agreement by Parent
and the Escrow Agent, constitute a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Representative, enforceable against the Representative in accordance with its
terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws of
general application affecting the rights and remedies of creditors, and to
general equity principles.

15.2 _Notices_. Any notice given to the Representative will constitute notice
to each and all of the Indemnifying Stockholders at the time notice is given
to the Representative. Any action taken by, or notice or instruction received
from, the Representative will be deemed to be action by, or notice or
instruction from, each and all of the Indemnifying Stockholders. Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company and the Surviving Corporation may, and the Escrow
Agent will, disregard any notice or instruction received from any one or more
individual Indemnifying Stockholders.

 



59 15.3 _Agreement of the Representative_. The Representative hereby agrees to do
such acts, and execute further documents, as shall be necessary to carry out
the provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

15.4 _Reimbursement and Liability of the Representative_.

(a) Subject to the terms and provisions of the Escrow Agreement and this
Section 15, each Indemnifying Stockholder agrees, in accordance with its
respective Pro Rata Portion, to reimburse the Representative for all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Representative in the
performance of his duties hereunder, including reasonable expenses incurred
prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement in relation to the engagement
of the Representative and the review or execution of the agreements related
to such engagement (" _Reimbursable Expenses_ "). Without limiting the
foregoing, the Representative shall have the right to engage legal counsel and
other professional advisers to assist it in the administration of
the Representatives duties hereunder (including the assessment, litigation
and/or settlement of any claims against the Escrow Fund), and any and all
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel and advisers shall be deemed
Reimbursable Expenses. Without limiting the foregoing, each Indemnifying
Stockholder agrees that the Representative may be reimbursed for Reimbursable
Expenses out of the Escrow Expense Allowance. The Representative is expressly
authorized to rely upon the advice of legal counsel and other professional
advisers engaged by him. The Representative shall be indemnified and held
harmless by the Indemnifying Stockholders in accordance with their respective
Pro Rata Portion from and against any Damages that may be incurred by the
Representative arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
performance of the Representatives duties or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, except as caused by the
Representatives gross negligence or willful misconduct, including the legal
costs and expenses of defending such Representative against any claim or
liability in connection with the acceptance or performance of the
Representatives duties or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Escrow Agreement. Parent shall not have any obligation or liability for
such expenses, costs or losses or for payment of any fees of the
Representative.

 

(b) The Representative shall not be personally liable as the Representative to
any Indemnifying Stockholder for any act done or omitted hereunder as
Representative while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable
judgment without gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Indemnifying
Stockholders shall severally (but not jointly) and in accordance with
their respective Pro Rata Portion indemnify the Representative and hold the
Representative harmless against any Damages incurred without negligence or bad
faith on the part of the Representative that arise from or as a result of the
acceptance or administration of the Representatives duties hereunder.

(c) If not paid directly to the Representative out of the Escrow Expense
Allowance or by the Indemnifying Stockholders, such expenses and Damages
referred to in subsections (a) and (b) above may be recovered by the
Representative from any Escrow Funds in excess of the Escrow Expense
Allowance, the First Merger Earn-Out Consideration or the Second Merger Earn-
Out Consideration but only if and when such funds are otherwise distributable
to the Company Stockholders (and not distributed or distributable to a Parent
Indemnitee) without the requirement of any consent or approval of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any other Person (and the Representative may provide
for such payment in any instruction delivered to the Escrow Agent or by
written instruction to Parent).

 

15.5 _Reliance on Representative_. Parent, Merger Sub, their respective
affiliates (including, without limitation, after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation) and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on the
appointment of David Liddle as Representative and treat such Representative as
the duly appointed attorney-in-fact of each Indemnifying Stockholder and as
having the duties, power and authority provided for in this Agreement. None of
Parent, Merger Sub, their respective affiliates (including, without
limitation, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) or the Escrow
Agent shall be liable to any Indemnifying Stockholder for any actions taken
or omitted by them in

 



60  reliance upon any instructions, notice or other instruments delivered by the
Representative. If the Representative shall be unable or unwilling to serve in
such capacity, his, her or its successor who shall serve and exercise the
powers of the Representative hereunder shall be appointed by a written
instrument signed by Indemnifying Stockholders holding a majority interest in
the Escrow Funds held in escrow at such time and, promptly thereafter, the
Representative shall notify Parent of the identity of such successor. The
letter of transmittal contemplated to be delivered by Section 2.8 shall
contain, among other things, a provision pursuant to which each
Company Stockholder that executes such letter of transmittal shall confirm
the appointment of the Representative.

SECTION 16.  _Release_. Each Company Stockholder who surrenders his, her or
its certificate(s) which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
shares of Company Stock and accepts payment of his, her or its portion of the
Total Merger Consideration upon conversion of the share(s) of Company Stock
formerly represented by such certificate(s) pursuant to Section 2 shall be
deemed to have, and hereby does, unconditionally release and forever discharge
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and any other subsidiary of Parent, including
their respective officers and directors, from (a) any and all obligations or
duties the Company might have to such Company Stockholder and (b) any and all
claims of liability, whether legal or equitable, of every kind and nature,
which such Company Stockholder ever had, now has or may claim against the
Company in each case arising out of facts or circumstances occurring at any

provisions set forth in this Agreement and made by or on behalf of any of the
parties hereto shall bind and inure to the benefit of the successors, heirs
and permitted assigns of such party, whether or not so expressed. None of the

_provided_ , that Parent and Merger Sub (including the Surviving Corporation)

such assignments in such forms as Parent or Merger Sub (including the
Surviving Corporation) may from time to time reasonably request. Any

17.3 _Interpretation_. For purposes of this Agreement, the following rules of
interpretation apply:

 

(a) _Descriptive Headings_. The headings of the sections and paragraphs of
this Agreement have been inserted for convenience of reference only and shall
not be deemed to be part of this Agreement.

(b) _Calculation of Time Period_. When calculating the period of time before
which, within which or following which any act is to be done or step taken
pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating
such period is excluded. If the last day of such period is a non-Business
Day, the period in question ends on the next succeeding Business Day.

(c) _Currency_. Any reference in this Agreement to $ means U.S. dollars.

(d) _Section and Similar References_. Unless the context otherwise requires,
all references in this Agreement to any "Section," "Schedule" or "Exhibit" are
to the corresponding Section, Schedule or Exhibit of this Agreement.

 

(e) _Mutual Drafting_. The parties hereto have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and have been represented by their
own legal counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, with the opportunity to seek advice as to their legal rights from
such counsel. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent
or interpretation arises, this Agreement is to be construed as jointly
drafted by the parties hereto and no presumption or

 



63  burden of proof is to arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of
the authorship of any provision of this Agreement or by reason of the extent
to which any such provision is inconsistent with any prior draft hereof.

17.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts.

 

17.5 _Facsimile_. The exchange of signature pages to this Agreement (in
counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile transmission or other electronic
transmission shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement _._

 

17.6 _Severability_. In the event that any one or more of the provisions
contained herein is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for
any reason in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of
any such provision in every other respect and of the remaining provisions
hereof shall not be in any way impaired or affected (so long as the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party), it being intended that each of
parties rights and privileges shall be enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, and any such invalidity,
illegality and unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction (so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party). If any court of
competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such court has the power to fashion and
enforce another provision (instead of the provision held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable) that is valid, legal and enforceable and carries out
the intentions of the parties hereto under this Agreement and, in the event
that such court does not exercise such power, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith in an attempt to agree to another provision (instead
of the provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) that is valid,
legal and enforceable and carries out the parties intentions to the greatest
lawful extent under this Agreement.

17.7 _Third Parties_. Except as specifically set forth or referred to herein,
nothing herein expressed or implied is intended or shall be construed to
confer upon or give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and their
permitted successors and assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason
of this Agreement or any other certificate, document, instrument or agreement
executed in connection herewith nor be relied upon other than the parties
hereto and their permitted successors or assigns. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Parent Indemnified Parties not
party hereto are entitled to the rights and remedies of third party
beneficiaries with respect to Section 14 and the Company Indemnified Parties
shall be third party beneficiaries of the provisions set forth in Section
6.4.

17.8 _Additional Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement, (a) an
individual will be deemed to have " _Knowledge_ " of a particular fact or
other matter if such individual is actually aware of such fact or other matter
or such individual would reasonably be expected to discover or otherwise
become aware of such fact or other matter after reasonable inquiry of those
employees who would be expected to have knowledge of the relevant matter, and
(b) an entity will be deemed to have "Knowledge" of a particular fact or
other matter if any individual who is currently serving as an officer of the
Company or any of the individuals listed on _Schedule 17.8_ has Knowledge of
such fact or other matter , (c) " _affiliate_ " and " _associate_ " have the
meanings ascribed to them under Rule 405 promulgated by the SEC under the
Securities Act, and (d) " _Business Day_ " means any day of the year on which
national banking institutions in the State of California are open to the
public for conducting business and are not required or authorized to close and
shall not include Saturday.

17.9 _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction_. This Agreement, and all
matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement and any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, the validity
hereof and the rights and obligations of the parties hereunder, shall be

 



64  construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of Delaware applicable
to contracts made and to be performed entirely in such state (without giving
effect to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof) except as to matters
pertaining to the Company as a Delaware corporation, and to the Company
Stockholders as stockholders of a Delaware corporation, which are governed by
the DGCL, and as to such matters, this Agreement shall be governed by the
DGCL. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any court of competent civil jurisdiction sitting in State of
Delaware over any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby and each party hereto hereby
irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such Action may be heard and
determined in such courts. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably waive any
objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of such
Action brought in such court or any claim that such Action brought in such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each of the parties hereto
agrees that a judgment in such Action may be enforced in other jurisdictions
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by any applicable
Legal Requirement. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably consents to
process being served by any party to this Agreement in any Action by delivery
of a copy thereof in accordance with the provisions of Section 17.1 and
consents to the exercise of jurisdiction of the courts of the State of
Delaware over it and its properties with respect to any action, suit or
proceeding arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or the enforcement of any rights under this
Agreement.

17.10 _Entire Agreement, Not Binding Until Executed_. This Agreement,
including the Disclosure Schedule, Schedules and Exhibits and the other
agreements referred to herein (including, without limitation, the Offer
Package Agreements and the Escrow Agreement), is complete, and all promises,
representations, understandings, warranties and agreements with reference to
the subject matter hereof, and all inducements to the making of
this Agreement relied upon by all the parties hereto, have been expressed
herein or in such Disclosure Schedule, Schedules, Exhibits or such other
agreements and this Agreement, including such Disclosure Schedule, Schedules,
Exhibits and such other agreements, supersede any prior understandings,
negotiations, agreements or representations by or among the parties, written
or oral, to the extent they related in any way to the subject matter hereof or
thereof, with the exception of the Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement by and
between Parent and the Company dated as of April 27, 2006 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which shall remain in full force and effect.
Neither this Agreement nor any of the terms or provisions hereof are binding
upon or enforceable against any party hereto unless and until the same is
executed and delivered by all of the parties hereto.

17.11 _Amendments; No Waiver_. Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, any
provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the Effective
Time if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed,
in the case of an amendment, by each of the parties hereto, or, in the case of
a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be effective; _provided_
that, after approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by the
Company Stockholders and without their further approval, no amendment or
waiver shall reduce the amount or change the kind of consideration to be
received in exchange for any share of Company Stock. No course of dealing and
no failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in exercising any right,
power or remedy conferred by this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof
or otherwise prejudice such partys rights, powers and remedies. The failure
of any of the parties to this Agreement to require the performance of a term
or obligation under this Agreement or the waiver by any of the parties to this
Agreement of any breach hereunder shall not prevent subsequent enforcement of
such term or obligation or be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach
hereunder. No single or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy
conferred by this Agreement shall preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. 

17.12 _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation_. Recognizing that Cooley
LLP (" _Cooley_ ") and Jeffrey Y. Suto, a Professional Corporation (" _Suto_
") have acted as legal counsel to the Company Stockholders and the Company and
its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, and that Cooley and Suto intend
to act as legal counsel to the former Company Stockholders after the
Effective Time, the

 



65  Company hereby waives, on its own behalf and agrees to cause its
Subsidiaries to waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection with Cooley
and Suto representing such former Company Stockholders after the Effective
Time.
