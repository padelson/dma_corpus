 THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of July 6, 2016 (this " _Agreement_ "), is made by and among Melrose Industries plc, a public limited company registered in England and Wales (" _Parent_ "), Nevada Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Acquisition Sub_ "), and Nortek, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). 

  

    
WITNESSETH 

  

 WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Parent and Acquisition Sub have unanimously approved and declared advisable the merger of Acquisition Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and approved the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and Acquisition Sub and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger; 

   

 WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has unanimously (i) determined that it is fair and advisable for Parent to acquire the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, (ii) approved this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), and (iii) determined to recommend that the stockholders of the Company accept the Offer and tender their shares of Common Stock into the Offer, in each case on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; 

   

 WHEREAS, pursuant to this Agreement, Acquisition Sub has agreed to commence a tender offer (the " _Offer_ ") to purchase any (subject to the Minimum Condition) and all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Common Stock_ "), at a price per share of Common Stock of $86.00 (such amount or any different amount per share of Common Stock that may be paid pursuant to an amended Offer, the " _Offer Price_ "), payable net to the seller in cash, without interest; 

  

 WHEREAS, following consummation of the Offer, Acquisition Sub will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent in accordance with the DGCL, and each share of Common Stock outstanding that is not tendered and accepted pursuant to the Offer (other than shares canceled pursuant to  _Section 3.1(a)_ hereof and Dissenting Shares) will thereupon be canceled and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price, in each case, on the terms and subject to conditions set forth in this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, the Merger shall be effected under Section 251(h) of the DGCL; and 

  

 WHEREAS, Parent has required, as a condition to its willingness to enter into this Agreement, that certain stockholders of the Company (the " _Major Company Stockholders_ ") each enter into a Tender and Support Agreement, dated as of the date hereof (each such agreement, a " _Support Agreement_ "), simultaneously herewith, pursuant to which, among other things, the Major Company Stockholders have agreed to tender their shares of Common Stock and take certain other actions in furtherance of the Merger, in each case on the terms and subject to the conditions provided for in the applicable Support Agreement. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual representations, warranties and covenants and subject to the conditions herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows: 

  

    
ARTICLE I 

DEFINITIONS 

  

    
 Section 1.1 _ Definitions. _ Defined terms used in this Agreement have the meanings ascribed to them by definition in this Agreement or in _Appendix A_.     

    
ARTICLE II 

THE OFFER AND THE MERGER 

  

    
 Section 2.1 _ The Offer. _ 

   

 (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof (and in any event on or before July 11, 2016), Acquisition Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to) commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act, the Offer to purchase all the outstanding Common Stock at a price per share equal to the Offer Price. The consummation of the Offer, and the obligation of Acquisition Sub to accept for payment and pay for any shares of Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer, shall be subject only to: (i) there being validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date that number of shares of Common Stock (excluding shares of Common Stock tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures but not yet delivered) which, together with the number of shares of Common Stock (if any) then owned by Parent or its Subsidiaries represents at least a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Common Stock (collectively, the " _Minimum Condition_ "); (ii) this Agreement not having been terminated in accordance with its terms (the " _Termination Condition_ "); and (iii) the satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or Acquisition Sub, of the other conditions and requirements set forth in _Annex I_ (together with the Minimum Condition and the Termination Condition, the " _Offer Conditions_ "). 

   

 (b) Subject to the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the Termination Condition and the satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or Acquisition Sub, of the other Offer Conditions, Acquisition Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to) accept for payment and pay for all shares of Common Stock validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer on or promptly after the applicable Expiration Date. Subject to _Section 3.7_, the Offer Price payable in respect of each share of Common Stock validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net to the seller in cash, without interest. 

  

 (c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ") that describes the terms and conditions of the Offer in accordance with this Agreement, including the Offer Conditions. Parent and Acquisition Sub expressly reserve the right to waive any of the Offer Conditions and to make any changes in the terms or conditions to the Offer; _provided_ that, unless previously approved by the Company in writing, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall not: (i) decrease the Offer Price, (ii) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) change the number of shares of Common Stock offered to be purchased in the Offer, (iv) amend or waive the Minimum Condition, the Termination Condition or the conditions set forth in clauses (b) or (c)(i) of _Annex I_, (v) add any condition to the Offer or any term that is adverse to the holders of Common Stock, (vi) extend the expiration of the Offer except as required or permitted by this  _Section 2.1_, (vii) provide for a "subsequent offering period" (or any extension thereof) in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act or (viii) modify, supplement or amend any other term or condition of the Offer in a manner adverse to the holders of Common Stock. 

  

 (d) Unless extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Offer shall expire at 02:00 a.m. (Eastern time) on August 31, 2016, _provided_ that in no event shall the Offer expire prior to the twentieth (20th) Business Day following the commencement of the Offer, as calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) of the Exchange Act (such time and date, the " _Initial Expiration Date_ "). If the Initial Expiration Date has been extended in accordance with this Agreement, the Offer shall expire at the time and on the date to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or such later time and date to which the Initial Expiration Date has been extended in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ "). 

        

 (e) If as of any then scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition has not been satisfied or, to the extent waivable by Parent or Acquisition Sub pursuant to this Agreement, waived by Parent or Acquisition Sub, Acquisition Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to) extend the Offer for successive periods of up to five (5) Business Days each, the length of each such period to be jointly determined by Parent and the Company in order to permit the satisfaction of the Offer Conditions; _provided_ , _however_ , that Acquisition Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer beyond 02:00 a.m. (Eastern time) on October 6, 2016 (the " _Outside Date_ "), unless at such time the proviso set forth in _Section 8.1(b)_ applies to Parent or Acquisition Sub. In addition, Acquisition Sub shall extend the Offer for any period or periods required by applicable Law or applicable rules, regulations, interpretations or positions of the SEC or its staff or Nasdaq or, in the event that a Supplementary Prospectus is required to be published during the period starting from Rights Admission and ending on the Rights Acceptance Date and the publication of such Supplementary Prospectus requires the Rights Acceptance Date to be extended beyond 6:00 a.m. (Eastern time) on August 23, 2016 pursuant to Section 87Q of the UK Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (as amended, modified or re-enacted from time to time), Acquisition Sub shall extend the Offer for a period of time equivalent to the period by which the Rights Acceptance Date is required to be extended. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Acquisition Sub be required to extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date, unless at such time the proviso set forth in _Section 8.1(b)_ applies to Parent or Acquisition Sub, and Acquisition Sub shall not extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date without the Company\'s consent. 

  

 (f) Acquisition Sub shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_, Acquisition Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to) promptly terminate the Offer and shall not acquire any shares of Common Stock tendered pursuant thereto. If the Offer is terminated by Acquisition Sub, or this Agreement is terminated prior to the Acceptance Time, Acquisition Sub shall promptly return, and shall cause any depositary acting on behalf of Acquisition Sub to promptly return, in accordance with applicable Law, all tendered shares of Common Stock that have not then been purchased in the Offer to the registered holders thereof. 

   

 (g) As soon as practicable on the date of the commencement of the Offer, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall: 

  

  

 (i) file with the SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-3 under the Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_"); 

  

 (ii) deliver a copy of the Schedule TO, including all exhibits thereto, to the Company at its principal executive offices in accordance with Rule 14d-3(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act; 

  

 (iii) give telephonic notice of the information required by Rule 14d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and mail by means of first class mail a copy of the Schedule TO, to Nasdaq in accordance with Rule 14d-3(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act; and 

  

 (iv) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to all holders of shares of Common Stock as and to the extent required by all applicable Laws, including the Exchange Act. 

  

  

 (h) The Schedule TO shall include as exhibits, the Offer to Purchase, a form of letter of transmittal, a form of summary advertisement, and a form of notice of guaranteed delivery, together with such other schedules or exhibits as may be required pursuant to the instructions to Schedule TO (the Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer shall be made, together with any amendments and supplements thereto, being referred to herein as the " _Offer Documents_ "). Subject to the provisions of _Section 6.4_, the Company consents to the inclusion of a description of the Company Recommendation in the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents. Parent 

        

and Acquisition Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand,
agree to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer
Documents, if and to the extent that such information shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable
Law, and Parent and Acquisition Sub agree to cause the Offer Documents, as
so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of shares
of Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by all applicable
Laws, including the Exchange Act. The Company and its counsel shall be given
a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents
before they are filed with the SEC, and Parent and Acquisition Sub shall give
due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by the Company and its counsel. In addition, Parent and Acquisition
Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel promptly with copies of any
written comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that Parent,
Acquisition Sub or their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents promptly
after receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. The
Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any
proposed written or oral responses to the Schedule TO and Offer Documents and
Parent and Acquisition Sub shall give due consideration to the reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its
counsel and to participate in any substantive telephonic communications with
the staff of the SEC related thereto.

  

    
 Section 2.2 _ Company Actions. _ 

  

    
 (a) _ Schedule 14D-9. _ To the extent reasonably practicable, concurrently with the filing by Acquisition Sub of the Schedule TO or as soon as practicable thereafter, the Company shall file with the SEC, in a manner that complies with Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") that shall contain the notice of appraisal rights to holders of shares of Common Stock and, subject to the provisions of _Section 6.4_, the Company Recommendation. The Company agrees to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to holders of shares of Common Stock, as and to the extent required by all applicable Laws, including the Exchange Act. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9, if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law, and the Company agrees to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of shares of Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by all applicable Laws, including the Exchange Act. Parent, Acquisition Sub and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC, and the Company shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, Acquisition Sub and their counsel. In addition, the Company shall provide Parent, Acquisition Sub and their counsel promptly with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. Parent, Acquisition Sub and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any proposed written or oral responses and the Company shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, Acquisition Sub and their counsel, and to participate in any substantive telephonic communications with the staff of the SEC related thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations of the Company in the preceding three sentences of this _Section 2.2(a)_ shall not apply from and after the time the Company Board effects a Company Change of Recommendation in accordance with _Section 6.4_. 

  

    
 (b) _ Company Information. _ From time to time as requested by Acquisition Sub or its agents, the Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished to Acquisition Sub mailing labels, security position listings, non-objecting beneficial owner lists and any other listings or computer files available to it 

        

containing the names and addresses of the record or beneficial owners of the
shares of Common Stock as of the most recent practicable date, and shall
promptly furnish Acquisition Sub with such information (including, but not
limited to, updated lists of holders of the shares of Common Stock and their
addresses, mailing labels, security position listings and non-objecting
beneficial owner lists) and such other assistance as Acquisition Sub or its
agents may reasonably request in communicating with the record and beneficial
holders of shares of Common Stock, in connection with the preparation and
dissemination of the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents and the solicitation
of tenders of shares of Common Stock in the Offer. Parent and Acquisition Sub
and their agents shall hold in confidence the information contained in any
such labels, listings and files, will use such information only in connection
with such transactions and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, will, upon
request, deliver, and will cause their agents to deliver, to the Company all
copies of such information then in their possession or control.

  

    
 (c) _ Acceptance Time. _ The Company shall register the transfer of shares of Common Stock accepted for payment effective immediately after the time at which Acquisition Sub accepts for payment shares of Common Stock tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the " _Acceptance Time_ "); _provided_ that Acquisition Sub pays for such shares of Common Stock at or promptly after such transfer. 

  

    
 Section 2.3 _ The Merger. _ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Acquisition Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the separate existence of Acquisition Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue under the name "Nortek, Inc." as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and shall continue to be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware. 

  

    
 Section 2.4 _ Closing. _ Subject to the satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ hereof, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place as promptly as practicable following consummation of the Offer, on a date to be specified by the parties hereto, but no later than the third (3rd) Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ hereof (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) at the offices of Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP, 767 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10153, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (such date being the " _Closing Date_ "). 

  

    
 Section 2.5 _ Effective Time. _ 

   

 (a) Concurrently with the Closing, the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall cause a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with respect to the Merger to be executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Secretary of State_ ") as provided under the DGCL.

ARTICLE III 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES 

  

    
 Section 3.1 _ Effect of the Merger on Securities. _ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Acquisition Sub or the holders of any securities of the Company or Acquisition Sub: 

  

   

 (a) _ Cancellation of Company Securities._ Each share of Common Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or held by Parent or Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time (including such shares of Common Stock that were accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer) shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in respect thereof. 

  

 (b) _ Conversion of Company Securities._ Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares canceled pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ hereof and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). The holders of certificates or book-entry shares which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Common Stock (respectively, the " _Certificates_ " and " _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Common Stock other than the right to receive, upon surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with _Section 3.2_ of this Agreement, the Merger Consideration, or, with respect to Dissenting Shares, the rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. 

  

 (c) _ Conversion of Acquisition Sub Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each share of common 

   

      

   

stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Acquisition Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
(1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

 (d) _ Adjustments._ Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement and other than as contemplated by this Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, the Offer Price and Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change; _provided_ that the Company may not effect such change except as permitted by this Agreement. 

   

  

    
 Section 3.2 _ Exchange of Certificates. _ 

  

    
 (a) _ Designation of Paying Agent; Deposit of Exchange Fund. _ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ "), the identity and the terms of appointment of which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, for the payment of the applicable Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.1(b)_. At or before the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, cash constituting an amount equal to the Total Common Merger Consideration (all cash deposited with the Paying Agent, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). At or immediately after the Effective Time, Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Corporation shall disburse in cash the amounts payable in respect of the Company Options pursuant to  _Section 3.3(a)_ and the Company Share Awards pursuant to _Section 3.3(b)_. In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by _Section 3.1(b)_, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. The Paying Agent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (i) held for the benefit of the holders of Common Stock and (ii) applied promptly to making the payments pursuant to _Section 3.2(c)_ hereof. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to _Section 3.2(c)_, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement. 

   

 (b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and in any event not later than the third Business Day thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented one or more outstanding shares of Common Stock (x) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and which shall be in the form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and (y) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration into which the number of shares of Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 (c) Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, which amount shall be paid as promptly as practicable, following the Paying Agent\'s receipt and acceptance of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or 

        

Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be forthwith canceled. The Paying Agent
shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions
as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in
accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or
accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares.

  

    
 (d) _ Termination of Exchange Fund. _ Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, and any such holders prior to the Merger who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation as general creditor thereof for payment of their claims for cash, without interest, to which such holders may be entitled. 

  

    
 (e) _ No Liability. _ None of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

  

    
 (f) _ Investment of Exchange Fund. _ The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ that (i) no such investment shall relieve Parent or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this  _Article III_, and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Common Stock in the amount of such losses and (ii) no such investment shall have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement. Any interest or income produced by such investments will become a part of the Exchange Fund. 

  

    
 Section 3.3 _ Treatment of Equity Awards. _ 

  

    
 (a) _ Treatment of Company Options. _ As of the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding and unexercised, whether vested or unvested, as of the Effective Time (each, a " _Company Option_ "), shall be canceled by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of any Company Option, in consideration for the right to receive a cash payment with respect thereto equal to _the product of_ (i) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Company Option as of the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Common Stock subject to such Company Option as of the Effective Time (the " _Option Cash Payment_ "), less applicable Taxes required to be withheld. For the avoidance of doubt, if the exercise price per share of Common Stock subject to a Company Option as of the Effective Time equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall be cancelled for no consideration as of the Effective Time, and the holder thereof shall have no further rights with respect thereto. The Option Cash Payment will be made promptly (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days) following the Effective Time. 

  

    
 (b) _ Treatment of Company Share Awards. _ As of the Effective Time, each Company Share Award (or portion thereof) that is outstanding as of the Effective Time, shall be canceled by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of any Company Share Award, in consideration for the right to receive a cash payment with respect thereto equal to _the product of_ (i) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Company Share Award (or in the case of any Company Share Award subject to performance-based vesting, 50% of the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Company Share Award) as of the Effective Time and (ii) the Merger Consideration (the " _Company Share Award Cash Payment_ "), less applicable Taxes required to be withheld. The Company Share Award Cash Payment will be made promptly (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days) following the Effective Time. 

       

                                    

    

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions as may be reasonably necessary to effectuate the actions contemplated by this  _Section 3.3_, contingent on the Closing of the Merger. 

  

    
 Section 3.4 _ Lost Certificates. _ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this _Article III_. 

  

    
 Section 3.5 _ Dissenting Shares. _ Notwithstanding _Section 3.1(b)_, to the extent that holders thereof are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall have the rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his or her right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, such holder\'s shares of Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and such shares shall not thereafter be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. 

   

    
 Section 3.6 _ Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights. _ After the Effective Time, there shall be no registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer following the Effective Time, they shall be canceled against delivery of the applicable Merger Consideration, as provided for in this _Article III_, for each share of Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates. All cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporation\'s obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have been authorized by the Company in compliance with this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. 

  

    
 Section 3.7 _ Withholding Rights. _ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause to be deducted and withheld) from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by or on behalf of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made and shall be paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority on such person\'s behalf. 

  

    
 Section 3.8 _ Subsequent Actions. _ The parties agree to take all necessary action to cause the Merger to become effective as promptly as practicable following the Offer Closing without a meeting of the Company\'s stockholders, as provided in Section 251(h) of the DGCL.

 Section 6.3 _ Access to Information; Confidentiality. _ 

  

 (a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company will (i) provide to Parent and its officers, directors, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, investment bankers, financing banks, agents and other representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") reasonable access during normal business hours to the Company\'s employees, properties, books, commitments, contracts and records and other information (including Tax Returns) as Parent may reasonably request regarding the business, assets, liabilities, employees and other aspects of the Company and instruct the Company\'s independent accountants to provide access to their work papers and such other information as Parent and Acquisition Sub may reasonably request and (ii) permit Parent and Acquisition Sub to make such inspections as they reasonably require; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to provide access to any information or documents which would, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, (A) constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other privilege held by the Company, (B) would violate an existing confidentiality obligation to or agreement with any person; or (C) otherwise violate any applicable Laws, _provided further_ , that in the event any of the foregoing clauses (A) - (C) apply the parties shall work together in good faith to attempt to mitigate such restrictions so as to endeavor to find a way to allow disclosure of such information in a manner that would not constitute such a waiver or otherwise result in a violation of such an agreement or applicable Laws. Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section 6.3_ shall be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or result in damage or destruction of any property or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 Section 6.4 _ Company Non-Solicitation; Company Change of Recommendation. _ 

  

 (a) The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with any persons that may be ongoing with respect to a Competing Proposal and, until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_, not, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage any inquiry or proposal with respect to the making of a Competing Proposal; (ii) participate in any negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any nonpublic information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with any person with respect to, any Competing Proposal; (iii) engage in discussions with any person with respect to any Competing Proposal; (iv) approve or recommend any Competing Proposal; (v) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any agreement or commitment providing for any Competing Proposal; (vi) take any action to make the provisions of any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business combination" or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation, or any restrictive provision of any applicable anti-takeover provision in the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company, inapplicable to any person other than Parent and its Affiliates or to any transactions constituting or contemplated by a Competing Proposal or (vii) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing or otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt by any person to make a Competing Proposal. The Company shall promptly after the date hereof (x) revoke or withdraw access of any person other than Parent and its Representatives to any data room (virtual or actual) containing any non-public information with respect to the Company or its 

        

Subsidiaries previously furnished with respect to a Competing Proposal and
(y) instruct each person other than Parent and its Representatives that has
executed a confidentiality agreement (other than the Confidentiality
Agreement) relating to a Competing Proposal or potential Competing Proposal
with or for the benefit of the Company promptly to return to the Company or
destroy all information, documents, and materials relating to the Competing
Proposal or to the Company or its businesses, operations or affairs heretofore
furnished by the Company or any of its Representatives to such person or any
of its Representatives in accordance with the terms of any confidentiality
agreement with such person, and shall use reasonable best efforts to enforce,
and not waive without Parent\'s prior written consent, any standstill or
similar provision in any confidentiality or other agreement with such person;
_provided_ that if the Company Board determines in good faith that it would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law not to do
so, at any time prior to the Window Shop Deadline, the Company may waive any
standstill or similar provisions in its agreements to the extent necessary to
permit a person to make a Competing Proposal, conditioned upon such person
agreeing to disclosure of such Competing Proposal to Parent and Acquisition
Sub, in each case as contemplated by and subject to compliance with this
_Section 6.4_.

  

 (b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 6.4(a)_, if after the date hereof the Company receives a bona fide written Competing Proposal that did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.4_ at any time prior to the Window Shop Deadline, but not after, which (i) constitutes a Superior Proposal or (ii) which the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with the Company\'s outside legal and financial advisors could reasonably be expected to result, after the taking of any of the actions referred to in either of clause (x) or (y) below, in a Superior Proposal, the Company may take the following actions: (x) furnish information to the third party making such Competing Proposal (provided, that substantially concurrently the Company makes available such information to Parent to the extent such information was not previously made available to Parent) and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party with respect to the Competing Proposal, in each case of clauses (x) and (y), if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such information, the Company receives from the third party an executed confidentiality agreement on terms no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than the Confidentiality Agreement (an " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "), a copy of which shall be provided for informational purposes only to Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement need not include any standstill or similar provision; and _provided further_ , _however_ , as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Company taking such actions as described in clauses (x) and (y) above, the Company shall provide written notice to Parent of such determination of the Company Board pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) above. From and after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall notify Parent of the receipt of any Competing Proposal, and (A) if it is in writing, deliver to Parent a copy of such Competing Proposal and any related draft agreements and other written material setting forth the terms and conditions of such Competing Proposal and the identity of the person making such Competing Proposal or (B) if oral, provide to Parent a detailed summary of the material terms and conditions thereof including the identity of the person making such Competing Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt and timely basis of the status and material details of any such Competing Proposal and with respect to any material change to the terms of any such Competing Proposal. The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into any confidentiality agreement with any person following the date of this Agreement that prohibits the Company from providing such information to Parent or otherwise complying with the terms of this Agreement. 

   

 (c) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 6.4(d)_, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof may (i) withdraw or withhold, amend, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition Sub the Company Recommendation or make any public announcement inconsistent with the Company Recommendation, or publicly propose to do any of the foregoing, (ii) approve, adopt, endorse, or recommend any Competing Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal (it being understood that the Company 

        

may make any factually accurate public statement that solely describes the
Company\'s receipt of a Competing Proposal and the operation of this Agreement
with respect thereto or any "stop, look and listen" communication or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act
provided that any such disclosure includes the Company Recommendation
without disclosing or effecting a Company Change of Recommendation), (iii)
following the date any Competing Proposal or any material modification thereto
is first made public, sent or given to the stockholders of the Company, fail
to issue a press release that expressly reaffirms the Company Recommendation
within five (5) Business Days following the Company\'s receipt of Parent\'s
written request to do so (which request may only be made once with respect to
any such Competing Proposal and each material modification thereto), (iv) fail
to include the Company Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9, or (v) except as
expressly contemplated by _Section 6.4(d)_, _Section 6.4(f)_ or, if
applicable,  _Section 6.4(g)_ cause or permit the Company to enter into any
contract, letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, or agreement in
principle regarding or providing for any Competing Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) or requiring the Company to abandon,
terminate, materially delay or fail to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any action described in clause
(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v), whether taken by the Company, the Company Board
or any committee thereof, being referred to as a " _Company Change of
Recommendation_ ").

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if an event, fact, circumstance, development, change or occurrence that materially affects the business, assets or operations of the Company and that is unknown to the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement and reasonably should not have been known as of the date of this Agreement (such event, fact, circumstance, development, change or occurrence, a " _Company Intervening Event_ ", but in no event shall a Competing Proposal or the making thereof be a Company Intervening Event) becomes known to the Company Board, the Company Board may make a Company Change of Recommendation, if the Company Board has determined in good faith after consultation with the Company\'s outside legal advisors that the failure of the Company Board to make such Company Change of Recommendation would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with the directors\' exercise of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Company Change of Recommendation may only be made (i) if the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent in advance of its intention to make a Company Change of Recommendation, including a description of the Company Intervening Event and the reasons for the Company Change of Recommendation (it being understood that the delivery of such notice shall not, in and of itself, be deemed a Company Change of Recommendation) and (ii) at a time that is after the third (3rd) Business Day following the Company\'s delivery to Parent of such notice, during which time Parent shall be entitled to deliver to the Company one or more proposals for amendments to this Agreement and, if requested by Parent, the Company shall negotiate with Parent in good faith with respect thereto, if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company\'s outside legal advisors, taking into account all amendments or revisions to this Agreement proposed by Parent, that the failure of the Company Board to make such Company Change of Recommendation still would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with the directors\' exercise of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law. 

  

 (e) Nothing in this _Section 6.4_ shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or its Subsidiaries from complying with Rule 14e-2, Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or to prohibit the Company from making any disclosure if the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with the Company\'s outside legal advisors that the failure to do so would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with the directors\' exercise of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law, nor shall any such action be deemed to constitute a breach of the Company\'s obligations under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 6.4(e)_ shall permit the Company to effect a Company Change of Recommendation (including in compliance with Rule 14e-2, 

        

Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange
Act or other applicable Law) without complying with _Section 6.4(d)_.

  

 (f) Except as provided in _Section 6.4(g)_ and notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if at any time prior to 2:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on Saturday, August 6, 2016 (the " _Termination Intent Notice Deadline_ "), the Company receives a Competing Proposal which the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal, then the Company Board may cause the Company to terminate this Agreement and enter into a binding written agreement (a " _Superior Proposal Agreement_ ") with respect to such Superior Proposal at any time prior to (but not after) 11:59 p.m. (Eastern time) on Saturday, August 6, 2016 (the " _Window Shop Deadline_ ") pursuant to _Section 8.1(i)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that such termination shall only be effective if: (i) the Company shall have (x) complied with this _Section 6.4_ in all material respects and (y) provided written notice to Parent no later than the Termination Intent Notice Deadline of the Company\'s intention to terminate this Agreement, which notice shall include the terms of the Superior Proposal, including the final draft of the Superior Proposal Agreement and the identity of the person making such Competing Proposal (the " _Termination Intent Notice_ "); (ii) except to the extent provided in _Section 6.4(g)_, during the three (3) Business Day period immediately following the Company\'s delivery to Parent of the Termination Intent Notice (the " _Negotiation Period_ "), the Company shall have, if requested by Parent, negotiated in good faith with respect to any proposals for amendments to this Agreement made by Parent; (iii) except to the extent provided in _Section 6.4(g)_, within one (1) Business Day following the expiration of the Negotiation Period, the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with the Company\'s outside legal and financial advisors, taking into account all amendments or revisions to this Agreement proposed by Parent, that the Competing Proposal remains a Superior Proposal; (iv) the Company has paid the Company Termination Fee to Parent upon the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (in the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(i)_ on August 6, 2016, the Company Termination Fee shall be payable on August 8, 2016 in accordance with _Section 6.4(g)_); and (v) the Company enters into such Superior Proposal Agreement substantially concurrently with the termination of this Agreement (and in any event prior to the Window Shop Deadline). Any material amendment to such Competing Proposal, including any revision to price, shall require the Company to deliver to Parent a new Termination Intent Notice and again comply with the requirements of this  _Section 6.4(f)_ with respect to such revised Competing Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of such material amendment delivered after the initial Negotiation Period, the subsequent Negotiation Period shall expire one (1) Business Day following the date of Parent\'s receipt of such new Termination Intent Notice with respect to such revised Competing Proposal. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) a new Termination Intent Notice may not be made after the Termination Intent Notice Deadline, and (ii) the Company may simultaneously give notice of its intention both to make a Company Change of Recommendation and to terminate this Agreement to enter into a Superior Proposal Agreement and the notice and negotiation periods set forth in _Section 6.4(d)_ and this _Section 6.4(f)_ may pass simultaneously. 

  

 (g) In the event that the Company provides a Termination Intent Notice to Parent prior to the Termination Intent Notice Deadline and the Negotiation Period with respect to such Termination Intent Notice would not expire prior to the Window Shop Deadline but for the operation of this _Section 6.4(g)_, then: (i) the Negotiation Period shall expire at 7:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on August 6, 2016; and (ii) the determination to be made by the Company Board pursuant to clause (iii) of  _Section 6.4(f)_ must be made in advance of the Window Shop Deadline. In the event that, in accordance with _Section 6.4(f)_, the Company Board causes the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(i)_ on August 6, 2016, it shall be a condition subsequent to the effectiveness of such termination that the Company has paid the Company Termination Fee to Parent on August 8, 2016. 

        

 (h) As used in this Agreement, " _Competing Proposal_ " shall mean any bona fide proposal (other than a proposal or offer by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) for (i) any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, issuance of securities, direct or indirect acquisition of securities, recapitalization, tender offer, exchange offer or other similar transaction in which (x) a person or "group" (as defined in the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder) of persons directly or indirectly acquires, or if consummated in accordance with its terms would acquire, beneficial or record ownership of securities representing more than 20% of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of the Company; or (y) the Company issues securities representing more than 20% of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of the Company; (ii) any direct or indirect sale, lease, exchange, transfer, acquisition or disposition of any assets of the Company and of the Subsidiaries of the Company that constitute or account for (x) more than 20% of the consolidated net revenues of the Company, consolidated net income of the Company or consolidated book value of the Company; or (y) more than 20% of the fair market value of the assets of the Company or (iii) any liquidation or dissolution of the Company. 

  

 (i) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a Competing Proposal made after the date hereof (with all percentages in clause (i) of the definition of Competing Proposal increased to fifty percent (50%) and clause (ii) of such definition being deemed to refer to any direct or indirect sale, lease, exchange, transfer, acquisition or disposition of any assets of the Company and of the Subsidiaries of the Company that constitute all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) that did not result from a breach of _Section 6.4(a)_ or _(b)_ and that is fully financed on terms that the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company\'s outside financial and legal advisors, would be more favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, after taking into account any proposal by Parent in writing to amend or modify the terms hereof and all factors the Company Board acting in good faith considers to be appropriate, including (i) the identity of the person making such Competing Proposal and (ii) the consideration, terms, conditions, timing, likelihood of consummation, financing terms and legal, financial, and regulatory aspects of such Competing Proposal.

 (h) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 6.5(d)_, neither the Parent Board nor any committee thereof may (i) withdraw or withhold, amend, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to the Company the Parent Recommendation or make any public announcement inconsistent with the Parent Recommendation, or publicly propose to do any of the foregoing, (ii) fail to include the Parent Recommendation in the Parent Circular, (iii) not publish the Parent Circular and the Prospectus substantially in the forms, respectively, of the Agreed Parent Circular and the Agreed Prospectus by July 6, 2016 or not hold the Parent General Meeting on or prior to July 25, 2016 (other than (A) where the same results from a breach by the Company of its obligations hereunder, (B) as a consequence of an event that can reasonably be considered to be a force majeure event or an emergency adjournment, _provided_ that the meeting is promptly reconvened and Parent complies with clause (ii) of  _Section 6.5(c)_ above or (C) as the Company and Parent may otherwise agree); (iv) cause or allow Acquisition Sub not to file the Offer Documents (with terms and conditions as agreed in this Agreement) with the SEC on or before July 11, 2016 (other than (A) where the same results from a breach by the Company of its obligations hereunder, (B) as a consequence of an event that can reasonably be considered to be a force majeure event or emergency, _provided_ that the Offer Documents are then published as soon as reasonable practicable or (C) as the Company and Parent may otherwise agree); or (v) except as expressly contemplated by  _Section 6.5(i)_ cause or permit Parent to enter into any contract, letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, or agreement in principle requiring Parent to abandon, terminate, materially delay or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any action described in clause (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v), whether taken by Parent, the Parent Board or any committee thereof, being referred to as a " _Parent Change of Recommendation_ "). 

  

 (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to the time the Parent Shareholder Approval is obtained, if an event, fact, circumstance, development, change or occurrence that is a continuing Company Material Adverse Effect or that materially affects the business, assets or operations of Parent and that is unknown to the Parent Board as of the date of this Agreement and reasonably should not have been known as of the date of this Agreement (such event, fact, circumstance, development, change or occurrence, a " _Parent Intervening Event_ ") becomes known to the Parent Board, the Parent Board may make a Parent Change of Recommendation, if the Parent Board has determined in good faith after consultation with Parent\'s outside legal advisors that the failure of the Parent Board to make such Parent Change of Recommendation would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with the directors\' exercise of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Parent Change of Recommendation may only be made (i) if Parent shall have provided prior written notice to the Company in advance of its intention to make a Parent 

        

Change of Recommendation, including a description of the Parent Intervening
Event and the reasons for the Parent Change of Recommendation (it being
understood that the delivery of such notice shall not, in and of itself, be
deemed a Parent Change of Recommendation) and (ii) at a time that is after the
third (3rd) Business Day following Parent\'s delivery to the Company of such
notice, during which time the Company shall be entitled to deliver to Parent
one or more proposals for amendments to this Agreement and, if requested by
the Company, Parent shall negotiate with the Company in good faith with
respect thereto, if the Parent Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with Parent\'s outside legal advisors, taking into account all
amendments or revisions to this Agreement proposed by the Company, that the
failure of the Parent Board to make such Parent Change of Recommendation still
would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with the directors\' exercise
of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Parent shall be entitled to
adjourn the Parent General Meeting in accordance with paragraph (i) of 
_Section 6.5(c)_ in the event that such notice referred to in the preceding
sentence is delivered three Business Days or less prior to the date of the

 Section 6.6 _ Directors\' and Officers\' Indemnification and Insurance. _ 

  

 (a) Parent and Acquisition Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), now existing in favor of any Indemnitee as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or the By-laws (or comparable organization documents) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or in any agreement shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect with respect to such Indemnitee. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) for a period of six years from and after the Effective Time (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and advance expenses to, Indemnitees with respect to all acts or omissions by them, in their capacities as such, occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware Law and (ii) not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws (or equivalent organizational documents) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement and any indemnification agreement of the Company or its Subsidiaries or other applicable contract that has been made available to Parent as in effect on the date of this Agreement in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnitees. 

  

 (b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 6.6(a)_, during the period commencing as of the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware Law: (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Indemnitee against and from any costs or expenses (including attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to: (A) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnitee\'s capacity as a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries occurring or alleged to have occurred at any time before or after the Effective Time; or (B) the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement and any transactions contemplated hereby; and (ii) pay in advance of the final disposition of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation the expenses (including attorneys\' fees) of any Indemnitee upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be finally determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this  _Section 6.6(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation for which indemnification may be sought under this _Section 6.6(b)_ unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all Indemnitees from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. 

       

                                    

    

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, in consultation with Parent, or, if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Acceptance Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of the directors\' and officers\' liability coverage of the Company\'s existing directors\' and officers\' insurance policies and the Company\'s existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, the " _D andO Insurance_"), for a claims reporting or discovery period of six years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period or time at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company\'s current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than (and otherwise comparable to) the coverage provided under the Company\'s existing policies; _provided_ , that the premium for such "tail" insurance shall not exceed 300% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company. If the Company or the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with the Company\'s current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company\'s current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Company\'s existing policies as of the date hereof, or (ii) Parent will provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time, the Indemnitees who are insured under the Company\'s DandO Insurance with comparable DandO Insurance that provides coverage for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company\'s current insurance carrier, that is no less favorable than the existing policy of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance; _provided further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount; and _provided_ , _further_ that Parent may substitute therefor policies of an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company\'s current insurance carrier, containing terms (including with respect to coverage and amounts) and conditions (including with respect to deductibles and exclusions) that are no less favorable to any Indemnitee than the coverage provided under the Company\'s existing policies. 

  

 (d) The Indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.6_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this  _Section 6.6_. The provisions of this _Section 6.6_ are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee and his or her successors, heirs or representatives. Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys\' fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnitee in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 6.6_. 

  

 (e) The rights of each Indemnitee under this _Section 6.6_ shall be in addition to any rights such person may have under the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Law or insurance policy or under any agreement of any Indemnitee with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

 (f) Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section 6.6_ or _Section 9.6_ hereof to the contrary, this _Section 6.6_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnitees and their successors, heirs or representatives.

forth in this _Section 6.6_.

The delivery of any notice pursuant to this  _Section 6.7_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the representations or warranties or covenants of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereunder.

With respect to any such public statements to be delivered orally by or on behalf of Parent or the Company, including by conference call or webcast, this _Section 6.8_ shall be deemed satisfied if, to the extent practicable, the disclosing party gives advance notice of such disclosure to the other party, including copies of any talking points, scripts or similar documents, and consults with the other party and considers in good faith any comments provided by such other party with respect thereto; _provided_ , _further_ that the prior agreement of the other party shall be required with respect to such disclosures to the extent that the non-disclosing party reasonably determines that any disclosure would be materially adverse to the non-disclosing party and it is reasonably practicable for the disclosing party to seek such prior consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.8_ shall not apply to any public statement made or proposed to be made by the Company or Parent in connection with or following a Company Change of Recommendation or Parent Change of Recommendation.

Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the Offer and the Merger be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Any person seeking indemnification under this Article VII shall be deemed to have met the standard of conduct for such indemnification unless the contrary shall be established. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article VII, the Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee seeking indemnification in connection with any action, suit, proceeding, claim or counterclaim, or part thereof, initiated by an Indemnitee unless the initiation thereof was approved by the Board of Directors of the Corporation or the initiation thereof relates to the enforcement by such Indemnitee of rights under Article VI or this Article II.

 Section 7.3 _ Subsequent Amendment. _ No amendment, termination or repeal of this Article VII or of the relevant provisions of the General Corporation Law or any other applicable laws shall affect or diminish in any way the rights of any Indemnitee to indemnification under the provisions hereof with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or claim arising out of or relating to any actions, omissions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the final adoption of such amendment, termination or repeal.

any actions, omissions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the date of
such merger or consolidation.

MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS 

  

    
 Section 1.1 _ Annual Meeting. _ A meeting of stockholders shall be held annually for the election of directors and the transaction of such other business as is related to the purpose or purposes set forth in the notice of meeting on such date and at such time as may be fixed by the Board of Directors; or if no date and time are so fixed, at 10:00 A.M. on the first Wednesday in May in each and every year, unless such day shall fall on a legal holiday, in which case such meeting shall be held on the next succeeding business day, at such time as may be fixed by the Board of Directors. 

  

    
 Section 1.2 _ Special Meetings. _ Special meetings of the stockholders for any purpose may be called by the Board of Directors, the President or the Secretary, and shall be called by the President or the Secretary at the written request of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting. Special meetings shall be held at such time as may be fixed in the call and stated in the notices of meeting or waiver thereof. At any special meeting only such business may be transacted as is related to the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is convened. 

  

    
 Section 1.3 _ Place of Meetings. _ Meetings of stockholders shall be held at such place, within or without the State of Delaware or the United States of America, as may be fixed in the call and stated in the notice of meeting or waiver thereof. 

  

    
 Section 1.4 _ Notice of Meetings; Adjourned Meetings. _ Notice of each meeting of stockholders shall be given in writing and shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting. The purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called shall be stated in the notice of each special meeting and of each annual meeting at which any business other than the election of directors is to be transacted. 

  

 A copy of the notice of any meeting shall be given, personally or by mail, not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting, to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice is given when deposited in the United States mail, with postage thereon prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the record of stockholders. 

  

 When a meeting is adjourned for less than thirty (30) days in any one adjournment, it shall not be necessary to give any notice of the adjourned meeting if the time and place to which the meeting is adjourned are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, and at the adjourned meeting any business may be transacted that might have been transacted on the original date of the meeting. When a meeting is adjourned for thirty (30) days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original meeting. 

   

    
 Section 1.5 _ Waiver of Notice. _ The transactions of any meeting of stockholders, however called and with whatever notice, if any, are as valid as those at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if: (a) all the stockholders entitled to vote are present in person or by proxy and no objection to 

        

holding the meeting is made by any stockholder; or if (b) a quorum is present
either in person or by proxy and no objection to holding the meeting is made
by anyone so present, and if, either before or after the meeting, each of the
persons entitled to vote, not present in person or by proxy, signed a written
waiver of notice, or a consent to the holding of the meeting, or an approval
of the action taken as shown by the minutes thereof.

  

 Whenever notice is required to be given to any stockholder, a written waiver thereof signed by such stockholder, whether before or after the time thereon stated, shall be deemed equivalent to such notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting of stockholders shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when such stockholder attends for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any meeting of stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice thereof. 

  

    
 Section 1.6 _ Qualification of Voters. _ Except as may be otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, every stockholder of record shall be entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of stockholders for every share standing in his name on the record of stockholders. 

  

    
 Section 1.7 _ Quorum. _ At any meeting of the stockholders the presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote thereat shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business. When a quorum is once present to organize a meeting, it is not broken by the subsequent withdrawal of any stockholders. The stockholders present may adjourn the meeting despite the absence of a quorum. 

  

    
 Section 1.8 _ Proxies. _ Every stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for him by proxy.

Every proxy shall be revocable at the pleasure of the stockholder executing it, except as otherwise provided therein and as permitted by law. Except as otherwise provided in the proxy, any proxy holder may appoint in writing a substitute to act in his place. 

  

    
 Section 1.9 _ Voting. _ Except as otherwise required by law, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders by the holders of shares entitled to vote in the election. Whenever any corporate action, other than the election of directors, is to be taken by vote of the stockholders at a meeting, it shall, except as otherwise required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, be authorized by a majority of the votes cast thereat, in person or by proxy. 

   

    
 Section 1.10 _ Action Without a Meeting. _ Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting or by vote, such action may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, by consent in writing setting forth the action so taken, signed by the holders of outstanding shares having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing. 

  

    
 Section 1.11 _ Record Date. _ The Board of Directors is authorized to designate a day, not more than sixty (60) days nor less than ten (10) days prior to the day of holding any meeting of stockholders as the day as of which those stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, such meeting shall be determined; and only stockholders of record on such day shall be entitled to notice or to vote at such meeting. 

  

    
 Section 1.12 _ List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote. _ The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and 

        

showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered
in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of
any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary
business hours, for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting, either
at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held (which place shall
be specified in the notice of the meeting), or, if not so specified, at the
place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and
kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and
may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.

  

    
 Section 1.13 _ Inspectors of Election. _ The Chairman of any meeting of the stockholders may appoint one or more Inspectors of Election. Any Inspector so appointed to act at any meeting of the stockholders, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall be sworn faithfully to execute the duties of an Inspector at such meeting with strict impartiality, and according to the best of his or her ability.

 (a) The material facts as to his relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of Directors or the committee, and the Board or committee in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors be less than a quorum; or
