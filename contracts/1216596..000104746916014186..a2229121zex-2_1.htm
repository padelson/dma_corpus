<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the board of directors of the Company (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Company Board</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") has unanimously (i)&nbsp;determined that it is fair and advisable
for Parent to acquire the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, (ii)&nbsp;approved this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, in accordance with the General

<U>Section&nbsp;3.1(a)</U> hereof and Dissenting Shares) will thereupon be canceled and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price, in each
case, on the terms and subject to conditions set forth in this Agreement; </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Merger shall be effected under Section&nbsp;251(h) of the DGCL; and </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
