participating in any Claim in advance of the final disposition of such Claim, including payment on behalf of or advancement to
the Indemnified Party of any Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect
to such indemnification and/or advancement, in each case without the requirement of any bond or other security, but in the case
of advancement of Expenses upon receipt of an undertaking, to the extent required by applicable law, from such Indemnified Party
to repay such advanced Expenses if it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final order that such Indemnified
Party was not entitled to indemnification hereunder with respect to such Expenses. In the event any Claim is brought against any
Indemnified Party, Parent and the Surviving Company shall each use all commercially reasonable efforts to assist in the vigorous
defense of such matter, provided that neither Parent nor the Surviving Company shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry
of any judgment in any Claim (in which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder) without the prior
written consent of such Indemnified Party if and to the extent the claimant seeks any non-monetary relief (including any admission
of liability or guilt) from such Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Indemnified Party shall be entitled to control
the defense of any action, suit, investigation or proceeding with counsel of its own choosing reasonably acceptable to Parent
and Parent and the Surviving Company shall cooperate in the defense thereof; <I>provided,</I> that Parent shall not be liable
for the fees of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties, other than local counsel, unless a conflict of interest shall
be caused thereby. The indemnification and advancement obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company pursuant to this <U>Section

but not limited to, any acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement by the Company Board and

the Indemnified Parties are entitled to the benefits of this <U>Section&nbsp;7.6</U>, the burden of proof shall be on Parent and
the Surviving Company to establish that an Indemnified Party is not so entitled. As used in this <U>Section 7.6(a)</U>, (A) the
term &ldquo;<B><I>Claim</I></B>&rdquo; means any threatened, asserted, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, or any
inquiry or investigation, whether instituted by the Company, any Governmental Entity or any other party, that any Indemnified
Party in good faith believes might lead to the institution of any such action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative,
investigative or other, including any arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution mechanism, arising out of or pertaining

Subsidiaries, any employee benefit plan maintained by any of the foregoing at or prior to the Effective Time and any other Person
at the request the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; and (B) the term &ldquo;<B><I>Expenses</I></B>&rdquo; means reasonable
attorneys&rsquo; fees and all other costs, expenses and obligations (including experts&rsquo; fees, travel expenses, court costs,
