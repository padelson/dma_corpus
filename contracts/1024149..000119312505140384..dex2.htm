"), at a price per share of Company Common Stock of $6.25 (such amount, or any
other higher amount per share of Company Common Stock paid pursuant to the

the conditions of this Agreement (as it may be amended from time to time as
permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ");



WHEREAS, also in furtherance of the foregoing, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the

consideration to be received by the Companys shareholders for their shares
of Company Common Stock in the Offer and the Merger is fair, from a financial
point of view, to those shareholders; and



WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously (x) resolved to
recommend acceptance of the Merger to the holders of the Company Common Stock

and (z) determined that the consideration to be paid for each share
of Company Common Stock in the Offer and the Merger is fair to the Company
Shareholders and to recommend that the Company Shareholders approve the
Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in
this Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as
follows:



ARTICLE I



THE OFFER AND THE MERGER



Section 1.1. _The Offer_.



(a) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as promptly as practicable
but in no event later than July 15, 2005, Buyer shall, and Parent shall cause
Buyer to, commence the Offer within the meaning of the applicable rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ").
The obligations of Buyer to, and of Parent to cause Buyer to, accept for
payment, and pay for, any shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to
the Offer shall be subject only to the conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_.
The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be the 20th business day
following the commencement of the Offer (determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) of
the SEC). Buyer expressly reserves the right to waive any condition to the
Offer or modify the terms of the Offer, except that, without the consent of
the Company, Buyer shall not (i) reduce the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to the Offer, (ii)

 



 

-2- reduce the Offer Price, (iii) waive the Minimum Tender Condition, (iv) add to
the conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ or modify any condition set forth in
_Exhibit A_ , (v) extend the Offer (except as set forth in the following two
sentences), (vi) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer or
(vii) otherwise amend or modify the Offer in any manner adverse to the
holders of Company Common Stock (it being agreed that a waiver by Buyer of any
condition, in its sole discretion, shall not be deemed to be adverse to the
holders of Company Common Stock). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may,
but shall not be obligated to, without the consent of the Company, (i) extend
the Offer if, at the scheduled expiration date of the Offer, any of the
conditions to Buyers obligation to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
are not satisfied, until such time as such conditions are satisfied or
waived, in increments of not more than five business days each, (ii) extend
the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or
position of the SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer and (iii)
extend the Offer for a period of time not to exceed ten business days if, at
the scheduled expiration date of the Offer, the Board of Directors of the
Company shall have withdrawn, qualified or modified, or proposed publicly to
withdraw, qualify or modify, its approval or recommendation of the Offer or
the Merger (any extension pursuant to this sentence being a " _Parent
Extension_ "). In addition, if at the otherwise scheduled expiration date of
the Offer any condition to the Offer is not satisfied, Buyer shall, and Parent
shall cause Buyer to, extend the Offer at the request of the Company for not
less than 20 business days; _provided_ that Parent and Buyer shall not
be obligated to extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date. In addition, Buyer
may and, if requested by the Company, Buyer shall, make available a
"subsequent offering period", in accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the SEC, of
not less than 10 business days. On the terms and subject to the conditions of
the Offer and this Agreement, Buyer shall, and Parent shall cause Buyer to,
pay for all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer promptly after the expiration of the Offer.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time consummation of the Offer is not
practicable due to (A) any general suspension of trading in, or limitation on
prices for, securities on any national securities exchange or in the over-
the-counter market or (B) the declaration of any banking moratorium or any
suspension of payments in respect of banks or any material limitation (whether
or not mandatory) on the extension of credit by lending institutions in the
United States, consummation of the Offer will be delayed until such time as
such events no longer make it impracticable to consummate the Offer.



(b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Buyer shall file with
the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer, which shall contain an offer to purchase and a related letter of
transmittal and such other ancillary documents pursuant to which the Offer
will be made (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant to
which the Offer will be made, together with any supplements or amendments
thereto and such other ancillary documents, the " _Offer Documents_ "). The
Offer Documents will contain all information which is required to be included
therein in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the " _Exchange Act_ "), and the rules and regulations thereunder and any
other applicable Laws. Each of Parent, Buyer and the Company shall promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and
to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect, and each of Parent and Buyer shall take all steps
necessary to amend or supplement the Offer Documents and to cause the Offer
Documents as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated to the Company Shareholders, in each case as and to the extent



 

-3- required by applicable Federal securities Laws and any other applicable Laws.
The Company and its counsel shall be given the opportunity to review and
comment on the Offer Documents and any supplements or amendments thereto prior
to the filing thereof with the SEC. Parent and Buyer shall provide the Company
and its counsel in writing with any comments Parent, Buyer or their counsel
may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents
promptly after the receipt of such comments.



(c) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Buyer on a timely basis
the funds necessary to purchase any shares of Company Common Stock that
Buyer becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.



Section 1.2. _Company Actions_.



(a) The Company hereby consents to the Offer, and on the date the Offer
Documents are filed with the SEC, the Company shall simultaneously file with
the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect
to the Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, as amended from time to time, the "
_Schedule 14D-9_ ") describing the recommendations referred to in Section
3.3(b) and shall mail the Schedule 14D-9 to the Company Shareholders. Each of
the Company, Parent and Buyer shall promptly correct any information provided
by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company
shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and
to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the
SEC and disseminated to the Company Shareholders, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable Federal securities Laws and any other
applicable Laws. Parent and Buyer and their counsel shall be given the
opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 and any supplements or
amendments thereto prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. The Company shall
provide Parent and its counsel in writing with any comments or other
communications the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such
comments or other communications.



(b) Parent and Buyer will take all steps necessary to cause the
Offer Documents to be disseminated to the Company Shareholders in accordance
with applicable state and federal Laws. In connection with the Offer, the
Company shall cause its transfer agent to furnish Buyer promptly, but in any
event within three business day after the date of this Agreement, with
mailing labels containing the names and addresses of the record holders of
Company Common Stock as of a recent date and of those persons becoming record
holders subsequent to such date, together with copies of all lists of
stockholders, security position listings and computer files and all other
information in the Companys possession or control regarding the beneficial
owners of Company Common Stock, and shall furnish to Buyer such
information and assistance (including updated lists of stockholders, security
position listings and computer files) as Parent may reasonably request in
communicating the Offer to the Company Shareholders. Subject to the
requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to
disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to
consummate the Offer, Parent and Buyer shall, and shall cause their agents to,
hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and
files, shall use such information only in



 

-4- connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be
terminated, shall, upon request, promptly deliver to the Company all copies
of such information then in their possession or under their control.



Section 1.3. _Directors_.



(a) Promptly after the acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common
Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer representing at least a majority of
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock on a fully diluted basis (the
" _Appointment Time_ ") and, from time to time thereafter, as shares of
Company Common Stock are accepted for payment by Buyer, Buyer shall be
entitled to designate such number of members of the Board of Directors of the
Company (the " _Buyer Designees_ "), rounded up to the nearest whole number,
as will give Buyer representation on the Board of Directors of the Company
equal to the product of the total number of members of the Board of Directors
of the Company (after giving effect to any increase in the number of the
directors elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that
the number of shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent or
Buyer at such time (including shares of Company Common Stock so accepted for
payment) bears to the total number of shares of Company Common Stock then
outstanding. In furtherance thereof, the Company shall, upon the request of,
and as specified by, Buyer, promptly either increase the size of the Board of
Directors of the Company or secure the resignations of such number of the
Companys incumbent directors, or both, as is necessary to enable Buyer
Designees to be so elected or appointed to the Board of Directors of the
Company and the Company shall take all actions available to the Company to
cause Buyer Designees to be so elected or appointed. At such time, if
requested by Buyer, the Company shall also take all action necessary to cause
persons designated by Buyer to constitute at least the same percentage
(rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the Board of Directors of the
Company of each committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law and the rules of any stock exchange or
trading market on which the Company Common Stock is listed and traded. The
provisions of this Section 1.3 are in addition to and shall not limit any
rights which Buyer, Parent or any of their affiliates (as such term is defined
in Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
_Securities Act_ ")) may have as a holder or beneficial owner of shares of
Company Common Stock as a matter of applicable Law with respect to the
election of directors or otherwise.



(b) The Company shall take all actions required in order to fulfill its
obligations under Section 1.3(a), including mailing to its shareholders
the information required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder as part of the Schedule 14D-9; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent and Buyer shall supply to the Company in writing prior to the
filing with the SEC of the Schedule 14D-9 any information with respect to
Parent and Buyer and Buyer Designees to the extent required by such Section
14(f) and Rule 14f-1.



(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 1.3, the parties hereto
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to ensure that at least
two of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company shall, at all
times following the Appointment Time and prior to the Effective Time, be
directors of the Company who were directors of the Company on the



 

-5- date hereof (the " _Continuing Directors_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that,
if there shall be in office less than two Continuing Directors for any
reason, the Board of Directors of the Company shall cause the persons
designated by the remaining Continuing Directors to fill such vacancies and
such persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for all purposes of
this Agreement, or if no Continuing Directors then remain, the other directors
of the Company then in office shall designate two persons to fill such
vacancies who will not be directors, officers, employees or affiliates of
Parent or Buyer and such persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors
for all purposes of this Agreement. From and after the time, if any, that
Buyer Designees constitute a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company
and prior to the Effective Time, subject to the terms hereof, any amendment
or modification of this Agreement, any termination of this Agreement by the
Company, any extension of time for performance of any of the obligations of
Parent or Buyer hereunder, any waiver of any condition to the Companys
obligations hereunder or any of the Companys rights hereunder and any other
action of the Company hereunder which adversely affects the Company
Shareholders (other than Parent or Buyer) may be effected only if (in
addition to the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company as a whole)
there are in office one or more Continuing Directors and such action is
approved by a majority of the Continuing Directors then in office. Following
the Appointment Time and prior to the Effective Time, neither Parent nor Buyer
shall take any other action to remove any Continuing Director.



 

Section 1.4. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, and in accordance with the LBCL, at the Effective Time, Buyer
shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Buyer shall cease and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation following the Merger (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ "). The corporate existence of the Company, with all
its purposes, rights, privileges, franchises, powers and objects, shall
continue unaffected and unimpaired by the Merger and, as the Surviving
Corporation, it shall be governed by the LBCL.



Section 1.5. _Effective Time; Closing_. As promptly as practicable (and in
any event within three business days) after the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions which by their
terms can only be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction
or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), the parties shall cause the
Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger or certificate of
ownership and merger, if applicable (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), with
the Secretary of State of the State of Louisiana and by making all other
filings or recordings required under the LBCL in connection with the Merger,
in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant
provisions of, the LBCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the
Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Louisiana, or at such other time (but not earlier than the time which
the Certificate of Merger is filed) as the parties agree shall be specified
in the Certificate of Merger (the date and time the Merger becomes effective,
the " _Effective Time_ "). On the date of such filing, a closing (the "
_Closing_ ") shall be held at 10:00 a.m., local Atlanta time, at the offices
of the King and Spalding LLP, 191 Peachtree Street, Atlanta, Georgia 30303, or
at such other time and location as the parties shall otherwise agree. 



Section 1.6. _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the LBCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers



 

-6- and franchises of the Company and Buyer shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions,
disabilities and duties of the Company and Buyer shall become the debts,
liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.



Section 1.7. _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Buyer, the Company
or the holders of any of the following securities:



(a) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares canceled pursuant to Section
1.7(b) and Dissenting Shares, if any) shall be canceled and shall by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof be
converted automatically into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to
$6.25 payable, without interest, to the holder of such share of Company
Common Stock, upon surrender of the certificate that formerly evidenced such
share of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in Section 1.10 (the "
_Merger Consideration_ ");



(b) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that is owned by Parent or Buyer and each share of
Company Common Stock and Preferred Stock (collectively, " _Company Stock_ ")
that is owned by the Company as treasury stock shall be canceled and retired
and cease to exist and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect
thereto;



(c) At the Effective Time, all shares of the Company Common Stock converted
pursuant to Section 1.7(a) shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate (" _Certificate_ ") representing any such shares of Company Common
Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 1.7(a); and



(d) Each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Buyer issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.



Section 1.8. _Dissenting Shares_. 



(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Company Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by the Company Shareholders who have
demanded and perfected their demands for appraisal of such shares of Company
Stock in the time and manner provided in Section 131 of the LBCL and, as of
the Effective Time, have neither effectively withdrawn nor lost their rights
to such appraisal and payment under the LBCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ")
shall not be converted as described in Section 1.7(a), but shall, by virtue
of the Merger, be entitled to only such rights as are granted by Section 131
of the LBCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such holder



 

-7- shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his,
her or its right to appraisal and payment under the LBCL, such holders
shares of Company Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted, at
the Effective Time, as described in Section 1.7(a), into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration set forth in such provisions, without any interest
thereon.



(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal pursuant to Section 131 of the LBCL received by the Company,
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the
LBCL and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
LBCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent
or as otherwise required by applicable Law, make any payment with respect to
any such demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.



Section 1.9. _Stock Option Plan; Restricted Stock; Warrants_.



(a) The Company shall ensure that all outstanding options to acquire Company
Common Stock (the " _Company Options_ ") granted under the 1999 Equity
Incentive Plan (the " _Company Stock Option Plan_ ") that are not exercised
prior to the consummation of the Merger (or, if the Minimum Tender Condition
has been satisfied, the Offer) shall terminate and expire immediately
after consummation of the Merger (or, if the Minimum Tender Condition has
been satisfied, the Offer). In addition, the Company shall pay such holder,
immediately after consummation of the Merger (or, if the Minimum Tender
Condition has been satisfied, the Offer), in exchange for the cancellation of
such holders Company Options (regardless of exercise price) an amount in cash
determined by _multiplying_ (A) the excess, if any, of the Offer Price over
the applicable exercise price per share of the Company Option _by_ (B) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock such holder could have purchased had
such holder exercised such Company Option in full immediately after
consummation of the Merger (or, if the Minimum Tender Condition has been
satisfied, the Offer) (such amount, the " _Company Option Consideration_ ").
The Company shall pay the holder of each of the outstanding options to acquire
shares of Company Common Stock, which shall not include Company Warrants,
that were not granted pursuant to the Company Stock Option Plan (the "
_Assumed Options_ "), in exchange for the cancellation of such holders
Assumed Options (regardless of the exercise price) immediately
after consummation of the Merger an amount in cash determined by
_multiplying_ (A) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
applicable exercise price per share of the Assumed Options _by_ (B) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock such holder could have purchased had such
holder exercised such Assumed Option in full immediately after consummation of
the Merger (such amount, together with the Company Option Consideration, being
the " _Option Consideration_ ").



(b) Immediately after the Effective Time, each outstanding share of
restricted common stock of the Company (" _Restricted Stock_ ") the
restrictions of which have not lapsed immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall become fully vested and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive
an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration for each such share of
Restricted Stock.



 

-8- (c) Immediately after consummation of the Merger, each of the outstanding
Company Warrants to acquire shares of Company Common Stock shall, pursuant to
their terms, become exercisable, upon payment of the applicable exercise price
thereof, into the right to receive an amount in cash determined by
_multiplying_ (a) the Merger Consideration  _by_ (b) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock such holder could have purchased had such holder
exercised such warrant in full immediately after the consummation of the
Merger. In addition, the Company shall pay such holder of a Founder Warrant
immediately after the consummation of the Merger in exchange for the
cancellation of such holders Founder Warrant (regardless of exercise price)
immediately after the consummation of the Merger, an amount in cash determined
by  _multiplying_ (A) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over
the applicable exercise price per share of the Founder Warrant _by_ (B) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock such holder could have purchased had
such holder exercised such Founder Warrant in full immediately after the
consummation of the Merger (such amount, the " _Founder Warrant Consideration_
").



Section 1.10. _Surrender of Shares of Company Common Stock; Stock Transfer
Books_.



(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock reasonably acceptable to the Company to receive the funds
necessary to make the payments to such holders pursuant to Section 1.7 upon
surrender of their Certificates. Parent will, at or prior to the Effective
Time, deposit with the Paying Agent the Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Fund_ "). The Fund shall
be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent. Any net profit
resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments, shall be
payable to Parent. Parent shall replace any monies lost through any investment
made pursuant to this Section 1.10(a). The Paying Agent shall make
the payments provided in Section 1.7.



(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be mailed to
each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of shares of
Company Common Stock entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 1.7 a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent)
and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of
a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder
of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock formerly evidenced
by such Certificate, and such Certificate shall then be canceled. Until so
surrendered, each such Certificate shall, at and after the Effective Time,
represent for all purposes, only the right to receive such Merger
Consideration. No interest shall accrue or be paid to any beneficial owner of
shares of Company Common Stock or any holder of any Certificate with respect
to the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificate. If
payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the
person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered on the stock
transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Certificate so



 

-9- surrendered shall be endorsed in blank or to the Paying Agent or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall
have paid all transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of
the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of
Parent that such taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. If any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon making of an
affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of
a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 1.7.



(c) At any time following the date that is six months after the Effective
Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it
any portion of the Fund that had been made available to the Paying Agent and
not disbursed to holders of shares of Company Common Stock (including all
interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all
amounts held in the Fund or other funds made available to it), and thereafter
each such holder shall be entitled to look only to Parent (subject to
abandoned property, escheat and other similar Laws), and only as general
creditors thereof, with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held by such holder. If any
Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock shall not have been
surrendered immediately prior to such date on which the Merger Consideration
in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity, any such cash, shares, dividends or
distributions payable in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent
permitted by the Company Articles of Incorporation and applicable Law, become
the property of the Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the
Surviving Corporation, Parent, Buyer or the Paying Agent shall be liable to
any holder of a share of Company Common Stock for any Merger Consideration
delivered in respect of such share of Company Common Stock to a public
official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar Law.



(d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
shares of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company. From and after
the Effective Time, except for Parent and Buyer, the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock
except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable Law, and all cash paid
pursuant to this Article I upon the surrender or exchange of Certificates
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by
such Certificate. 



(e) Parent, Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as the
case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration and any other amount otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Options,
Assumed Options or Company Warrants such amounts that Parent, Buyer, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold



 

-10- with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986 (the " _Code_ "), the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or
any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by Parent, Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to such holder of the shares of Company Common Stock, Company
Options, Assumed Options or Company Warrants in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Buyer, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any property or asset of any of them is bound or affected,

results of operations or financial condition of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole ( _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to

U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") or the accounting
rules and regulations of the SEC, (B) the public announcement of the Offer or
Merger, (C) any action or failure to act by Parent or any of its affiliates

and policies of the FCC promulgated thereunder (the " _FCC Filings_ "), (iv)
for filings contemplated by Section 3.15 and (v) where failure to obtain such
consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings
or notifications, has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.



Section 3.6. _Compliance with Laws_. Subject to Section 3.7, each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries has been operated at all times in
compliance with all Laws applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or by which any property, business or asset of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is bound or affected, except for any such failures to comply or
violations that have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.



Section 3.7. _Licenses and Permits_.



(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries each has all governmental permits,
licenses, franchises, variances, exemptions, orders issued or granted by
a Governmental Entity and all other authorizations, consents, certificates of
public convenience and/or necessity and approvals issued or granted by a
Governmental Entity (collectively, " _Licenses_ ") necessary to conduct its
business as presently conducted, except those the absence of which have not
had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect (the " _Company Material Licenses_ ").



(b) The term " _Company Licenses_ " means those Company Material Licenses
granted or issued by the FCC and, to the extent not otherwise Company Material
Licenses, all other Licenses issued or granted to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by the FCC, and all arrangements pursuant to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries leases radio spectrum from a third party holding a
License granted or issued by the FCC (all such Company Licenses issued or
granted by the FCC being the " _FCC Licenses_ "), all Licenses issued or
granted to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by a Governmental Entity of
any state of the United States regulating telecommunications businesses and
all Licenses issued or granted to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by
foreign Governmental Entities regulating telecommunications



 

-15- businesses. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with (i)
its obligations under each of the Company Licenses and (ii) the rules and
regulations of the Governmental Entity issuing such Company Licenses, except,
in either case, for such failures to be in compliance as have not had, and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. There is no pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened by or before the FCC, the Federal Aviation Administration

actions granting all FCC Licenses have not been reversed, stayed, enjoined,
annulled or suspended, and there is no pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened, application, petition, objection or other pleading with
the FCC, the FAA or any other Governmental Entity that challenges or questions
the validity of or any rights of the holder under any FCC License, in each
case, except as has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Each Company
Material License, including each FCC License, is listed on Section 3.7(b) of
the Company Disclosure Letter.



(c) Except as has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries is the exclusive, authorized, legal holder
of each FCC License necessary to conduct the Companys business as presently
conducted, free and clear of all encumbrances except for encumbrances listed
on the face of such License or generally applicable to all similarly situated
companies. Except as has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, the FCC
Licenses are valid and in full force and effect without condition, except for
conditions listed on the face of such Licenses or generally applicable to all
similarly situated companies. All reports and other documents related to the
FCC Licenses required to be filed by the Company or its Subsidiaries with any
Governmental Entity are correct, except where the failure to be correct has
not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.



Section 3.8.  _Reports; Financial Statements; Internal Controls_.



(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed all reports,
registrations, schedules, forms, statements and other documents, together with

"), that they were required to file since January 1, 2003 with (i) the FCC,
(ii) the SEC, (iii) any state or other federal regulatory authority (other
than any taxing authority, which is covered by Section 3.10) and (iv) any
foreign regulatory authority (other than any taxing authority, which is
covered by Section 3.10), and have paid all fees and assessments due and
payable in connection therewith, except in each case where the failure to file
such Report, or to pay such fees and assessments, has not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect. No Report of the Company made with the SEC, as of the date of
such Report, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances in which
they were made, not misleading, except that information as of a later

 



 

-16- date (but before the date of this Agreement) will be deemed to modify
information as of an earlier date. Since January 1, 2003, as of their
respective dates, all Reports of the Company made with the SEC complied as to
form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules
and regulations thereunder with respect thereto. No executive officer of the

(b) The Company has previously made available to Parent copies of (i) the
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2004, as reported in the Companys Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004, including any
amendments thereto filed with the SEC (collectively, the " _Company 2004 10-K_
"), filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act, accompanied by the audit report

Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm with respect to
the Company for such periods (such balance sheets and statements, the "
_Audited Company Financial Statements_ ") and (ii) the unaudited consolidated
balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of March 31, 2005 and the

Statements_ " and, together with the Audited Company Financial Statements, the

Company Financial Statements fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
dates thereof, and the other financial statements included in the Company
Financial Statements (including the related notes, where applicable) fairly
present in all material respects the results of the consolidated operations
and changes in stockholders equity and cash flows of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods therein set forth, subject in
the case of the Unaudited Company Financial Statements to normal year-end
audit adjustments consistent with past experience; each of such statements
(including the related notes, where applicable) complies in all material
respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto; and each of the Company Financial Statements (including the related
notes, where applicable) has been prepared in all material respects in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except,
in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. There
is no applicable accounting rule, consensus or pronouncement that has been
adopted as of the date of this Agreement by the SEC, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board, the Emerging Issues Task Force or any similar body but is not
in effect as of the date of this Agreement that, if implemented, would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect.

internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) of the

reliability of financial reporting. The Company (i) has designed and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and is
accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and (ii) has disclosed,
based on its most recent evaluation of such disclosure controls and procedures
prior to the date hereof, to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of
the Board of Directors of the Company (A) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any
material respect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Companys internal controls over financial reporting.

(b) any material change in the Companys internal controls over financial
reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act)
or (c) any action of the type described in Sections 5.1(b) or 5.1(c) (other

except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate,
to have a Material Adverse Effect, the unpaid Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries did not exceed the accrual for Tax liability (disregarding any



 

-18- reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between
book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the balance sheet in the most
recent Company Financial Statement (disregarding any notes thereto); (ix)
neither the Company nor any Subsidiary (A) has been a member of any other

penalty; and (xiv) the Company has not made any distribution of stock, and no

Effect (each a " _Company Permitted Lien_ "). The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries either own, or have valid leasehold interests in, all properties
and assets used by them in the conduct of their business, except where the
absence of such ownership or leasehold interest has not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect.



 

-19- Section 3.12. _Change of Control Agreements_. Neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the accelerated vesting or
delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any payment or benefit to
any director, officer or employee of the Company. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no amount paid or payable by the Company in

Litigation pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has had, or would reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Except
for such matters which have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to

Material Adverse Effect.

published, sent or delivered to Company Shareholders, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be

To the knowledge of the Company, there are no third parties using any of the
Intellectual Property Rights material to the business of the Company or its

_Representatives_ ") of the Company to, afford the Representatives of Parent

employees, agents, properties, offices and other facilities, books and records

Section 5.4. _Further Assurances_. 



(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, each of the parties

make effective the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including using all commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain



 

-30- all licenses, permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and
orders of each Governmental Entity and parties to contracts with the Company
and its Subsidiaries as are necessary for the consummation of the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to
fulfill the conditions set forth in Article VI. If at any time after the
Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers of each party to this
Agreement and the Surviving Corporation, subject to Section 5.5, shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to take all such action.



(b) In connection with, and without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall
(i) take all actions necessary to ensure that no state antitakeover statute or
similar statute or regulation is or becomes operative with respect to this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (ii) if any state antitakeover statute or similar statute
or regulation is or becomes operative with respect to this Agreement, the
Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement,
take all actions necessary to ensure that this Agreement, the Merger and any
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Offer,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



Section 5.5. _Board Recommendations_.



(a) In connection with the Offer, the Merger and the Shareholders Meeting,
the Board of Directors of the Company shall (i) subject to Section 5.5(b),
recommend to the holders of the Company Common Stock to vote in favor of the
approval of this Agreement and the Merger and use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the necessary approvals by the Company Shareholders of this
Agreement, (ii) otherwise comply with all legal requirements applicable to
such meeting and (iii) subject to Section 5.5(b), recommend to the holders of
the Company Common Stock to tender their shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer.

 



(b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall, except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.5(b), (i) withdraw,
qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify the
approval or recommendation of such Board of Directors or such committee of the
Offer, the Merger or this Agreement, (ii) approve or recommend any
transaction involving an Acquisition Proposal from a third party (an "
_Alternative Transaction_ "), or (iii) cause the Company to enter into any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other
similar agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement in compliance with
the provisions of Section 5.9(b)) (each, an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ")
related to any Alternative Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
prior to the Appointment Time, the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after it has received a Superior Proposal in
compliance with Section 5.9(b) and after consultation with
independent outside counsel that it is required to do so by its fiduciary
duties to Company Shareholders under applicable Louisiana Law, the Board of
Directors of the Company may (subject to this and the following sentences)
inform the Company Shareholders that it no longer believes that the Offer or
the Merger is advisable and no longer recommends approval (a " _Subsequent
Determination_ "), but only at a time that is after the third business day



 

-31- following Parents receipt of written notice advising Parent that the Board of
Directors of the Company has received a Superior Proposal or an Acquisition
Proposal that is reasonably likely to be a Superior Proposal. Such written
notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal or Acquisition Proposal (and include a copy thereof with all
accompanying documentation, if in writing), identify the person making such
Superior Proposal and state that the Board of Directors of the Company is
considering making a Subsequent Determination. During such three business day
period, the Company shall provide an opportunity for Parent to propose such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the
Company to proceed with its recommendation to its shareholders without a
Subsequent Determination;  _provided_ , _however_ , that any such proposed
adjustment shall be at the discretion of Parent at the time. For purposes of
this Agreement, a " _Superior Proposal_ " means any proposal (on its most
recently amended or modified terms, if amended or modified) made by a third
party to enter into an Alternative Transaction that the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with an
independent financial advisor) to be more favorable to the Company
Shareholders than the Offer and the Merger, taking into account all relevant
factors (including whether, in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors of the Company, after consultation with such independent
financial advisor, the third party is reasonably able to finance the
transaction, and any proposed changes to this Agreement that may be proposed
by Parent in response to such Alternative Transaction). Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, after the Appointment Time, the Company
shall submit this Agreement (whether or not terminated) to the Company
Shareholders whether or not the Board of Directors of the Company makes a
Subsequent Determination. Nothing contained in this Section 5.5 shall
prohibit the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company from (A) taking
and disclosing to the Company Shareholders pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act a position with respect to a tender or
exchange offer by a third party, which is consistent with its obligations
hereunder or (B) making such disclosure to the Company Shareholders as, in the
good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, after receiving
advice from outside counsel is consistent with its obligations hereunder and
is required by applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Company may not, except
as provided by this Section 5.5(b), withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner
adverse to Parent, the approval or recommendation of such Board of Directors
of the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement.



Section 5.6. _Shareholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any shareholder
Litigation against the Company and its directors relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents consent, which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld.



Section 5.7. _Indemnification_.



(a) It is understood and agreed that all rights to indemnification by
the Company now existing in favor of each present and former director,
officer, employee and agent of the Company or its Subsidiaries (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in the Company Articles of Incorporation
or the Company Bylaws, in each case as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, or pursuant to any other agreements in effect on the date hereof,
copies of which



 

-32- have been provided to Parent, shall survive the Merger, and Parent shall,
subject to Section 5.7(c), (i) cause the Surviving Corporation to continue in
full force and effect for a period of at least six (6) years from the
Effective Time and (ii) perform, or cause the Surviving Corporation to
perform, in a timely manner, the Surviving Corporations obligation with
respect thereto. Parent and Buyer agree that any claims for indemnification
hereunder as to which they have received written notice prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time shall survive, whether or not such claims
shall have been finally adjudicated or settled.



(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving
Corporation shall, maintain in effect for six (6) years from the Effective
Time, if available, the current directors and officers liability insurance
policies (" _D andO Insurance_") covered by such policies (provided that the
Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same
coverage containing terms and conditions that are not materially less
favorable) with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend pursuant to this Section 5.7(b) more than an amount per
year equal to 200% of current annual premiums paid by the Company for such
insurance. In the event that, but for the proviso to the immediately preceding
sentence, the Surviving Corporation would be required to expend more than 200%
of current annual premiums, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain the
maximum amount of such insurance obtainable by payment of annual premiums
equal to 200% of current annual premiums. If the Surviving Corporation elects
to reduce the amount of insurance coverage pursuant to the preceding sentence,
it will furnish to the officers and directors currently covered by such DandO
Insurance reasonable notice of such reduction in coverage and shall, to the
extent additional coverage is available, afford such persons the opportunity
to pay such additional premiums as may be necessary to maintain the existing
level of DandO Insurance coverage. In lieu of the foregoing, the Company may
purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a six year "tail" prepaid officers and
directors liability insurance policy in respect of acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such Indemnified Party
currently covered by the Companys DandO Insurance; _provided_ that the premium
and terms of such insurance are reasonably acceptable to Parent (it being
understood that a policy with a one-time premium not in excess of 250% of the
current annual premium shall be deemed to be reasonably acceptable to Parent).



(c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.7.



(d) The provisions of this Section 5.7 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his
or her representatives.



Section 5.8. _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult with
each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements with respect to this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger and shall
not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to
such consultation, except as may be required by Law or any listing



 

-33- agreement with a national securities exchange or trading system to which
Parent or the Company is a party. The parties agree that the initial press
release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is set forth in _Exhibit B_ to this Agreement.



Section 5.9. _Acquisition Proposals_.



(a) As of the date hereof, the Company shall terminate (and shall cause each
Subsidiary to terminate) all direct and indirect negotiations and discussions
with all other parties with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.



(b) The Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its
Subsidiaries or Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
initiate or encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal or (ii)
participate in or encourage any discussion or negotiations regarding, or
furnish to any person any non-public information with respect to, or take any
other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of, any proposal that
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not prohibit the
Board of Directors of the Company from furnishing information to, or entering
into discussions or negotiations with, any person or entity that makes an
unsolicited Acquisition Proposal prior to the approval of this Agreement by
the Company Shareholders if, and only to the extent that, (A) the Board of
Directors of the Company (after consultation with independent outside legal
counsel) determines in good faith that such action is required for the Board
of Directors of the Company to comply with its fiduciary obligations to
the Company Shareholders under applicable Louisiana Law, (B) prior to taking
such action, the Company receives from such person or entity an executed
agreement in reasonably customary form relating to the confidentiality of
information to be provided to such person or entity containing provisions no
less favorable to the Company than those set forth in the Confidentiality
Agreement and (C) the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good
faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisor, that the
Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal. The
Company shall provide immediate (and at least within 24 hours) oral and
written notice to Parent of (1) the receipt of any such Acquisition Proposal
or any inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition
Proposal, (2) the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal
or inquiry, (3) the identity of such person or entity making any such
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and (4) the Companys intention to furnish
information to, or enter into discussions or negotiations with, such person or
entity. The Company shall continue to keep Parent fully and promptly informed
of any material change to the terms of any such Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any
proposal with respect to (i) a transaction pursuant to which any person (or
group of persons) other than Parent or its affiliates, directly or
indirectly, acquires or would acquire more than 20% of the outstanding shares
of common stock of the Company or of the outstanding voting power of the
Company, whether from the Company or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange
offer or otherwise (other than the Offer), (ii) a merger, share exchange,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization or any other transaction
involving the Company (other than the Merger) or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to which any person or group of persons (other than
Parent or its affiliates) party thereto, or its stockholders, owns or would
own more than 20% of the outstanding shares of common stock or the outstanding
voting power of the Company or, if applicable, the parent entity resulting
from any such transaction



 

-34- immediately upon consummation thereof, or (iii) any transaction pursuant to
which any person (or group of persons) other than Parent or its affiliates
acquires or would acquire control of assets (including for this purpose the
outstanding equity securities of the Subsidiaries of the Company and
securities of the entity surviving any merger or business
combination involving any of the Subsidiaries of the Company) of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries representing more than 20% of the fair market value
of all the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
immediately prior to such transaction.



Section 5.10. _Company Shareholders  Meeting; Proxy Statement_.



(a) The Company shall, as soon as practicable following acceptance for
payment of and payment for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer, cause the Shareholders Meeting to be duly called and held for the

applicable Law and the Company Articles of Incorporation and Company Bylaws to
duly call, give notice of, and convene the Shareholders Meeting. 



(b) Subject to Section 5.5, the Company shall solicit from holders of shares
of Company Stock entitled to vote at the Shareholders Meeting proxies in

for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, Parent and the
Company shall jointly prepare, and the Company shall file, the Proxy Statement
with the SEC and shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to respond to
the comments of the SEC and to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the

promptly inform Parent and (ii) if at any time prior to the Shareholders

telephone conferences, relating to the Offer Documents, the Proxy Statement,
the Merger or this Agreement.



(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d), in the event
that Buyer shall acquire at least ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer, the parties hereto agree to take
all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective,
as soon as practicable after the expiration of the Offer, without a meeting of
shareholders of the Company, in accordance with Section 112(G) of the LBCL.



Section 5.11. _Shareholder Lists_. The Company shall promptly upon the request
by Parent, or shall cause its transfer agent to promptly, furnish Parent and
Buyer with mailing labels containing the names and addresses of all record
holders of shares of Company Common Stock and with security position listings
of shares of Company Common Stock held in stock depositories, each as of the
most recent practicable date, together with all other available listings and
computer files containing names, addresses and security position listings of
record holders and beneficial owners of shares of Company Common Stock. The
Company shall furnish Parent and Buyer with such additional information,
including updated listings and computer files of the Company Shareholders,
mailing labels and security position listings, and such other assistance as
Parent, Buyer or their agents may reasonably request.



Section 5.12.  _Benefits Continuation; Severance_.



(a) From and after the Appointment Time and for not less than 12 months
following the Appointment Time, Parent, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation shall provide, or shall cause their subsidiaries to provide,
benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided
under the Company Benefit Plans (other than the Company Stock Option Plan) as
in effect on the date hereof for the employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the Appointment Time (" _Affected Employees_ ") and for
former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (" _Former Employees_ ");
notwithstanding the foregoing, however, Parent, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be obligated to make matching contributions or any
other payments under the Company Savings Security and Profit Sharing Plan (the
" _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") in amounts or percentage levels comparable to
matching contributions or other payments made by the Company prior to the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger but will provide matching
contributions and other such payments in amounts and percentage levels
comparable to similarly situated employees of Parent. Parent, the



 

-36- Company and the Surviving Corporation shall comply with the terms of all
Company Benefit Plans in effect immediately prior to the Appointment Time
between the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affected Employees or Former
Employees, subject to any reserved right to amend or terminate any Company
Benefit Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such amendment or termination
may be inconsistent with Parents and the Surviving Corporations obligations
pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 5.12. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent, the Company and the
Surviving Corporation agree to honor all obligations for severance pay and
other severance benefits to Affected Employees (x) pursuant to the terms of
the written employment and separation agreements listed in Section 3.12 of the
Company Disclosure Letter and (y) who are terminated prior to the date that
is twelve months following the Appointment Time in accordance with the
Companys severance policies set forth in Section 5.12 of the Company
Disclosure Letter.



(b) Employees shall be given credit for all service with the Company and
its Subsidiaries (or service credited by the Company or its Subsidiaries)
under all employee benefit plans and arrangements currently maintained or
established in the future by Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including,
without limitation, the Surviving Corporation) in which they are or become
participants for purposes of participation, eligibility, vesting, and level of
benefits (but not for benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan
or any plan providing post-retirement medical, dental or prescription drug
benefits or as would otherwise result in duplication of benefits). Parent and
its subsidiaries (including without limitation the Surviving Corporation)
shall cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations, eligibility waiting
periods or required physical examinations under any welfare benefit plans of
Parent and its subsidiaries (including without limitation the Surviving
Corporation) to be waived with respect to Affected Employees and their
eligible dependents to the extent waived under the corresponding plan in
which the applicable Affected Employee participated prior to the Effective
Time and, with respect to life insurance coverage, up to the Affected
Employees current level of insurability. Parent and its subsidiaries
(including without limitation the Surviving Corporation) shall give Affected
Employees and their eligible dependents credit for the plan year in which the
Effective Time (or commencement of participation in any benefit plan) occurs
toward applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for expenses
incurred prior to the Effective Time (or the date of commencement of
participation in such benefit plan).



(c) Nothing in this Section 5.12 shall confer any rights or remedies upon
any person, individual or whomsoever other than the Company, Parent and
Buyer.



Section 5.13. _FCC Application_. The Company and Parent shall coordinate
efforts and cooperate with each other to cause the FCC Filings to be made for
approval of the transactions contemplated in the License Assignment and the
Spectrum Lease (the " _Cameron Transactions_ ") to be accomplished as soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement. In the event the Cameron
Transactions have not been approved by the FCC within 35 days after the date
of this Agreement (or such lesser time as the parties may mutually agree), the
Company and Parent shall coordinate efforts and cooperate with each other to
cause the FCC Filings to be made for approval of the transfer of control of
the FCC Licenses to Parent as a result of the Offer or the Merger (the "
_Transfer of Control_ ") to be accomplished as soon as practicable thereafter.
The Company and Parent shall prosecute each FCC Filing with
commercially reasonable diligence



 

-37- and otherwise use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the grants
of the FCC Filings (the " _FCC Approval_ ") as expeditiously as practicable.
Each party will promptly provide to the other parties a copy of any pleading,
order or other document served on it relating to such FCC Filings. The Parent
and the Company shall oppose any petitions to deny or other objections filed
with respect to the FCC Filings and any requests for reconsideration or review
of the FCC Approval.



Section 5.14. _Director Resignations_. The Company shall cause to be delivered
to Parent resignations of all the directors of the Companys Subsidiaries to
be effective upon the consummation of the Merger. The Company shall cause such
directors, prior to resignation, to appoint new directors nominated by Parent
to fill such vacancies.



Section 5.15. _Company Options; Warrants_. Immediately prior to
the consummation of the Merger, the Company shall cause the termination and
expiration of all Company Options, Assumed Options and Founder Warrants not
exercised prior to the consummation of the Merger in exchange for the Option
Consideration and Founder Warrant Consideration in the manner described in
Section 1.9.



Section 5.16. _Purchase of Company Stock_. Other than pursuant to the Offer
and the Shareholders Agreement, Parent shall not, and shall cause its
affiliates not to, purchase shares of Company Common Stock or enter into
option, lock-up, voting or proxy agreements or any other similar agreements
with respect to Company Common Stock at any time prior to the consummation of
the Offer.



Section 5.17. _Parent s Transaction; Support for Offer and Merger_. To the
extent permitted by Law, from the date hereof, the Company will not take any
actions with the FCC or any other Governmental Authority in opposition to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by Parents application in FCC
WT Docket No. 05-63 (" _Parent s Transaction_"). The Company, jointly with
Parent, shall inform the FCC that the Company will not prosecute any complaint
with respect to, or oppose, the Parents Transaction as long as this Agreement
shall not have been terminated in accordance with its terms. Subject to
Sections 5.5 and 5.9, neither the Company, nor any of its respective
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, advisors, agents and
representatives shall from the date hereof knowingly take or omit to take any
action the taking or omission of which would reasonably be expected to delay
materially or to prevent the transactions contemplated by the Agreement or by
Parents Transaction.



 

Section 5.18. _No Amendments, Etc. of License Assignment or Spectrum Lease_.
Without the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not, nor shall
it permit any Subsidiary to, amend, modify or waive any provision of the
License Assignment or the Spectrum Lease. The Company shall promptly provide
to Parent copies of all notices and other written communications given or
received pursuant to the License Assignment and Spectrum Lease.



Section 5.19. _Undertakings_. The Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the individuals reasonably requested by Parent to execute an
Undertaking as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement.



 

-38- ARTICLE VI

vote of the Company Shareholders, as required by the LBCL, the Company
Articles of Incorporation and the Company Bylaws;



(b) No temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or
other order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other legal
restraint or prohibition (including, any statute, rule,
regulation, injunction, order or decree proposed, enacted, enforced,
promulgated, issued or deemed applicable to, or any consent or approval
withheld with respect to, the Merger, by any Governmental Entity) preventing
the consummation of the Merger shall be in effect; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the parties invoking this condition shall use all commercially reasonable
efforts to have any such order or injunction vacated;

herein, all conditions of the Offer shall have been fulfilled or waived and

ARTICLE VII



TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER



Section 7.1. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Offer
and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Appointment Time:



(a) By mutual written consent duly authorized by the Boards of Directors of
Parent and the Company;



(b) By any of Parent, Buyer or the Company if any court of competent
jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, decree,
ruling or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the Offer or the Merger and such order, decree, ruling
or other action shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the party terminating this Agreement pursuant to this Section
7.1(b) shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to have such order,
decree, ruling or action vacated;



 

-39- (c) By any of Parent, Buyer or the Company if the Offer shall not have been
consummated on or before October 15, 2005 (the " _Outside Date_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if the Offer shall not have been consummated
on or before October 15, 2005 due to the failure to have obtained the
approvals described in Section 6.1 of the Company Disclosure Letter (without
regard to whether the Minimum Tender Condition shall have been satisfied),
then the Outside Date shall be December 31, 2005; (ii) if the Offer shall not
have been consummated on or before December 31, 2005 due to the failure to
have obtained the approvals described in Section 6.1 of the Company Disclosure
Letter (without regard to whether the Minimum Tender Condition shall have been
satisfied) and it is reasonably likely that the parties will be able to
obtain such approvals by February 28, 2006, the parties shall negotiate in
good faith an amendment to this Agreement to extend the Outside Date to a date
not later than February 28, 2006; and (iii) the right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 7.1(c) shall not be available to any party
whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the
primary cause of, or resulted in, the failure to consummate the Offer on or
before such date; 



(d) By Parent or Buyer if the Board of Directors of the Company (i) shall
have withdrawn or shall have modified in a manner adverse to Parent or Buyer
its approval or recommendation of the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement,
(ii) causes the Company to enter into an agreement with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement), (iii) shall
have endorsed, approved or recommended any Acquisition Proposal or (iv) shall
have resolved to do any of the foregoing;



(e) By Parent, Buyer or the Company, if as a result of the failure of any
condition set forth in _Exhibit A_ to this Agreement, the Offer shall have
been terminated by Parent or Buyer or expired in accordance with its terms
without Buyer having purchased any Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer;  _provided_ _however_ , that none of Parent, Buyer or the Company
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(e) if
such party is in material breach of this Agreement;



(f) By Parent or Buyer, if the Company shall breach in any material respect
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other obligations
hereunder (which breach would give rise to the failure of the condition set
forth in clause (b) on _Exhibit A_ ) and, within 20 days after written notice
of such breach to the Company from Parent, such breach shall not have been
cured in all material respects or waived by Parent or Buyer and the Company
shall not have provided reasonable assurance to Parent and Buyer that such
breach will be cured in all material respects on or before the expiration of
the Offer; or



(g) By the Company, if Parent or Buyer shall breach in any material respect
any of their respective representations, warranties or obligations hereunder
(which breach would give rise to the failure of the condition set forth in
clause (b) on _Exhibit A_ (assuming that references therein to (i) the Company
are replaced with references to Parent and Buyer and (ii) Sections 3.2, 3.3
and 3.12 are replaced with references to Section 4.2)) and, within 20
days after written notice of such breach to Parent from the Company, such
breach shall not have been cured in all material respects or waived by the



 

-40- Company and Parent or Buyer, as the case may be, shall not have provided
reasonable assurance to the Company that such breach will be cured in all
material respects on or before the expiration of the Offer.



Section 7.2. _Effect of Termination_.



(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1
hereof, this Agreement shall forthwith be terminated and have no
further effect except as specifically provided herein and, except as provided
in this Section 7.2 and in Section 8.11, there shall be no liability on the
part of any party; _provided_ that nothing herein shall relieve any party from
liability for any willful breach hereof.



(b) If (i) Parent or Buyer exercises its right to terminate this Agreement
under Section 7.1(d), then the Company shall, within three business days of
such termination, pay $35 million (the " _Termination Fee_ ") to Parent or
(ii) unless the Termination Fee shall have been paid pursuant to clause (i)
of this Section 7.2(b), upon the consummation of any Alternative Transaction
(A) within 12 months after the termination of this Agreement for any reason or
(B) as a result of or pursuant to any Acquisition Agreement entered into
within 12 months after the termination of this Agreement for any reason, the
Company shall pay the Termination Fee to Parent, upon consummation of such
Alternative Transaction, in each case payable in same-day funds, as
liquidated damages and not as a penalty, to reimburse Parent for its time,
expense and lost opportunity costs of pursuing the Offer and the Merger. For
purposes of this Section 7.2(b), references to 20% in the definition of
"Acquisition Proposal" as such term relates to an Alternative Transaction
will be deemed to be references to 50%.



(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if
the Company fails promptly to pay to Parent any amounts due under this Section
7.2, the Company shall pay the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal
fees and expenses) in connection with any action, including the filing of any
lawsuit or other legal action, taken to collect payment, together with
interest on the amount of any unpaid fee or obligation at the publicly
announced prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect from time to time from the
date such fee or obligation was required to be paid.



Section 7.3. _Amendments_. This Agreement may not be amended except by action
taken or authorized by the board of directors of each of the parties (and, in
the case of the Company, with the approval of the Board of Directors of the
Company) set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that after approval of the Merger by
the Company Shareholders (if required), no amendment may be made without the
further approval of the Company Shareholders if the effect of such amendment
would be to reduce the Merger Consideration or change the form thereof or such
approval is otherwise required by the LBCL.



Section 7.4. _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, whether
before or after the Shareholders Meeting, any party, by action taken by its
board of directors, may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
covenants, obligations or other acts of any other party or (b) waive any
inaccuracy of any representations or warranties or compliance with any of the
agreements, covenants or conditions of any other party or with any conditions
to its own



 

-41- obligations. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party by its duly authorized officer. The failure of any party
to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights. The waiver of any
such right with respect to particular facts and other circumstances shall not
be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each
such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time
and from time to time.



ARTICLE VIII



GENERAL PROVISIONS



Section 8.1. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Other than the provisions of
Section 5.7, nothing in this Agreement shall confer any rights or remedies
upon any person other than the parties.



Section 8.2. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement constitutes the entire
Agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements, or representations by or
among the parties, written or oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof,
except for the Confidentiality Agreement.



Section 8.3. _Succession and Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties named herein and their respective
successors. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights,
interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the
other parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer may freely assign its
rights to another direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent without
such prior written approval but no such assignment shall relieve Buyer or
Parent of any of its obligations hereunder.



Section 8.4. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.



Section 8.5. _Governing Law; Venue; Service of Process; Waiver of Jury Trial_.



(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflicts
of law thereof, except that the Merger shall be governed by the LBCL.



(b) The parties (i) agree that any suit, action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement will be brought solely in state or
federal courts of the State of Delaware, (ii) consent to the exclusive

to the laying of venue in any such suit, action or proceeding in such court.



(c) Each party irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner
provided for the giving of notices pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ that
such service will be deemed to have been given only when actually received by
such party. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of a party to
serve process in another manner permitted by Law.



 

-42- (d) EACH PARTY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, AND WHETHER MADE BY
CLAIM, COUNTERCLAIM, THIRD PARTY CLAIM OR OTHERWISE.



Section 8.6. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions
hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in
any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is
invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree that the court making the
determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce
the scope, duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete specific
words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision
with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest
to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or
provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after the
expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed.



Section 8.7. _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties acknowledges and
agrees that the other party would be damaged irreparably in the event any of
the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each of the parties
agrees that the other party shall be entitled to seek an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof.



Section 8.8. _Construction_. The language used in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual
intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any party.
Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." All references to the "parties" means the parties to this
Agreement unless the context otherwise requires. All references to any
agreement, instrument, statute or regulation are to it as amended and
supplemented from time to time (and, in the case of a statute or regulation,
to any corresponding provisions or successor statutes or regulations).



Section 8.9. _Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties and Agreements_.
The representations, warranties and agreements in this Agreement shall
terminate at the Effective Time, except that the agreements set forth in
Articles I and VIII and Sections 5.4, 5.7 and 5.12 shall survive the Effective
Time indefinitely.



Section 8.10. _Certain Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement, the

mean any individual, corporation, partnership (general or limited), limited
liability company, limited liability partnership, trust, joint venture, joint-
stock company, syndicate, association, entity, unincorporated organization or
government or any political subdivision, agency or instrumentality thereof.



 

-43- Section 8.11. _Fees and Expenses_. Each party shall pay its own costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.



Section 8.12. _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given (and shall be
deemed to have been duly given upon receipt) by delivery in person, by
telecopy or by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt
requested) to the respective parties at the following addresses, or at such

Sprint to Acquire Wireless Affiliate US Unwired for $1.3B



    |  | _More than 500,000 PCS wireless users to become direct
subscribers of Sprint_ 
---|---|--- 
    |  | _Extends Sprint s direct service territory to an additional
8 million people in nine states_ 
---|---|--- 



OVERLAND PARK, Kan., and LAKE CHARLES, La.  July 11, 2005  Sprint (NYSE:
FON) and US Unwired, Inc. (NASDAQ: UNWR) today announced that their boards of
directors have unanimously approved an agreement for Sprint to acquire US
Unwired for approximately $1.3 billion.



Under the terms of the agreement, Sprint will commence a cash tender offer to
acquire all of US Unwireds outstanding common stock at a price of $6.25 per
share. Following completion of the tender offer, any remaining shares of US
Unwired will be acquired in a cash merger at the same price. Sprint also will
acquire US Unwireds net debt, which was approximately $266 million as of
March 31, 2005, in connection with the transaction. Shareholders with
approximately 27.3% of the outstanding common shares of US Unwired have agreed
to tender their shares pursuant to the tender offer and to vote their shares
in favor of the merger. The acquisition is subject to customary regulatory
approvals and is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2005.



As part of the agreement, Sprint and US Unwired will seek an immediate stay of
litigation pending in U.S. District Court in Lake Charles, La., including US
Unwireds request for an injunction to block the merger of Sprint and Nextel
Communications, with a final resolution to become effective upon the closing
of the acquisition.



US Unwired, based in Lake Charles, La., provides Sprint PCS services in nine
states, serving more than 500,000 direct wireless subscribers in 48 markets.
It employs about 600 people and had 2004 revenues of $408 million.

"This acquisition would bring an end to a long partnership with the management
and shareholders of US Unwired," said Gary Forsee, chairman and CEO, Sprint.
"We appreciate their efforts over the years to grow the Sprint business in its
assigned territories. While we decided to acquire a direct ownership interest
in these assets, we continue to value our relationship with other affiliates
providing Sprint services."



Robert Piper, US Unwireds president and CEO, said: "Since US Unwireds
inception, our employees have demonstrated their commitment to building
substantial shareholder value. We began our Sprint relationship with a
handful of customers and a service territory of 1.8 million residents. Through
the effort of our personnel, our network now covers 8.1 million people and
serves more than a half-million subscribers. We are pleased to have
this opportunity to realize continued value for our shareholders."
