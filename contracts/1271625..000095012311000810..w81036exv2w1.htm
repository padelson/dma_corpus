instalment of the Contingent Incentive and the Salary Based Incentive shall
be funded by the Buyer. In consideration thereof, the Seller has agreed to
deduct the cost therefore, net of tax effects for the Group Companies, from

specified below, when arriving at the agreed Up-Front Purchase Price.
Further, the Buyer and the Seller have agreed to cause the Group Companies

Incentive. Therefore, the Parties have agreed as follows.

Participants allocated share of the first instalment of the Contingent
Incentive and of the Salary Based Incentive (each such share, the "First
Employee Participants Share"), (ii) a calculation of the applicable income
withholding tax and employers tax and social security charges in respect of
each First Employee Participants Share, and (iii) a calculation of the net
tax effects for the Group Companies of the payment of the amounts set forth
in items (i) and (ii) above applying Clause 9.4.2, _mutatis mutandis_ , cause
the Group Companies to pay the First Employee Participants Shares to the
Employee Participants being entitled thereto, less applicable income
withholding tax and employers tax and social security charges. Further, the
Buyer shall cause the Group Companies to report and pay the applicable income
withholding taxes and employers taxes and social security charges to
Applicable Authorities in accordance with Applicable Laws.  
      
  8.8.4  |   | Further, but subject to the funding condition set forth in
the last sentence of this paragraph, after receipt of a certificate
(substantially in the form of the Incentive Certificate), which certificate
shall set forth (i) each Employee Participants allocated share of the second
instalment of the Contingent Incentive (each such share, the "Second Employee
Participants Share") and (ii) a calculation of the applicable income
withholding tax and employers tax and social security charges in respect of
each Second Employee Participants Share, and (iii) a calculation of the net
tax effects for the Group Companies of the payment of the amounts set forth
in items (i) and (ii) above applying Clause 9.4.2,  _mutatis mutandis_ , the
Buyer shall cause the Group Companies to pay the Second
Employee Participants Shares to the Employee Participants being entitled
thereto, less applicable income withholding tax and employers tax and social
security charges, on the date for the Companys ordinary pay-roll following
satisfaction of the funding condition set forth in the last sentence of this
paragraph. Further, the Buyer shall cause the Group Companies to report and
pay the applicable income withholding taxes and employers taxes and social
security charges to Applicable Authorities in accordance with Applicable
Laws. The  
    

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

       |   | Buyers obligation to cause the Second Employee
Participants Share to be paid pursuant to the foregoing sentences shall be
subject to the condition that the Group Companies receive from the Seller
payment of an amount (gross of the net tax effects of applicable withholding
Taxes) sufficient to pay the Second Employee Participants Share and
all applicable employers taxes and social security charges.  
---|---|--- 
      
  8.8.5  |   | The Seller confirms that it will as of the Closing Date
either have agreed with the Employee Participants that the benefits payable
under the Transaction Incentive Plans will not be included in the basis for
calculating any employment benefits; such as pension rights or vacation pay
(Sw. _semesterl on och semesterersattning_) or ensure that the amounts payable
in accordance with Clause 8.8.4 include payment of any such employment
benefits.  
      
  9.  |   | COMPENSATION AND LIMITATIONS  
      
  9.1  |   | Compensation

Buyer and its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Group Companies),
due to such breach.

be treated as a reduction of the Purchase Price, and, subject to the
qualifications and limitations set forth in this Agreement, including without
limitation Clause 10.8, be made at the time of payment and by means of a set-
off against any remaining claims of the Seller for the Deferred Purchase
Price, provided, however, that to the extent any such set-off against
remaining claims of the Seller for the Deferred Purchase Price does not
suffice for the payment of any sum payable by the Seller in respect of any
breach of this Agreement, by means of a set-off against any remaining claims
of the Seller for the Earn-Out, provided, however, that to the extent any such
set-off against remaining claims of the Seller for the Earn-Out does not
suffice for the payment of any sum payable by the Seller in respect of any
breach of this Agreement, the Seller shall compensate the Buyer for such
remaining amounts. Any exercise by the Buyer of the right of setoff in
accordance with Clause 10.8 against a payment owing to the Seller hereunder,
shall not, pending resolution of the matter resulting in such set-off,
constitute a breach or a failure to pay by the Buyer.  
      
  9.1.3  |   | None of the limitations or exclusions set forth in this
Clause 9 shall apply if the Seller is guilty of fraud (including Clauses 30
and 33 set forth in the Swedish Contract Act (Sw. _Lag (1915:218) om avtal
och andra r attshandlingar pa formogenhetsrattens omrade_), _inter alia,_

disclose a material fact necessary in order to make a Warranty true and
correct and not misleading.

  9.2.1  |   | The Warranties are the only warranties given by the Seller
in relation to the Shares and the Group Companies. The Warranties do not
release the Buyer from its duty to carry out a prudent investigation of the
state of affairs of the Group Companies. The Buyer may not rely, and has not
relied, on any other information, statement or warranty (express or implied),
whether based on the Sale of Goods Act, any other Applicable Law or
otherwise.  
      
  9.2.2  |   | In relation to matters relating to Tax, the warranties in
Clause 6.6 are the only warranties governing such matters.  
     

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

     9.2.3  |   | The Seller has not made any warranty (expressed or
implied) as to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the
Group Companies, furnished or made available to the Buyer, its Affiliates and
its advisors, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Neither the
Seller nor any other Person shall have or be subject to any liability to the
Buyer resulting from the distribution to the Buyer, or the Buyers use of,
any such information.  
---|---|--- 
      
  9.3  |   | Remedies  
      
  9.3.1  |   | The Buyers sole remedies for a breach by the Seller of
this Agreement is:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | compensation in accordance with Clause 9.1.1;

), specific performance (Sw. _fullg orelse_) if and to the extent such
remedies are available under Applicable Law.  
   

  

       |   | Such remedies shall be exclusive and, consequently, no
other remedy, including the right to rescind this Agreement, shall be
available to the Buyer in the event of the Sellers breach of this Agreement,
whether under the Sale of Goods Act or otherwise.

without any deduction or withholding and no Party shall be entitled to assert
any credit, set-off or counterclaim against another Party in order to justify
withholding payment of any such amount, in whole or in part, other than as
required under Applicable Law or with respect to undisputed claims or claims
that have been finally settled by a final arbitration award or final judgement
by the Accountant, as the case may be, which may be set-off in accordance
with Clause 9.1.2 of this Agreement; provided, however, that all or a portion

agreement attached hereto as _Schedule 10.8.3_ (the "Escrow Agreement").
The  
---|---|--- 
    

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

       |   | Buyer covenants and agrees that it will execute and

request.  
---|---|--- 
      
  10.8.4  |   | The escrow agent appointed pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement shall hold and release the amount so withheld and paid into the
Escrow Account pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement.
Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, the Buyer
specifically covenants and agrees:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | that any amounts paid to the Escrow Account with
respect to a specific bona fide claim against the Seller pursuant to Clause
10.8.2(a) above shall be immediately released if the Buyer has not initiated
legal proceedings in respect of the claim in question within one month of
having made such payment into the Escrow Account; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | that any amounts paid to the Escrow Account pursuant to

       | (A)  |   | 1/4 of such amount shall be released on 1
January 2014;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (B)  |   | 1/4 of such amount shall be released on 1 January
2015;

    | (D)  |   | 1/4 of such amount shall be released on 1 January
2017;  
      
    |   |   | in each case provided that no bona fide claim has been
made against the Seller under item (c) of Schedule 9.9 prior to such date.  
   

  

     10.8.5  |   | Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set out
herein, if the Buyer is entitled to withhold an amount pursuant to Clause
10.8.2, the Seller shall, in its sole discretion, be entitled to have a bank
guarantee issued to the Buyer (the "Bank Guarantee") instead of having the
Buyer pay the relevant amount to the Escrow Account pursuant to Clause 10.8.3.
The Bank Guarantee shall be issued by a reputable bank reasonably
satisfactory to the Buyer and shall cover the amount which the Buyer is
entitled to withhold pursuant to Clause 10.8.2. The Buyer covenants and
agrees that it will immediately pay to the Seller any amounts withheld

  3.1.2  |   | In addition to the Buyer Calculations, the Buyer shall
deliver to the Seller upon written request (and, in any case, in the event of

Dispute Notice within such thirty (30) calendar day period, the Seller shall
be deemed to have accepted the Buyer Calculations as correct and final. If

thirty (30) calendar day period, the Seller shall be deemed to have accepted
all items and amounts contained in the Buyer Calculations with respect to
which it has not disagreed in its Earn-Out Dispute Notice, provided, however,

opportunity to present to the Accountant (with copies to be provided to the
other Party) any material related to the unresolved disputes and, if requested
by the Accountant, to discuss the issues with the Accountant in a meeting
where representatives of both Parties shall attend. When resolving the Earn-
Out Dispute, the Accountant shall review the Buyers and the Sellers
calculations and the Earn-Out Accounts for purposes of determining whether
the Earn-Out Accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Adjustments
Principles on a consistent basis with the Interim Financial Information.

Seller has disagreed pursuant to Clause 3.1.3 and the decision of the
Accountant shall in no event go beyond any of the disagreements of and the
calculations made by the Seller or the Buyer pursuant to Clauses 3.1.1 and
3.1.3. The Accountant shall issue and deliver to the Buyer and the Seller a
written statement of such resolution setting forth the Accountants
adjustments to the Earn-Out Accounts, if any, and the Accountants
calculation of the PBT (a "Final Decision") and such calculation of the PBT
shall be based on the so adjusted Earn-Out Accounts, and shall,
absent manifest errors, be final and binding upon both the Buyer and the
Seller.  
      
  3.1.7  |   | The fees, costs and expenses of the Accountant shall be
paid by the Buyer if the calculation of PBT by the Accountant differs from
the Buyers Calculation by 3% or more based on the Final Decision by the
Accountant,  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   | and otherwise will be split 50/50 between the Buyer and
the Seller, and the Parties shall cover their own costs and expenses in
connection with the final determination of the PBT, provided, however, that
if the Buyer did not make material information available that was reasonably
requested by the Seller or its advisors in connection with their review of
the Buyer Calculation, the Buyer shall pay all fees, costs and expenses of
the Accountant and the Seller.

  3.1.8  |   | In the event of an Earn-Out Dispute, the Buyer will be
under no obligation to make any payment of the disputed portion of the Earn-
Out, as determined in accordance with Clause 3.1.6, until such dispute is
finally resolved by either a written settlement agreement between the Buyer
and the Seller or a Final Decision, provided, however, that to the extent
the Earn-Out is not, subject to disagreement by the Seller as described in
Clause 3.1.6, the Buyer shall be obliged to pay the undisputed part of the
Earn-Out, i.e. the lower amount of the range defined by the Buyers and the
Sellers respective calculation of the PBT, in accordance with Clause 3.2
below.

Out, (a) within five (5) calendar days after the Buyers receipt of the
Sellers written acceptance of the Buyer Calculations (the "Sellers
Acceptance"), (b) within thirty five (35) calendar days after the Sellers

receiving the Buyer Calculations, the Seller has not delivered the Sellers
Acceptance to the Buyer or provided the Buyer with an Earn-Out Dispute
Notice, or, in any event, with respect to any undisputed part of the Earn-
Out, or (c) if the Seller has delivered an Earn-Out Dispute Notice to the

the Earn-Out in respect of which the Buyer and the Seller subsequently
executes a written settlement agreement or the Accountant issues and delivers
a Final Decision, as applicable, in each case in the Sellers favor, at a rate
corresponding to (i) STIBOR, _plus_ (ii) a margin of 1.78 percent of
such amount divided by 360, multiplied by the number of days from the fifth

to Clauses 3.2.1 or 3.2.2, as the case may be, from the due date thereof
pursuant to such Clause until the date of payment.

based on the actual and documented services rendered to the Group Companies
and will to the extent relating to the Included Business be included in the
calculation of the PBT. The Buyer shall procure that the Group Companies
provide a summary of any services provided under (i) or (ii) above to the
board of directors of the Company as part of Groups normal
reporting practices. Any other corporate cost allocations, including without
limitation to management fees that deviates from what is set out above, made
to or paid by the Group Companies, shall be excluded from the calculation of
the PBT.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | _Benefits Adjustments:_ Employee benefits (excluding
salaries) may be provided by the Buyer or its Affiliates for the Group
Companies employees. Any increase in the cost allocation for such benefits
as compared to those expenses in the Forecast, unless such increase results
from a change required by Applicable Law, shall not be charged to the Group
Companies. Increases in benefits expenses resulting from periodic cost
increases imposed by benefit providers in the Agreed Course of Business or
for new employees (excluding employees for any Excluded Business), as
contemplated by the Forecast, will be an operating expense for purposes of
determining the PBT.  
      
    | (c)  |   | _Compensation Adjustments._ Any increases in salaries
or related compensation (other than benefits provided pursuant to 5(b),
above) of the employees of the Group Companies in the Agreed Course of
Business shall be charged to the Group Companies, provided that any salary
and related compensation adjustments directed by the Buyer and not in the
Agreed Course of Business or in excess of what is required under Applicable
Law or by collective bargaining agreements will be excluded from the PBT as
well as compensation adjustments relating to the Excluded Business. All
additional employees of the Group Companies added in the Agreed Course of
Business after the Closing Date (including any employees that replace
existing employees as of the Closing Date but excluding employees for any
Excluded Business or any additional employees of the Group Companies working
at the head office directly as a result of any new stores opened following
the Closing Date), their compensation expense will be an operating expense
for purposes of determining the PBT.  
      
    | (d)  |   | _Other Expenses._ All expenses of the Group Companies,
to the extent relating to and incurred in the conduct of the Included
Business and in the Agreed Course of Business shall be included for the
purposes of calculating the PBT (including any costs and expenses relating to
project Queen, a new IT-system to be implemented by the Group Companies,
that is currently included in the Forecast). Any expenses   
  

  ##### 

  

  

      |   |   | incurred outside the Agreed Course of Business of
the Included Business and any expenses incurred in relation to the Excluded
Business shall be excluded for the purposes of calculating the PBT, including
but not limited to any additional overhead costs directly resulting from the
opening of any new stores after the Closing Date and any additional expenses
relating to project Queen that are not included in the Forecast and that
result from a modification of the scope of project Queen as of the Signing
Date.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (e)  |   | _Exclusion of claim:_ The impact on the PBT of the
Group Companies related to any and all issues that may give the Buyer a claim
against the Sellers under the Agreement shall be excluded for the purposes of
calculating the PBT.  
      
    | (f)  |   | _Accounting Reserves:_ Any accounting reserves, except
for reserves and accruals created in the Ordinary Course of Business, that
have been created by the Company prior to the Closing Date and that are
reversed during the Earn-Out Period shall not count for purposes of
calculating the PBT, provided, however, that to the extent such reserves
created outside the Ordinary Course of Business are found insufficient during
the Earn-Out Period entailing additional costs and expenses for the Group
Companies in relation to the subject matter of such reserves, such costs and
expenses shall also be excluded from the calculation of the PBT. The
Company will provide a certificate at Closing, signed by the Companys chief
financial officer, setting forth a true and accurate list of the Companys
accounting reserves outside the Ordinary Course of Business and the amounts
of such reserves as of the Closing Date.  
      
    |   |   | Any accounting reserves created by the Company during the
Earn-Out Period in the Ordinary Course of Business in accordance with the
Accounting Principles in relation to the Included Business, shall be included
in the calculation of the PBT (whereas, for the avoidance of doubt, any
accounting reserves outside the Ordinary Course of Business or relating to
the Excluded Business shall not). If and to the extent any such accounting
reserves that have been included in the PBT are thereafter reversed during
the Earn-Out Period, any such reversal shall be counted for purposes of PBT.
If and to the extent any such accounting reserves that have been included in
the PBT and which individually amount to at least SEK 500,000, are reversed
or are found insufficient after the expiry of the Second Earn-Out Period or
an Accelerated Earn-Out, the Buyer agrees to compensate the Seller as
promptly as possible with an amount in SEK corresponding to the effect such
reversal would have had on the Earn-Out if it had taken place during
the Earn-Out Period and the Seller agrees to compensate the Buyer as promptly
as possible with an amount in SEK corresponding to the effect any such
additional costs or expenses resulting from the subject matter of the
insufficient reserve would have had if they had been incurred during the
Earn-Out Period, respectively.  
      

  ##### 

  

   

       | (g)  |   | _Disputes and Complaints:_ All costs and expenses
incurred by the Group Companies in rigorously defending against any,
disputes, complaints or other legal matters in relation to the matters
described in Clause 4.1.2(a) will to the extent related to the Included
Business be considered expenses incurred in the Agreed Course of Business and
included in the PBT calculation, provided that the Buyer agrees that it will
notify the Sellers Representative prior taking any such action, and will use
its commercially reasonable business judgment in determining the appropriate
course of action to engage in such rigorous defense so as not to engage in
excessive or unnecessary legal proceedings.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (h)  |   | _Included and Excluded Business:_ All income and
expenses of the Buyer and its Affiliates (including for purposes hereof the
Group Companies) that relates to the Company Business in or relating to the
Existing Shops (including but not limited to any gain or loss relating to any
disposal of Existing Shops or material assets), any income that relates to a
Current Customer in any stores that are not Existing Shops and any income
from retail sales of products that are transferred from Existing Shops to new
stores and sold in new stores, and as such business is intended to be
conducted pursuant to the Forecast or is adjusted, changed or modified after
the Closing Date in accordance with Clause 4.1.2(b), shall be included in the
calculation of the PBT ("Included Business"). All income and expenses of the
Group Companies that relate to any business activities in stores that are not
open on the Closing Date, including in any stores acquired (directly or
indirectly) after the Closing Date (with the Buyer procuring that such
acquired stores will not operate under the trade names or trademarks of any
Group Company) but excluding any business activities of the Current
Customers, shall be excluded in the calculation of the PBT ("Excluded
Business"). Accordingly, and for the avoidance of doubt, only the operations
of the Buyer and its Affiliates (including for purposes hereof the Group
Companies) within the Company Business conducted in the Existing Shops
(including but not limited to any gain or loss relating to any disposal of
Existing Shops or material assets) and for the products and services (i)
offered as of the Closing Date and any income relating to Current Customers
or products from Existing Shops in any stores that are opened after the
Closing Date, (ii) referred to in the Forecast or (iii) added with the prior
written consent of the Seller, will be included in the calculation of the
PBT.  
      
    | (i)  |   | _Current Customers_ : Without prejudice to item (h)
above, in the event that there is a default relating to a Current Customer in
a store that is not an Existing Shop, the income and expenses resulting from
the default process, i.e. from the auction, retail or scrap sales, shall be
included in the calculation of the PBT, and be determined based on the
average income and expenses for defaulting customers during the relevant
Earn-Out Period in the Existing Shops (relative to and adjusted for the
relevant loan amounts).  
      

  ##### 

  

   

       | (j)  |   | _Cost and Expenses relating to this Agreement:_
Any costs and expenses incurred by the Buyer in connection with the
performance of the Buyers obligations pursuant to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement shall not be allocated to the Company. Services, resources
and licenses to be provided by the Group Companies to the Buyer shall be
provided at arms-length basis and on market terms in accordance with
Applicable Law.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (k)  |   | _Additional Working Capital Loans:_ If the Group
Companies require additional funding in relation to, or funding replacing,
the Working Capital Loans existing on the Closing Date to fund the pledge
stock of the Included Business in the Agreed Course of Business, the Buyer
and its Affiliates shall make available such financing on an arms-length
basis, or procure that external funding is raised, at a competitive
marketable interest rate for external financing and on such other terms and
conditions commensurate with those applicable to the Group Companies under
the terms of the Working Capital Loans existing as of the Closing
Date. Interest expense of the Group Companies in accordance with the above
shall be included in the calculation of the PBT, provided, however, that any
such interest expense relating to the Excluded Business or exceeding what may
reasonably be deemed to be a competitive marketable interest rate for
external funding shall be excluded for the purposes of calculating the PBT.  
      
    | (l)  |   | If financing, in addition to the replacement of the
Preato Loan in accordance with Clause 4.1.1(k), that is not financing in
accordance with item (k) above, is deemed reasonably necessary by the board
of the Company, in light of the Group Companies performing significantly
worse than anticipated in the Forecast, for the conduct of the Included
Business in the Agreed Course of Business, the Buyer or its Affiliates shall
make available such shareholder financing on an arms-length basis, or procure
that external funding is raised, at an interest rate not exceeding the
interest rate on the Working Capital Loans existing on the Closing Date and
on such other terms and conditions commensurate to the terms and conditions
of the Working Capital Loans. Interest expense (excluding any other fees) of
the Included Business in accordance with the above shall be included in the
calculation of PBT.  
      
    | (m)  |   | _Financing Costs, Amortizations and Write-Offs:_ Any
other interest expenses and other financing costs not relating to funding
described in items (k) or (l) above, including without limitation any
interest expenses or other financing costs resulting from a breach of the
covenant in Clause 4.1.1(k), of the operations of the Included Business and
any costs relating to amortizations or write-offs of intangible assets in the
Group Companies, whether relating to the Included or the Excluded Business,
shall be excluded from the calculation of the PBT.  
      

  ##### 

  

   

       | (n)  |   | _Dividend, Distribution and other Transfer of
Value_ : If any Group Company declares makes or pays any dividend,
distribution or other transfer of value (Sw. _v ardeoverforing_) other than
to another Group Company or in breach of Applicable Law, and such dividend,
distribution or transfer of value result in an increase in borrowing costs by
the Group Companies, taken as a whole, the additional interest expense
resulting from such financing will be excluded from the calculation of PBT.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

     6.  |   | Reporting to Seller during the Earn-Out Period  
---|---|--- 
      
  6.1  |   | The Buyer shall procure that the Company provides the
Sellers Representative with a copy of the Interim Financial Information
within 30 days following the end of each such reporting period.  
      
  6.2  |   | The Interim Financial Information shall (i) present fairly in
all material respects the financial condition and the results of operations

respective dates of, and for the periods referred to in, such Interim
Financial Information, all in accordance with this Schedule, and (ii) be

consistent application of the Adjustment Principles and results of operations
of the Group Companies throughout the periods involved. In addition, the
Interim Financial Information will include a comparison to the anticipated
results of operation for the relevant period based on the Forecast.  
      
  6.3  |   | Furthermore, the Interim Financial Information will include a
certification, signed by each of the senior executive officer (currently Siv
Svensson) and chief financial officer (currently Jan Mattsson) of the
Company, that the Group Companies operations have been conducted in
accordance with all of the provisions of this Schedule and that, to each
such persons knowledge, there has been no breach of any obligation of the
Buyer and no dispute with respect to any costs allocated by the Buyer to the
Group Companies in accordance with the terms of this Schedule.  
      
  6.4  |   | The Sellers Representative will review the Group Companies
financial performance against the Forecast following the close of each
calendar quarter. To the extent the Sellers Representative believes any such
Interim Financial Information and/or the other information received is
unclear or incorrect, the Seller will promptly notify the Buyer and the Buyer
will procure that the Group Companies promptly provides the Sellers
Representative with an explanation of any perceived issues and other
information reasonably requested by the Sellers Representative.  
      
  6.5  |   | The Seller shall be entitled to receive additional financial
information (including monthly management accounts) and other information
regarding the Group Companies as may be reasonably requested by the Seller.

     7.  |   | Acceleration of Earn-Out and Breach  
---|---|--- 
      
  7.1  |   | In the event that (i) the Group Companies cease to be an
Affiliate of the Buyer (for purposes of which the Group Companies shall be
deemed to be an Affiliate of the Buyer as from the Closing), or (ii) the
Buyer, or any of its Affiliates to whom the Buyers obligations hereunder
have been transferred, enters into insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy or
similar proceedings, any part of the Earn-Out in respect of any of the First
and the Second Earn-Out Periods that remains unpaid on the occurrence of such
an event shall accelerate and become immediately payable to the Seller. The
amount then payable as Earn-Out in respect of such periods (the "Accelerated
Earn-Out") shall be determined on the basis of the Accelerated PBT in
accordance with Clause 2, _less_ any part of the Earn-Out paid by the Buyer
prior thereto in accordance with Clause 3.  
      
  7.2  |   | If the Buyer and the Seller fail to agree on the Accelerated
PBT within 15 calendar days from the date of the Accelerated Earn-Out, the
Buyer or the Seller may refer the matter to the Accountant in accordance with
3.1.6 and 3.1.7.  
      
  7.3  |   | Subject to Clause 9.1.2 of the Agreement, any payment of the
Accelerated Earn-Out shall be made by the Buyer to a bank account nominated

determination of the Accelerated Earn-Out above.  
      
  7.4  |   | If not paid when due pursuant to Clause 7.1, interest at a
rate equal to the default interest rate according to section 6 of the Swedish
Interest Act (Sw. _r antelagen _(1975:635)), shall be payable by the Buyer to
the Seller on the Accelerated Earn-Out from the due date thereof pursuant to
such Clause until the date of payment.  
      
  7.5  |   | In case the Buyer has breached or is in breach of any of its
obligations under Clauses 4 and 6, the Buyer shall at the time of payment of
the respective part of the Earn-Out pay to the Seller any amounts that would
have been paid to the Seller under the Earn-Out if the Buyer had not been in
breach of Clauses 4 or 6, including any costs incurred by the Seller in
disputing such breach.
