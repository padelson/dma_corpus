respects with all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code, except for breaches and violations
that would not, or have not, individually or in the aggregate had or would be reasonably expected
to have, a Material Adverse Effect. No &#147;prohibited transaction,&#148; within the meaning of Section
4975 of the Code or Section&nbsp;406 of ERISA for which no class or statutory exemption is available,
has occurred with respect to any Employee Plan. There are no Actions pending or, to the Knowledge

Employee Plan or against the assets of any Employee Plan or relating to any Employee Plan or
Employee Agreement. Each Employee Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after

of their respective ERISA Affiliates (other than ordinary administration expenses typically
incurred in a termination event and benefits accrued thereunder). There are no audits, inquiries or
proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of the RFG Family Entities, threatened by the IRS, the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or the DOL with respect to any Employee Plan. No RFG Family
Entity is subject to any penalty or Tax with respect to any Employee Plan under Section 502(i) of
ERISA or Section&nbsp;4975 through 4980B of the Code. All contributions, including any top heavy or
matching contributions and premiums, required to be made by any RFG Family Entity or any of their

Closing Date. All unpaid Liabilities of any RFG Family Entity or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates with respect to an Employee Plan that are not yet due have been properly accrued in
accordance with GAAP. For completed plan years of each Employee Plan, all contributions have been
fully deducted for income Tax purposes and no such deduction has been challenged or disallowed by
any Governmental Authority and, to the Knowledge of the RFG Family Entities, no reasonable or valid
basis exists for any such challenge or disallowance. Each of the RFG Family Entities and their
respective ERISA Affiliates are in compliance in all material respects with the requirements of
Parts 6 and 7 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and the regulations promulgated thereunder and any
similar state Laws concerning group health care continuation coverage and group health plan
portability, access and renewability requirements. Each Employee Plan or related trust that is
intended to be qualified or exempt from taxation under Section&nbsp;401(a), 401(k) or 501(a) of the Code
has received a favorable determination, opinion, notification or advisory letter from the IRS that
it is so qualified or exempt, and, to the Knowledge of the RFG Family Entities, nothing has
occurred since the date of such letter that would adversely affect the qualified or exempt status

enforce any covenant contained in this Article&nbsp;9, then such unenforceable covenant shall be deemed
to have been deleted from this Agreement to the extent necessary to permit the remaining separate
covenants to be enforceable. Each Seller has considered the nature and extent of the restrictions

The Parties recognize and agree that the violation of the provisions of this Article&nbsp;9 or of any
other provision of this Agreement cannot be reasonably or adequately compensated in damages and
that, in addition to any other relief to which any Party may be entitled by reason of such
violation, it shall also be entitled to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive and
equitable relief. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Seller specifically
agrees that a showing by Calavo of any breach of any provision of this Article&nbsp;9 shall constitute,
for the purposes of all determinations of the issue of injunctive relief, conclusive proof of all
of the elements necessary to entitle Calavo to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive
