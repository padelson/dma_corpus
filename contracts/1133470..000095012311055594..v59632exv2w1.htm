  _THE MERGER_  

   

 2.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ "), Newco shall merge with and into RFG (the " _Merger_ "). The Closing shall occur, and the Merger shall become effective at the time the Certificate of Merger (the " _Merger Certificate_ ") shall have been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or such later date and time as is agreed upon by the Parties and specified in the Merger Certificate, such date and time to be hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_." The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_." 

  

 2.2 _Merger Certificate_. Calavo shall prepare a Merger Certificate that contains the statements required by State Law. The Parties to this Agreement shall cooperate in connection with executing and filing the Merger Certificate with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on a timely basis. 

  

 2.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the separate existence of Newco shall terminate, and RFG shall continue as the surviving entity of the Merger (" _Surviving RFG_ "). From and after the Effective Time, all the rights, property, privileges, powers and franchises of each of RFG and Newco shall vest in Surviving RFG, and Surviving RFG shall be subject to all the Liabilities and duties of each of RFG and Newco. The Merger shall be effective as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of State Law. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registrations or transfers of Securities Certificates on the equity interest transfer records of RFG. 

  

 2.4 _Certificate of Formation, Operating Agreement and Officers and Managers of RFG After the Merger_. 

  

 (a) Unless and until amended after the Closing in accordance with applicable Law, the Certificate of Formation of RFG shall be the Certificate of Formation of Surviving RFG after the Closing. Unless and until amended after the Closing in accordance with applicable Law, the Operating Agreement of Surviving RFG shall be amended and restated at the Effective Time to be substantially in the form set forth as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Operating Agreement_ "). 

   

 (b) Surviving RFG shall be governed in accordance with this Agreement and the Operating Agreement. As soon as practicable after Closing, the Board of Managers shall amend and restate the limited liability company agreements of the LLCs to provide for management by Surviving RFG as the sole member, to provide that the officers of Surviving RFG shall be the officers of the LLCs and to provide for such other terms as may be agreed upon 

      ##### 

  

    

by the Board of Managers, provided all such terms shall be consistent with the
terms of this Agreement and the Operating Agreement. 

   

 (c) The officers of Surviving RFG, effective at the Effective Time, shall be as set forth in the Operating Agreement until their respective successors shall have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the applicable provisions of Surviving RFGs Certificate of Formation, Operating Agreement and State Law. 

   

 2.5 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Closing, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of Purchaser, RFG or any Seller: 

  

 (a) Each Security of Newco that is outstanding immediately prior to the Closing automatically shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable Security in Surviving RFG with the same rights, powers and privileges as the Securities so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding equity interests of Surviving RFG. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the Securities of Newco shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of Securities of Surviving RFG into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. Calavo shall own all outstanding Securities of Surviving RFG from and after the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) All of the Securities of RFG that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive an allocation of the Merger Consideration as set forth on _Exhibit A_, which represents each Securityholders proportional interest in RFG. If the Merger Consideration consists of cash and Merger Shares, each Securityholder shall be entitled to his or its pro rata portion of each. 

   

 2.6 _Fractions and Rounding_. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no fractional shares of Common Stock and no certificates or scrip therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued as Merger Consideration; instead, Purchaser will pay to each payee otherwise entitled to receive a fractional share of Common Stock, an amount in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying such fraction of a share of Common Stock by the Merger Share Value. Any cash portion of the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Article 2 shall be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half being rounded up). 

  

 2.7 _Approval of Merger_. Each Seller, by executing this Agreement, hereby consents to this Agreement and all transactions contemplated hereby, including but not limited to the Merger. Calavo, as the sole holder of Securities of Newco, hereby consents to this Agreement and all transactions contemplated hereby, including but not limited to the Merger. 

  

 2.8 _Dissenting Shares_. Because each holder of voting securities of RFG and Newco has consented in writing to the Merger, no holder of voting securities of RFG or Newco shall be entitled to exercise dissenters rights or appraisal rights under State Law. 

   ##### 

  

  

 2.9 _Payment at Closing._  

  

 (a) At the Closing, Calavo shall pay an amount equal to the Initial Merger Cash to the Trust, which shall distribute such amounts to the Securityholders as set forth in Section 2.24. The Sellers agree and acknowledge that Purchaser shall have no liability for distributions made to the Sellers by the Trust. 

   

 (b) As promptly as possible after the Closing, Calavo shall cause its transfer agent to issue a stock certificate in the name of the Trust to evidence the Initial Merger Shares. Such stock certificate shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent and shall evidence the Initial Merger Shares (the " _Holdback Shares_ ") that the Securityholders have agreed to allow the Escrow Agent to hold as security for the Sellers obligations pursuant to Section 2.11 and Article 10, in accordance with Section 2.10. 

   

 (c) The Securityholders hereby covenant that the Initial Merger Consideration shall be used to pay off the SBA Loan as soon as practicable, but not later than 5 business days, after Closing. 

   

 2.10 _Merger Securities Held by Escrow Agent_. __ 

  

 (a) As security for the closing adjustment obligations of the Sellers described in Section 2.11 and the indemnification obligations of the Sellers described in Article 10, the Escrow Agent shall hold the Holdback Shares in accordance with this Section 2.10 and the Escrow Agreement. 

   

 (b) During the period in which the Escrow Agent holds the Holdback Shares as security, the Trust shall be treated as the record owner of the Holdback Shares and shall have voting rights and dividend rights with respect to the Holdback Shares. Neither the Trust nor any Seller shall be entitled to sell, assign, pledge or otherwise transfer (except to Calavo) any of the Holdback Shares prior to the later to occur of (i) the end of the Lock-Up Period with respect to such Holdback Shares, and (b) the delivery of the Holdback Shares to the Trust by the Escrow Agent in accordance with this Section 2.10 and the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Any stock dividends or stock split shares that are distributed by Calavo on the Holdback Shares shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent and be held by the Escrow Agent subject to the terms of this Section 2.10 and the Escrow Agreement, but any cash dividends that are paid by Calavo on the Holdback Shares shall be distributed to the Trust. 

   

 (c) If a Seller becomes obligated under Article 10 or any other provision of this Agreement to make a payment to Calavo, such payments, at the election of Seller, shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds by the Sellers to Calavo. To the extent that the Sellers do not timely make payments in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Calavo may, at its option, use the Holdback Shares to recover any funds to which they may be entitled. The number of the Holdback Shares to be transferred to Calavo, if any, shall be equal to the aggregate amount of the indemnifiable Losses or other obligation to be paid by the Sellers in the form of Holdback Shares, divided by the Merger Shares Value. For example, if the Sellers owe $500,000, Calavo shall receive from the Escrow Agent 21,739 Holdback Shares ($500,000 divided by $23), and the Sellers and the Trust shall cease to be treated as the owner of those 

      ##### 

  

    

Holdback Shares. If and to the extent that the Escrow Agent does not hold
sufficient Holdback Shares to cover the obligation, then the Sellers (or, to
the extent applicable, the Trust) shall be personally obligated to make a
payment to Calavo for the deficit. In order to allow the Escrow Agent to
instruct Calavos transfer agent to transfer shares to Calavo in satisfaction
of a claim, the Trust shall deliver two duly executed stock assignments in
blank to the Escrow Agent at the Closing. The Escrow Agent is authorized to
complete such assignments and deliver them to Calavos transfer agent if a
Seller becomes liable to make a payment to Calavo under this Agreement. 

   

 (d) The deposit of the Holdback Shares with the Escrow Agent is not intended to limit the amount or duration of the Sellers indemnification obligations under Article 10 or other obligations under this Agreement. If and to the extent that the Holdback Shares are not sufficient to satisfy the Sellers monetary obligation, if the Person entitled to indemnification is not Calavo or Surviving RFG, or if the Holdback Shares have been returned to the Seller following the expiration of the period described above, then Calavo (or any other Person entitled to indemnification) shall be entitled to such other remedies as set forth in this Agreement and shall be entitled to enforce such obligations against the Sellers. 

   

 (e) At the end of the Holdback Period, the Escrow Agent shall retain a number of Holdback Shares equal to the amount of any Pending Claim by Purchaser, and deliver to the Trust the Holdback Shares that have not been applied to the satisfaction of the Sellers obligations under this Agreement and are not being retained pursuant to a Pending Claim by Purchaser. A " _Pending Claim_ " means a claim (i) that is asserted in good faith and on a reasonable basis by Calavo, (ii) for which written notice of the specific claim is given to the Sellers within the one year after the Closing Date, and (iii) which is based on a Sellers obligation under this Agreement. If and to the extent that the Holdback Shares are being retained pursuant to a Pending Claim, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the Holdback Shares only if and when it is determined that such amounts are not required to be transferred to Calavo. After the return of the deposited Holdback Shares to the Trust, the Sellers shall remain personally obligated to satisfy their obligations under this Agreement to the extent that they have obligations that may continue after Holdback Shares have been delivered to the Trust. 

   

 2.11 _Closing Adjustment_. 

  

 (a) At least three business days prior to the Closing Date, RFG shall deliver to Purchaser an unaudited interim Closing Statement (the " _Closing Statement_ "), certified as true and correct by RFGs Chief Financial Officer, setting forth, in reasonable detail, RFGs good faith calculation of the Current Assets, Current Liabilities and Closing Adjustment Amount as of the Closing Date. All expenses relating to the preparation of the Closing Statement by employees or agents of RFG or Purchaser will be borne by the party employing or engaging such employees or agents and will be reflected in the Closing Statement as appropriate. Purchaser and Purchasers independent certified public accountants will have the right to review, at the expense of Purchaser, any applicable work papers relating to the preparation of the Closing Statement. 

   

 (b) No later than 60 calendar days after the Closing Date, Calavo will prepare and deliver, or cause to be prepared and delivered, to the Sellers Representative, at Calavos 

      ##### 

  

    

expense, an unaudited statement (the " _Final Statement_ "), certified as true
and correct by Calavos Chief Financial Officer, which will set forth in
reasonable detail any proposed adjustments to the Closing Adjustment Amount
as of the Closing Date from the estimate thereof set forth in the Closing
Statement. The Sellers Representative and his Representatives will have
the right to review, at the Sellers Representatives expense, the Books and
Records of Surviving RFG, relating to the preparation of the Final Statement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any information received in connection with
such review shall be subject to the same restrictions set forth in Section
2.15 with respect to Earn-Out Statement Confidential Information. 

   

 (c) In the event of any objection by the Sellers Representative with respect to the calculations set forth in the Final Statement, the Sellers Representative shall give written notice to Calavo of the existence of such objection and the Parties will attempt to resolve any disputed items in good faith for a period of 30 days from the receipt of such written notice. If the Sellers Representative does not deliver a written objection within 30 days after his receipt of the Final Statement, then the calculation of the Closing Adjustment Amount as set forth in the applicable Final Statement shall be deemed to have been accepted. 

   

 (d) Failing resolution pursuant to Section 2.11(c) within 30 days after receipt of the written notice of objection from the Sellers Representative, either Calavo or the Sellers Representative may submit any unresolved disputed items with respect to the Final Statement for binding resolution to the Independent Accounting Firm. Calavo and the Sellers Representative shall direct the Independent Accounting Firm to, within 30 days following such submission, resolve the unresolved objections and such resolution shall be final and binding on all Parties hereto. 

   

 (e) Each of Calavo and the Sellers Representative shall submit to the Independent Accounting Firm (with a copy delivered to the other on the same day), within 10 days after the date of the engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm, a memorandum (which may include supporting exhibits) setting forth their respective positions on the unresolved objections. Each of Calavo and the Sellers Representative may (but shall not be required to) submit to the Independent Accounting Firm (with a copy delivered to the other on the same day), within 20 days after the date of the engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm, a memorandum responding to the initial memorandum submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm by the other Party. Unless requested by the Independent Accounting Firm in writing, no Party hereto may present any additional information or arguments to the Independent Accounting Firm, either orally or in writing. 

   

 (f) Within 30 days after the date of its engagement hereunder, the Independent Accounting Firm shall issue a written ruling which shall include a revised Final Statement as adjusted (i) pursuant to any resolutions to objections agreed upon by Calavo and the Sellers Representative and (ii) pursuant to the Independent Accounting Firms resolution of the unresolved objections. The Independent Accounting Firm shall review only those matters specified in the unresolved objections and shall make no changes to the Final Statement, except as are required to resolve the unresolved objections. The Final Statement provided by the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 2.11(f) shall be deemed to be the Final Statement and it shall be final and binding on all Parties hereto. The Parties agree that the procedure set forth in this Section 2.11 for resolving disputes with respect to the Final Statement 

      ##### 

  

    

shall be the sole and exclusive method for resolving any such disputes. The
Independent Accounting Firms determination may be enforced in any court of
competent jurisdiction, but the substance of the Independent Accounting
Firms determination shall not be subject to review in any such proceeding. 

   

 (g) Calavo, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, shall each be responsible for one-half of the fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm. 

   

 (h) If, consistent with the provisions of this Section 2.11, the adjustments to the Final Statement require an adjustment to the Initial Cash Merger Consideration, the Sellers, on a joint and several basis, or Calavo, as applicable, will make any payments or refunds, as the case may be, on a dollar-for-dollar basis with respect to the Initial Cash Merger Consideration necessary as a result of the change in the Closing Adjustment Amount as shown in the Final Statement within five business days of the adjustments to the Final Statement being deemed final pursuant to Section 2.11. If a decrease of the Initial Cash Merger Consideration as a result of the change in the Closing Adjustment Amount as shown in the Final Statement requires a refund to Purchaser, such payment will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds from the Sellers to Calavo. If an increase of the Initial Cash Merger Consideration as a result of the change in the Closing Adjustment Amount as shown in the Final Statement requires a refund to the Sellers, such payments shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds by Calavo to the Trust, net of applicable withholding taxes. To the extent that the Sellers do not timely make payments as set forth above, Calavo may, at its option, use the Holdback Shares to recover any refund to which they may be entitled. 

   

 (i) In addition, Calavo and the Sellers agree that in the event that Calavo is not able to recover the account receivable shown on _Schedule 2.11_ of the Sellers Disclosure Letter by September 1, 2011, the Sellers, on a joint and several basis, shall make payment to Calavo in the amount to which such account receivable has not been collected. Calavo agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to collect such account receivable prior to September 1, 2011.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any Seller breaches any of the covenants contained in Article 9, then such Seller shall not be entitled to receive from Calavo any Earn-Out Payments that would otherwise have been distributed to such Seller by Purchaser in accordance with this Article 2\. In such event, the total amount of any Earn-Out Payments shall be reduced by the total amount of any Earn-Out Payment that such Seller ceases to have the right to receive. For purposes of this Section, a breach of Article 9 by Mr. K. Catchot, Mr. J. Catchot or Mr. Gibson shall be also attributable to Liberty Fresh Foods, LLC, to the extent of the breaching Partys interest therein on the date hereof (as set forth on  _Schedule 2.14_ of the Sellers Disclosure Letter), and any breach of Article 9 by Liberty Fresh Foods, LLC shall be attributable to each of Mr. K. Catchot, Mr. J. Catchot and Mr. Gibson. 

  

 2.15 _Calculation of Earn-Out Payments_. 

  

 (a) During the Earn-Out Period, Calavo shall provide to the Sellers Representative, at Calavos expense, no later than the monthly meeting of the Board of Directors of Calavo (which in no event shall be later than 30 days after the end of each calendar month), monthly statements providing in reasonable detail information regarding the operation of the Business and the EBITDA and Revenues achieved by the Business for the twelve-months ended with the prior calendar month and the twelve-months ended with the two months immediately preceding such month, together with any other information reasonably necessary to permit the Sellers Representative to assess progress toward the achievement of the Earn-Out Triggers and the Benchmark (each, an " _Earn-Out Statement_ "). Each Earn-Out Statement will be prepared in accordance with Financial Statement Principles. Purchaser shall maintain such accounting records, ledgers, books and other documents as may be necessary to prepare such statements and 

      ##### 

  

    

make such records, ledgers, books and other documents available to the
Sellers Representative upon his request after reasonable notice and during
normal business hours. 

   

 (b) In the event of any objection by the Sellers Representative with respect to the determination of the EBITDA, Revenues or the Earn-Out Payment payable for the Earn-Out Period, the Sellers Representative shall give written notice to Calavo of the existence of such objection and the Parties will attempt to resolve any disputed items in good faith for a period of 30 days from the receipt of such written notice. If the Sellers Representative does not deliver a written objection within 30 days after his receipt of an Earn-Out Statement, then the calculation of the EBITDA, Revenues and the Earn-Out Payment payable for the Earn-Out Period as set forth in the applicable Earn-Out Statement shall be deemed to have been accepted. 

   

 (c) Failing resolution pursuant to Section 2.15(b) within 30 days after receipt of the written notice of objection from the Sellers Representative, then either Calavo or the Sellers Representative may submit any unresolved disputed items with respect to the amount of EBITDA, Revenues or the Earn-Out Payment payable for the Earn-Out Period for binding resolution to the Independent Accounting Firm. Calavo and the Sellers Representative shall direct the Independent Accounting Firm to, within 30 days following such submission, resolve the unresolved objections and such resolution shall be final and binding on all Parties hereto. 

   

 (d) Each of Calavo and the Sellers Representative shall submit to the Independent Accounting Firm (with a copy delivered to the other on the same day), within 10 days after the date of the engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm, a memorandum (which may include supporting exhibits) setting forth their respective positions on the unresolved objections. Each of Calavo and the Sellers Representative may (but shall not be required to) submit to the Independent Accounting Firm (with a copy delivered to the other on the same day), within 20 days after the date of the engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm, a memorandum responding to the initial memorandum submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm by the other Party. Unless requested by the Independent Accounting Firm in writing, no Party hereto may present any additional information or arguments to the Independent Accounting Firm, either orally or in writing. 

   

 (e) Within 30 days after the date of its engagement hereunder, the Independent Accounting Firm shall issue a written ruling which shall include a revised Earn-Out Statement as adjusted (i) pursuant to any resolutions to objections agreed upon by Calavo and the Sellers Representative and (ii) pursuant to the Independent Accounting Firms resolution of the unresolved objections. The Independent Accounting Firm shall review only those matters specified in the unresolved objections and shall make no changes to the Earn-Out Statement, except as are required to resolve the unresolved objections. The Earn-Out Statement provided by the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 2.15 shall be deemed to be the final Earn-Out Statement and it shall be final and binding on all Parties hereto. The Parties agree that the procedure set forth in this Section 2.15 for resolving disputes with respect to the Earn-Out Statement shall be the sole and exclusive method for resolving any such disputes. The Independent Accounting Firms determination may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction, but the substance of the Independent Accounting Firms determination shall not be subject to review in any such proceeding. 

       ##### 

  

     

 (f) Calavo, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, shall each be responsible for one-half of the fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm. 

   

 (g) After the Closing, upon reasonable written notice, Purchaser shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Sellers Representative access, during normal business hours, to the Books and Records of Surviving RFG for any reasonable business purpose. The Sellers Representative acknowledges that receipt of (i) the Earn-Out Statements, together with any supporting documentation, and any information which may be gained as a result of the access contemplated by such Section 2.15, to the extent not already disclosed to the public, may constitute receipt of confidential and/or material, non-public information (the " _Earn-Out Statement Confidential Information_ ") concerning Purchaser. In addition, the Sellers Representative acknowledges that he and the other Sellers are prohibited from (i) purchasing or selling Securities of Calavo until 48 hours after such Earn-Out Statement Confidential Information (or financial information of the Purchaser covering the relevant time period to which the Earn-Out Statement Confidential Information relates) is disclosed to the public and (ii) communicating such Earn-Out Statement Confidential Information to any other Person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such Person will purchase or sell Securities of Calavo until such Earn-Out Statement Confidential Information (or financial information of Calavo covering the relevant time period to which the Earn-Out Statement Confidential Information relates) is disclosed to the public. In addition, the Sellers Representative shall cause any Person (including any of the Sellers Representatives officers, employees, directors, managers, advisors, agents, attorneys, accountants or Representatives) receiving access to Earn-Out Statement Confidential Information on behalf of the Sellers Representative to keep such Earn-Out Statement Confidential Information confidential and not disclose any such Earn-Out Statement Confidential Information to others. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Sellers Representative shall be entitled to disclose Earn-Out Statement Confidential Information (i) if requested or required by law, regulation or legal or regulatory process (in which case, prior to such disclosure the Sellers Representative will give the Purchaser prior written notice and an opportunity to obtain, at the Purchasers sole cost and expense, a protective order or other appropriate remedy against such disclosure; in the event such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, the Sellers Representative will use commercially reasonable efforts to disclose only that portion of the Earn-Out Statement Confidential Information which is legally required to be disclosed and to ensure that all Earn-Out Statement Confidential Information that is so disclosed will be accorded confidential treatment, in each case at the Purchasers sole cost and expense) and (ii) to the extent necessary to enforce its rights under this Agreement. 

   

 2.16 _Payment of Earn-Out Payments_.

   ##### 

  

  

 (ii) Calavo shall cause its transfer agent to issue a stock certificate in the name of the Trust to the Trust to evidence the Merger Shares portion of the Earn-Out Payment, if any. 

  

 (b) Late payments by Calavo shall accrue interest (with any Merger Shares being valued at the Merger Shares Value) at a rate of ten percent (10%) per annum or the maximum permissible statutory rate if it is less. 

   

 2.17 _Operation of Surviving RFG During the Earn-Out Period_. 

  

 (a) Except (x) as set forth on _Schedule 2.17_ of the Sellers Disclosure Letter (the " _Capital Expenditure Plan_ ") and (y) as both members of the Board of Managers may otherwise agree in writing, from the Closing Date through and including the last day of the Earn-Out Period, the Business of Surviving RFG shall be operated in accordance with this Agreement and the Operating Agreement and in the ordinary course consistent with the operation of the Business of the RFG Family Entities prior to the Closing Date. During the Earn-Out Period, except as both members of the Board of Managers may otherwise agree in writing, Calavo shall not, and shall not cause Surviving RFG to, and Surviving RFG shall not: 

   

 (i) sell, assign, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of any material assets or properties of Surviving RFG, except for sales of inventory in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and for distributions of cash to Calavo, subject to Section 2.17(b) (below); 

  

 (ii) sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of Surviving RFG or the Securities of Surviving RFG, including by stock sale, merger, consolidation, stock exchange, sale of assets or similar transaction; provided, however, that the preceding covenant shall not be construed as prohibiting Calavo from merging or consolidating with another corporation or business entity, which shall be in compliance with Section 2.18(c) below; 

  

 (iii) change the type or nature of Surviving RFGs business from the Business conducted by the RFG Family Entities immediately prior to the Effective Time; 

  

 (iv) transfer any portion of Calavos business to Surviving RFG; 

  

 (v) [* * *]; 

  

 (vi) [* * *]; 

  

 (vii) [* * *]; 

  

 (viii) allocate to Surviving RFG corporate overhead charges relating to the operation of its business in excess of the adjusted overhead costs of the Business as of the date of this Agreement, except as necessary to bring Surviving RFG into compliance with Calavos policies and procedures as set forth in Section 2.19, or as may be required by Law, which additional compliance costs in no event shall exceed $[* * *] in the aggregate on an annual basis as set forth in Section 2.19; or

 (ix) except as set forth in the applicable Employment Agreement, terminate other than for Cause (as defined in the applicable Employment Agreement) the employment of any of the Earn-Out Key Employees with Surviving RFG. 

  

 (b) Calavo agrees that, during the Earn-Out Period, it shall provide to Surviving RFG (i) funds for Capital Expenditures as set forth in the Capital Expenditure Plan and (ii) Working Capital, in an aggregate amount up to $3,000,000, if and to the extent reasonably necessary to operate Surviving RFG in a manner that is consistent with the manner in which the Business of the RFG Family Entities has been conducted prior to the date of this Agreement. In addition, if Surviving RFG pays one or more cash dividends to Calavo during the Earn-Out Period, which when aggregated with all other cash dividends during the Earn-Out Period up to the date of measurement in the aggregate exceed forty percent (40%) of the taxable income earned by Surviving RFG during the Earn-Out Period up to the date of measurement, the maximum Working Capital of $3,000,000 as set forth above shall be increased by an amount equal to the excess cash dividends over the 40% of cumulative taxable income as provided above. For example, if RFG has generated an aggregate of $5,000,000 in taxable income and Calavo has taken cash dividends of $5,000,000, the maximum Working Capital shall be increased from $3,000,000 to $6,000,000 ($3,000,000 + (60%)($5,000,000)). In no event shall any cumulative cash dividend exceed taxable income of Surviving RFG for the period from the Closing until the end of the Earn-Out Period. Calavo shall not charge Surviving RFG any interest expense related to the funds provided pursuant to this paragraph, and Calavo retains sole discretion to provide Surviving RFG with funds that are in excess of the required funds described in this paragraph. So long as Calavo complies with the covenants that are set forth in the three immediately preceding sentences, Calavo shall be permitted to cause Surviving RFG to distribute cash dividends to Calavo from Surviving RFGs taxable income, in such amount and at such times determined by Calavo, with or without the consent of the Board of Managers. " _Working Capital_ " means funds for the purpose of everyday operations of Surviving RFG. Working Capital shall not be used for purposes of Capital Expenditures or other long term assets or investments. 

   

 (c) Surviving RFG shall be attributed any Revenues (and associated EBITDA) generated from [* * *]. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event that Calavo becomes the landlord to Surviving RFG or any of its Subsidiaries during the Earn-Out Period, Calavo shall be entitled to charge Surviving RFG or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, rent at the rate set forth in the Real Property Lease for purposes of calculating EBITDA; provided however that Calavo may not increase the amount of such rent during the Earn-Out Period without the consent of the Board of Managers. 

   

 2.18 _Calavo s Additional Earn-Out Period Covenants_. During the Earn-Out Period, Calavo shall: 

  

 (a) maintain Surviving RFG as a separate legal entity and conduct the business of Surviving RFG exclusively through Surviving RFG, and ensure that there is no commingling of the amounts attributable to the business of Surviving RFG with that of Calavo or any of its other Affiliates or Subsidiaries;

 (c) require any successor to Calavo (whether by merger, sale of substantially all of Calavo assets, or otherwise) to assume and agree, in writing, to perform this Agreement, in the same manner and to the same extent that Calavo would have been required to perform if no such succession had taken place; 

   

 (d) subject to the requirements of this Section 2.18(d), so long as their applicable Employment Agreements remain in effect, provide the Earn-Out Key Employees with management authority for the day-to-day operations of Surviving RFG (including authority to implement the equipment and plant upgrades described in the Capital Expenditure Plan) and the authority to enter into Contracts and agreements, and modifications thereto, with suppliers, distributors, customers and vendors in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices; provided, however, that [* * *].

 2.19 _Operation of Surviving RFG Consistent with Calavo s Policies and Procedures_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at all times during and after the Earn-Out Period, the business of Surviving RFG (at Surviving RFGs expense, except as where otherwise noted below), shall be operated consistently with and in compliance with all of Calavos applicable policies and procedures and in accordance with applicable Law, including, without limitation:

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the expenses incurred by Surviving RFG in connection with complying with subsections (a)(i) and (a)(ii) in excess of $[* * *] per year shall be excluded from calculations of EBITDA, and (ii) no expenses of Calavo or Calavos other Subsidiaries, other than as specifically relates to Surviving RFG and as incurred by Surviving RFG, with respect to the items set forth in this Section 2.19 shall be allocated to Surviving RFG for purposes of calculating EBITDA.

 (vii) if one or more of the Sellers cause Surviving RFG or any of its Subsidiaries to be operated in a manner that breaches any of the covenants described above in Sections 2.17, 2.18, or 2.19, then such covenant shall not be deemed to have been breached by Calavo for purposes of this Agreement and neither Calavo nor Surviving RFG shall have any liability to the Sellers by reason of, or arising out of, the breach of such covenant. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement: 

   

 (i) For purposes of this Section, Calavo shall be entitled, through its officers, employees and Representatives (including any third party inspectors retained at Calavos sole expense), to reasonable access during normal business hours (or off hours, if agreed to by Calavo and Surviving RFG) to the Leased Real Property: (i) at any time within the 6 months after the Closing, for purposes of inspecting the Leased Real Property to identify any reasonable remedial actions that may be required within 5 years after the Closing Date (the " _Baseline Inspection_ ") for Surviving RFG to be in compliance with the below requirements prior to the 5 year anniversary of the Closing Date (and the time frame, if applicable, for Surviving RFG to undertake such remedial actions); and (ii) at any time within the 2-month period prior to the end of the Earn-Out Period (or what is reasonably expected to be the end of the Earn-Out Period if prior to the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date), but in no event later than two (2) weeks prior to the end of the Earn-Out Period, for purposes of inspecting the Leased Real Property to evaluate Surviving RFGs compliance with the foregoing requirements (the " _Compliance Inspection_ "). In exercising its rights hereunder, Calavo shall conduct itself so as not to materially and adversely interfere in the conduct of the business of Surviving RFG. 

  

 (ii) Pursuant to the completion of the Baseline Inspection, Calavo shall provide to Surviving RFG, at Calavos sole expense and no later than 60 days after the completion of the Baseline Inspection, a written report (the " _Inspection Report_ ") detailing: (a) maintenance schedules of such reasonable remedial actions that shall be required to be completed within 5 years after the Closing Date; and (b) a list of any equipment or facilities that shall require maintenance, repair, or replacement prior to the end of the Earn-Out Period.

 (iii) As of the last day of the Earn-Out Period, at the sole cost and expense of Surviving RFG (including for purposes of calculating EBITDA), (a) all material building systems located in the Leased Real Property, shall be in good operating condition and 

   ##### 

  

 

repair, ordinary wear and tear, as described below, excepted; (b) the Leased
Real Property shall be in compliance with all applicable Laws, except to the
extent such noncompliance does not materially affect the use of the property

have not, individually or in the aggregate had or would be reasonably
expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect; and (c) the Leased Real Property
shall be free of all Hazardous Materials, except for inventories of such
substances to be used, and wastes generated therefrom, in the ordinary course
of business of Surviving RFG (which inventories and wastes, if any, have
been and are stored or disposed of in accordance with applicable

expected end of the Earn-Out Period if prior to the fifth anniversary of the

 2.21 _Early Termination of Covenants_. 

  

 (a) The covenants set forth in [* * *] shall be suspended at Calavos option, if, and for so long as, for any twelve calendar month period ending during the Control Period, Covenant EBITDA is less than $[* * *] (the " _Benchmark_ "); provided, however, that the covenants set forth in [* * *] shall be reinstated for any period during the Control Period that the Benchmark is met and Calavo shall act in good faith during the time of any such suspension. To the extent that Surviving RFG makes Capital Expenditures that are in excess of the Capital Expenditures set forth in the Capital Expenditure Plan during or after the time of any such suspension, the Earn-Out Payments, if any, shall be reduced by the amount of such excess. 

   

 (b) The " _Covenant EBITDA_ " shall mean the EBITDA for the twelve-month period shown on the Earn-Out Statement for the applicable month, subject to the following adjustment (the " _Force Majeure Adjustment_ "): At any time prior to the 15th day after receipt of an Earn-Out Statement that may have been affected by an Force Majeure Event, the Sellers Representative may request that Calavo revise the Covenant EBITDA based on such Force Majeure Event (" _Adjustment Request_ ") by sending written notice to Calavo that a Force Majeure Event has occurred and the nature of the Force Majeure Event. Calavo and the Sellers Representative will attempt in good faith for a period of 30 days after the Adjustment Request to determine the EBITDA for such period as if the Force Majeure Event identified in the Adjustment Request had not occurred. If Calavo and Sellers Representative cannot mutually agree upon an adjusted EBITDA number for such period, the matter shall be submitted to an Independent Accounting Firm as set forth in Section 2.15. Force Majeure Adjustments pursuant to the above shall be made for the twelve-month period ending with the month for which the 

      ##### 

  

    

Sellers Representative made the Adjustment Request and the twelve-month
periods ending on the last day of the five months following such month (six
months in total). 

   

 (c) The Employment Agreements for Mr. K. Catchot, Mr. J. Catchot and Mr. Gibson shall provide for reduction in the compensation levels of Mr. K. Catchot, Mr. J. Catchot and Mr. Gibson for the purpose of achieving the Benchmark. The Employment Agreements for Mr. K. Catchot, Mr. J. Catchot and Mr. Gibson shall provide for similar reduction in the event the Covenant EBITDA for the twelve-month period ending any time during the period starting with the first full calendar month after the Closing and continuing until the beginning of the Control Period is less than $[* * *]; provided, however, that if for the twelve-month period ending on the last day of the twelfth calendar month after the Closing, the Revenues generated by any of the Top 5 Customers is less than 50% of the Revenues generated during the twelve months prior to Closing, such loss in Revenues from the Top 5 Customer which had the greatest reduction in Revenues shall be treated as a Force Majeure Event. 

   

 (d) In addition, the Employment Agreement for Mr. J. Catchot shall provide that his compensation may be reduced by up to $55,000 per annum at any time, if such reduction is requested in a written notice to Surviving RFG from Sellers Representative. 

   

 2.22 _Withholding_. Calavo shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to the Securityholders such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold and pay to applicable taxing authorities with respect to such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld from the Securityholders, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Securityholders. The Sellers shall be responsible for paying any and all Taxes that are incurred as a result of the payment of the Merger Consideration to them. 

  

 2.23 _Lock-Up_. In addition to any restrictions imposed by the Securities Act or Section 2.10, (a) with respect to the Initial Merger Shares, during the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the six month anniversary of the Closing Date, and (b) with respect to the Stage 2 Merger Shares and Stage 3 Merger Shares, during the period beginning with the date of issuance and ending on the six month anniversary of such issuance (each, a " _Lock-Up Period_ "), each Seller agrees that he or it will not sell, assign, pledge or otherwise transfer any of the Merger Shares, and will not agree to take any of the preceding actions, without Calavos prior written consent. In addition, each Seller agrees that, during the Lock-Up Period, he or it will not engage in (i) any short sale of shares Common Stock, (ii) any hedging transaction regarding shares of Common Stock, or (iii) any grant of a put or call option regarding shares of Common Stock. The obligations set forth in this Section also apply (i) to all shares of Common Stock that the Sellers may receive as a stock dividend or other distribution on the Merger Shares and (ii) to all other Securities of Calavo that the Sellers may receive in a recapitalization or similar transaction in exchange for the Merger Shares. The agreements set forth in this Section are irrevocable and binding upon the successors, personal representative, heirs and assigns of each Seller. To ensure compliance with the provisions of this Section 2.23, (x) the certificates evidencing the Merger Shares shall bear the legends described in Section 4.7 and (y) Calavo shall be entitled to place stop transfer orders with its transfer agent that are consistent with the terms of this Section 2.23. 

   ##### 

  

  

 2.24 _Payments by Trust._ Distributions from the Trust shall be made in such proportions as set forth in Exhibit A, except for reductions resulting from the obligations of the Sellers as set forth in this Agreement or as otherwise agreed to by the Sellers in accordance with the Organizational Documents of the Trust. No consideration shall be distributed by the Trust except in compliance with this Agreement, or as may otherwise be agreed by and amongst the Sellers.

The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, each other document or instrument executed pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and of the transactions contemplated hereby, does not and will not: (a) violate, conflict with or result in a breach of any provision of the Organizational Documents of the Securityholder, if a Securityholder Entity; (b) conflict with or violate any Law or Governmental Order applicable to the Seller or any of its respective assets, properties or businesses is bound or affected; (c) conflict with, result in any breach of, constitute a default (or event which with the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both, would become a default) under, require any consent under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration, suspension, increase in payment, revocation, or cancellation of any provision under the terms of any Contract to which the Seller

 4.5 _Investment Intent._ The Merger Shares that are allocable to the Seller are being acquired for the Sellers own account and not with a view to the public distribution of any of the Merger Shares. The Seller will not sell, pledge or otherwise transfer any of the Merger Shares except in accordance with this Agreement and applicable federal and state securities Laws. 

  

 4.6 _Restricted Securities_. The Seller understands that the offering and sale of the Merger Shares in the Merger is intended to be exempt from registration under the Securities Act by virtue of Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D under the Securities Act. The Seller understands that the Merger Shares are and will remain "restricted securities" under the federal securities laws because they will be acquired from Calavo in a transaction not involving a public offering. The Seller understands the resale limitations imposed by the Securities Act and is familiar with Rule 144 under the Securities Act and the conditions which must be met in order for Rule 144 to be available for the public resale of "restricted securities." The Seller understands that: (i) the Merger Shares have not been registered or qualified under the Securities Act or the securities laws of California, Delaware or any other state, and neither the SEC nor any state or other regulatory authority has made any recommendation or finding concerning the value of the Merger Shares; (ii) there is no assurance that the Seller will be able to sell the Merger Shares at a purchase price that the Seller deems reasonable; (iii) the Merger Shares may be offered, sold or otherwise transferred by the Seller only if the transaction is registered and qualified under the applicable provisions of federal and state securities laws or if exemptions from such registration and qualification are available; (iv) the satisfaction of these securities registration exemptions is the Sellers responsibility; and (v) Calavo is under no obligation to assist the Seller in satisfying these exemptions, and Calavo does not intend to register any subsequent transaction by the Seller under applicable federal and state securities laws. 

  

 4.7 _Legend._ The Seller understands that legends to the following effect will be placed on the certificates evidencing the Merger Shares: 

   

"The shares that are represented by this certificate have not been registered
or qualified under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), or
applicable state securities laws. The shares may not be sold, offered for
sale, assigned, pledged or otherwise transferred unless such transfer is
registered or qualified under the Act and applicable state securities laws
covering such shares or unless the corporation receives an opinion of counsel
or other evidence satisfactory to the corporation to the effect that such
registration and qualification are not required. 

   ##### 

  

   

The shares that are represented by this certificate are subject
to restrictions on transfer that are described in an Agreement and Plan
of Merger dated _____, 2011 among the holder of this certificate,
Calavo Growers, Inc. and certain other parties."

In evaluating the suitability of an investment in Calavo, the Seller has not relied upon any representation or other information (whether oral or written) from Calavo or any of its agents that is inconsistent with the information contained in the documents described in the immediately preceding sentence. No oral or written representations or recommendations have been made, and no oral or written information has been furnished, to the Seller regarding the advisability of acquiring the Merger Shares. Calavo has provided the Seller (including his or her professional advisors, if any) with a sufficient opportunity to ask questions and receive answers concerning the terms and conditions of the issuance of the Merger Shares and to obtain any additional information which Calavo possesses or can acquire without unreasonable effort or expense that is necessary to verify the accuracy of the information that is contained in the documents described in the first sentence of this paragraph.

 4.11 _Accredited Investor_. Each Seller, except for Donald Johnson, is an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act and each Seller has delivered to Calavo on the date hereof a fully completed and duly executed Investor Questionnaire in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_. 

  

 4.12 _No Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the Seller.

RFG Family Entity, any Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, in this Agreement
and shall not be deemed to amend or supplement the Sellers Disclosure Letter
or the Purchasers Disclosure Letter, as applicable. 

   

 6.9 _Seller Transfers_. Each Seller agrees that until the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article 11, he or it shall not sell, pledge or otherwise transfer any of his or her Securities of RFG (or with respect to Mr. K. Catchot, Mr. J. Catchot and Mr. Gibson, his Securities of Liberty Fresh Foods, LLC) without the prior written consent of Purchaser. 

  

 6.10 _Employment of Earn-Out Key Employees_. Newco agrees to enter into and to deliver at or prior to the Closing to Mr. J. Catchot, an employment agreement substantially in the form set forth in _Exhibit F-1_, Mr. K. Catchot, an employment agreement substantially in the form set forth in _Exhibit F-2_, and to Mr. Gibson, an employment agreement substantially in the form set forth in _Exhibit F-3_ (each, an " _Employment Agreement_ "). Each Seller that is an Earn-Out Key Employee hereby agrees to enter into and to deliver at or prior to the Closing to Newco an Employment Agreement, as applicable. Each of Mr. J. Catchot, Mr. K. Catchot, Mr. Gibson, Mr. Castillo and Mr. Johnson agree to comply with all of the terms of (1) Calavos Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that Calavo posts on its website or files with the Securities and Exchange Commission and (2) Calavos Employment Handbook that Calavo distributes generally to its employees, including employees of Calavos subsidiaries. 

  

 6.11 _Release_. Effective at the Closing, each Seller releases and discharges each of the RFG Family Entities and their subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees, equity holders, agents, attorneys and predecessors and successors in interest, heirs, executors and assigns, from any and all claims for relief, including all causes of actions, suits, petitions or demands in law or equity, direct, derivative, or otherwise, and any and all allegations of liability, including any allegation of debts, obligations, promises, guarantees, damage awards, or for any equitable, legal and administrative relief that have been, could have been, or may be asserted in any court action, whether federal or state, or otherwise, or before any administrative body, tribunal, arbitrator or arbitration panel, regardless of whether known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, or fixed or contingent at the time of the Closing, that any Seller may have against any of the RFG Family Entities. The release contained herein is intended to be complete and final and to cover not only claims, demands, liabilities, damages, actions and causes of action which are known, but also claims, demands, liabilities, damages, actions and causes of action which are unknown or which the Seller does not suspect to exist in its favor which, if known at the time of executing this Agreement, might have affected its actions, and therefore the Seller expressly waives the benefit of the provisions of Section 1542 of the California Civil Code, which provides: 

   

"A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR." 

    ##### 

 

  

Each Seller hereby waives and relinquishes all rights and benefits that he or
it has or may have had under Section 1542 of the California Civil Code or the
law of any other state, country, or jurisdiction to the same or similar
effect to the full extent that he may lawfully waive such rights. 

   

 6.12 _Quitclaim_. Effective at the Closing, each Seller assigns to RFG, without additional compensation, all right, title and interest in all creations, including without limitation all ideas, processes, inventions, technology, writings, software programs, designs, formulas, discoveries, patents, copyrights, or trademarks, or any claims or rights, (and any related improvements or modifications to the foregoing), whether or not subject to patent or copyright protection (collectively, " _Creations_ "), relating to the Business that have been or will be conceived or developed by the Seller alone or with others, whether or not conceived before, on or after the date hereof. Such Creations shall be the sole property of RFG and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, shall be deemed works made for hire. To the extent that any such work is deemed not to be a "work made for hire" or that other Intellectual Property rights are embodied therein, each of the Sellers hereby assigns, and agrees to assign, to RFG all right, title and interest in and to any such work and all related Intellectual Property rights, as well as to all other Intellectual Property contributed to or conceived or made by such Seller at any time during his or its employment or engagement with the RFG Family Entities (in each case, whether alone or jointly with others). Each Seller shall execute such written instruments and do other such acts as may be necessary in the opinion of Purchaser to obtain a patent, register a copyright, or otherwise enforce RFGs rights in such Creations (and such Seller hereby irrevocably appoints RFG and any of its officers as his or its attorney in fact to undertake such acts in his or its name). 

  

 6.13 _Amendments of Schedules_. RFG may deliver (by written notice to Purchaser) supplements to the disclosure schedules to this Agreement with respect to any actions, events, conditions, circumstances or matters arising or occurring after the execution and delivery of this Agreement which, if existing, occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in the Sellers Disclosure Letter; _provided_ that such supplement may only amend the Sellers Disclosure Letter to reflect actions, events, conditions, circumstances or matters that are not the result of a breach of any covenant set forth in this Agreement. The supplement shall list each updated, supplemented or amended item by an appropriate reference to the applicable Section of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, unless Purchaser provides RFG with a written termination notice pursuant to Section 11.1(b) prior to the Closing, the disclosure schedules shall be deemed for purposes of Article 10 hereof to include and reflect such supplement made in accordance with this Section 6.13 prior to the Closing Date, but solely with respect to those actions, events, conditions, circumstances or matters disclosed thereon that occurred after the date of this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no such supplemented disclosure schedule shall cure, or be deemed to cure, any breach of this Agreement that existed as of the date of this Agreement. 

  

 6.14 _Closing Statement_. RFG shall prepare and deliver the Closing Statement as set forth in Section 2.11. 

  

 6.15 _Public Announcements_. Prior to the Closing Date, no Party shall issue any press release or public announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without prior consultation with and written approval of the other Parties hereto, which approval will not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed, unless disclosure is 

   ##### 

  

 

otherwise required by applicable Law (including applicable federal securities
Laws) or by the applicable rules of any stock exchange, provided that, to the
extent required by applicable Law or by the applicable rules of any stock
exchange, the Party intending to make such release shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts consistent with such applicable Law or the rules of any
stock exchange to consult with the other Party with respect to the text
thereof and to consider in good faith any proposed modifications thereto.

Article 8 
  _POST CLOSING TAXES_  

   

 8.1 _Returns and Payments_. 

  

 (a) Purchaser shall prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed) all Tax Returns with respect to the RFG Family Entities due after the Closing Date (including any valid extensions of time). Tax Returns of the RFG Family Entities due after the Closing Date that relate to any period beginning before the Closing Date (such Tax Returns, the " _Straddle Return_ ") shall be prepared in a manner reasonably consistent with past practices employed with respect to the RFG Family Entities, except where a contrary manner is required by Law. Purchaser shall provide the Sellers Representative with a copy of each completed Straddle Return (or, in the case of Tax Returns filed for an affiliated group, the portion of such consolidated Tax Return solely relating to the RFG Family Entities), together with appropriate supporting information and schedules at least fifteen days prior to the due date (including any extensions thereof) for the filing of such Straddle Return, and the Sellers Representative shall have the right to review and comment on such Straddle Return prior to the filing of such Straddle Return and Purchaser shall accept all reasonable comments provided by the Sellers Representative; provided, however, that for any Straddle Return required to be filed within ninety days of the Closing Date (taking into account any available extensions), Purchaser shall instead use commercially reasonable efforts to afford the Sellers Representative a reasonable opportunity (but in no event less than ten business days) to review and approve such Straddle Return prior to filing. The failure of the Sellers Representative to propose any changes to any such Straddle Return within fifteen days following the receipt thereof shall be deemed to 

    ##### 

  

 

constitute its approval thereof. Purchaser shall file or cause to be filed all
such Tax Returns and shall pay the Taxes shown due thereon; provided,
however, that nothing contained in the foregoing shall in any manner
terminate, limit or adversely affect any right of Purchaser to receive
indemnification pursuant to any provision in this Agreement. 

   

 (b) Purchaser and the Sellers Representative agree that the Transaction Tax Benefit items, to the extent permitted by Law, shall be included as deductions of the RFG Family Entities in all Tax Returns for the Stub Period with respect to income taxes (" _Stub Period Income Tax Returns_ ") and further agree that the "next day rule" of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) has no application with respect to such Transaction Tax Benefit items. For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Stub Period_ " shall be any taxable year of the RFG Family Entities that ends on the Closing Date for U.S. federal income tax purposes or for purposes of any other taxing jurisdiction. The RFG Family Entities will prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed, and cause their Affiliates to prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the provisions of this Section 8.1. 

   

 8.2 _Cooperation with Respect to Tax Returns_. Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, and each at their own cost and expense, as promptly as practicable, such information (including access to books and records) and assistance, including making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanations of any material provided, relating to the RFG Family Entities as is reasonably necessary for the filing of any Tax Return, for the preparation for any audit and for the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any adjustment or proposed adjustment with respect to Taxes. Purchaser shall retain in its possession, and shall provide the Sellers Representative reasonable access to (including the right to make copies of), such supporting books and records and any other materials that the Sellers Representative may specify with respect to Tax matters relating to any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date for a period of seven years after the Closing. After such time, Purchaser may dispose of such material. 

  

 8.3 _Tax Audits_. Purchaser shall have the sole right to represent the interests of the RFG Family Entities in all Tax audits or administrative or court proceedings related to Taxes; provided, however, that with respect to audits or proceedings regarding any item, the adjustment of which may cause the Sellers to become obligated to make any payment pursuant to Article 10, Purchaser shall consult with the Sellers Representative, and not settle any such item, without the consent of the Sellers Representative (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) (any such audits or proceedings, a " _Relevant Proceeding_ "); provided further that Purchaser shall not be required to seek the Sellers Representatives consent with respect to audits or proceedings that could reasonably be expected to result in payments by the Sellers of less than $10,000. Where consent to settlement is withheld by the Sellers Representative pursuant to this Section 8.3, any Liability of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (including Surviving RFG) for Taxes, after giving effect to this Agreement, shall not exceed the Liability for Taxes that would have resulted had the Sellers Representative not withheld its consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 8.3, the Sellers Representative may represent the interests of the RFG Family Entities in any Relevant Proceeding at its own 

   ##### 

  

 

expense insofar as the items at issue relate solely to taxable periods of the
RFG Family Entities ending on or prior to the Closing. 

   

 8.4 _Allocation of the Purchase Price; Form 8594_. 

  

 (a) As promptly as practicable after the Closing, Calavo shall allocate the Merger Consideration in accordance with Code Sections 1060 among the assets of the RFG Family Entities, and Calavo shall advise the Sellers Representative of the allocation. 

   

 (b) Calavo shall prepare and file an Internal Revenue Service Form 8594, Asset Acquisition Statement Under Section 1060 (" _Form 8594_"), that is consistent with the allocation of the Merger Consideration described in this Section 8.4. Upon the request of Calavo, the Sellers Representative shall execute the Form 8594 and deliver it to Calavo within ten days after a request for the executed Form 8594 is made by Calavo. If required by applicable law, Calavo shall also prepare and file amendments to Form 8594 after the exact amount of the Earn-Out Payments has been determined and, within ten days after receiving Calavos request, the Sellers Representative shall execute and deliver to Calavo each such amended Form 8594. 

   

 (c) So long as Purchaser complies with the Code with respect to such allocations, Calavo and the Sellers agree to be bound by Calavos allocation of the Purchase Price described in this Section 8.4 in the preparation, filing, and audit of all tax returns, and each party agrees that (if required by applicable law) it shall file the Form 8594 with its tax return for the taxable year that includes the Closing Date and, if required by applicable law, each Party shall file an amended Form 8594 consistent with the allocation principles described in this Section 8.4 with respect to the allocation of the Earn-Out Payments after the exact amount of the Earn-Out Payments has been determined. 

   

Article 9 
  _CONFIDENTIALITY AND NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENTS_  

   

 9.1 _Confidentiality_. 

  

 (a) Purchaser, RFG, and each Seller and each of their respective Affiliates and Representatives shall treat all nonpublic information obtained in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby as confidential in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are hereby incorporated by reference and shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing, at which time such Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

    ##### 

  

 

(including the Sellers Representative) to hold in confidence any and all non-
public information, whether written or oral, concerning the Business,
Surviving RFG or Purchaser. 

   

 (d) This Section 9.1 shall not apply to the extent any confidential information subject hereto (x) is or becomes public after the Closing other than through the fault of the Person who received such information (the " _Receiving Party_ "), (y) is received after the Closing from a third party that is lawfully in possession of the same and did not obtain it from the Person whose confidential information is being disclosed (the " _Disclosing Party_ "), or (z) is independently developed after the Closing by the Receiving Party without using the disclosed information. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Receiving Party shall be entitled to disclose any information disclosed in connection with this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement (i) if requested or required by Law, regulation or legal or regulatory process (in which case, prior to such disclosure, the Receiving Party will give the Disclosing Party prior written notice and an opportunity to obtain, at such Partys sole cost and expense, a protective order or other appropriate remedy against such disclosure; in the event such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, the Receiving Party will use commercially reasonable efforts to disclose only that portion of the confidential information which is legally required to be disclosed and to ensure that all confidential information that is so disclosed will be accorded confidential treatment, in each case at the Disclosing Partys sole cost and expense) and (ii) to the extent necessary to enforce its rights under this Agreement. 

   

 9.2 _Noncompetition Covenant_. To provide Calavo the full value of its acquisition of RFG, and as a material inducement to Calavo to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, each Seller, except Cut Fruit, LLC, agrees to refrain from competing with Purchaser, Surviving RFG or any of its Subsidiaries to the extent provided in this Article 9\. Without the prior written consent of Calavo, no Seller (other than Cut Fruit, LLC) shall, at any time during the period described in Section 9.3, directly or indirectly (whether as owner, investor, lender, principal, agent, partner, officer, director, employee, independent contractor, consultant, shareholder or otherwise), and whether or not for compensation, engage in (or have any interest in) any business, corporation, person, partnership or other entity that competes with any business that is engaged in by Purchaser, Surviving RFG or any of its Subsidiaries (i) in any county, city or other geographic area in the United States (including, without limitation, each county in the State of California and Texas) or foreign country in which Purchaser, Surviving RFG or any of its Subsidiaries has conducted its Business prior to the date of this Agreement, so long as Purchaser, Surviving RFG or any of its Subsidiaries carry on such Business or a similar business in such place or places, or (ii) in any other domestic or foreign geographic area in which Purchaser, Surviving RFG or any of its Subsidiaries subsequently conducts its business, so long as Purchaser, Surviving RFG or any of its Subsidiaries carry on such business in such place or places. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Seller subject to this Section 9.2 shall not engage in any business (or have an interest in) Cut Fruit, LLC in such a manner that would conflict with the obligations set forth in the previous sentence. The provisions of this Section 9.2 shall not be construed as prohibiting any Seller from (a) acquiring and owning up to 1% of the outstanding Securities of any corporation that is a publicly traded corporation or (b) continuing to provide services for those entities set forth on _Schedule 9.2_ of the Sellers Disclosure Letter, so long as such entities continue to operate materially the same 

   ##### 

  

 

line of business and so long as such entities do not compete with the business
conducted by Purchaser, Surviving RFG or any of its Subsidiaries. 

   

 9.3 _Duration_. 

  

 (a) With respect to Liberty Fresh Foods, LLC and each of the Earn-Out Key Employees, the noncompetition covenant of Section 9.2 shall be effective for a period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the fifth annual anniversary of the last day of the Earn-Out Period. With respect to each of Jose O. Castillo and Donald L. Johnson, the noncompetition covenant in Section 9.2 shall be effective for a period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the later to occur of (a) the date his employment with Purchaser (including its Subsidiaries) terminates, and (b) the first annual anniversary of the last day of the Earn-Out Period. 

   

 (b) The preceding provisions of this Section 9.3 shall not diminish or otherwise affect any of the noncompetition or unfair solicitation covenants or other covenants that a Seller or any other person or entity has given pursuant to an Employment Agreement or any other agreement with Calavo or Purchaser. 

   

 9.4 _Scope and Reasonableness_. Calavo and the Sellers agree that it is not their intention to violate any public policy or statutory or common law. The Parties intend that the noncompetition covenants contained in Sections 9.2 and 9.3 shall be construed as a series of separate covenants by each Seller, one for each area included in the geographical scope described in Section 9.2 and for each year (or portion thereof) described in Section 9.3. Except for geographical coverage and duration, each such covenant of each Seller shall contain all of the terms of the covenants of this Article 9\. If any court of competent jurisdiction refuses to enforce any covenant contained in this Article 9, then such unenforceable covenant shall be deemed to have been deleted from this Agreement to the extent necessary to permit the remaining separate covenants to be enforceable. Each Seller has considered the nature and extent of the restrictions upon competition set forth in this Article 9 and agrees that they are reasonable with respect to duration and geographical scope and in all other respects. 

  

 9.5 _Injunctive Relief_. Any Party having any rights under any provision of this Article 9 shall be entitled to recover damages by reason of any breach of such provision and to exercise all other rights and remedies granted by Law, which rights may be exercised cumulatively. The Parties recognize and agree that the violation of the provisions of this Article 9 or of any other provision of this Agreement cannot be reasonably or adequately compensated in damages and that, in addition to any other relief to which any Party may be entitled by reason of such violation, it shall also be entitled to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive and equitable relief. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Seller specifically agrees that a showing by Calavo of any breach of any provision of this Article 9 shall constitute, for the purposes of all determinations of the issue of injunctive relief, conclusive proof of all of the elements necessary to entitle Calavo to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against such Seller. 

  

 9.6 _Venue_. For purposes of injunctive relief, each Seller agrees to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction or jurisdictions where it is alleged that 

   ##### 

  

 

Purchaser is at the time being damaged by an alleged breach or violation of
the provisions of this Article 9.

Except as described in this Section 10.1, all representations and warranties of the Parties that are contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Closing for a period of 24 months. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) representations and warranties relating to Tax, Employee, environmental and other matters as to which the beneficiary of the representations and warranties may have Liability under applicable statutes, rules or regulations or judicial or administrative orders, judgments or decrees shall not expire until the later to occur of the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations or the second anniversary of the Closing; (ii) representations and warranties that are made fraudulently by a Party shall survive forever; (iii) the Sellers representations and warranties that are contained in Sections 3.1 (Organization, Authority and Qualification of the RFG Family Entities), Section 3.2 (Capitalization), Section 3.3 (Subsidiaries and Other Interests), Section 3.4 (Due Authorization), 4.1 (Organization and Authority of Securityholder Entities), 4.2 (Execution and Enforceability) and 4.5 through 4.11 (Investment Representations) shall survive forever; and (iv) Calavos representations and warranties that are contained in Sections 5.1 (Organization and Authority of Calavo and Newco) and 5.7 (Issuance of Shares to the Securityholders) shall survive forever.

No Party shall be entitled to assert any indemnification pursuant to this Article 10 after the expiration of the applicable survival period; provided that if on or prior to such expiration of the applicable survival period a notice of claim shall have been given to the respective indemnifying Party for such indemnification, the indemnified party shall continue to have the right to be indemnified with respect to the matter or matters to which such claim relates until such claim for indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise resolved.

 (iv) Any litigation, arbitration, investigation or other claim or legal proceeding (including, without limitation, any claims and legal proceedings that are listed on a schedule to this Agreement), whether brought before or after the Closing, that is based upon or arises out of any actions or omissions made or taken by any Seller or any of the RFG Family Entities prior to the Closing; 

  

 (v) (A) All Taxes of any of the RFG Family Entities for any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, (B) all Taxes of any member of an affiliated, combined or unitary group of which any of the RFG Family Entities is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local or foreign Law; and (C) any and all Taxes of any Person (other than the RFG Family Entities) imposed on the RFG Family Entities as a transferee or successor, by Contract or pursuant to any Law, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring on or prior to the Closing Date; and 

  

 (vi) All payments and other Losses made or incurred by any RFG Family Entity after the Closing Date that are attributable to any guarantees executed by such RFG Family Entity prior to the Closing Date of any obligations of any Seller or of any Affiliate of any Seller, including without limitations the guarantees executed by GHCA of the obligations of LIG Partners, LLC owed to Umpqua Bank and EDF Resource Capital, Inc.; and

covenants applicable to such Seller after the Closing. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding Section 10.2(a) and 10.2(b), a Securityholder shall not be deemed to have agreed to indemnify another Seller under Section 10.2(a) or 10.2(b) by reason of such other Sellers position as an officer, director, shareholder, member or employee of Calavo (including Surviving RFG and their Subsidiaries). 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything in Section 10.5(a) to the contrary, Mr. K. Catchot, Mr. J. Catchot and Mr. Gibson (and their Affiliates, to the extent their Affiliates receive any payments from Liberty Fresh Foods, LLC) agree to be jointly and severally liable for any obligations of Liberty Fresh Foods, LLC, if and to the extent that Liberty Fresh Foods, LLC defaults on its obligations pursuant to this Article 10. 

   

 10.3 _Indemnification by Calavo_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Closing Date and subject to the provisions of this Article 10, Calavo shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Securityholders and each of their respective officers, directors, shareholders, members, employees, other Representatives, Affiliates, successors and permitted assigns from and against any and all Losses that such parties may incur based upon, arising out of, relating to or resulting from: 

   

 (i) Any breach of any representation or warranty of Purchaser made in this Agreement (including any exhibit, schedule or other agreement or document delivered pursuant to this Agreement); or

 (b) Only the Sellers Representative, on behalf of the Securityholder, may assert a claim for indemnification or other remedy against Calavo pursuant to this Article 10. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding Section 10.3(a), Calavo shall not be deemed to have agreed to indemnify Surviving RFG or any other RFG Family Entity (all of which will be owned by Calavo as of the Effective Time) by reason of the fact that Surviving RFG or any other RFG Family Entity may be deemed to be an Affiliate of any Seller or to have any other relationship with such Seller. 

   

 10.4 _Notice of Claims; Contest of Claims_. 

  

 (a) If any indemnified party believes that it has incurred any Losses, or if any claim or legal proceeding is instituted by a third party with respect to which any indemnified party intends to claim any Losses under this Article 10, the indemnified party shall so notify the indemnifying Party. The notice shall describe the Losses, the amount of the Losses, if known, and the method of computation of the Losses, all with reasonable particularity and shall contain a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which the Losses shall have been 

      ##### 

  

    

incurred; and, in the case of a claim or legal proceeding by a third party,
shall include a copy of all documents received by the indemnified party in
connection therewith and any other information known to the indemnified party
with respect to the claim or legal proceeding. The notice shall be given
promptly after the indemnified party becomes aware of each such Loss,
claim or legal proceeding, but failure to give such prompt notice shall not
affect an indemnifying Partys obligations hereunder except to the extent (if
any) that the indemnifying Party has suffered Losses as a result of such
notification failure. 

   

 (b) With respect to any indemnification notice that does not involve a claim or legal proceeding by a third party, the indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have accepted the notice and the indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have agreed to pay the Losses at issue if the indemnifying Party does not send a notice of disagreement to the indemnified party within ten calendar days after receiving the notice. If the indemnifying Party does not send a notice of disagreement to the indemnified party within ten calendar days after receiving the notice, the indemnifying Party shall, within ten days after receipt of such notice of Losses, pay or cause to be paid to the indemnified party the amount of Losses incurred by the indemnified party and described in the notice. 

   

 (c) With respect to an indemnification notice that involves a claim or legal proceeding by a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the indemnifying Party shall, within ten days after receipt of such notice, notify the indemnified party if it elects to conduct and control the defense of the claim or legal proceeding, provided that any such election must be accompanied by a written acknowledgement by the indemnifying Party of its obligation to indemnify the indemnified party with respect to all elements of such claim or legal proceeding. If the indemnifying Party does not so notify the indemnified party of its election to conduct and control the defense of the claim or legal proceeding, the indemnified party shall have the right to defend, contest, settle or compromise the claim or legal proceeding, and the indemnifying Party shall, within ten days after receipt of notice from the indemnified party, pay to the indemnified party the amount of any Losses resulting from the indemnified partys liability to the third-party claimant. 

   

 (d) Subject to the provisions of Section 10.4(c) and 10.4(d), the indemnifying Party shall have the right to undertake, conduct and control, through counsel of its own choosing (and reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party) and at the sole expense of the indemnifying Party, the defense of a Third Party Claim. At the expense and request of the indemnifying Party, the indemnified party shall cooperate in connection with such defense; the indemnified party shall otherwise be entitled to participate in (but not control) the defense of the claim or legal proceeding at its own expense subject to Section 10.4(d). So long as the indemnifying Party is defending the claim or legal proceeding in good faith and on a reasonable basis, and so long as the indemnified party does not incur any Losses by reason of the defense of the claim or legal proceeding, the indemnified party shall not pay or settle the claim or legal proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnified party shall have the right to pay or settle the Action at any time, provided that in such event the indemnified party shall waive any right to indemnity therefor by the indemnifying Party. The indemnifying Party shall not settle the Action without the written consent of the indemnified party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that the indemnified party shall not be required to give its consent (A) if 

    ##### 

  

 

pursuant to or as a result of such payment, settlement, compromise or
cessation, injunctive or other equitable relief will be imposed against the
indemnified party, or (B) if such payment, settlement or compromise includes
a statement or admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on
behalf of any indemnified party, or (C) if such payment, settlement or
compromise does not expressly and unconditionally release the indemnified
party from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such claim, with
prejudice, or (D) if such settlement is reasonably expected to have a
material adverse effect on the business of the indemnified party. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume control of such defense and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by the indemnified party if (A) the claim for indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation, (B) the claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the indemnified party, (C) the indemnified party has been advised by legal counsel that there is a conflict of interest between the indemnified party and the indemnifying Party in the conduct of the defense of such Third-Party Claim, (D) the indemnifying Party failed or is failing to use commercially reasonable efforts to prosecute or defend such Third-Party Claim and such failure would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the indemnified party, or (E) the indemnifying Party fails to provide to the indemnified party reasonable evidence that the indemnifying Party has reasonably sufficient financial resources to defend such Third-Party Claim. 

   

 (f) If the indemnifying Party is entitled to and does assume control of the defense of any Third-Party Claim, all the Parties shall reasonably cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof, including giving each other reasonable access to all information relevant thereto, subject to receipt of a reasonable confidentiality agreement. The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make employees and other representatives available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided in connection therewith. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the indemnifying Partys request) the provision to the indemnifying Party of records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. 

   

 (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any notice or other communication contemplated to be made by or to any Seller under this Article 10 will instead be made by or to the Sellers Representative. 

   

 10.5 _Additional Indemnification Limitations_. 

  

 (a) The maximum indemnification obligation of each Securityholder under this Agreement shall not exceed the Merger Consideration actually received, or that actually becomes payable, to such Securityholder (including the amount of the Holdback Shares, any payments made with respect to the Closing Adjustment Amount, and the value of any Merger Shares at the Merger Shares Value). The maximum aggregate indemnification obligation of Calavo under this Agreement shall not exceed the Merger Consideration that actually becomes payable to the Securityholders (including the amount of the Holdback Shares, any payments 

      ##### 

  

    

made with respect to the Closing Adjustment Amount, and the value of any
Merger Shares at the Merger Shares Value). 

   

 (b) No claims shall be made for indemnification from the Sellers pursuant to Section 10.2(a) or 10.2(b) unless and until the aggregate amount of the Losses incurred by the indemnified parties described in Section 10.2 exceeds $30,000, in which event the indemnified parties described in Section 10.2 shall become entitled to full indemnification for all of their Losses, subject to the limits specified in Section 10.5(a). 

   

 (c) No claims shall be made by the indemnified parties described in Section 10.3 for indemnification from Calavo pursuant to Section 10.3(a) unless and until the aggregate amount of the Losses incurred by the indemnified parties described in Section 10.3 exceeds $30,000, in which event the Sellers shall become entitled to full indemnification for all of their Losses, subject to the limits specified in Section 10.5(a). 

   

 (d) The indemnification limitations described in this Section 10.5 shall not apply to a claim that is made based upon an allegation of fraud by the indemnifying Party. 

   

 (e) The aggregate amount of Losses for which the indemnified parties described in Section 10.2 may seek indemnification hereunder shall be reduced by the net amount of (i) any proceeds of insurance actually received by the indemnified parties described in Section 10.2 from non-Affiliate third parties in connection with a claim for indemnification by such indemnified parties, minus (ii) any reasonable and documented costs and expenses incurred directly in connection with the recovery of such amounts (including any premium increases reasonably and in good faith related to such claim). The indemnified parties described in Section 10.2 shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery under all applicable insurance policies covering any Loss to the same extent as it would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder, but only to the extent such indemnified party believes in good faith that such recovery is available;  _provided_ that the indemnified parties described in Section 10.2 shall not be required to instigate litigation or other dispute resolution. In the event that an insurance or other recovery is received by any of the indemnified parties described in Section 10.2 with respect to any Loss for which any such Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery (net of reasonable expenses incurred in obtaining such recovery) shall be made promptly to the Escrow Account (if the Holdback Period has not yet expired and payments were made in Holdback Shares) or to the Sellers (if the Holdback Period has expired or payments were not made in Holdback Shares). 

   

 (f) To the extent that the Securityholders do not timely make payments as set forth in this Article 10 to Calavo and the Holdback Period has not expired, Calavo may use the Holdback Shares to recover any refund to which it may be entitled. 

   

 10.6 _Materiality Limits_. For the purposes of this Article 10, any qualification of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement that purports to limit such representation or warranty based on "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" or similar language shall be disregarded in calculating the amount of Losses in the event of a breach of such representation or warranty. 

   ##### 

  

  

 10.7 _Offset_. Subject to Section 2.10, if Calavo or Surviving RFG becomes entitled to receive an indemnification payment under the terms of this Article 10, Calavo shall have the right to apply any unpaid Earn-Out Payments that are otherwise payable (or become payable) to the Securityholders pursuant to Article 2 above as an offset against, and in full or partial satisfaction of, the amounts that are owed to Calavo pursuant to the indemnification provisions of this Article 10; provided however that with respect to claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 10.2(b), Calavo may only offset pursuant to this Section 10.7 against the Earn-Out Payments allocated to such Securityholder (in which case payments made to the Securityholders may not be in accordance with the percentages set forth in _Exhibit A_). Any Earn-Out Payments subject to a claim for indemnification made prior to the end of the Earn-Out Period shall not be released until the underlying claim has been finally resolved pursuant to Section 10.4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the amount or duration of the indemnification obligations pursuant to this Article 10 shall not be limited to the Earn-Out Payments. 

  

 10.8 _Security for Earn-Out Payments_. 

  

 (a) As security for the prompt and full payment of the Earn-Out Payments as and when due and payable, effective at the Closing, Calavo hereby grants to the Securityholders a first-priority security interest in all of the Securities of Surviving RFG (the " _Collateral Interests_ "). The security interest created by this Agreement shall automatically terminate upon the earlier to occur of (a) the payment of all Earn-Out Payments that become due and payable during the Earn-Out Period or (b) the determination (either as mutually agreed by Calavo and the Sellers Representative or as otherwise determined by the Independent Accountant) that no Earn-Out Payments have become or will become due during the Earn-Out Period, either because the required Earn-Out Triggers have not been met or otherwise. Unless and until an Earn-Out Payment has become due and payable and Calavo has not made such payment in full, Calavo may exercise any and all voting and other consensual rights pertaining to the Collateral Interests for any purpose not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement and Calavo may receive, retain and distribute any and all dividends and distributions paid in respect of the Collateral Interests. Only the Sellers Representative (acting on behalf of the Securityholders) is entitled to exercise the rights and remedies available to a secured party as a result of Calavos failure to pay in full any Earn-Out Payments that are due and payable, and such exercise shall constitute the Sellers sole remedy for Calavos failure to pay the Earn-Out Payments in full and neither the Securityholders nor the Sellers shall have no other right to obtain monetary payments from, or injunctive relief against, Calavo as a result of Calavos failure to pay such Earn-Out Payments. 

   

 (b) Calavo agrees to deliver to the Escrow Agent the certificates representing the Collateral Interests for purposes of perfecting the security interest granted pursuant to this Section. The Escrow Agent shall hold the certificates representing the Collateral Interests in accordance with this Section 10.8 and the Escrow Agreement. Upon termination of the security interest provided in this Section 10.8, the Escrow Agent shall return the certificates representing the Collateral Interests to Calavo. 

   

 10.9 _Cooperation._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article 10, the Parties shall cooperate in good faith and in all reasonable respects with each other in connection with the determination and resolution of any indemnification claim hereunder. 

   ##### 

  

  

 10.10 _Exclusive Remedy_. This Agreement sets forth the sole and exclusive remedies of Purchaser, on the one hand, and of the Securityholders and Sellers, on the other hand, for a breach of this Agreement by the other party. The obligations set forth in this Article 10 shall be binding upon the respective successors and assigns of Calavo, the Securityholders and the Sellers. 

  

 10.11 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Purchaser, Surviving RFG and the Securityholders shall treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Article 10 as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for all Tax purposes. 

  

Article 11

 11.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing Date (the " _Termination Date_ "): 

  

 (a) by Purchaser, effective upon written notice to RFG, if there shall have been a material breach of any of the representations, warranties, agreements or covenants set forth in this Agreement on the part of the RFG Family Entities or the Sellers which has rendered the satisfaction of any conditions set forth in Section 7.3 incapable of fulfillment, such violation or breach has not been waived by Purchaser, and the breach has not been cured within thirty days following Purchasers written notice of such breach; provided that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 11.1(a) shall not be available to Purchaser if it is then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or other agreement contained herein;

    ##### 

  

 

(Regulatory Approvals) or 7.3(c) (Regulatory Approvals) shall not have been
satisfied but all other conditions to the Closing shall be satisfied or shall
be capable of being satisfied upon satisfaction of the condition to the
Closing set forth in such sections, then any Party shall have the right to
extend the End Date an additional 30 days by notifying the other Party in
writing of such election prior to the End Date; provided, further, that the

available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement (including the obligation to consummate the Closing, subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of the applicable conditions precedent to the
Closing, pursuant to Article 7 hereof) shall have been the cause of, or shall
have resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to such
date; 

   

 (e) by RFG or Purchaser, effective upon written notice, if there shall be in effect a final, non-appealable order of a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction permanently prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or

 12.3 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise set forth herein, each Party hereto shall bear all costs and expenses incurred by it, in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and the other agreements and documents contemplated hereby, the performance of its obligations hereunder and thereunder and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

 12.5 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall benefit, the Parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the rights and obligations of the Sellers hereunder are not assignable to another Person without Purchasers prior written consent, (ii) the Sellers may not sell, assign or otherwise transfer any Merger Shares except in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and (iii) the rights and obligations of Purchaser hereunder are not assignable to another person without the Sellers prior written consent, except that Calavo may assign its rights and obligations hereunder without obtaining such consent in connection with Calavos merger with and into another corporation or in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of Calavos assets or capital stock to another Person, provided that such other Person assumes in a writing delivered to the Sellers all of the obligations of Calavo to the Sellers provided in this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentences of this paragraph and Article 10 (Indemnification), this Agreement is not intended to benefit any Person, or to be enforceable by any person, other than the Parties to this Agreement. 

  

 12.6 _Calculation of Time_. Wherever in this Agreement a period of time is stated in a number of days, unless otherwise stated it shall be deemed to mean calendar days starting with the first day after the event or delivery of notice and ending at the end of the last day of the applicable time period. However, when any period of time so stated would end upon a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, such period shall be deemed to end upon the next day following that is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. 

  

 12.7 _Further Assurances_. Each Party to this Agreement shall perform any further acts and execute and deliver any further documents that may be requested by another Party and that are reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of this Agreement. 

  

 12.8 _Provisions Subject to Applicable Law_. All provisions of this Agreement shall be applicable only to the extent that they do not violate any applicable Law, and are intended to be limited to the extent necessary so that they will not render this Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable under any applicable Law. If any provision of this Agreement or any application 

   ##### 

  

 

thereof shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity,
legality and enforceability of other provisions of this Agreement or of any
other application of such provision shall in no way be affected thereby. 

   

 12.9 _Waiver of Rights_. No Party to this Agreement shall be deemed to have waived any right or remedy that it has under this Agreement unless this Agreement expressly provides a period of time within which such right or remedy must be exercised and such period has expired or unless such Party has expressly waived the same in writing. The waiver by any Party of a right or remedy hereunder shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any other right or remedy or of any subsequent right or remedy of the same kind. 

  

 12.10 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any manner the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

 12.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, and by each party on a separate counterpart, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which taken together shall constitute but one and the same instrument. In the event that any signature is delivered by facsimile transmission or as an attachment to electronic mail, such signature shall create a valid and binding obligation of the party executing (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) such counterpart, with the same force and effect as if such facsimile or electronic signature were the original thereof. 

  

 12.12 _Preparation of this Agreement_. In the event of any dispute regarding this Agreement, no presumption or burden of proof shall be imposed on any Party by reason of the preparation of this Agreement by its counsel. 

  

 12.13 _Governing Laws_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of California without giving effect to such states conflict-of-law principles. 

  

 12.14 _Forum._ Any action brought under this Agreement shall be brought in the courts of the State of California, located in the County of Los Angeles. Each Party hereto irrevocably waives any objection on the grounds of venue, forum non conveniens or any similar grounds and irrevocably consents to service of process by mail or in any manner permitted by applicable law and consents to the jurisdiction of said courts. 

  

 12.15 _Attorneys  Fees and Other Expenses_. The unsuccessful Party to any court action to interpret or enforce this Agreement shall pay to the prevailing party all costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees, incurred therein by the successful Party, all of which shall be included in and as a part of the award rendered in such proceeding or action. For purposes of this Section 12.15, attorneys fees shall include, without limitation, fees incurred in connection with post-judgment and post-award actions. A party shall be deemed to be the prevailing party for purposes of this Section 12.15 only if an award or judgment in the court action determines that such party is the prevailing party and is entitled to reimbursement of the costs and expenses described in this Section 12.15. 

   ##### 

  

  

 12.16 _Specific Performance_. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the other Party would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each of the Parties agrees that, except as otherwise provided in Article 10, the other Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in any action instituted in any court of the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the Party and the matter, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled, at law or in equity. 

  

 12.17 _Sellers  Representative_. 

  

 (a) Each Seller by executing this Agreement hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints Ken Catchot as the Sellers Representative (the " _Sellers  Representative_"), with full power and authority to act in the name of and for and on behalf of such Seller with respect to all matters arising in connection with, or related to, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each Seller hereby appoints the Sellers Representative (a) the agent and true and lawful attorney-in-fact of such Seller, with full power of substitution, and with full capacity and authority in its sole discretion, to act in the name of and for and on behalf of such Seller in connection with all matters arising out of, resulting from, contemplated by or related or incident to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and (b) the agent for service of process for such Seller, and such Seller hereby irrevocably consents to the service of any and all process in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement by the delivery of such process to the Sellers Representative. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the power of the Sellers Representative shall include the power to represent such Seller with respect to all aspects of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, which power shall include the power to (i) waive any and all conditions of this Agreement, (ii) amend, modify or supplement this Agreement in any respect, (iii) defend, negotiate or settle any claims or actions for indemnity pursuant to Article 10, (iv) retain legal counsel or accountants and be reimbursed by the Sellers for all fees, expenses and other charges of such legal counsel or accountants, (v) receive notices or other communications, (vi) deliver any notices, certificates or other documents required hereunder, (vii) take all such other action and to do all such other things as the Sellers Representative deems necessary, appropriate, desirable or advisable with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and (ix) perform its obligations as set forth in, and in accordance with, this Agreement. Each Seller agrees that Purchaser and its Affiliates shall have the absolute right and authority to rely upon the acts taken or omitted to be taken by the Sellers Representative on behalf of the Sellers and shall have no liability with respect thereto, and none of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates shall have any duty to inquire as to the acts and omissions of the Sellers Representative. Purchaser shall not have any liability with respect to any aspect of the distribution or communication of such deliveries between the Sellers Representative and any Seller; and any disclosure made to the Sellers Representative by or on behalf of Purchaser shall be deemed to be a disclosure made to each Seller. Each Seller that makes a claim against Purchaser alleging the lack of authority of the Sellers Representative shall indemnify Purchaser and its Affiliates for any damages suffered, including reasonable attorneys fees and other costs, as a result of Purchasers good faith reliance on the acts or omissions of the Sellers Representative. 

       ##### 

  

     

 (b) The Sellers Representative shall promptly forward to each Seller all notices he receives regarding or arising under this Agreement and shall keep each Seller fully informed on all matters relating to the defense, negotiating, and settlement of any claim or action for indemnity pursuant to Article 10, including but not limited to the selection and retention of legal counsel or accountants in connection with any such claim or action.
