the Company or one or more Subsidiaries at a price designated by Parent;

or the comparable charter or organizational documents of any Subsidiary  



 

12  or (B) any Permit, Material Contract, Franchise Agreement, Management

ARTICLE III

EFFECTS OF THE MERGERS

SECTION 3.01 _Effects on Shares_. As of the Company Merger Effective Time, by
virtue of the Company Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
of Company Common Shares or holders of any shares in MergerCo:

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of MergerCo issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time shall
remain as one issued and outstanding share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

(b) Each Company Common Share that is owned by any Subsidiary or by MergerCo
shall, immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time,
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
payment shall be made with respect thereto.

(c) Each Company Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Company Merger Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance
with _Section 3.01(b)_) shall automatically be converted into, and canceled
in exchange for, the right to receive an amount in cash to be paid by Parent
equal to $19.50 (the " _Company Common Share Merger Consideration_ ").



 

13 (d) Each Company Series A Preferred Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Company Merger Effective Time (other than the Company Series A
Shares owned by any Subsidiary or by MergerCo, which shall be automatically
cancelled and retired and cease to exist) shall automatically be converted
into, and shall be cancelled in exchange for, the right to receive one share
of 7.8750% Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "
_MergerCo Series A Preferred Shares_ "), of the Surviving Corporation (the "
_Company Series A Preferred Share Merger Consideration_ "). The MergerCo
Series A Preferred Shares shall have terms that are materially the same as the
terms of the Company Series A Preferred Shares outstanding on the date hereof,
except that MergerCo rather than the Company will be the issuer of the
shares. At the Company Merger Effective Time, MergerCos Articles of
Incorporation will be amended or supplemented to include terms that are
materially the same as the Company Series A Preferred Shares.

(e) At the Company Merger Effective Time, each warrant to purchase Company
Common Shares listed in _Section 4.03(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule (the "
_Company Warrants_ ") not theretofore exercised shall be canceled in exchange
for the right to receive a single lump sum cash payment, equal to the product
of (i) the number of Company Common Shares subject to such Company Warrant
immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, whether or not
exercisable, and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Company Common Share Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Warrant
(the " _Warrant Merger Consideration_ "). If the exercise price per share of
any such Company Warrant is equal to or greater than the Company Common Share
Merger Consideration, such Company Warrant shall be canceled without any cash
payment being made in respect thereof.

(f) The Buyer Parties acknowledge that, to the extent not previously vested,
all outstanding restricted share awards (" _Company Restricted Shares_ ")
granted pursuant to the Companys Amended and Restated 2003 Omnibus Stock
Incentive Plan, as amended (the " _Incentive Plan_ "), automatically shall
become fully vested and free of any forfeiture restrictions immediately prior
to the Company Merger Effective Time. Each such Company Restricted Share shall
be considered an outstanding Company Common Share for all purposes of this
Agreement, including the right to receive the Company Common Share Merger
Consideration. The amount of previously accrued and unpaid dividends on the
Company Restricted Shares also shall become fully vested immediately prior to
the Company Merger Effective Time and shall be paid by the Surviving
Corporation immediately following the Company Merger Effective Time.

SECTION 3.02 _Effect on Operating Partnership Units_.

(a) At the Partnership Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Partnership
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any partnership
interest of the Operating Partnership, each unit of limited partner interest
in the Operating Partnership issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Partnership Merger Effective Time (" _OP Units_ ") (other than any OP Units
or Series A Preferred OP Units held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
which OP Units and Series A Preferred OP Units shall remain outstanding and
unchanged as units of limited partnership interest in the
Surviving Partnership), subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
shall be converted into, and cancelled in exchange for, the right to receive
cash in an amount equal to the Company Common Share Merger Consideration per
OP Unit on an as-converted basis (the " _OP Unit Merger Consideration_ ").



 

14 (b) The general partner interests of the Operating Partnership shall remain
outstanding as general partner interests in the Surviving Partnership,
entitling the holder thereof to such rights, duties and obligations as are
more fully set forth in the partnership agreement of the Surviving
Partnership.

(c) Each limited and general partnership interest in Merger Partnership shall
automatically be cancelled and cease to exist, the holders thereof
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto and no payment shall be
made with respect thereto.

SECTION 3.03 _Exchange of Certificates; Paying Agent_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall
appoint a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act
as Exchange and Paying Agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment or
exchange, as applicable, in accordance with this _Article III_ of the Merger
Consideration (collectively, such cash being referred to as the " _Exchange
Fund_ "). On or before the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall deposit
with the Paying Agent the Merger Consideration for the benefit of the holders
of Company Common Shares, the Company Series A Preferred Shares, the Company
Warrants, and the OP Units. The Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to make,
and the Paying Agent shall make, payments of the Merger Consideration out of
the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement, the Articles of Merger
and the Partnership Merger Certificate. The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any other purpose. Any and all interest earned on cash deposited in the
Exchange Fund shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Share Transfer Books_. At the Company Merger Effective Time, the share or
unit transfer books of the Company and the Operating Partnership,
as applicable, shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of the Company Common Shares, Company Restricted
Shares, the Company Warrants, the Company Series A Preferred Shares or the OP
Units. From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, persons who held
Company Common Shares, Company Restricted Shares, Company Warrants, Company
Series A Preferred Shares, or OP Units immediately prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time shall cease to have rights with respect to such shares,
warrants or units, except as otherwise provided for herein. On or after the
Company Merger Effective Time, any Certificates of the Company or the
Operating Partnership, as applicable, presented to the Paying Agent,
the Surviving Corporation or the transfer agent for any reason shall be
exchanged for the applicable Merger Consideration.

(c) _Exchange Procedures for Certificates_. (i) Promptly after the Company
Merger Effective Time (but in any event within five (5) Business Days), the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each person who
immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time held Company Common
Shares, Company Warrants or Company Series A Preferred Shares that were
exchanged for the right to receive the Company Common Share Merger
Consideration, in the case of Company Common Shares, the Warrant Merger
Consideration, in the case of Company Warrants, or the Company Series A
Preferred Share Merger Consideration, in the case of the Company Series A
Preferred Shares, as applicable, pursuant to _Section 3.01_: (A) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery of Certificates shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass to the  



 

15  Paying Agent, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent,
and which letter shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the holders Certificates in exchange for the Company Common
Share Merger Consideration, the Warrant Merger Consideration, or the Company
Series A Preferred Share Merger Consideration, as applicable, to which the
holder thereof is entitled. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation
to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents reasonably satisfactory
to the Company as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying
Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall receive in exchange therefor the
Company Common Share Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Company
Common Shares, the Warrant Merger Consideration, in the case of Company
Warrants or the Company Series A Preferred Share Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the Company Series A Preferred Shares, previously
represented by such Certificate pursuant to the provisions of this _Article
III_ , and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Shares, Company Warrants
or the Company Series A Preferred Shares that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a person other than
the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 3.03_, each Certificate shall be deemed at
any time after the Company Merger Effective Time to represent only the right
to receive, upon such surrender, the Company Common Share Merger
Consideration, the Warrant Merger Consideration, or the Company Series A
Preferred Share Merger, as applicable, as contemplated by this _Section
3.03_. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the Merger Consideration.

(ii) Promptly after the Partnership Merger Effective Time (but in any event
within five (5) Business Days), the Surviving Partnership shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each person who immediately prior to the Partnership
Merger Effective Time held OP Units that were exchanged for the right to
receive the OP Unit Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.02_: (A) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery of Certificates shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass to the
Paying Agent, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and
which letter shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent
may reasonably specify) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the holders Certificates in exchange for the OP Unit Merger
Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or
agents reasonably satisfactory to the Company as may be appointed by Parent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate
shall receive in exchange therefor the OP Unit Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the OP Units previously represented by such Certificate pursuant to
the provisions of this _Article III_ , and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of OP
Units that is not registered in the transfer records of the Operating
Partnership, payment may be made to a person other than the person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such  



 

16  Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this  _Section 3.03_, each Certificate shall be deemed at
any time after the Partnership Merger Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive, upon such surrender, the OP Unit Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this  _Section 3.03_. No interest shall be paid or accrue on
the OP Unit Merger Consideration.

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Shares, Company Series A
Preferred Shares, Company Warrants or OP Units_. (i) At the Company Merger
Effective Time, holders of Company Common Shares and Company Series A
Preferred Shares shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, stockholders
of the Company other than the right to receive the Company Common Share Merger
Consideration or the Company Series A Preferred Share Merger Consideration, as
applicable, provided under this _Article III_. The Company Common Share
Merger Consideration or the Company Series A Preferred Share Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
representing Company Common Shares or Company Series A Preferred Shares in
accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights and privileges pertaining to the
Company Common Shares and Company Series A Preferred Shares exchanged
theretofore and represented by such Certificates. The Warrant Merger
Consideration paid with respect to Company Warrants in accordance with the
terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights and privileges pertaining to the canceled
Company Warrants, and on and after the Company Merger Effective Time the
holder of a Company Warrant shall have no further rights with respect to any
Company Warrant, other than the right to receive the Warrant Merger
Consideration as provided in  _Section 3.01(e)_.

(ii) At the Partnership Merger Effective Time, holders of OP Units shall cease
to be, and shall have no rights as, limited partners of the Operating
Partnership other than the right to receive the OP Unit Merger Consideration
provided under this _Article III_. The OP Unit Merger Consideration paid upon
the surrender for exchange of Certificates representing OP Units in
accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights and privileges pertaining to the OP
Units exchanged theretofore and represented by such Certificates. 

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed for six (6) months after the Company Merger Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent, and any holders of Company Common Shares,
Company Series A Preferred Shares, Company Warrants or OP Units prior to the
Company Merger or Partnership Merger, as the case may be, who have
not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only
to Parent for payment of the applicable Merger Consideration.

permit it to continue to qualify as a REIT for the taxable year of the Company
(or portion thereof) that includes and ends with the Company Merger Effective

violate Section 856(c)(4) of the Code on the last day of any calendar quarter
after the date hereof. No Tax Subsidiary is a corporation for U.S. federal

has engaged in any transaction that would give rise to "redetermined rents,
redetermined deductions and excess interest" described in Section 857(b)(7) of

which presents a material risk that any material Tax described in the
preceding sentences will be imposed on the Company or any Tax Subsidiary.

reasonably necessary to cause their respective officers, trustees, directors,
employees, investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, brokers, finders
and any other agents, representatives or affiliates to immediately cease any
discussions, negotiations or communications with any party or parties with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company, the Operating Partnership
and the Subsidiaries shall be responsible for any failure on the part of their
respective officers, trustees, directors, employees, investment bankers,
financial advisors, attorneys, brokers, finders and any other agents,
representatives or affiliates to comply with this _Section 7.04(a)_.

(b) Subject to _Section 7.04(c)_, neither the Company Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) make a Change in Recommendation, or approve or recommend,
or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or (ii)
cause the Company to enter into any agreement, letter of intent, acquisition
agreement or similar agreement concerning an Acquisition Proposal (other than
a confidentiality agreement described in _Section 7.04(c)_). The Company and
the Operating Partnership shall promptly notify Parent (but in no event after
twenty-four hours following the Companys initial receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal) of the relevant details relating to an Acquisition Proposal
(including the identity of the parties and all material terms thereof) which
any of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any of the other Subsidiaries
or any such officer, trustee, director, employee, investment banker,
financial advisor, attorney, broker, finder or other agent, representative or
affiliate may receive after the date hereof, and shall (i) keep Parent
informed on a reasonably current basis as to the status of and any material
developments regarding any such proposal and (ii) provide Parent as soon as
practicable after receipt or delivery thereof with copies of (A) drafts of any
definitive acquisition agreements or proposal letters with respect thereto
and (B) any written material nonpublic information sent or provided by the
Company to any third party in connection with any  



 

47  Acquisition Proposal which was not previously provided or made available to
Parent. The Company shall not, and shall not cause any Subsidiary to,
terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of any existing standstill or
confidentiality agreement to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party
and the Company shall, and shall cause each Subsidiary to, enforce the
provisions of any such agreement. 

(c) Notwithstanding _Section 7.04(a)_ and _Section 7.04(b)_ or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, following the receipt by the
Company or any Subsidiary of a written Acquisition Proposal (that was not
solicited, encouraged or facilitated in violation of _Section 7.04(a)_ and
_Section 7.04(b)_) prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the
Company Board may (directly or through advisors or representatives) if the
Company Board determines in good faith following consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisors that such Acquisition Proposal is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may (i)
furnish non-public information with respect to the Company and the
Subsidiaries to the Person who made such proposal (provided that the Company
(x) has previously or concurrently furnished such information to Parent and
(y) shall furnish such information pursuant to a confidentiality agreement
which is at least as favorable to the Company as the Confidentiality
Agreement), (ii) disclose to its stockholders any information that, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, is required to be disclosed under
the MGCL, (iii) participate in negotiations regarding such proposal and (iv)
following receipt of a written Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a
Superior Proposal, but prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
(A) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, or fail to make, the
Company Recommendation or recommend that the Companys stockholders approve
such Superior Proposal (a " _Change in Recommendation_ "), (B) terminate this
Agreement pursuant to, and subject to compliance with, _Section 9.01(h)_ and
(C) take any action that any court of competent jurisdiction orders the
Company to take, but in each case referred to in clauses (i) through (iv) only
if, after complying with this _Section 7.04(c)_ and _Section 7.04(d)_ below,
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with its duties to the Company or its stockholders
under applicable Law. Nothing in this _Section 7.04_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall prevent the Company Board from complying with Rule 14d-9 or
Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal or from making any required disclosure to the Companys
stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, failure to do so would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor the Company Board shall
be permitted pursuant to this sentence or clause (ii) of the prior sentence to
recommend an Acquisition Proposal which is not a Superior Proposal or make a
Change in Recommendation.

(d) The Company Board shall not take any of the actions referred to in clause
(iv) of the first sentence of _Section 7.04(c)_ unless the Company Board has
(i) given Parent at least four (4) Business Days notice, measured from the
receipt of notice of such proposal or the receipt of any material change to
the terms thereof, of its intent to take such action and providing a copy of
the documents and agreements providing for the Superior Proposal, and (ii)
after taking into account any amendment to this Agreement entered into or to
which Parent irrevocably commits to enter into and for which all internal
approvals of Parent have been obtained since receipt of such notice, such
Superior Proposal remains a Superior Proposal.



 

48 SECTION 7.05 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

(a) From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to honor in accordance with their terms
all severance, change-of-control and similar obligations of the Company and
the Subsidiaries, and Parent shall pay on the Closing Date to any applicable
officer or employee of the Company or any Subsidiary any amounts with respect
to such severance, change-in-control and similar obligations that are payable
by their terms upon consummation of the Company Merger at the Company Merger
Effective Time or on the Closing Date, all of which are listed in _Section
7.05_ of the Disclosure Schedule. From and after the effective time, Parent
shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor in accordance with
their terms any other employment related contracts, agreements arrangements
and commitments of the Company and its Subsidiaries in effect immediately
prior to the Company Merger Effective Time that are applicable to any current
or former employees or directors of the Company or any Subsidiary or any of
their predecessors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to applicable Law,
nothing herein is intended to prevent Parent from amending or terminating any
such obligation, contract, agreement, arrangement or commitment in accordance
with its terms.

(b) With respect to each employee of the Company or any Subsidiary
(collectively, the " _Company Employees_ ") who remains an employee of the
Surviving Corporation or its successors or assigns or any of their
subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ "), for 12 months
following the Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide the Continuing Employees with (i) base salary and cash
incentive opportunities in an amount at least equal to the same level that was
provided to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Company
Merger Effective Time, and (ii) employee benefits that are not materially
less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time. Each
Continuing Employee will be entitled to credit for his or her years of
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities
thereof, including for such purpose, Barcelo Crestline Corporation, Crestline
Capital Corporation, Host Marriott Corporation and Marriott
International, Inc.) before the Closing Date under the parallel employee
benefit plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries to the same extent as such employee
was entitled, before the Company Merger Effective Time, to credit for such
service under the respective Plan (except to the extent such credit would
result in the duplication of benefits and except with respect to benefit
accrual under a defined benefit plan). In addition, with respect to each
health benefit plan, during the calendar year that includes the Closing Date,
each Continuing Employee shall be given credit for amounts paid by the
employee under the respective Plan for purposes of applying deductibles, co-
payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the parallel plan, program or
arrangement of Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

(c) Prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company Board, or an
appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a
resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the
disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a covered person
of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder (" _Section 16_ ") of Company Common Shares
pursuant to this Agreement and the Company Merger shall be an exempt
transaction for purposes of Section 16\.



 

49 (d) Prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company Board shall take
such actions as are necessary to terminate the Companys Executive Deferred
Compensation Plan, as amended ( the " _EDC Plan_ "). Such action shall be
contingent upon, and effective as of, the Company Merger Effective Time.
Payment of all account balances under the EDC Plan shall be in cash to the
participants in a single lump-sum payment by the Surviving Corporation
immediately following the Company Merger Effective Time. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, payment of the portion of an account that is subject to
Section 409A of the Code to a specified employee within the meaning of Section
409A of the Code who has a separation from service on or before the Company
Merger Effective Time shall be delayed to the date six months following such
participants separation from service in the event, and only in the event
that, prior to the Company Merger Effective Time the Company Board determines
that such delay is necessary to comply with the requirements of Section 409A
of the Code.

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement (including, without limitation, this
_Section 7.05_) (i) amends, or shall be deemed to amend, any Plan, or (ii)
limits in any way the Parents or Surviving Corporations ability to amend or
terminate any particular Plan at any time.

SECTION 7.06 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer,
trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any employment
or indemnification agreement or under the Company Charter, the Company
Bylaws, the Operating Partnership Agreement or this Agreement or, if
applicable, similar organizational documents or agreements of any of the
Subsidiaries, from and after the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each person
who is at the date hereof or during the period from the date hereof through
the Company Merger Effective Time serving as a director, officer, trustee,
employee, agent, or fiduciary of the Company or its Subsidiaries or as a
fiduciary under or with respect to any employee benefit plan (within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_
") to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable law, as now or
hereafter in effect, in connection with any Claim and any judgments, fines,
penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments
and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of such
judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement) resulting
therefrom; and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or, within 30 days after
any request for advancement, advance to each of the Indemnified Parties, to
the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable law, as now or
hereafter in effect, any Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness
with respect to or otherwise participating in any Claim in advance of the
final disposition of such Claim, including payment on behalf of or advancement
to the Indemnified Party of any Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in
connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification
and/or advancement, in each case without the requirement of any bond or other
security). The indemnification and advancement obligations of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation pursuant to this  _Section 7.06(a)_ shall extend to
acts or omissions occurring at or before the Company Merger Effective Time and
any Claim relating thereto (including with respect to any acts or omissions
occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions  



 

50  contemplated hereby, including the consideration and approval thereof and
the process undertaken in connection therewith and any Claim relating
thereto), and all rights to indemnification and advancement conferred
hereunder shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director,
officer, trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary of the Company or its
Subsidiaries after the date hereof and shall inure to the benefit of such
persons heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives. As used in
this _Section 7.06(a)_: (x) the term " _Claim_ " means any threatened,
asserted, pending or completed Action, suit or proceeding, or any inquiry or
investigation, whether instituted by any party hereto, any Governmental
Authority or any other party, that any Indemnified Party in good faith
believes might lead to the institution of any such Action, suit
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or
other, including any arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution
mechanism, arising out of or pertaining to matters that relate to such
Indemnified Partys duties or service as a director, officer, trustee,
employee, agent, or fiduciary of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any
employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) maintained
by any of the foregoing or any other person at or prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; and
(y) the term " _Expenses_ " means reasonable attorneys fees and all other
reasonable costs, expenses and obligations (including, without limitation,
experts fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript fees,
duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well as telecommunications,
postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in connection
with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in
(including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in or
participate in, any Claim for which indemnification is authorized pursuant to
this  _Section 7.06(a)_, including any Action relating to a claim for
indemnification or advancement brought by a Indemnified Party. Neither Parent
nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry
of any judgment in any actual or threatened claim, demand, Action, suit,
proceeding, inquiry or investigation in respect of which indemnification has
been or could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder unless such
settlement, compromise or judgment includes an unconditional release of such
Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such claim, demand,
Action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation or such Indemnified Party
otherwise consents thereto.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and MergerCo agree that all rights
to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Company Merger Effective Time now
existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers, trustees,
employees, agents, or fiduciaries of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as
provided in the Company Charter and Company Bylaws (or, as applicable, the
charter, bylaws, partnership agreement, limited liability company agreement,
or other organizational documents of any of the Subsidiaries) and
indemnification agreements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
identified in _Section 7.06(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule shall be assumed
by the Surviving Corporation in the Company Merger, without further action, at
the Company Merger Effective Time and shall survive the Company Merger and
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

(c) For a period of six years from the Company Merger Effective Time, the
charter and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no
less favorable with respect to indemnification than are set forth in the
Company Charter and Company Bylaws, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the
Company Merger Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the
rights  



 

51  thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Company Merger Effective
Time, were directors, officers, trustees, employees, agents, or fiduciaries of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, unless such modification shall be
required by Law and then only to the minimum extent required by Law.

(d) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain for a period of at least six (6)
years the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and
employed lawyer liability insurance maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred
on or before the Company Merger Effective Time, including, without limitation,
in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
that (i) that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of
at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which
are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to the insured, provided that such
substitution shall not result in gaps or lapses of coverage with respect to
matters occurring before the Company Merger Effective Time; (ii) in no event
shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend pursuant to this
_Section 7.06(d)_ more than an amount per year of coverage equal to three
hundred percent (300%) of the current annual premiums paid by the Company for
such insurance. In the event that, but for the proviso to the immediately
preceding sentence, the Surviving Corporation would be required to expend
more than three hundred percent (300%) of the current annual premiums paid by
the Company, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain the maximum amount of such
insurance obtainable by payment of annual premiums equal to three hundred
percent (300%) of the current annual premiums paid by the Company. Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its successors or assigns
to, maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor
all obligations thereunder.

(e) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation, partnership or other
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Corporation assumes the obligations set forth in this
_Section 7.06(e)_.

 

(f) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all of the
obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 7.06_ and the
parties acknowledge and agree that Parent guarantees the payment and
performance of the Surviving Corporations obligations pursuant to this
_Section 7.06_.

SECTION 7.07 _Further Action; Reasonable Efforts_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate
and make effective the Mergers, including using its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all Permits, consents, approvals, authorizations,
qualifications and orders of Governmental Authorities and other third parties
to Permits, Material Contracts, Franchise Agreements, Management Agreement
Documents, Ground Leases or Plans to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a
party or by which it or any of its respective  



 

52  properties or assets may be bound, in each case as are necessary, proper or
advisable for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or otherwise disclosed in _Section 7.07(a)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule. In the event that the Company or the Operating Partnership shall
fail to obtain any consent from any person (other than a Governmental
Authority) described above, the Company and the Operating Partnership shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts, and shall take such actions as are
reasonably requested by Parent, to minimize any adverse effect upon the
Company, the Operating Partnership and the Buyer Parties and their respective
businesses resulting, or which could reasonably be expected to result, after
the Effective Time, from the failure to obtain such consent. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection with obtaining any
approval or consent from any person (other than a Governmental Authority) with
respect to any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, (i) without the
prior written consent of Parent which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall pay or
commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any
cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or
other obligation due to such person and (ii) none of the Buyer Parties or
their respective affiliates shall be required to pay or commit to pay to such
person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other
consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or other
obligation; _provided_ , that the Company and its Subsidiaries may make such
payments as and to the extent contemplated by the terms of the relevant
agreement with respect to which consent is being sought.

(b) The parties hereto agree to cooperate and assist one another in connection
with all actions to be taken pursuant to this _Section 7.07_, including the
preparation and making of the filings referred to therein and, if requested,
amending or furnishing additional information thereunder, including, subject
to applicable Law and the Confidentiality Agreement, providing copies of
all related documents to the non filing party and their advisors prior to
filing, and, to the extent practicable, neither of the parties will file any
such document or have any communication with any Governmental Authority
without prior consultation with the other party. Each party shall keep the
other apprised of the content and status of any communications with, and
communications from, any Governmental Authority with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the extent practicable and
permitted by a Governmental Authority, each party hereto shall permit
representatives of the other party to participate in meetings and calls with
such Governmental Authority.

(c) Each of the parties hereto agrees to cooperate and use its reasonable best
efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any Action,
including administrative or judicial Action, asserted by any party in order
to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed, terminated or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) that in whole or in part restricts, delays,
prevents or prohibits consummation of the Mergers, including, without
limitation, by vigorously pursuing all available avenues of administrative and
judicial appeal.

(d) The Company and the Subsidiaries shall give prompt notice to Parent,
MergerCo and Merger Partnership, and Parent, MergerCo and Merger
Partnership shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any
representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becoming
untrue or inaccurate such that the condition set forth in _Section 8.02(a)_
would not be satisfied, or (ii) the failure by it to comply with or satisfy
in any material respect  



 

53  any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
under this Agreement such that the condition set forth in  _Section 8.02(b)_
would not be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification
shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement.

(e) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange the Debt Financing
on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter,
including using reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate definitive agreements
with respect thereto on terms and conditions contained therein, and (ii)
satisfy all conditions applicable to the Buyer Parties in such definitive
agreements that are within their control. In the event any portion of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the
Debt Commitment Letter, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to arrange to obtain any such portion from alternative sources as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event. Parent shall give the
Company prompt notice of any material breach by any party of the Debt
Commitment Letter or any termination of the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent
shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable
detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and Parent
shall not permit any material amendment or modification to be made to, or any
waiver of any material provision or remedy under, the Debt Commitment Letter
without first notifying the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Debt
Financing (or any alternative financing) has not been obtained, Parent shall
continue to be obligated to consummate the Mergers on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

(f) The Company and the Subsidiaries agree to provide, and shall cause their
officers, trustees, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants and other advisors or representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") to provide, all commercially reasonable cooperation in
connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing as may be reasonably
requested by Parent, MergerCo or Merger Partnership (provided that such
requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries), including (i) participation
in meetings, drafting sessions and due diligence sessions, (ii) furnishing
Parent, MergerCo and Merger Partnership and their financing sources with
financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company or the
Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by the Parent, MergerCo or Merger
Partnership, (iii) assisting Parent, MergerCo and Merger Partnership and
their financing sources in the preparation of (A) an offering document for any
Debt Financing, and (B) materials for rating agency presentations, (iv)
reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts of Parent, MergerCo or
Merger Partnership and their financing sources for any Debt Financing raised
by Parent, MergerCo or Merger Partnership, (v) forming new direct or indirect
Subsidiaries, and (vi) providing and executing documents (including the
execution and delivery of estoppel certificates and subordination and non-
disturbance agreements (" _SNDAs_ ")) as may be reasonably requested by
Parent, MergerCo or Merger Partnership; _provided_ , that none of the Company
or any Subsidiary shall be required to pay any commitment of other similar fee
or incur any other liability in connection with the Debt Financing prior to
the Closing. Parent, MergerCo or Merger Partnership shall, promptly
upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company or the Subsidiaries for
all reasonable out of pocket costs incurred by the Company, the Subsidiaries
and their Representatives in connection with such cooperation. Parent,
MergerCo and Merger Partnership shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and
hold harmless the Company, the Subsidiaries and their respective  



 

54  Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered
or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing
and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than historical
information relating to the Company or the Subsidiaries). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, the condition set forth in _Section 8.02(b)_, as
it applies to the Companys obligations under this _Section 7.07(f)_, shall
be deemed satisfied unless the Debt Financing (or any alternative financing)
has not been obtained primarily as a result of the Companys willful and
material breach of its obligations under this _Section 7.07(f)_.

(g) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to
Parent at least two business days prior to the Closing Date payoff letters
from third-party lenders to the Company, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, except with respect to the indebtedness obligations
of the Company and the Subsidiaries set forth in _Section 7.07(g)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule and any other indebtedness specified by Parent to the
Company no later than 15 days prior to the Closing. On the Closing Date,
subject to Parent making available the funds required by this Agreement, the
Company and the Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts to,
unless instructed otherwise in writing by Parent not later than 15 days prior
to Closing, permanently (i) terminate the credit facilities requested by
Parent to be so terminated, except to the extent such facilities are either
set forth in _Section 7.07(g)_ of the Disclosure Schedule or specified
by Parent to the Company no later than ten business days prior to Closing,
and all related agreements, to which the Company and the Subsidiaries is a
party and (ii) to the extent the related facility or loan is terminated
pursuant to this  _Section 7.07(g)_, release any liens on the Companys or
the Subsidiaries assets relating to those facilities. The Company and the
Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts to effectuate the
assumption of the mortgage indebtedness listed on _Section 7.07(g)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule by Parent or its subsidiaries with the Company being
responsible for all assumption costs and expenses required by the existing
lenders incurred in connection with such assumptions.

SECTION 7.08 _Transfer Taxes_. Parent and the Company shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires,
applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains,
sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer or stamp taxes, any
transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar taxes
that become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (together with any related interests, penalties or additions to Tax,
" _Transfer Taxes_ "), and shall cooperate in attempting to minimize the
amount of Transfer Taxes. From and after the Company Merger Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid, without deduction or
withholding from any consideration or amounts payable to holders of the
Company Common Shares, Company Warrants, Company Restricted Shares and/or OP
Units, all Transfer Taxes.

SECTION 7.09 _Tax Matters_.

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Company Merger
Effective Time, the Company and its Tax Subsidiaries shall:

(i) continue to be organized and operate in such a manner as to permit the
Company to continue to qualify as a REIT throughout the period from the
date hereof to the Company Merger Effective Time;



 

55 (ii) prepare and timely file all Tax Returns required to be filed by them on
or before the Closing Date (" _Post-Signing Returns_ ") in a manner
consistent with past practice, except as otherwise required by applicable
laws;

(iii) fully and timely pay all Taxes due and payable in respect of such Post-
Signing Returns that are so filed;

(iv) properly reserve (and reflect such reserve in their books and records
and financial statements), for all Taxes payable by them for which no Post-
Signing Return is due prior to the Company Merger Effective Time in a manner
consistent with past practice; and 

(v) terminate all Tax Sharing Agreements to which the Company or any of its
Tax Subsidiaries is a party such that there are no further liabilities
thereunder (provided that the foregoing does not apply to existing Tax
Protection Agreements, if any).

(b) For federal and applicable state and local income Tax purposes, each of
the parties hereto shall report and treat the Company Merger and the
Partnership Merger as being taken pursuant to a single integrated plan, with
the result that such mergers be treated as a taxable sale by the Company of
all of the Companys assets to MergerCo in exchange for the merger
consideration provided for herein to be provided to the stockholders of the
Company and the assumption of all of the Companys liabilities, followed by a
distribution of such merger consideration to the stockholders of the Company
in liquidation pursuant to Section 331 and Section 562 of the Code, and that
this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of liquidation" of the Company for
federal income Tax purposes.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company shall notify Parent if the Company has determined, in its reasonable
discretion, that it must take any action for the Company to maintain its
qualification as a REIT or to eliminate or reduce income or excise taxes under
Sections 856, 860 and 4981 of the Code (and similar provisions of state or
local Tax Law) for any period or portion thereof ending on or prior to the
Effective Time, including making dividend or distribution payments to
stockholders of the Company or unitholders of the Operating Partnership (as
permitted pursuant to _Section 6.01(b)_ hereof). Furthermore, the Company
shall consider in good faith taking actions requested by Parent if Parent
provides to the Company an opinion of tax counsel nationally recognized
in the federal taxation of REITs that such action is necessary in order for
the Company to maintain its qualification as a REIT or to eliminate or reduce
income or excise taxes under Sections 856, 860 and 4981 of the Code (and
similar provisions of state or local Tax Law) for any period or portion
thereof ending on or prior to the Effective Time.

SECTION 7.10 _Public Announcements_. The parties hereto agree that no public
release, public filing or announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Mergers shall be issued by a party
without the prior consent of the other parties (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), except as such release, filing or announcement may be

enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any injunction, order,
decree or ruling or taken any other action (including the failure to have
taken an action) which, in either such case, has become final and non-
appealable and has the effect of making consummation of the Company Merger
illegal or otherwise preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Company
Merger (" _Governmental Order_ "); provided, however, that the terms of this 
_Section 9.01(c)_ shall not be available to any party unless such party shall
have used its reasonable best efforts to oppose any such Governmental Order or
to have such Governmental Order vacated or made inapplicable to the
Company Merger;

(d) by Parent if each of it, MergerCo and Merger Partnership is not in
material breach of its obligations under this Agreement, and if (i) any of

consummate the Mergers are satisfied (except, in the case of any condition
which requires the delivery of officers certificates  



 

59  or legal opinions, such conditions shall only be deemed satisfied if such

date as if such first date were the Closing Date); _provided_ , that this

(i) by Parent if the Company Board has effected a Change in Recommendation.

SECTION 9.02 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01_, this Agreement shall forthwith become

party hereto except that the Guaranty referred to in _Section 5.07_ and the
provisions of _Section 7.03(b)_, this _Section 9.02_, _Section 9.03_ and

twelve (12) months following the Termination Date, the Company and/or
its Subsidiaries enters into an agreement with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal, or an Acquisition Proposal is consummated (in each case whether or
not such Acquisition Proposal was the same Acquisition  



 

60  Proposal referred to in the foregoing clause (A)), then the Company shall
pay to Parent, upon the earlier to occur of the execution of such agreement or
the consummation of such Acquisition Proposal, the Company Termination Fee
(and for purposes of this _Section 9.03(b)(i)_, "50%" shall be substituted
for "20%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal);

(ii) by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.01(g)_ or _Section 9.01(i)_, then the
Company shall pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee on the Termination
Date;

(iii) by the Company pursuant to _Section 9.01(h)_, then the Company shall
pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee on the Termination Date; or

(iv) by the Company (A) pursuant to _Section 9.01(b)_ or a termination on
or after the Outside Date pursuant to _Section 9.01(e)(i)_, and in either
case all of the conditions to Parents obligation to consummate the Mergers
are satisfied (except, in the case of any condition which requires the
delivery of officers certificates or legal opinions, such conditions shall
only be deemed satisfied if such officers certificates or legal opinions
could be delivered on the Outside Date as if the Outside Date were the Closing
Date) as of the Outside Date assuming the Closing occurred on the Outside
Date, or (B) _Section 9.01(e)(ii)_, then the Parent shall pay to the Company
the Parent Termination Fee within three (3) Business Days of the Termination
Date.

 

(c) To the extent required to be paid pursuant to this _Section 9.03_, the
Company Termination Fee and the Parent Termination Fee shall be paid by the
applicable party as directed in writing by the other party in immediately
available funds.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, each of " _Company Termination Fee_ " and
" _Parent Termination Fee_ " means an amount equal to $50 million.

(e) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
9.01(e)_, Parent shall pay to the Company within three (3) Business Days after
the date of termination all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses,
including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of lawyers,
accountants, consultants, financial advisors and investment bankers, incurred
by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with the entering into of
this Agreement and the carrying out of any and all acts contemplated
hereunder up to an aggregate maximum amount of $15 million (the " _Company
Expenses_ "). If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
9.01(d)_, the Company shall pay to Parent, within three (3) Business Days
after the date of termination all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of lawyers,
accountants, consultants, financial advisors, and investment bankers,
incurred by Parent in connection with the entering into of this Agreement and
the carrying out of any and all acts contemplated hereunder up to an aggregate
maximum amount of $15 million (the " _Parent Expenses_ "). If this Agreement
is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 9.01(f)_,
then the Company shall pay to Parent within three (3) Business Days after the
date of such termination the Parent Expenses;  _provided_ , that for purposes
of this sentence only the reference to "$15 million" in the definition of
Parent Expenses shall be deemed instead a reference to "$7.5 million";
_provided_ , _further_ , that in the event the Company Termination Fee
becomes payable as a result of such termination, the Parent Expenses shall be
credited toward such payment of the Company Termination Fee.



 

61 (f) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this  _Section 9.03_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the Company shall fail to
pay the Company Termination Fee or Parent Expenses when due or Parent shall
fail to pay the Parent Termination Fee or the Company Expenses when due, the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall reimburse the other party for all
reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred or accrued by such other party
(including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with the
collection under and enforcement of this _Section 9.03_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Companys right to receive
payment of the Parent Termination Fee and the Company Expenses from Parent or
the Guarantor (in accordance with the Guaranty) pursuant to _Section 9.03_
and to require Parent, MergerCo, Merger Partnership and the Guarantor to
perform their respective obligations under (i) the Guaranty in accordance
with its terms and (ii) this _Section 9.03(f)_, shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Company, the Operating Partnership and the
Subsidiaries against Parent, MergerCo, Merger Partnership the Guarantor, and
any of their respective former, current, or future general or limited
partners, stockholders, managers, members, affiliates or Representatives
(collectively, the " _Parent Parties_ ") (whether at law or in equity) with
respect to the negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and
the transactions and obligations contemplated hereby, including for any loss
suffered as a result of the failure of the Company Merger or the Partnership
Merger to be consummated, under any theory and for any reason, and upon
payment in full of such amounts and fulfillment of such obligations, none of
the Parent Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to
or arising out of the negotiation, execution and performance of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION 9.04 _Escrow of Company Termination Expenses_.

(a) In the event that Parent is obligated to pay the Parent Termination Fee or
Company Expenses (collectively, the " _Company Termination Expenses_ ") set
forth in _Section 9.03(e)_, Parent shall pay to the Operating Partnership
from the Company Termination Expenses deposited into escrow in accordance with
the next sentence, an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Company
Termination Expenses and (ii) the sum of (1) the maximum amount that can be
paid to the Operating Partnership without causing the Company to fail to meet
the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3) of the Code determined
as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in
Sections 856(c)(2)(A)-(H) or 856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code (" _Qualifying
Income_ "), as determined by the Companys independent certified public
accountants, plus (2) in the event the Company receives either (A) a letter
from the Companys counsel indicating that the Company has received a ruling
from the IRS described in  _Section 9.04(b)_ or (B) an opinion from the
Companys outside counsel as described in _Section 9.04(b)_, an amount equal
to the Company Termination Expenses less the amount payable under clause (1)
above. To secure Parents obligation to pay these amounts, Parent shall
deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the Company Termination
Expenses with an escrow agent selected by Parent and on such terms (subject to
_Section 9.04(b)_) as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Operating
Partnership, Parent and the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow
of the Company Termination Expenses pursuant to this _Section 9.04(a)_ shall
be made at the time Parent is obligated to pay the Operating Partnership such
amount pursuant to _Section 9.03(e)_ by wire transfer or bank check.



 

62 (b) The escrow agreement shall provide that the Company Termination Expenses
in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to the Operating
Partnership unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the
following: (i) a letter from the Companys independent certified public
accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow
agent to the Operating Partnership without causing the Company to fail to meet
the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if
the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income or a
subsequent letter from the Companys accountants revising that amount, in
which case the escrow agent shall release such amount to the Company, or (ii)
a letter from the Companys counsel indicating that the Company received a
ruling from the IRS holding that the Company Termination Expenses would either
constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the
meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (or alternatively,
the Companys outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that
the receipt by the Operating Partnership of the Company Termination Expenses
would constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income
within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code or would not
otherwise disqualify Company as a REIT), in which case the escrow agent shall
release the remainder of the Company Termination Expenses to the Operating
Partnership. Parent agrees to amend this _Section 9.04_ at the request of
the Company in order to (x) maximize the portion of the Company Termination
Expenses that may be distributed to the Operating Partnership hereunder
without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (y) improve the Companys chances of securing a
favorable ruling described in this _Section 9.04(b)_ or (z) assist the
Company in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its outside counsel as
described in this _Section 9.04(b)_. The escrow agreement shall also provide
that any portion of the Company Termination Expenses held in escrow for five
years shall be released by the escrow agent to Parent.

SECTION 9.05 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Company Merger Effective Time,
the Company, on the one hand, and Parent, MergerCo and Merger Partnership, on
the other hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation
or other act of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the
representations and warranties of the other party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any agreement
of the other party or any condition to its own obligations contained herein.
Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the Company or Parent (on behalf of Parent, MergerCo and
Merger Partnership). The failure of any party to assert any of its rights
under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those
rights.

is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy or the application of this Agreement to any person or

this Agreement are agreed to be  



 

64  severable. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is

in order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated
as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by action taken by their
respective board of directors (or similar governing body or entity) at
any time prior to the Company Merger Effective Time; provided, however, that,
after approval of the Company Merger by the stockholders of the Company, no
amendment may be made without further stockholder approval which, by Law or in
accordance with the rules of the NYSE, requires further approval by such
stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by the parties hereto.

SECTION 10.05 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, together with
the Confidentiality Agreement and the Disclosure Schedule, constitute the
entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral,

This Agreement shall not be assigned (whether pursuant to a merger, by
operation of law or otherwise).

SECTION 10.06 _Performance Guaranty_. Parent hereby guarantees the due, prompt
and faithful performance and discharge by, and compliance with, all of the
obligations covenants, terms, conditions and undertakings of each of the Buyer
Parties under this agreement in accordance with the terms hereof including any
such obligations, covenants, terms, conditions and undertakings that are
required to be performed discharged or complied with following the Company
Merger Effective Time.

SECTION 10.07 _Remedies; Specific Performance_.

(a) Each of the Company and the Operating Partnership agree that to
the extent it has incurred losses in connection with this Agreement, the
maximum aggregate liability of Parent, MergerCo, Merger Partnership, the
Guarantor and any other Parent Party for such losses shall be limited to an
amount equal to the amount of the Guaranty (inclusive of the amount of the
Parent Termination Fee and the Company Expenses) and any amounts payable under
_Section 9.03(f)_, and in no event shall the either of Company or the
Operating Partnership or any of their respective affiliates seek to recover
from Parent, MergerCo, Merger Partnership, the Guarantor or any other Parent
Party any money damages in excess of such amounts in connection herewith.

(b) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed by the Company or
the Operating Partnership in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached by the Company or the Operating partnership. It is
accordingly agreed that Parent, MergerCo and Merger Partnership shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to  



 

65  enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the
United States or any state having jurisdiction, such remedy being in addition
to any other remedy to which any party is entitled at law or in equity. The
parties acknowledge and agree that the Company and the Operating Partnership
shall not be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement by Parent, MergerCo or Merger Partnership or to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof and that the Companys sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to any such breach shall be the remedy set forth
in _Section 9.03_ and  _Section 10.07(a)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance to prevent any
breach by Parent, MergerCo or Merger Partnership of _Section 7.03(b)_.

SECTION 10.08 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in

other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by

persons entitled to indemnification or payment thereunder and may be enforced
by such persons).

 

SECTION 10.09 _Governing Law; Forum_. The Partnership Merger shall be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware
applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed in that State without
regard to its rules of conflict of laws. Except as provided in the immediately

or relating to this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of
this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by

regard to its rules of conflict of laws.

Each of the Company, Operating Partnership and Parent hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally consents to submit to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of
the courts of the State of Maryland or any court of the United States located

arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or
performance of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby (and
agrees not to commence any litigation relating thereto except in such courts),
waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such litigation in the

for acceptance of legal process, and (b) that service of process may also be
made on such party by prepaid certified mail with a proof of mailing receipt
validated by the United States Postal Service constituting evidence of valid
service. Service made pursuant to (a) or (b) above shall have the same legal
force and effect as if served upon such party personally within the State of

66 SECTION 10.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission) in two or more counterparts, and by the
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed
shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement. 

SECTION 10.12 _Waiver_. Except as provided in this Agreement, no action taken
pursuant to this Agreement, including, without limitation, any investigation
by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the
party taking such action of compliance with any representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement. The waiver by any party
hereto of a breach of any provision hereunder shall not operate or be
construed as a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of the same or any

no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it
and the other hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as applicable, by, among other
