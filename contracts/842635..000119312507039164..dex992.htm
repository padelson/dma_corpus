Proposal_ ") or engage in any negotiations or enter into any agreement or
understanding with any Person (other than Buyer) regarding an Acquisition
Proposal. Sellers will not furnish any information concerning the Millennium
Inorganic Companies to any Person other than Buyer for the purpose of,
or with the intent of, permitting such Person to evaluate a possible
Acquisition Proposal. Sellers will notify Buyer promptly following the receipt
of any unsolicited Acquisition Proposal and will disclose the terms of the

letters of credit, letters of comfort or similar obligations that would have
been "Seller Guarantees" had they been entered into on or prior to the
Execution Date and the entry into which is either permitted under _Section

cause) within the twelve month period beginning on the Closing Date, Buyer

determined according to Section 414(l) of the Code, Treasury Regulation
Section 1.414(l)-1, Section 208 of ERISA and the assumptions and valuation
methodology which the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation would have used

to provide Buyer with such information as Buyer shall reasonably request
regarding the assets and liabilities attributable to the St. Helena
Employees and the spin-off methodology.

and appropriate to cause the Transferred Employees located in the United

Inorganic Company Benefit Plans and Affiliate Benefit Plans in which U.S.
Transferred Employees participated while employed by the Millennium Inorganic
Companies. Effective on transfer of associated assets, Buyer shall, or shall
cause the Millennium Inorganic Companies to, assume and maintain all existing

be transferred from Sellers trust to the trust maintained by Buyer, or a
Millennium Inorganic Company, to fund the liabilities allocable to
Covered Employees, according to the Sellers actuarys calculation, subject

actual investment earnings or losses allocable to the assets and the amount of
any benefit payments made to Covered Employees from the Closing Date to the
date of transfer.

(m) Buyer shall assume and maintain, or shall cause the Millennium Inorganic
Companies to assume and maintain, all existing retirement liabilities and

a rollover from the Millennium Chemicals Inc. Savings and Investment Plan to
qualified plans maintained by Buyer or a Millennium Inorganic Company.

(o) Nothing in this Agreement (including this _Section 7.1_ of this
Agreement) shall confer any rights as a third party beneficiary or otherwise
on any Transferred Employee, former employee of the Millennium Inorganic
Companies, or participant or beneficiary in any Millennium Inorganic Company
Plan or Affiliate Benefit Plan. Nothing in this Agreement (including this
_Section 7.1_ of this Agreement) shall amend or be construed as an amendment
to any Millennium Inorganic Company Plan or Affiliate Benefit Plan or shall
provide participants in any Millennium Inorganic Company Plan or Affiliate
Benefit Plan with any rights in addition to their rights under the terms of
such plans and applicable Law. Nothing in this Agreement (including this
_Section 7.1_ of this Agreement) shall prevent Buyer from amending or
terminating any Millennium Inorganic Company Plan or require Buyer to continue
providing any benefit or type of benefit after the first anniversary of the
Closing Date.

(p) Buyer will assume and maintain, or cause the Millennium Inorganic

Sellers will deliver to Buyer plan assets of the Non-U.S. Benefit Plans, if
applicable, to the relevant pension and investment vehicles as directed by
Buyer or, where applicable, by the Transferred Employees. Plan assets for the
Non-U.S. Benefit Plans will be determined by Sellers retained actuary, in

Section 7.2 _Insurance_.

(a) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that as of and after the Closing, Buyer
shall be responsible for all insurance coverage for the Assets and the
Business, and that neither Sellers nor any of their Affiliates shall be
responsible for providing insurance coverage for the Assets or the Business,
and that all such coverage currently provided by Sellers or their Affiliates,
including coverage under any owner controlled insurance programs, shall be
canceled at the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall retain
all benefits under all (i) contracts of insurance issued prior to the Closing
Date and providing coverage to the Millennium Inorganic Companies, including
contracts of insurance issued to any current or former parent or affiliate of
the Millennium Inorganic Companies or the predecessors-in-interest of the
foregoing specified entities, and (ii) rights of the Millennium Inorganic
Companies to the contracts of insurance specified in clause (i) above.

(b) As of the Closing and thereafter, Buyer shall obtain and maintain workers

Section 7.3 _Further Assurances_. Sellers and Buyer agree that from time to
time after the Closing Date they will execute and deliver, and will cause
their respective Affiliates to execute and deliver, such further instruments,

Agreement and the Other Agreements.

_provided_ , _however_ , no Millennium Inorganic Company shall be required to
remove the "Millennium" name from any products or product components that are
in inventory as of the Closing.

Section 7.5 _Third Person Consents Not Obtained at Closing_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this
Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign any Affiliate Contract
or any Shared Contract or any benefit arising under or resulting from such
Affiliate Contract or Shared Contract  



 

49 EXECUTION VERSION



 

 (to the extent related to the Business) if an attempted assignment thereof,
without a required Third Person Consent or Authorization, would constitute
a breach or other contravention of the rights of such third Person, would be
ineffective with respect to any party to an agreement concerning such
Affiliate Contract or Shared Contract, would violate or otherwise is not
permitted by Law or would in any way adversely affect the rights of Sellers
or, upon transfer, of Buyer under or in respect of such Affiliate Contract or
Shared Contract. If any transfer or assignment by Sellers to, or any
assumption by Buyer of, any interest in, or obligation under, any Affiliate
Contract or Shared Contract, requires any Third Person Consent or
Authorization, then no such assignment or assumption shall be made without
such Third Person Consent or Authorization being obtained. To the extent any
Affiliate Contract or Shared Contract (to the extent related to the Business)
may not be assigned to Buyer by reason of the absence of any such Third Person
Consent or Authorization, Buyer shall not be required to assume any
obligations arising under such Affiliate Contract or Shared Contract;
_provided_ , _however_ , that upon the receipt of any such Third Person
Consent or Authorization after the Closing, such Affiliate Contract or Shared
Contract shall be assigned to Buyer and Buyer shall assume such Affiliate
Contract or Shared Contract (but only to the extent related to the Business).

(b) If any such Third Person Consent or Authorization is not obtained prior
to the Closing Date, Sellers shall, to the extent not prohibited by the terms
of any applicable Affiliate Contract, Shared Contract or Law and until the
receipt of such Third Person Consent or Authorization, hold the Affiliate
Contract or Shared Contract (to the extent related to the Business), subject
to such Third Person Consent or Authorization, together with any proceeds
therefrom, in trust for Buyer. Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate (each at
its own expense) in any lawful and reasonable arrangement reasonably proposed
by Buyer under which Buyer shall obtain to the extent practicable the economic
Claims, rights and benefits related to such Affiliate Contract or Shared
Contract (to the extent related to the Business), with respect to which the
Third Person Consent or Authorization has not been obtained in accordance with
this Agreement. Such reasonable arrangement may include (i) the
subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing to Buyer of any and all rights of
Sellers against the other party to such third-party agreement arising out of a
breach or cancellation thereof by the other party and (ii) commercially
reasonable efforts by Sellers to enforce such rights. If Buyer is able to

notices and communications with the relevant Governmental Authority relating
to such Tax Controversy; _provided_ , _however_ , that a failure to comply
with this provision shall not affect the indemnified partys right to
indemnification hereunder except to the extent such failure
materially impairs the indemnifying partys ability to contest any such Tax
liabilities. Except as provided in this _Section 8.8(c)_, the indemnifying
party may elect to control, and may elect to have sole discretion in handling,
settling or contesting any audit inquiry, information request, audit

this Agreement and except for the covenants and indemnification provisions
contained in _ARTICLE VIII_: (a) the representations and warranties of
Sellers in _Section 4.22_ shall not survive the Closing, (b) the
representations and warranties of the parties hereto contained in this  



 

60 EXECUTION VERSION



 

 Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full force and
effect for a period of 18 months after the Closing Date, except for
the representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.2_, _Section
3.5_, _Section 3.6_, _Section 4.2_, _Section 5.2_, and _Section 5.5_,
which shall survive the Closing indefinitely, and  _Section 4.11_ which
shall survive for three years after the Closing Date, and (c) each covenant
and agreement of the parties hereto contained in this Agreement which by its
terms requires performance after the Closing Date shall survive the Closing
and shall remain in full force and effect until such covenant or agreement is
fully performed.

Section 11.2  _Indemnification Provisions for Benefit of Buyer_.

(a) If the Closing occurs, each Seller, severally, but not jointly, agrees
to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the Buyer Indemnitees from and
against any Loss or Claim suffered or incurred by them arising out of or
related to the breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of it
contained in this Agreement. No Claim may be asserted or commenced against
any Seller pursuant to this _Section 11.2_ unless written notice of such
Claim is received by Sellers describing in reasonable detail the facts and
circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such Claim on or prior to
the date on which the representation or warranty or covenant (as applicable)
on which such Claim is based ceases to survive as set forth in _Section
11.1_.

(b) No Claim for any inaccuracy in any representation or warranty may be made
against any Seller for indemnification pursuant to  _Section 11.2(a)_: (i)
with respect to any individual item (or group of related items) of Loss unless
such Loss exceeds $50,000 (nor shall any such Loss below such threshold be
applied to or considered for purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of
the Buyer Indemnitees Losses) and (ii) unless the aggregate amount of all
Losses of the Buyer Indemnitees with respect to _Section 11.2(a)_ shall
exceed the Buyer Indemnification Deductible (after which point Sellers will
be obligated only to indemnify Buyer from and against Losses in excess of the
Buyer Indemnification Deductible but less than or equal to the Buyer
Indemnification Ceiling). The maximum amount that Sellers combined shall be
required to pay in the aggregate pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)_ in respect of
all Losses by all Buyer Indemnitees is the Buyer Indemnification Ceiling
_less_ the Buyer Indemnification Deductible, after which point no Seller will
have an obligation to indemnify Buyer from and against further such Losses.
Notwithstanding the preceding, the limitations in this _Section 11.2(b)_ do
not apply to any claims by the Buyer Indemnitees arising out of or related to
(i) the Retained Liabilities, (ii) Losses or other amounts to be paid by
Sellers pursuant _ARTICLE VIII_ (including any breach of Sellers
representations and warranties in _Section 4.17_) and/or _Section 2.6_,
and/or (iii) a breach of the representations and warranties contained in
_Sections 3.2_, _3.5_ , _3.6_ and _4.2_.

(c) If the Closing occurs, each Seller, severally, but not jointly, agrees to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the Buyer Indemnitees from and
against any Loss or Claim arising out of or related to the Retained
Liabilities applicable to it.

(d) If the Closing occurs, Lyondell agrees to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless each of the Buyer Indemnitees from and against any Loss or Claim
arising out of or related to a breach of any covenant of Lyondell in _Section
7.5_, _Section 7.7_, _Section 8.1(a)_ and _Section 8.7_.



 

61 EXECUTION VERSION



 

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, if any Loss for
which the Buyer Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement is not clearly applicable to one of the Sellers, then both Sellers
shall be jointly and severally liable for such indemnification obligation.

Section 11.3 _Indemnification Provisions for Benefit of Sellers_. If the
Closing occurs, Buyer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of
the Seller Indemnitees from and against any Losses or Claims actually suffered
or incurred by them arising out of or related to the breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant of Buyer contained in this Agreement. No
Claim may be asserted or commenced against Buyer pursuant to this _Section
11.3_ unless written notice of such Claim is received by Buyer describing in
reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject
matter of such Claim on or prior to the date on which the representation or
warranty or covenant (as applicable) on which such Claim is based ceases to
survive as set forth in _Section 11.1_.

Section 11.4 _Indemnification Procedures; Matters Involving Third Parties_.

(a) A Seller Indemnitee or Buyer Indemnitee, as the case may be (for purposes
of this _Section 11.4_, an " _Indemnified Party_ "), shall give the
indemnifying party under _Section 11.2_ and _Section 11.3_, as applicable
(for purposes of this _Section 11.4_, an " _Indemnifying Party_ "), prompt
written notice of any matter which it has determined has given or could give
rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement stating the amount of
the Loss, if known, and method of computation thereof, containing a reference
to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of
indemnification is claimed or arises; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
failure to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from
its obligations under this _ARTICLE XI_ except to the extent
the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure.

(b) If any third party shall notify an Indemnified Party with respect to any
matter (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") that may give rise to a claim for
indemnification against the Indemnifying Party under this _ARTICLE XI_, then
the Indemnified Party shall promptly (and in any event within five Business
Days after receiving notice of the Third-Party Claim) notify the Indemnifying
Party thereof in writing; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide
such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from its obligations
under this ARTICLE XI except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is
prejudiced by such failure.

(c) For a period of 60 days following notice to it from the Indemnified Party
of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will have the right to assume
and thereafter conduct the defense of the Third-Party Claim (with counsel of
its choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party) by the giving of
notice to the Indemnified Party confirming the obligation of the Indemnifying
Party to hold harmless the Indemnified Party with respect to the Losses
arising from the Third Party Claim; _provided_ , that the Indemnifying Party
will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
with respect to the Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably  



 

62 EXECUTION VERSION



 

 withheld) unless the judgment or proposed settlement involves only the
payment of money damages that will be satisfied in full by the Indemnifying
Party and does not impose an injunction or other equitable relief upon the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates.

(d) Unless and until the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the Third-
Party Claim as provided in _Section 11.4(c)_, the Indemnified Party may
defend against the Third-Party Claim in any manner it may reasonably deem
appropriate.

(e) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim in
accordance with _Section 11.4(c)_, in no event will the Indemnified Party
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect
to the Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party (not to be unreasonably withheld).

Section 11.5 _Determination of Losses_. The Losses giving rise to any
indemnification obligation hereunder shall be limited to the Loss suffered by
the Indemnified Party (i.e., reduced by any insurance proceeds or other
payment or recoupment received, realized or retained by the Indemnified Party
as a result of the events giving rise to the claim for indemnification net of
any expenses related to the receipt of such proceeds, payment or recoupment,
including retrospective premium adjustments, if any, and further reduced by
any reduction in Taxes of the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates occasioned
by such loss or damage). The amount of the indemnity payment shall be
increased to take into account any increase in Taxes of the Indemnified Party
or its Affiliates with respect to the indemnity payment. An Indemnified Party
shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate damages in respect of any claim
for which it is seeking indemnification.

Section 11.6 _Limitations on Liability_. 

(a) BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE REMEDIES SET FORTH IN _ARTICLE
VIII_, _ARTICLE X_ AND THIS  _ARTICLE XI_, INCLUDING THE DEDUCTIBLES,
LIABILITY LIMITS AND SURVIVAL PERIODS SET FORTH ABOVE AND THE DISCLAIMERS SET
FORTH IN _SECTION 6.5_ AND _SECTION 6.6_, ARE INTENDED TO BE, AND SHALL BE,
