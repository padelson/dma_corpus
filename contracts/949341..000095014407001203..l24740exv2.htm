 Section 3.1 _Conversion of Shares._  

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, each share of the Companys common stock, no par value (the " _Common Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ and Dissenting Shares) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive $5.15 in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ ") without any interest thereon. 

  

 (b) Each share of common stock, no par value, of Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of the common stock, no par value, of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (c) All shares of Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any shares of Common Stock owned by Parent, Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or the Company shall, at the Effective Time, be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  

 (d) At the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration without any interest thereon pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the holders immediately prior to the Effective Time of shares of outstanding Common Stock not represented by certificates (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and the holders of certificates that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of outstanding Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Common Stock other than the right to receive, upon surrender of such Book-Entry Shares or Certificates in accordance with _Section 3.2_ , the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, for each such share of Common Stock held by them. 

  

 (e) If at any time between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time any change in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, the amount of the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.1(a)_ shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change. 

  

 Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares._  

  

 (a) At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall deliver, in trust, to a paying agent mutually agreed upon by Parent and the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of 

   ##### 

  

   

the holders of shares of Common Stock and the holders of Stock Options at the
Effective Time, sufficient funds for timely payment of (i) the aggregate
Merger Consideration to be paid pursuant to this _Section 3.2_ in respect of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares, assuming no Dissenting Shares plus (ii)
the aggregate Option Consideration to be paid pursuant to _Section 3.4_ in
respect of the Stock Options (such cash being hereinafter referred to as
the " _Consideration Fund_ "). In the event the Consideration Fund shall be
insufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration contemplated by
_Section 3.1_ and the Option Consideration contemplated by _Section 3.4_,
Parent shall promptly deliver, or cause to be delivered, additional funds to
the Paying Agent in an amount that is equal to the deficiency required to
make such payments. 

  

 (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares whose shares were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1_ (i) a letter of transmittal that shall specify that delivery of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed to have occurred, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration, the form and substance of which letter of transmittal and instructions shall be substantially as reasonably agreed to by the Company and Parent and prepared prior to the Closing. Upon surrender of a Book-Entry Share or a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and with such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Book-Entry Share or Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, subject to any required withholding of Taxes, the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_ , and the Book-Entry Share or Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration payable to holders of Book-Entry Shares or Certificates. If any Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than a Person in whose name the Book-Entry Share or Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Book-Entry Share or Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. 

  

 (c) The Consideration Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Earnings on the Consideration Fund shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and shall be paid to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs. No investment of the Consideration Fund shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from promptly making the payments required by this _Article III_ , and following any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Common Stock at the Effective Time in the amount of such losses, which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Consideration Fund. 

  

 (d) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Common Stock that were outstanding 

   ##### 

  

   

immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article III_ , except as otherwise
provided by Law. 

  

 (e) Any portion of the Consideration Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former shareholders or holders of Stock Options of the Company one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ with respect to such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and any holders of Stock Options shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration in respect thereof. 

  

 (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Paying Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to any Person in respect of cash from the Consideration Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration in respect thereof would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, and any holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share who has not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ with respect thereto shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration in respect thereof. 

  

 (g) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact (such affidavit shall be in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Paying Agent) by the Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which such Person is entitled in respect of such Certificate pursuant to this  _Article III_. 

  

 Section 3.3 _Shares of Dissenting Shareholders._  

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement other than _Section 3.3(b)_ to the contrary, any shares of Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a shareholder who is entitled to dissent from the Merger under Sections 60.551 to 60.594 of the OBCA and who has exercised, when and in the manner required by Sections 60.551 to 60.594 of the OBCA to the extent so required prior to the Effective Time, such right to dissent and to obtain payment of the fair value of such shares under Sections 60.551 to 60.594 of the OBCA in connection with the Merger (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration unless and until such shareholder shall have effectively withdrawn or lost (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such shareholders right to obtain payment of the fair value of such shareholders Dissenting Shares under Sections 60.551 to 60.594 of the OBCA, but shall instead be entitled only to such rights with respect to such Dissenting Shares as may be granted to such shareholder under Sections 60.551 to 60.594 of the OBCA. From and after the Effective Time, Dissenting Shares 

   ##### 

  

   

shall not be entitled to vote for any purpose or be entitled to the payment of
dividends or other distributions (except dividends or other distributions
payable to shareholders of record prior to the Effective Time). The Company
shall promptly provide any notices of dissent to Parent. 

  

 (b) If any shareholder who holds Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such shareholders right to obtain payment of the fair value of such shareholders Dissenting Shares under Sections 60.551 to 60.594 of the OBCA, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such effective withdrawal or loss, such shareholders shares of Common Stock shall no longer be Dissenting Shares and, if the occurrence of such effective withdrawal or loss is later than the Effective Time, shall be treated as if they had as of the Effective Time been converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, as set forth in subsection (a) of _Section 3.1_ or converted or cancelled in accordance with subsections (b) or (c) of _Section 3.1_, as applicable. 

  

 Section 3.4 _Treatment of Stock Options_. 

  

 (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement and to the extent necessary, the board of directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Option Plans) shall adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as are required to adjust the terms of options to purchase shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the Company Option Plans (excluding any purchase rights issuable pursuant to the ESPP) that are outstanding at the Effective Time (" _Stock Options_ "), to provide that each Stock Option, whether or not vested or exercisable prior to the Effective Time or as a result of the Merger, shall (i) at the Effective Time immediately be converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to (A) the number of shares subject to the Stock Option multiplied by (B) the Merger Consideration, less the applicable Stock Option exercise price per share of Common Stock subject to such Stock Option, provided that this amount is greater than zero, and less any applicable tax withholding obligations, and (ii) otherwise terminate at the Effective Time. Immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall promptly pay or cause to be paid to the holders of Stock Options the consideration as provided in this _Section 3.4_. 

  

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, no holder of a Stock Option shall have any right to acquire equity of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Parent or any of their respective affiliates.

In addition, nothing herein shall restrict the Company from complying with its disclosure obligations with regard to any Acquisition Proposal under applicable Law. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) The Company will promptly notify Parent of the receipt by the Company of any oral or written proposal or offer or any inquiry or contact with any person regarding a potential proposal or offer regarding an Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the Person or Persons making such Acquisition Proposal and the material terms of the Acquisition Proposal.

 (d) Subject to _Section 6.3(e)_, unless and until this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _Section 8.1_, the Company shall not withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to the Parent or Sub, the approval or recommendation of the Merger as set forth in _Section 6.7_; or approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that, prior to the Company Special Meeting, the Companys board of directors receives a Superior Proposal that has not been withdrawn, the Companys board of directors may, if the Companys board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its counsel, that the failure to take such action may be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, withdraw, withhold or modify the approval or recommendation of the Merger (a " _Change of Recommendation_ "), approve or recommend such Superior Proposal or terminate this Agreement as permitted pursuant to the terms of _Section 8.1(b)(iv)_ or _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_; _provided_ that: 

   

 (i) the Company notifies the Parent that it intends to take such action, which notice must identify the party making such proposal and set forth the material terms and conditions of such proposal; and 

   

 (ii) Parent shall not have proposed, within three (3) Business Days after receipt of such notice from the Company, to amend this Agreement to provide for terms the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor, to be as favorable as or superior to those of the Superior Proposal. 

  

 (f) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.3_ shall prohibit the Company or its board of directors from taking and disclosing to the Companys shareholders a position with respect to a tender offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from taking any action or making any disclosure required by applicable Law; _provided_ that the content of the disclosure complies with this _Section 6.3_. 

  

 Section 6.4 _Employee Benefits._  

  

 (a) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide the employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries who remain employed by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their subsidiaries after the Effective Time (the " _Employees_ ") with employee benefits that are in the aggregate no less favorable to each Employee than those maintained from time to time by Parent or its Subsidiaries (including 

   ##### 

  

    

without limitation the Surviving Corporation) for similarly-situated employees
of Parent or its Subsidiaries. 

  

 (b) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall honor or cause to be honored, in accordance with their terms, all written employment, employment termination, severance and other compensation agreements, including agreements providing for change-in-control, severance or retention benefits, scheduled on _Section 6.4(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_, in each case in the form existing immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement. _Section 6.4(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth the Companys informal severance guidelines for its employees not otherwise benefiting from a severance provision in an agreement set forth in  _Section 6.4(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule._ Parent shall cause each Employee terminated within one (1) year after the Effective Time to receive severance in accordance with such guidelines.

Each Parent Plan shall waive eligibility waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements and pre-existing condition limitations to the extent waived or not applicable under the applicable Benefit Plan. The Employees shall be given credit under the applicable Parent Plan for amounts paid prior to the Effective Time during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs under a corresponding Benefit Plan for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Parent Plan. 

  

 (d) The ESPP has been or will be suspended at or prior to February 14, 2007. The ESPP shall be terminated for all purposes immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 6.5 _Publicity_. The initial press release by each of Parent and the Company with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be acceptable to Parent and the Company. Neither the Company nor Parent (nor any of their respective Affiliates) shall issue any other press release or make any other public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior agreement of the other party, except as may be required by Law or by any listing agreement with a national securities exchange, in which case the party proposing to issue such press release or make such public announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before making any such public announcements; _provided_ that the Company will no longer be required to obtain the prior agreement of or consult with Parent in connection with any such press release or public announcement if the Companys board of directors has effected a Change of Recommendation.

 Section 6.6 _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification._ 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless the individuals who at any time prior to the Effective Time were directors or officers of the Company or any of its present or former Subsidiaries or corporate parents (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities in connection with actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) to the fullest extent permitted by Law, and Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted by Law. The articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain the provisions with respect to indemnification and advancement of expenses set forth in the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Company on the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties, unless such modification is required by Law. 

  

 (b) Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect for not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries for the Indemnified Parties and any other employees, agents or other individuals otherwise covered by such insurance policies prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Insured Parties_ ") with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); _provided_ that in lieu of the purchase of such insurance by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the Company may at its option prior to the Effective Time purchase a six-year run-off (Extended Reporting Period) program for directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance. 

  

 (c) This _Section 6.6_ is intended to benefit the Insured Parties and the Indemnified Parties, and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent, Sub, the Company and the Surviving Corporation. Parent hereby guarantees the payment and performance by the Surviving Corporation of the indemnification and other obligations pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ and the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys a majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors, assigns and transferees of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their respective successors or assigns, as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.6_. 

  

 Section 6.7 _Proxy Statement_. The Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable Law and its articles of incorporation and bylaws and Nasdaq rules to call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of the Companys shareholders (including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the " _Company Special Meeting_ ") as soon as practicable following the date hereof for the purpose of approving this Agreement and, in 

   ##### 

  

    

connection with the Company Special Meeting, as soon as practicable after the
date hereof the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Proxy
Statement_ ") relating to the Merger and this Agreement and furnish the
information required to be provided to the shareholders of the Company
pursuant to the OBCA and the Exchange Act, which Proxy Statement shall be
reasonably satisfactory to Parent. Promptly after its preparation and prior
to its filing with the SEC, the Company shall provide a copy of the Proxy
Statement, and any amendment to the Proxy Statement, to Parent, and will
consider inclusion into the Proxy Statement comments timely received from
Parent or its counsel. The Company shall give Parent notice of any comments
on the Proxy Statement received by the SEC, and shall promptly respond to SEC
comments, if any. Unless this Agreement is previously terminated
in accordance with _Section 8.1_, the Proxy Statement shall include the
recommendation of the Companys board of directors that the Companys
shareholders approve this Agreement (the " _Company Recommendation_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Companys board of directors determines
in good faith, after consultation with its counsel, that calling,
giving notice of, convening or holding the Company Special Meeting, or
preparing and distributing the Proxy Statement, or including a Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement may be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law following an indication of an
Acquisition Proposal, the Company may delay any such action until the
Companys board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with its counsel, that it may take such action. 

  

 Section 6.8 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts._

relating thereto, and giving the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and conferences (to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity or private party); (vii) avoid the entry of, or have

defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the

additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated

Parents freedom of action with respect to its ability to retain the Company
and its Subsidiaries or any portion thereof or any of Parents or its
Affiliates other assets or business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
the Company, Parent or Sub shall be obligated to use its commercially
reasonable efforts or take any action pursuant to this _Section 6.8(a)_ if
in the opinion of its board of directors after consultation with its outside
counsel such actions would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary
duties to their respective shareholders under, or otherwise
violate, applicable Law. 

  

 (b) Each of the Company, Parent and Sub shall give prompt notice to the other parties of (i) any written notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and (ii) any change or development that is reasonably likely to result in a material breach of a representation, warranty or covenant under this Agreement.

Parent agrees that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall (i) continue, through at least March 31, 2007, to recruit and assess applicants for applicable employment positions with the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to Department of Labor recruiting requirements with respect to "green card" applicants and (ii) deliver any required reports related thereto to the Department of Labor. If the Closing shall have occurred prior to March 31, 2007, Parent and Sub shall continue such recruiting and assessment activities from the Effective Time through at least March 31, 2007, without interruption, and deliver any required reports. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any such activities shall not be deemed a violation of this Agreement, including without limitation Section 6.1.

 (b) each of Parent and Sub shall have performed in all material respects all of the respective obligations hereunder required to be performed by Parent or Sub, as the case may be, at or prior to the Closing; 

  

 (c) the Company shall have received a certificate signed by the chief financial officer of Parent, dated as of the Closing Date, to the effect that, to the knowledge of such officer, the conditions set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ and _Section 7.3(a)_ have been satisfied; and 

  

 (d) Parent shall have delivered to the Company a certificate, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to the effect that, at the Effective Time, after giving effect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, none of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries will (i) be insolvent (either because the financial condition is such that the sum of its debts is greater than the fair value of its assets or because the present fair saleable value of its assets will be less than the amount required to pay its probable liability on its debts as they become absolute and matured), (ii) have unreasonably small capital with which to engage in its business or (iii) have incurred or plan to incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they become absolute and matured. 

  

 Section 7.4 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. None of the Company, Parent or Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in  _Section 7.1_, _Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.3_, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure was caused by such partys failure to act in good faith or use its commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as required by and subject to _Section 6.8(a)_. 

  

ARTICLE VIII

 (ii) if any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over the Company, Parent or Sub shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action, in each case permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger substantially as contemplated by this Agreement, and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and non-appealable, unless the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ shall not have complied with its obligations under _Section 6.8(a)_; 

   

 (iii) if the Company Special Meeting shall have concluded without the approval of this Agreement by the Companys shareholders having been obtained in accordance with the OBCA; or
