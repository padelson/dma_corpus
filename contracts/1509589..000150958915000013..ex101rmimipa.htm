manage all aspects of the Work.

(b) In order to earn the entire Drilling Incentive Amount (subject to any

in the event that Seller does not meet the Drilling Commitment by the

Buyer shall, to the extent such Drilling Incentive Payments set forth therein

funds to the account designated in writing by Seller. The Drilling Incentive
Payments shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all U.S.
federal and applicable state income Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by
applicable Legal Requirement. In no event shall the aggregate Drilling
Incentive Payments exceed the Drilling Incentive Amount.

following any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement, and

contrary to the intent of the Parties hereto as expressed in this Section
3.03, any Tax Authority makes or proposes an allocation different from the

with each other in good faith to contest such Tax Authority's allocation (or
proposed allocation); provided, however, that after consultation with the
Party adversely affected by such allocation (or proposed allocation), the

reasonably required to protect its interests; and provided further, that no
Party shall be unreasonably impeded in its ability and discretion to
negotiate, compromise and/or settle any Tax audit, claim or similar
proceedings in connection with such allocation.

not deduct or withhold any amount for Taxes under Code Section 1445(a) and
Colo. Rev. Stat. § 39-22-604.5, and shall not otherwise withhold any amount of

through Seller's or the Company's banking representatives, or management

information, and that Buyer will not have any right or remedy arising out of
any such representation, warranty or other projections, forecasts, estimates,
appraisals, statements, promises, advice, data or information and (ii) any
Claims that any Buyer Indemnified Party may have for breach of any
representation or warranty shall be based solely on the representations and
warranties expressly set forth in Article V or Article VI.

waived, or (ii) Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.03(a),
and at the time of such assertion Buyer has no existing right to assert

ARTICLE IX 

SURVIVAL

9.01 Survival. The representations and warranties in this Agreement shall
survive Closing until the date that is twelve (12) months following the
Closing Date; provided, that the representations and warranties set forth in
(a) Sections 5.01, 5.02, 5.03, 5.04, 5.06, 6.01, 6.02, 6.03, 6.04, 6.05, 6.13,
6.21, 7.01, 7.02 and 7.06 (collectively, the "Fundamental Representations"
shall survive for the following periods: (i) the representation and warranty
set forth in Section 5.02 shall survive indefinitely; and (ii) the other
Fundamental Representations shall survive until sixty (60) days after the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect thereto. A
Buyer Indemnified Party seeking a remedy pursuant to Section 10.01 for a
breach of a representation or warranty must commence a Claim with respect to
such a breach within the survival period noted above. In the event that such a
Claim for indemnification is properly brought under Section 10.01 within the
survival period, the survival period under this Section with respect to the
breach of the applicable representation or warranty shall be deemed to toll,
with respect to such Claim only, until such Claim is ultimately resolved by a
written instrument executed by each of the Parties or finally resolved by a
court of competent jurisdiction. If a Buyer Indemnified Party fails to
commence a Claim arising from the breach of a representation or warranty
hereunder within the survival period, such Buyer Indemnified Party shall be
deemed to have waived such Claim and all Damages related thereto. All
covenants and agreements contained herein shall remain in full force and
effect until



all obligations with respect thereto shall have been performed or satisfied or
shall have been terminated in accordance with their terms.

ARTICLE X 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES

10.01 Indemnification.

(a) Subject to the survival provisions set forth in Article IX, from and after
Closing, Seller shall indemnify, defend, hold harmless and release Buyer, its
Affiliates, and its and their respective directors, officers, employees, legal
counsel, financial advisors and agents (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified
Parties") from and against any and all Damages that arise out of, result from
or are payable as a result of the following:

(i) the breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in Article V
or Article VI of this Agreement and in any certificate delivered by Seller at
Closing;

(ii) the failure of Seller to perform any covenant or obligation hereunder
that is required to be performed by Seller after Closing;

(iii) any and all Seller Taxes; and

(iv) those matters set forth on Exhibit B.

(b) Subject to the survival provisions set forth in Article IX, from and after
Closing, Buyer shall indemnify, defend, hold harmless and release Seller, its
Affiliates, and its and their respective directors, officers, employees, legal
counsel, financial advisors and agents (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified
Parties") from and against any and all Damages that arise out of, result from
or are payable as a result of the following:

(i) the breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer in Article VII
of this Agreement and in any certificate delivered by Buyer at Closing; and

(ii) the failure of Buyer to perform any covenant or obligation hereunder that
is required to be performed by Buyer after Closing.

(c) Limitations on Indemnity for Representations and Warranties.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to
the exclusions set forth in the following sentence, Seller shall not be
obligated to indemnify, defend, hold harmless or release the Buyer Indemnified
Parties for any Damages pursuant to Section 10.01(a)(i) to the extent (A) the
amount of such Damages does not exceed $50,000 per individual event or
circumstance (the "Threshold"), (B) the aggregate amount of such Damages
suffered or incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties does not exceed one
percent (1%) of the Seller Closing Amount (the "Deductible") and then only to
the extent of such excess and (C) the aggregate amount of all Damages suffered
or incurred by the Buyer



Indemnified Parties exceeds ten percent (10%) of the Seller Closing Amount
(the "Cap"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Threshold, the Deductible and
the Cap shall not apply to Damages based on fraud or breach of a Fundamental
Representation; provided that the maximum aggregate liability of Seller for
Damages arising out of breach of a Fundamental Representation shall be limited
to the Seller Closing Amount (and any Deferred Consideration or Drilling
Incentive Payments actually received by Seller at the time such Claim being
adjudicated). The Parties acknowledge and agree that the intent of this
Section 10.01(c), and this Agreement, is that all liability and responsibility
for Damages amounts below the Threshold for individual events or
circumstances, Damages amounts below the Deductible in the aggregate and
Damages amounts exceeding the Cap in the aggregate with respect to the matters
set forth in Section 10.01(a)(i) above shall be borne by Buyer.

(ii) The Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate or resolve any Claims subject to indemnification under this Section
10.01. In the event that the Indemnified Party shall fail to make such
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any claim or liability,
then notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained herein, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be required to indemnify any Person for any
Damages that could reasonably be expected to have been avoided if the
Indemnified Party had made such efforts.

(iii) The amount of any and all Damages under this Section 10.01 will be
determined net of any insurance or other recoveries actually received by an
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates from third Persons in connection with the
facts giving rise to the right of indemnification (in each case, calculated
net of reasonable third party out-of-pocket costs and expenses of such
recoveries but not including any costs or expenses attributable to increases
in insurance premiums).

(iv) No Indemnifying Party will be liable hereunder in respect of any Claim if
such Claim would not have arisen but for a change in Legal Requirements.

(v) No Buyer Indemnified Party will be entitled to any indemnification under
this Section 10.01 for any Damage to the extent any such Damage (i) was taken
into account in determining the Purchase Price and (ii) as of the date of this
Agreement is set forth in any Disclosure Schedule.

(d) In the event that any Claim for which Seller, on the one hand, or Buyer,
on the other hand (each an "Indemnifying Party"), would be liable to the other
Party or another Person indemnified under this Section 10.01 (each
collectively, an "Indemnified Party") is asserted against or sought to be
collected from such Indemnified Party by a non-Affiliate third Person, the
Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such Claim
promptly after becoming aware of such Claim, specifying the nature of and
specific basis for such Claim and the amount or the estimated amount thereof
to the extent then feasible (the "Claim Notice"); provided, however, that no
failure or delay in the giving of such Claim Notice shall relieve the
Indemnifying Party of any Liability hereunder, except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such omission or delay. The
Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from the delivery of the Claim
Notice (the "Notice Period") to notify the Indemnified Party whether or not it
desires,



at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to defend the
Indemnified Party against such Claim; provided, however, that any Indemnified
Party is hereby authorized during the Notice Period, after giving additional
notice to the Indemnifying Party, to file any motion, answer or other pleading
necessary to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and not
prejudicial to the defense of such Claim. If the Indemnifying Party notifies
the Indemnified Party within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the
Indemnified Party against such Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall, at
its own expense, assume the defense of any such Claim either directly or
through its insurer. In such case, but subject to Section 10.01(e) below, the
Indemnifying Party shall control the course of and make all decisions
concerning any such proceeding, select and employ counsel, and settle or
prosecute such proceeding to a final conclusion, and the Indemnified Party may
participate in, but not control, any such defense or settlement at its own
cost and with its own counsel, and if requested by the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its
counsel in contesting any Claim that the Indemnifying Party elects to contest,
or, if appropriate and related to the Claim in question, in making any
counterclaim against the Person asserting the third-party Claim, or any cross-
complaint against any Person. To the extent the Indemnifying Party elects not
to assume the defense of any Claim for which it has an indemnity obligation
under this Section 10.01, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
defend, and be reimbursed for its reasonable cost and expense incurred (but
only if and to the extent the Indemnified Party is actually entitled to
indemnification hereunder) in regard to such Claim with counsel selected by
the Indemnified Party (who shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnifying Party), by all appropriate proceedings. In such circumstances,
the Indemnified Party shall defend such Claim in good faith and have full
control of such defense and proceedings; provided, however, that the
Indemnified Party may not enter into any compromise or settlement of such
Claim, if indemnification is to be sought hereunder, without the Indemnifying
Party's consent. Additionally, in such circumstances, the Indemnifying Party
may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement controlled by
the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 10.01(d), and the Indemnifying
Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such
participation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall
not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any
settlement of any pending proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party
is a party, unless (A) such settlement includes a full and unconditional
release of such Indemnified Party from all liability on Claims that are the
subject matter of such proceeding, (B) such settlement does not contain any
admission of wrongdoing or illegal conduct and (C) the Indemnifying Party has
agreed in writing that it is liable to pay the full amount of the settlement
to the extent pertaining to such Indemnified Party.

(e) If a Party becomes an Indemnified Party, it shall, at the Indemnifying
Party's expense, cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and permit the
Indemnifying Party reasonable access to the Indemnified Party's books,
records, facilities and employees for the purpose of permitting the
Indemnifying Party to perform its obligations under this Section 10.01;
provided, however, that the Indemnified Party shall not be required to
disclose to the Indemnifying Party any documents or correspondence covered by
the attorney-client privilege or the work product doctrine, except pursuant to
a joint defense agreement. To the extent that any documents or correspondence
are covered by the attorney-client privilege or the work product doctrine, the
Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party if the Indemnified Party
seeks to protect such privilege with respect to third parties. The Indemnified
Party shall disclose to the Indemnifying Party the non-privileged



contents of any such documents or correspondence. If requested by the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall
negotiate in good faith a joint defense agreement with respect to the matter
that is the subject of the privileged communication or work product.

(f) Any payments made to any Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 10.01
shall constitute a further adjustment of the Purchase Price (as adjusted
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement) for Tax purposes and shall be treated
as such by Buyer and Seller on their Tax Returns to the extent permitted by
Legal Requirements. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
Buyer shall be permitted to offset any amounts owed pursuant to this Agreement
against Damages owed by Seller to Buyer pursuant to this Section 10.01.

10.02 Exclusive Remedy Post-Closing. From and after Closing, Section 10.01
shall be the exclusive remedy of both Parties for monetary Damages with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and each of
the Parties hereby waives any other Claim, cause of action, or remedy for
monetary Damages that it might assert against the other, whether under
statutory or common law, or any other Legal Requirement; provided that nothing
in this Section 10.02 shall prevent either Party from (a) seeking specific
performance, injunctive and/or similar equitable relief for Claims of breach
or failure to perform covenants performable under this Agreement at any time
after Closing or (b) pursuing, and recovering in respect of, any Claim based
on actual fraud.

10.03 Cooperation and Preservation of Books and Records. The Parties recognize
that the Parties and their respective Affiliates may need access, from time to
time, after the Closing Date, to certain accounting and Tax records and
information held by the other Parties; therefore, the Parties shall (a)
properly retain and maintain such records until the thirtieth (30th) day
following the last date on which the period to which such records relate is
subject to audit by any Governmental Entity, and (b) subject to the right of
each Party to refrain from disclosing or making available any proprietary
information, any written or oral communications that are subject to the
attorney-client privilege and any documents that are covered by the work
product doctrine, allow the requesting Party and its respective agents and
other representatives, at times and dates mutually acceptable to the Parties,
to inspect, review, and make copies of such records as the requesting Party
may deem necessary or appropriate from time to time for use in connection with
the preparation of Tax Returns or in connection with any lawsuit, Claim or Tax
audit relating to the Company. Such inspection, review and copying of records
shall be conducted during normal business hours and at the requesting Party's
expense.

10.04 Investigation of Books and Records. Buyer's closing of the transactions
contemplated hereby will constitute Buyer's acknowledgment that it has had, to
Buyer's actual knowledge, with the requirement of reasonable investigation or
inquiry, prior to the Closing Date, access to the Assets, the books and
records of the Company and the officers and employees of the Company to its
full and complete satisfaction. Buyer hereby further acknowledges that in
making the decision to enter into this Agreement and consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, it is relying solely on its own independent
investigation and due diligence and the express representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements of Seller set forth in this Agreement. Except for
such express representations and warranties, Seller makes no representation or
warranty of any



kind as to the books and records of the Company, any information contained
therein or any other information provided to Buyer by or on behalf of Seller,
the Company. Buyer agrees that any conclusions drawn from the books and
records of the Company are and shall be the result of its own independent
review and judgment.

10.05 Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY HERETO BE LIABLE
HEREUNDER FOR EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, INDIRECT, SPECIAL INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR LOST PROFITS OF ANY KIND, ARISING DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY FROM, INCIDENT TO, OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THIS AGREEMENT,
REGARDLESS OF SOLE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR DEFECT IN
PREMISES, EQUIPMENT OR MATERIAL, AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER PRE-EXISTING THIS
AGREEMENT, EXCEPT THIS WAIVER SHALL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT SUCH EXEMPLARY,
PUNITIVE, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR LOST
PROFITS ARE ASSERTED BY A THIRD PARTY AGAINST AN INDEMNIFIED PARTY.

10.06 Disclaimers. Buyer acknowledges that, except as expressly set forth
herein, (a) SELLER HAS NOT MADE AND BY THE DOCUMENTS OF CONVEYANCE AND
TRANSFER TO BE EXECUTED PURSUANT HERETO SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO HAVE MADE, AND
(b) SELLER HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS AND NEGATES, ANY REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING (i) ANY IMPLIED
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO THE CONDITION, MERCHANTABILITY, USAGE, NON-
INFRINGEMENT, SUITABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND (ii) ANY
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO (1) CONTRACTUAL, ECONOMIC OR FINANCIAL
INFORMATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE ASSETS AND PROPERTIES OF THE COMPANY, (2) ANY
PROJECTIONS, FORECASTS, BUSINESS PLANS OR BUDGET INFORMATION, (3) THE
CONTINUED FINANCIAL VIABILITY OR PRODUCTIVITY OF THE ASSETS AND PROPERTIES OF
THE COMPANY, (4) THE ENVIRONMENTAL OR PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE ASSETS AND
PROPERTIES OF THE COMPANY, OR (5) TITLE TO THE ASSETS AND PROPERTIES OF THE
COMPANY.

10.07 Tax Matters.

(a) Tax Treatment. The Parties agree to treat the purchase and sale of the
Purchased Equity described in Section 2.01 for U.S. federal and applicable
state income tax purposes as a purchase and sale of all of the Assets and the
Transferred Assets. No Party shall take any position (whether in a Tax Return,
an audit, or otherwise) that is inconsistent with the foregoing provisions of
this Section 10.07(a) unless required to do so by applicable Legal
Requirements.

(b) Liability for Taxes.

(i) Seller Tax Liabilities. Following the Closing Date, Seller will be
allocated and bear all Taxes imposed on the Company or for which the Company
may otherwise be liable and all Transferred Asset Taxes with respect to the
following (the "Seller Tax



Liabilities"): (A) any Pre-Closing Tax Period and (B) the portion of any
Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date as determined
pursuant to Section 10.07(b)(iii).

(ii) Buyer Tax Liabilities. Following the Closing Date, Buyer will be
allocated and bear all Taxes imposed on the Company and all Transferred Asset
Taxes with respect to the following: (A) any taxable period that begins after
the Closing Date and (B) the portion of any Straddle Period beginning after
the Closing Date as determined pursuant to Section 10.07(b)(iii).

(iii) Straddle Period Tax Liability. The Taxes of the Company and any
Transferred Asset Taxes, if any, attributable to a Straddle Period shall be
allocated to Seller for the portion of such Straddle Period ending on and
including the Closing Date, and to Buyer for the portion of such Straddle
Period beginning after the Closing Date. For purposes of this Section
10.07(b)(iii), the Parties agree to use the following conventions for
determining the amount of Taxes of the Company attributable to the portion of
the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and the portion
of the Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date: (A) in the case of
any real property, personal property, ad valorem and similar Taxes, the amount
attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including the
Closing Date shall be determined by multiplying the amount of such Taxes for
the Straddle Period by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
days in the Tax period ending on and including the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period, and the
remainder shall be the amount attributable to the portion of the Straddle
Period beginning after the Closing Date and (B) in the case of all other Taxes
not described in clause (A) above, including a Tax that is an income Tax or
that is a business activity tax otherwise based on gross income, sales or
gross receipts, revenue, production or other specific transactions, (I) the
amount attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and
including the Closing Date shall be determined as if the Company filed a Tax
Return with respect to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and
including the Closing Date using a "closing of the books" methodology and
using elections, methods of accounting, and other factors consistent with
prior years' Tax Returns; provided, however, that exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and
amortization deductions) shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on and including the Closing Date based on the ratio that the
number of days in the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date
bears to the total number of days in the Straddle Period and (II) the
remainder of the Tax shall be the amount attributable to the portion of the
Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date.

(iv) Payment of Seller Tax Liabilities. As between Buyer and Seller, Seller
Tax Liabilities initially shall be paid by Seller by either: (A) paying such
Tax with the filing of the Tax Return, if required, with respect to which the
Tax is reported where the responsibility to prepare and file such Tax Return
is assigned to Seller under this Agreement or (B) paying an amount to Buyer as
provided in Section 10.07(c)(ii) where the responsibility to prepare and file
the Tax Return with respect to which the Tax is reported is assigned to Buyer.



(c) Tax Returns. Except as otherwise provided in Section 10.07(f):

(i) Tax Returns for Pre-Closing Tax Periods. Seller shall prepare or cause to
be prepared and timely file or cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns of the
Company required to be filed for Pre-Closing Tax Periods, provided that Buyer
shall cause the Company to execute any such Tax Return if reasonably requested
to do so by Seller. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed in a manner
consistent with past practice of the Company, except as otherwise required by
applicable Legal Requirement, and Seller will timely pay or cause to be timely
paid all Taxes due on Tax Returns prepared pursuant to this Section
10.07(c)(i) to the extent that such Taxes constitute Seller Taxes. Buyer shall
provide (or cause to be provided) to Seller any information reasonably
requested by Seller relating to the Company within its possession to
facilitate the preparation and filing of the Tax Returns described in this
Section 10.07(c)(i). Reasonably in advance of the due date for filing any such
Tax Return required to be filed after the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver a
copy of such Tax Return, together with all supporting documentation and
workpapers, to Buyer for its review, comment and approval, such approval not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(ii) Tax Returns for Straddle Periods. Buyer shall prepare or cause to be
prepared and timely file or cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns of the
Company required to be filed for all Straddle Periods. Such Tax Returns shall
be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with past practice of the
Company, except as otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirement. The
Taxes due for Straddle Periods shall be allocated between Seller and Buyer as
provided in Section 10.07(b)(iii). Buyer shall provide Seller with copies of
any such completed Tax Returns for its review, comment and approval, such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Not later
than three (3) days prior to the due date for the payment of Taxes with
respect to any such Tax Return, payment shall be made by Seller to Buyer of
the amount of such Taxes allocated to Seller in accordance with Section
10.07(b)(iii), and Buyer shall then pay all Taxes due on such Tax Returns.

(iii) Other Tax Returns. Seller shall timely file or cause to be filed all Tax
Returns due after the Closing Date that remit sales and use Taxes and other
transaction-based Taxes collected by the Company from customers on or prior to
the Closing Date.

(iv) Amendments to Tax Returns. Unless required by applicable Legal
Requirements, Buyer shall not, and shall not cause or permit the Company to,
amend or modify any Tax Return of the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
or Straddle Period without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Buyer may amend or modify any such Tax Return of the Company
even if not required by applicable Legal Requirements without the consent of
Seller provided that (i) any additional Taxes resulting therefrom will not
constitute Seller Tax Liabilities, (ii) such amendment or modification does
not cause, and is not likely to cause, Seller to be liable to any Governmental
Entity for any additional Taxes and (iii) such amendment or modification does
not state,



acknowledge or otherwise indicate that Seller is liable to any Governmental
Entity for any Taxes in addition to those for which Seller acknowledged
liability in such Tax Return prior to such amendment or modification.

(d) Tax Refunds. Seller shall be entitled to all refunds and credits of Taxes
of the Company (including refunds and credits arising by reason of amended Tax

Straddle Period allocated to Seller pursuant to Section 10.07(b)(iii)). Upon
the request of Seller, and at Seller's sole cost and expense, Buyer shall file
(or cause to be filed) all Tax Returns (including amended Tax Returns) or
other documents claiming any refunds to which Seller is entitled pursuant to
this Section 10.07(d); provided, however, that Buyer shall not be required to
file or cause to be filed any Tax Return (including any amended Tax Return) if
filing such Tax Return would result in an increase in the Taxes of the Company
or Buyer for taxable periods or portions thereof beginning after the Closing
Date, unless Seller agrees to indemnify Buyer for such increase in Taxes.
Buyer shall be entitled to all refunds and credits of Taxes of the Company
with respect to any taxable period or portion thereof (determined in
accordance with Section 10.07(b)(iii)) beginning after the Closing Date. Each
Party shall forward, and shall cause its Affiliates to forward, to the Party
entitled to receive a refund or credit of Tax pursuant to this Section
10.07(d) the amount of such refund or credit within five (5) days after the

its Affiliates in procuring such refund or credit.

agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to the other, upon written request,
such information (including access to books and records of the Company (as
well as the timely provision of powers of attorney or similar authorizations))
and assistance as is reasonably necessary (i) for the filing of any Tax Return
for a Pre-Closing Tax Period (including Buyer making officers of the Company
available to sign Tax Returns) or otherwise relating to any of the payments to
be made pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) for the making of any election
relating to Taxes, (iii) for the preparation for any audit or responding to
any information document requests (or other requests for information,
materials or documents) in connection with any audit, and (iv) for the

adjustment with respect to Taxes. Such assistance shall include making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanations of any material provided hereunder. If assistance
from employees ("Employee Assistance") or the provision of information,
materials or documents ("Required Materials") is required in connection with
an audit or the prosecution or defense of any Tax Claim, Seller and Buyer
shall each designate a representative for the coordination of Employee
Assistance and the delivery of Required Materials with respect to such audit
or Tax Claim. Each time Employee Assistance and the delivery of Required
Materials is required, the designated representatives shall discuss the
required Employee Assistance and Required Materials, and agree by e-mail on
reasonable time periods for the provision of such Employee Assistance or the
delivery of such Required Materials. Buyer and Seller shall retain all books
and records of the Company with respect to Taxes for a period of at least
seven (7) years following Closing. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with each
other in the conduct of any Tax Claim and all other Tax matters involving



the Company and each shall execute and deliver such powers of attorney and
other documents as are necessary to carry out the intent of this Agreement.

(f) Transfer Taxes. Any Transfer Taxes incurred as a result of (i) the
transfer of the Purchased Equity pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid one-
half by Buyer and one-half by Seller and (ii) the transfer of the Transferred

paid 100% by Seller. The party required by applicable Legal Requirements to
file a Tax Return with respect to such Transfer Taxes shall timely prepare,
with the other party's cooperation, and file such Tax Return. If Seller files
any such Tax Return, Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller for Buyer's share
of any Transfer Taxes allocated to Buyer in accordance with this Section
10.07(f) but paid by Seller in connection with the filing of such Tax Return.
Each of Buyer and Seller agree to timely sign and deliver (or to cause to be
timely signed and delivered) such certificates or forms as may be necessary or
appropriate and otherwise to cooperate to establish any available exemption
from (or otherwise reduce) any such Transfer Taxes.

(g) Tax Claim Provisions.

(i) Each of Buyer and Seller shall, within twenty (20) Business Days, notify
the other in writing upon receipt by it (or any of its respective Affiliates)
of any notice of assessment, official inquiry, examination, proceeding or
other claim with respect to Taxes of the Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period
or Straddle Period ("Tax Claims").

(ii) Seller shall control and make all decisions required with respect to any
Tax Claim relating exclusively to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and shall keep
Buyer informed regarding the progress and substantive aspects of any such Tax
Claim. Buyer shall be entitled to participate (at its expense) in any such Tax
Claim. Without limiting the foregoing, Seller (A) may select advisors with
respect to such Tax Claim (including counsel), (B) may, in its sole
discretion, pursue or forego any conferences with any Tax Authority,
administrative appeals and court proceedings, and (C) may, in its sole
discretion, either pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund where applicable
Legal Requirements permit such refund suits or contest the Tax Claim in any
permissible manner. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller
shall not settle or compromise any such Tax Claim without the prior written
consent of Buyer, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(iii) In the case of a Tax Claim for a Straddle Period, Buyer and Seller shall
jointly control such Tax Claim. Each of Buyer and Seller shall be entitled to
participate (at its expense) in any such Tax Claim, and shall keep the other
Party informed regarding the progress and substantive aspects of any such Tax
Claim. Neither Buyer nor Seller may settle or compromise any such Tax Claim
for any Taxes for which the other Party (or its Affiliates) may be liable
without the prior written consent of such Party, not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(iv) In the event of conflict between any of the provisions of this Section
10.07(g) and Section 10.01(d), the provisions of this Section 10.07(g) shall
control.

Buyer true, correct and complete copies of each such employment or consulting
agreement, as well as any other agreement providing for severance or any
"change in control" payment or benefit for any Business Employee. Except as
set forth in any such employment, consulting, severance, or change-in-control
agreement, neither Seller or any Affiliate has made any binding commitment
(written or otherwise) to any Business Employee or independent contractor

Business Employee, as applicable, Buyer shall be entitled to review copies of
the personnel records maintained by Seller with respect to such Business
Employee, and discuss such records and such Business Employee with Seller's
representatives. Buyer's interviews of the Business Employees as set forth in
this Section 10.08 shall be conducted so as not to unreasonably interfere with
the business of Seller, the Company or their respective Affiliates prior to
Closing.

(c) After the date hereof, Buyer shall be authorized to communicate with any
Business Employee regarding such Business Employee's potential employment with
Buyer and Buyer shall be authorized to communicate any offer of employment to
any Business Employees. Buyer shall, not later than five (5) days prior to the
later of the Closing or the Transition End Date, deliver to Seller a final
written list containing the name of each Business Employee Buyer desires to
hire. Each Business Employee that is offered employment with Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer and that accepts such offer and report to work with Buyer
or an Affiliate of Buyer as contemplated herein (each a "Continuing Employee"
and, collectively, the "Continuing Employees") shall, as of the later of the
Closing or the Transition End Date, be terminated by Seller, or its Affiliate,
as applicable, and become an employee of Buyer; provided, however, that any
such Business Employee who is on a leave of absence or otherwise not actively
at work on Closing or the Transition End Date, as applicable (an "Inactive
Employee"), shall be terminated by Seller, or its Affiliate, as applicable and
become a Continuing Employee on the date such Inactive Employee returns to
active status and reports to work with Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer. The
date that an individual becomes a Continuing Employee pursuant to the
foregoing is referred to as his or her "Hire Date." Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Buyer and its Affiliates shall only be responsible

Continuing Employee's job, except for a vehicle, computer, cellular phone and
office space.

Seller and its Affiliates shall waive any rights under any non-competition,
confidentiality, or similar agreement that restricts or impairs the ability of
any Continuing Employee to work for Buyer.

(e) Seller or its Affiliate, as applicable, shall be responsible for all
compensation and benefits earned by or accruing or owing to Business Employees
up to and including the Hire Date, and Buyer shall be responsible for all
compensation and benefits earned by or accruing to Continuing Employees after
the Hire Date under Buyer's compensation and benefits programs (on and subject
to the terms of employment agreed upon between Buyer and such Continuing
Employee). Buyer shall have no obligations with respect to any Business
Employee that is not hired by Buyer at later of Closing or the Transition End
Date.

(f) Seller will be solely responsible for offering and providing any COBRA
Coverage with respect to any Business Employee or other individual who is a
"qualified beneficiary" and who is covered by an Employee Benefit Plan that is
a "group health plan" and who experiences a "qualifying event" on or prior to
the later of the Closing Date or the Transition End Date (or in the case of a
Continuing Employee, the date of his or her addition to the payroll of the
Buyer). The Buyer will be solely responsible for offering and providing any
COBRA Coverage required with respect to any Continuing Employee (or other
qualified beneficiary) who becomes covered by a group health plan sponsored or
contributed to by Buyer and who experiences a qualifying event on or
subsequent to the date of his or her addition to the payroll of the Buyer. For
purposes hereof, each of "qualified beneficiary," "group health plan" and
"qualifying event" has the meaning ascribed thereto in Section 4980B of the

or her service with Seller or its Affiliates for purposes of eligibility to

insurance carrier, to credit, all Continuing Employees with any deductibles
and co-payments already incurred during such year under Seller's benefit
plans, and waive any pre-existing conditions, exclusions or limitations as to
coverage, any evidence-of-insurability provisions and any waiting-period
requirements under such plans.; and (iii) Buyer shall apply towards any
deductible requirements and out-of-pocket maximum limits under such welfare
benefit plans that are applicable to 2015, any similar deductible requirements
and out-of-pocket maximum limits



satisfied by any Continuing Employee under Seller's or its Affiliates' welfare
benefit plans. Prior to the later of Closing or the Transition End Date,
Seller shall prepare and deliver, or cause to be prepared and delivered, to
each Continuing Employee, and request such Continuing Employee to deliver to
Buyer, a schedule setting forth the amount of the deductible and out-of-pocket
maximum limits satisfied by each Continuing Employee under Seller's welfare
benefit plans with the information available as of the date the schedule is
prepared, which schedule shall be updated through the later of the Closing
Date or the Transition End Date as soon as reasonably practicable after such
date Closing.

(h) Buyer shall cause the trustee or administrator of Buyer's 401(k) plan to
accept direct rollovers (including but not limited to participant loans) from
Seller's or its Affiliates' 401(k) plan trust for each Continuing Employee
electing the same with respect to an "eligible rollover distribution" (as
defined under Code Section 402(c)(4)) of his or her vested account thereunder;
provided, however, that Buyer shall be required to accept a rollover of a
Continuing Employee's plan loans only if such Continuing Employee rolls over
100% of his or her account from the Seller's or its Affiliate's 401(k) plan,

plan loans) and shall be subject to such administrative terms as determined by
Buyer. Each Continuing Employee shall, on the later of the Closing Date or
Transition End Date, begin accruing vacation time at the level to which they
would be entitled under Buyer's vacation policies as in effect for such year.
Seller or its Affiliate, as applicable, will pay to each Business Employee an
amount equal to any accrued and unused vacation days at the later of Closing
or the Transition End Date, as applicable, in accordance with its policies.

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (a) nothing in
this Agreement shall create any obligation on the part of Buyer to continue
the employment of any employee for any definite period following the Closing
Date, and (b) nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Buyer from altering,
amending, or terminating any of its Employee Benefit Plans, or the
participation of any of its employees in such Employee Benefit Plans, at any
time.

(j) No provision in this Agreement shall create any third party beneficiary or
other right in any Person (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) for
any reason in respect of continued employment or new employment with Seller,
its Affiliates or Buyer or in respect of any benefits that may be provided,
directly or indirectly, under any plan or arrangement maintained by Seller,
its Affiliates or Buyer.

Company prior to the Closing Date (a "Company Indemnified Party") from and
against Claims brought by reason of the fact that such Person was an officer,
employee, manager or equity owner of the Company prior to the Closing Date
(the "Company Indemnified Matters"), but only to the extent such Company
Indemnified Party would be entitled to indemnification or exculpation with
respect to the Company Indemnified Matters under applicable Legal Requirements
or the provisions of the organizational documents of the Company; provided,
however, that neither Buyer, nor the Company shall be required to indemnify a
Company Indemnified Person for any Company Indemnified Matters that are
related



to any of the matters for which the Buyer Indemnified Parties may seek
indemnity pursuant to this Article X or for any Claim brought by the equity
owner of the Company claiming breach of fiduciary duty with respect to the
sale contemplated herein.

representatives, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Buyer and
the Company and may not be terminated or amended in any manner adverse to such
Persons without their prior written consent.

efforts, with reasonable assistance from Buyer (including Buyer providing
reasonably requested assurances of financial condition and qualifications), to
obtain all Consents listed on Schedule 5.03 and Schedule 6.04; provided,
however, that Seller shall not be required to incur any liability or pay any
money in order to obtain any such Consent. Seller shall provide copies to
Buyer of each such Consent so obtained prior to Closing. In the event any
Consent listed on Schedule 5.03 or Schedule 6.04 has not been obtained prior
to Closing, Buyer and the Company shall be the only Persons responsible for
obtaining such Consent from and after Closing.

available to it pursuant to this Agreement confidential and to cause its
Affiliates and representatives to maintain all information made available to
them pursuant to this Agreement confidential, all as provided in that certain

and in any event within three (3) Business Days of the occurrence of such
Casualty Loss, which notice shall include reasonable detail regarding the
scope and nature of such Casualty Loss.

(b) At Closing, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount of the
Casualty Cost less any insurance proceeds to which the Company is entitled. If
there is a reduction in the Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 10.13,
then Seller shall retain the right but not the obligation, for one hundred
eighty (180) days after the Closing Date, to attempt to cure any such Casualty
Loss at Seller's sole cost and expense. If Seller elects to cure such Casualty
Loss, Seller may replace any personal property that is the subject of a
Casualty Loss with equipment of similar grade and utility,



or replace any real property of similar nature and kind if such property is
acceptable to Buyer in its reasonable discretion. If Seller cures the Casualty
Loss to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction, then Buyer shall promptly pay the
Seller the amount of the Casualty Cost less any insurance proceeds to which
Company was entitled used to reduce the Purchase Price for such Casualty Loss
pursuant to this Section 10.13.

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 10.13 to the contrary,
Buyer may, by notice to Seller prior to the Closing Date, terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.03(g) if a Casualty Loss causes a Material
Adverse Effect.

request of Buyer, Seller shall assist Buyer in obtaining all financial

related to the Company for periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date that
is necessary for Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) to comply with the
requirements under the Securities Act of a Registration Statement on Form S-1,
and the rules set forth in Regulation S-X (the "Requisite Financial Statement

obtain such information using commercially reasonable efforts. Buyer shall be
responsible, and obligated to reimburse Seller, for all actual, reasonable and
documented costs and expenses (including third Person or internal resources
and personnel) incurred by Seller associated with obtaining the Requisite
Financial Statement Information (and/or in having the same, at Buyer's
request, audited). Seller shall provide Buyer reasonable access during normal
business hours to such records (to the extent such information is available)
and personnel of Seller and Seller's accounting firm as Buyer may reasonably
request to enable Buyer, and its representatives and accountants, to create
and/or audit the Requisite Financial Statement Information. Except to the
extent included in any filings made pursuant to the Securities Act, Buyer
agrees to hold all Requisite Financial Statement Information confidential and
agrees not to use any Requisite Financial Statement Information other than in
connection with the preparation of any such filings. Buyer agrees to defend,
indemnify and hold harmless Seller (and the other Seller Indemnified Parties)
from and against any and all Liabilities and claims incurred by Seller (or any
other Seller Indemnified Parties) that arise out of (or are attributable to)
Buyer's use of any Requisite Financial Statement Information.

10.15 Credits and Receipts. All monies, proceeds, receipts, credits and income
attributable to the Assets (as determined in accordance with GAAP) (a) for all
periods of time at and after the Closing Date, shall be the sole property and
entitlement of the Company, and, to the extent received by Seller or one of
its Affiliates, shall be promptly accounted for and transmitted to the Company
and (b) for all periods of time prior to the Closing Date, shall be the sole
property and entitlement of Seller and, to the extent received by the Company
or Buyer, shall be promptly accounted for and transmitted to Seller. After the
Closing Date, regardless of when and by whom the actual invoice or demand for
payment is received, (i) Seller shall pay and be responsible for all accounts
payable or overhead or administrative costs incurred in the ordinary course of
business with respect to the Assets and attributable to any period of time at
or before the Closing Date and (ii) Buyer shall cause the Company to pay and
be responsible for all accounts payable or overhead or administrative costs
incurred in the ordinary course of business with respect to the Assets and
business of the Company and attributable to any period of time after the
Closing Date.



10.16 Exclusivity. In addition to the exclusivity provisions set forth in
Section 4.02(d), in the event of termination of this Agreement by Seller under
Section 8.03(a), by Buyer under Section 8.03(b) or by Seller under Section
8.03(f), during the period from such termination until January 31, 2017,
Seller shall be restricted from: (a) soliciting, initiating, responding to,
facilitating or engaging in discussions or negotiations with any Person other
than Buyer or its Affiliates or Seller's Affiliates, regarding the Transaction
or any Prohibited Commercial Agreement; or (b) enter into any arrangement or
agreement with any Person other than Buyer or its Affiliates or Seller's

purchase agreement substantially on the terms of this Agreement, mutatis
mutandis. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit
or restrict in any manner a material transaction involving Bonanza Creek
Energy, Inc. or its business as a whole and any subsequent reorganization
resulting therefrom.

(c) Any item disclosed in one Section or Schedule will be deemed to be
disclosed in any other Section or Schedule where such disclosure is relevant,
even if there is no express cross-reference, provided that the nature and the
relevance of the disclosure is reasonably apparent. Disclosure of items that
may or may not be required to be disclosed by this Agreement does not mean
that such items are material or create a standard of materiality and will not
be deemed an admission that any such disclosed matter is or may give rise to a

11.15 Disclosure Schedules.

(a) The Disclosure Schedules are deemed to be incorporated herein but are
qualified in their entirety by the Agreement, and shall not be construed as
indicating that any matter disclosed therein is required to be disclosed, nor
shall any disclosure be construed as an admission that such information is
material with respect to Seller or the Company, as applicable.

(b) Seller may by written notice to Buyer revise or supplement the Disclosure
Schedules hereunder other than Schedule 4.02(c) and Schedule 5.06, or add new
Disclosure Schedules, at any time prior to the Closing Date to reflect any
information, event or circumstance that either (a) existed on the date hereof
and should have been included on one or more existing or new Disclosure
Schedules but was not, or (b) came into existence after the date hereof and
would have been required to be disclosed on one or more existing or new
Disclosure Schedules if such information was in existence on the date of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding any such revision or supplement of the Disclosure
Schedules, unless such revision or supplement results in a Material Adverse
Effect, Buyer shall have the obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, subject to and in accordance with its terms
and conditions, but shall have the right to bring a claim against Seller under
Section 10.01 if any such revision or supplement of the Disclosure Schedules
identifies a breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in
Article V or Article VI of this Agreement.

11.16 Waiver. Buyer hereby waives, and following Closing shall cause the
Company to waive any conflicts that may arise in connection with (a) Locke
Lord LLP, counsel to the Company, representing Seller following Closing in a
dispute with Buyer or the Company arising under this Agreement and (b) the
communication by such counsel to Seller in connection with any such
representation any fact known to such counsel.

11.17 Netting of Payments. Buyer shall have the right to net payments owed to
Seller under this Agreement with payments owed by Seller or its Affiliates to
Buyer or the Company under this Agreement and the Commercial Agreements;
provided that any such payment owed by Seller



shall not include any estimates or Claims for indemnification pursuant to
Section 10.01 to the extent such Claims have not been fully and finally
adjudicated. Buyer shall provide detailed statements identifying any such
netting, which statements shall include the gross amounts payable by each of
Seller, the Company and Buyer and the net payment that results.
