Certificates in accordance with Section 1.06, without any interest thereon.

### 

  

### (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, and in no event

each holder of record as of the Effective Time of one or more Certificates

of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the

### 

  

#### (i) Promptly after receipt of such Transmittal Materials, the Paying
Agent shall review the Transmittal Materials in order to verify proper
completion and execution thereof.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and
cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such properly completed and
executed Transmittal Materials, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive from the Paying Agent in exchange therefor the Per Share
Consideration, in the amount set forth in Section 1.05(a) and the Certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Promptly following receipt of
the Transmittal Materials, the Paying Agent shall forward the Per
Share Consideration to each PCCI Stockholder who has properly surrendered
the Transmittal Materials to the Paying Agent.  Until so surrendered, each
Certificate shall be deemed for all purposes, subject only to Section 262 of

Certificates, then the Paying Agent will notify such PCCI Stockholder
promptly of the need for further information.

### (c) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the PCCI
Stockholder claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by PCBC in its sole discretion, the posting by such person of a bond
in such amount as PCBC may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Per Share Consideration deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (d) Neither the Paying Agent nor any other party to this Agreement shall
be liable to any holder of any Certificates for any amount paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws.

  

###

transfer books of PCCI to establish the identity of those persons entitled to
receive consideration specified in this Agreement, which books shall be
conclusive with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to
ownership of stock represented by any Certificate, PCBC and the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to deposit any consideration represented thereby in escrow
with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved with respect to
any claims thereto.

4      
   



  

### Option granted that is outstanding and unexercised shall be
proportionately adjusted such that each PCCI Stock Option shall cease to

the Per Share Consideration to which they are entitled under this
Agreement, (iii) the Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose
that is not provided for herein, (iv) the Paying Agent may invest, if so

aggregate, in a Material Adverse Change with respect to or materially
adversely affect the ability of PCCI or the Bank to consummate the
transactions contemplated herein. Except as disclosed in Section 3.01(a)
and on _Schedule 3.01_, neither PCCI nor the Bank have any equity interest,
direct or indirect, in any other bank or corporation or in any partnership,
joint venture or other business enterprise or entity, except as acquired
through settlement of indebtedness, foreclosure, the exercise of creditors
remedies, in a fiduciary capacity or as a secured creditor.

  

### 

  

## Section 3.02. _Organization and Qualification of the Trusts_.  With
respect to PCCI Capital Trust I, PCCI Capital Trust II, and PCCI Capital
Trust III (each, a "Trust" and collectively, the "Trusts"):

  

## 

  

### (a) Each Trust has issued and sold capital securities (the "Capital
Securities") and common securities (the "Common Securities") under the terms
of an Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust (each, a "Trust Agreement"
and collectively, the "Trust Agreements"), and PCCI has issued to each Trust
Junior Subordinated Debt Securities ("Debt Securities"), pursuant to a Junior
Subordinated Indenture, each dated of even date with its respective Trust
Agreement (such Indenture and Trust Agreement collectively being referred to
herein as the "Operative Documents"). _Schedule 3.02_ sets forth, with
respect to each Trust, the (i) aggregate liquidation value of its Capital
Securities, (ii) aggregate liquidation value of its Common Securities, (iii)
date of its Operative Documents, (iv) aggregate amount of Debt Securities
that have been issued to the Trust by PCCI, (v) fixed rate currently paid on
the Capital Securities, the Common Securities and the Debt Securities
(collectively, the "Securities"), (vi) date on which the current rates paid
on the Securities may first change, and the floating rate to be paid on the
Securities after such date, (vii) date after which PCCI may redeem the Debt
Securities at par, and (viii) maturity date of the Debt Securities.

  

### 

  

### (b) Each Trust has been duly created and is validly existing in good
standing as a statutory trust under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act with the
power and authority to own property and to conduct the business it transacts
and proposes to transact and to enter into and perform its obligations under
its respective Operative Documents. Each Trust is not a party to or
otherwise bound by any materialagreement other than the Operative Documents
and a Placement Agreement of even date with its Trust Agreement. Each Trust
is and will, under current law, be classified for federal income tax purposes
as a grantor trust and not as an association taxable as a corporation.

  



  

11      
   



  

### (c) The Capital Securities and the Common Securities have been duly
authorized by the Trust Agreements and, have been validly issued and
represent undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the respective
Trust. None of the Capital Securities or the Common Securities is subject to
preemptive or other similar rights. All of the issued and outstanding
Common Securities of each trust are directly owned by PCCI free and clear of
any pledge, security interest, claim, lien or other encumbrance, and have
been issued in compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws.
The Capital Securities, the Common Securities and the Debt Securities satisfy
the eligibility requirements of Rule 144A(d)(3) promulgated under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). None of PCCI or
the Trusts is an "investment company" or an entity "controlled" by an
"investment company," in each case within the meaning of section 3(a) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, without regard to section 3(c) of
such act. The Debt Securities are not held of record by stockholders of any
of PCCI, the Bank or the Trusts.

  

### 

  

### (d) The sole assets of each Trust are its respective Debt Securities, any
interest paid on such Debt Securities to the extent not distributed, proceeds
of such Debt Securities, or any of the foregoing.

  

### 

  

### (e) All of the proceeds from the sale of the Capital Securities issued by
each respective Trust have been invested in its respective Debt Securities.
All of the proceeds from the sale of the Common Securities issued by each
respective Trust have been invested in its respective Debt Securities. All
Debt Securities are and have been held by the Trusts since their initial
issuance.

  

### 

  

### (f) Each Trust was not formed to, and is not authorized to, conduct any
trade or business and each Trust has not conducted any trade or business
since it was formed. Each Trust exists for the exclusive purposes of (i)
issuing and selling its respective Capital Securities and Common Securities,
(ii) using the proceeds from the sale of its respective Capital Securities
and Common Securities to acquire its respective Debt Securities, and (iii)
engaging only in activities necessary, advisable or incidental thereto. Each
Trust was formed to facilitate direct investment in the assets of the Trust,
and the existence of multiple classes of ownership is incidental to that
purpose. There is no intent to provide holders of such interests in the Trust
with diverse interests in the assets of the Trust.

  

### 

  

### (g) As of the date of this Agreement, PCCI has made timely payments of
all installments of principal and interest on, and performed all of its
other obligations under, the Debt Securities.  As of the date of this
Agreement, PCCI has not exercised its right to defer interest payments on any
of the Debt Securities. PCCI has not been advised by the Board of Governors
of the Federal System (the "Federal Reserve") or the Federal Reserve Bank of
San Francisco to defer interest payments on any of the Debt Securities, nor
does PCCI have Knowledge (as defined in Section 12.08(g)) of any basis
for the same.

  

### 

  

### (h) Each Trusts income consists solely of payments made by PCCI with
respect to its respective Debt Securities, and such payments are not derived
from the

  



  

12      
   



  

### active conduct of a financial business by the Trust.  Both PCCIs
obligation to make such payments and the measurement of the amounts payable
by PCCI are defined by the terms of the Debt Securities. Neither PCCIs
obligation to make such payments nor the measurement of the amounts payable
by PCCI is dependent on income or profits of PCCI or any Affiliate of PCCI.

  

### 

  

### (i) PCCI has not issued any class of capital stock either _pari passu_ or
senior to the Debt Securities. All Debt Securities are either _pari passu_ or
senior to PCCIs trade accounts, constituting deferred purchase price for
goods and services, payable arising in the ordinary course of business.

  

### 

  

### (j) PCCI and each Trust have created a debtor-creditor relationship
between PCCI, as debtor, and each Trust, as a creditor, and PCCI and each
Trust has treated its respective Debt Securities as indebtedness for all tax
purposes.

  

### 

  

### (k) PCCI received opinions from tax counsel upon each issuance of Capital
Securities, Common Securities and Debt Securities stating that it was the
opinion of such tax counsel that as of the date of issuance: (1) each Trust
would be treated as a grantor trust for United States federal income tax
purposes and (2) the Debt Securities would be treated as indebtedness of PCCI
for United States federal income tax purposes. Copies of such tax opinions,
including copies of any certificates signed by officers in support of such
tax opinions, have been delivered to PCBC.

  

### 

  

### (l) The aggregate amount of Capital Securities qualifies as Tier 1
capital in accordance with the applicable Federal Reserve regulations in
effect as of the date of this Agreement (up to 25% of other components of
Tier 1 capital), with the balance qualifying as Tier 2 capital.

  

### 

  

## Section 3.03. _Execution and Delivery_. PCCI has taken all corporate
action necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and (provided the
required regulatory and stockholder approvals are obtained) performance
of this Agreement and the other agreements and documents contemplated hereby
to which it is a party, including, but not limited to, the Merger Agreement.
This Agreement has been, and the other agreements and documents contemplated
hereby, including, but not limited to, the Merger Agreement, have been or at
Closing will be, duly executed by PCCI. Assuming the due execution and

contemplated hereby by PCBC and Newco, this Agreement constitutes and such
other agreements and documents will constitute the legal, valid and binding

conditions, subject to the Bankruptcy Exception (as defined in Section
12.08(b)).

PCCI consists of (a) 10,000,000 shares of PCCI Common Stock, of which, as
of the date of this Agreement, 4,552,085 shares are fully paid, validly

outstanding options with respect to each PCCI Stock Option Plan, (ii) the

Option Plan, (iii) a list of all option holders with respect to each PCCI

Option Plan. All PCCI Stock Options were issued and, upon issuance in
accordance with the terms of the outstanding option agreements, the shares of
PCCI Common Stock shall be issued in compliance with all
applicable securities laws. Except as disclosed in  _Schedule 3.04_ , there
are no (x) other outstanding equity securities of any kind or character,
including but not limited to preferred stock, (y) outstanding subscriptions,

securities, irrevocable proxies or other agreements or commitments obligating
PCCI to issue any shares of, restricting the transfer of or otherwise
relating to shares of its capital stock of any class. All of the issued
and outstanding shares of PCCI Common Stock have been duly authorized,
validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable, and have not been issued
in violation of the preemptive rights of any person. Such shares of PCCI
Common Stock have been issued in full compliance with applicable law.
There are no restrictions applicable to the payment of dividends on the
shares of PCCI Common Stock, except pursuant to applicable laws and
regulations and the Operative Documents applicable to each Trust (in the
event of an extension of interest payments), and all dividends declared prior
to the date of this Agreement have been paid. _Schedule 3.04_ also sets

Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of PCCI, (ii) any provision of the

### (a) PCCI has furnished to PCBC true and complete copies of (i) the
audited consolidated balance sheets of PCCI as of December 31, 2001 and 2002,
and the audited consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders
equity and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2000, 2001, and 2002,
(ii) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of PCCI as of June 30, 2003, and
the related unaudited consolidated statement of income for the six-month
period ended June 30, 2003 (such balance sheets and the related statements of
income, changes in shareholders equity and cash flows are collectively
referred to herein as the "PCCI Financial Statements"). Except as described
in the notes to the PCCI Financial Statements, the PCCI Financial Statements
fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of PCCI as of the respective dates thereof and the results of operations and
changes in financial position of PCCI for the periods then ended, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), applied on
a basis consistent with prior periods (subject, in the case of the unaudited
interim financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments and the fact
that they do not contain all of the footnote disclosures required by GAAP),
except as otherwise noted therein, and the accounting records underlying the
PCCI Financial Statements accurately and fairly reflect in all
material respects the transactions of PCCI.  Excepts as set forth on
_Schedule 3.06_ , the PCCI Financial Statements do not contain any items of
extraordinary or nonrecurring income or any other income not earned in the
ordinary course of business except as expressly specified therein.

  

### 

  

### (b) PCCI has furnished, or has caused the Bank to furnish, to PCBC, true
and complete copies of the Reports of Condition and Income ("Call Reports")

June 30, 2003. Such Call Reports fairly present, in all material respects,
the financial position of the Bank and the results of its operations at the
dates and for the periods indicated in conformity with the Instructions for
the Preparation of Call Reports as promulgated by applicable

  



  

15      
   



  

### regulatory authorities. The Call Reports do not contain any items of
special or nonrecurring income or any other income not earned in the ordinary
course of business except as expressly specified therein. The Bank has
calculated its allowance for loan losses in accordance with GAAP, which
includes regulatory accounting principles ("RAP") where applicable, as
applied to banking institutions and in accordance with all applicable rules
and regulations. To the Knowledge of PCCI, the allowance for loan losses
account for the Bank is adequate in all material respects to provide for all
losses, net of recoveries relating to loans previously charged off, on all
outstanding loans of the Bank.

  

### 

  

## Section 3.07. _Undisclosed Liabilities_. None of PCCI, the Bank or the

agency or instrumentality, domestic or foreign, that in any manner involves
PCCI, the Bank, the Trusts or any of their current or former officers or
directors (while acting in such capacity) or any of their properties or
capital stock. As of the date of this Agreement, no legal action, suit or

## Section 3.12. _Leases, Contracts and Agreements_. _Schedule 3.12_ sets
forth a complete listing, as of August 31, 2003, of all leases, subleases,
licenses, contracts and agreements to which any of PCCI, the Bank or any
Trust is a party (the "Contracts"), and which (a) relate to real property
used by PCCI or the Bank in its operation (such Contracts being referred to
herein as the "Leases"), or (b) involve payments to or by PCCI, the Bank or
any Trust in excess of $100,000 during the term thereof. True and correct
copies of all such Contracts, and all amendments thereto, have been made
available to PCBC. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Contracts"
shall not be deemed to include loans made by, unfunded loan commitments,
letters of credit, loan participations, Federal funds sold or purchased by,
repurchase agreements made by, spot foreign exchange transactions of, bankers
acceptances of or deposit liabilities of the Bank. Except as set forth in
_Schedule 3.12_, no participations or loans have been sold which have buy
back, recourse or guaranty provisions which create contingent or direct
liabilities of PCCI. To the Knowledge of PCCI, all of the Contracts are
legal, valid and binding obligations of the parties to the Contracts
enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to the
Bankruptcy Exception. Except as described in _Schedule 3.12_ , all rent and
other payments by PCCI, the Bank or any Trust under the Contracts are
current, there are no existing defaults by PCCI, the Bank or any Trust under
the Contracts and no termination, condition or other event has occurred which
(whether with or without notice, lapse of time or the happening or occurrence
of any other event) would constitute a material default thereunder. Each of
PCCI and the Bank has a good and indefeasible leasehold interest in each of
the properties subject to the Leases, free and clear of all mortgages,
pledges, liens, encumbrances and security interests, but subject to all
matters of record.

## Section 3.13. _Taxes_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Each of PCCI, the Bank and each Trust has duly and timely filed all
Tax Returns that they were required to file under applicable laws and
regulations with the appropriate Federal, state, local or foreign
governmental agencies. All such Tax Returns were correct and complete in all
material respects and have been prepared in substantial compliance with all
applicable laws and regulations. All Taxes due and owing by PCCI, the Bank or
any Trust (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have been paid. None of
PCCI, the Bank or the Trusts currently is the beneficiary of any extension of
time within which to file any Tax Return. No claim has ever been made by an

## 

  

## Section 3.30. _Employee Benefit Plans_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Set forth on _Schedule 3.30(a_ ) is a complete and correct list of
all "employee benefit plans" (as defined in the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")), all "multi employer
plans" (as defined in ERISA), all specified fringe benefit plans as defined
in Code § 6039D, and all other bonus, incentive, compensation,
deferred compensation, profit sharing, stock option, stock appreciation
right, stock bonus, stock purchase, employee stock ownership, savings,
severance, supplemental unemployment, layoff, salary continuation,
retirement, pension, health, life insurance, disability, group insurance,
vacation, holiday, sick leave, fringe benefit or welfare plan or any other
similar plan, agreement, policy or understanding (whether written or oral,
qualified or nonqualified, currently effective or terminated), and any trust,
escrow or other agreement related thereto, which (i) are maintained or
contributed to by PCCI or the Bank, or with respect to which PCCI or the Bank
has any liability during the last five years, and (ii) provide benefits, or
describe policies or procedures applicable to, or for the welfare of any
officer, director, independent contractor, employee, service provider, former
officer or former employee of PCCI or the Bank, or the dependents or spouses
of any such person, regardless of whether funded (the "Employee Plans").
 True, accurate and complete copies of the documents comprising
each Employee Plan, including each trust, funding vehicle (including all
annuity contracts, insurance contracts, and other funding instruments), the
most current determination letter issued by the Internal Revenue Service,
Form 5500 Annual Reports for the three most recent plan years, documents,
records, policies, procedures or other materials related thereto, has been
delivered to PCBC and are included and specifically identified in _Schedule
3.30(a_ ).  No unwritten amendment exists with respect to any Employee Plan.

  

### 

  

### (b) Except for PCCIs Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the
"SERP"), no Employee Plan is a defined benefit plan within the meaning of
ERISA § 3(35), no Employee Plan is otherwise subject to ERISA Title IV, and
neither PCCI nor the Bank has ever sponsored or otherwise maintained such a
plan.

  

### 

  

### (c) There have been no prohibited transactions (as defined in Code §
4975(c)(1)), breaches of fiduciary duty or any other breaches or violations
of any law applicable to the Employee Plans that would subject PCBC, PCCI, or
any Employee Plan to any taxes, penalties, or other liabilities. Each
Employee Plan that is represented to be qualified under Code § 401(a) has a
favorable determination letter that covers all existing amendments up to and
including GUST and has no obligation to adopt any amendments for which the
remedial amendment period under Code § 401(b) has expired and PCCI is

  

### 

  

### 26      
   

### 

  

### not aware of any circumstances likely to result in revocation of any such
favorable determination letter. To the Knowledge of PCCI, each such Employee
Plan is so qualified and has been operated in compliance with applicable law
and in accordance with its terms and any related trust is exempt from federal
income tax under Code § 501(a) and no event has occurred which will or
reasonably could result in the loss of such tax exemption or to liability for
any tax under Code § 511. Except as disclosed on _Schedule 3.30(c)_ , no
Employee Plan holds any stock or other securities of PCCI or the Bank. There
are no pending claims, lawsuits or actions relating to any Employee Plan
(other than ordinary course claims for benefits) and, to the Knowledge of
PCCI, none are threatened. Except as disclosed on _Schedule 3.30(c)_ , PCCI
does not provide benefits to any employee or dependent of such employee after
the employee terminates employment other than as disclosed in this Agreement
or any schedule hereto or as required by law. Except as set forth in the
Existing CEO Employment Agreement and the Split Dollar Life Insurance
Agreements, no written or oral representations have been made to any employee
or former employee of PCCI or the Bank promising or guaranteeing any employer
payment or funding for the continuation of medical, dental, life or
disability coverage or any other welfare benefit (as defined in ERISA § 3(1))
for any period of time beyond the end of the current plan year (except to the
extent of coverage required under Code § 4980B). Compliance with FAS 106
would not create any material change to the PCCI Financial Statements. Except
as required in connection with qualified plan amendments required by tax law
changes and except as identified on _Schedule 3.30(c)_ , the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not cause a termination
or partial termination, or otherwise accelerate the time of payment,
exercise, or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due to any
employee, officer, former employee or former officer of PCCI or the Bank.
There are no surrender charges, penalties, or other costs or fees that would
be imposed by any person against PCCI, the Bank, an Employee Plan, or any
other person, including without limitation, a Employee Plan participant or
beneficiary, as a result of the hypothetical liquidation as of the
Closing Date of any insurance, annuity, or investment contracts or any other
similar investment held by any Employee Plan.

  

### 

  

### (d) No participant or beneficiary or non-participating employee has been
denied any benefit due or to become due under any Employee Plan, and neither
PCCI nor the Bank has misled any person as to his or her rights under any
Employee Plan;

  

### 

  

All obligations required to be performed by PCCI or the Bank under any
provisions of any Employee Plan have been performed by them in all material
respects and they are not in default under or in violation of any provision
of any Employee Plan;

  



  

To the Knowledge of PCCI, no event has occurred that would constitute grounds
for an enforcement action by any party against PCCI or the Bank under part 5
of Title I of ERISA under any Employee Plan.

  



  

### (e) With respect to each "employee benefit plan" (as defined in ERISA)
maintained or contributed to or required to be contributed to, currently or
in the past, by any corporation or trade or business, the employees of which,
together with the

### employees of PCCI, are required to be treated as employed by a single
employer under any of the rules contained in ERISA or Code § 414 (the
"Controlled Group Plans"):

  

### 

  

#### (i) To the Knowledge of PCCI, all Controlled Group Plans that are "group
health plans" (as defined in Code § 5000(b)(1) and ERISA § 733(a)) have been
operated up to the Closing in a manner so as to not subject PCCI to any
material liability under Code § 4980B or § 4980D;

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) Except for the SERP, there is no Controlled Group Plan that is a
defined benefit plan (as defined in ERISA § 3(35)), nor has there been in the
last five (5) calendar years; and

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) There is no Controlled Group Plan that is a "multiple employer
plan" or "multi employer plan" (as either such term is defined in ERISA), nor
has there been in the last five (5) calendar years.

  

#### 

  

Each such Controlled Group Plan is included in the listing of Employee Plans
on _Schedule 3.30(a)_.

  



  

### (f) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.30(f)_ , all Employee Plan
documents, annual reports or returns, audited or unaudited financial
statements, actuarial valuations, summary annual reports, and summary plan
descriptions issued with respect to the Employee Plans are correct, complete,
and current in all material respects, have been timely filed.

  

### 

  

### (g) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.30(g)_ , no payment that is owed
or may become due to any director, officer, employee, or agent of PCCI or the
Bank as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be
non-deductible to PCCI or PCBC, as the case may be, or subject to tax under
Code § 280G or § 4999 (or any corresponding provision of state, local, or
foreign Tax law), nor will PCCI, the Bank or PCBC be required to "gross up"
or otherwise compensate any such person because of the imposition of any
excise tax on a payment to such person.

  

### 

  

### (h) Except for the PCCI Stock Option Plans, the Director Plan and the
ESPP, no Employee Plan is invested in or provides the opportunity for the
purchase of any employer security (within the meaning of ERISA § 407(d)).

  

###

liabilities of and all payments by PCCI and the Bank, and all Employee Plans,
whether arising by operation of law, by contract or by past custom, for

of operations and changes in financial position of PCBC for the periods then
ended, in conformity with GAAP, applied on a basis consistent with prior
periods (subject, in the case of the unaudited interim financial statements,
to normal year-end adjustments and the fact that they do not contain all of

therein, and the accounting records underlying the PCBC Financial Statements

## Section 6.16. _Indemnification and Insurance_.

it will indemnify and hold harmless each person entitled to indemnification
from PCCI or the Bank, against all liabilities arising out of actions or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including, without
limitation, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) to the same
extent and subject to the conditions set forth in the respective Certificate
of Incorporation or Association of Incorporation and Bylaws of PCCI and the
Bank and any indemnification agreements entered into by PCCI or the Bank
prior to the date of this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (b) After the Effective Time, directors, officers and employees of PCCI
or the Bank who become directors, officers or employees of PCBC or its
Subsidiaries, except for the indemnification rights provided for in Section
6.16(a) above, shall have indemnification rights having prospective
application only. The prospective

  

### 

  

### 49      
   

### 

  

### indemnification rights shall consist of such rights to which directors,
officers and employees of PCBC and its Subsidiaries would be entitled under
the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of PCBC or the particular Subsidiary
of PCBC for which they are serving as officers, directors or employees and
under such directors and officers liability insurance policy as PCBC may
then make available to officers, directors and employees of PCBC and its
Subsidiaries. At the Effective Time, any executive officer or director of
PCCI or the Bank who becomes an officer or director of PCBC (including any
Subsidiary of PCBC) shall be included in PCBCs director and officer
insurance policy.

  

### 

  

### (c) PCBC shall use commercially reasonable efforts to purchase extended
reporting period coverage for PCCIs and the Banks existing officers and
directors liability insurance ("DandO Insurance") for a period of six years
after the Effective Time, _provided, however_ , that the cost thereof does
not exceed 3.0 times the last annual premiums paid by PCCI for DandO Insurance
(the "Maximum Amount"). PCBC shall advise PCCI whether such insurance will
be provided by PCBC not later than December 31, 2003. If PCBC advises PCCI
that such insurance cannot be obtained or does not provide confirmation of
its ability to secure such coverage on or prior to such date, PCCI may obtain
and pay for similar coverage (the "Similar DandO Coverage") for up to a period
of six years following the Closing under its own DandO Insurance policies and
the Banks DandO Insurance policies; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if the
amount of premium that is necessary to maintain or procure such insurance
coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, PCCI may purchase the most advantageous
policy of DandO Insurance obtainable for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount.

  

### 

  

### (d) The provisions of this Section 6.16 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the officers and directors
of PCCI and the Bank, and their respective heirs and their representatives.

### (e) If PCBC or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate with or
merge into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
person of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or substantially
all of its assets to any person, then in each case, proper provisions shall
be made so that the successor and assigns of PCBC shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.16.

that it intends to enter into such an agreement and (iii) PCBC does not make,
within five business days of receipt of such notice, a proposal or offer that

reasonably likely to be consummated, taking into account all legal, financial
and regulatory aspects of the proposal.

might have based on the adequacy of a remedy at law which might be asserted

not identified as being nonpublic, confidential or proprietary) by or on
behalf of the Disclosing Party or its Representatives relating to or

Accordingly, each Recipient agrees that the Disclosing Party shall be
entitled to obtain specific performance and/or injunctive relief against the
breach or threatened breach of Article XI of this Agreement by the Recipient
or its Representatives. Each Recipient further agrees to waive, and use its
reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives to waive, any requirement for
the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedies. Such
remedies shall not be deemed the exclusive remedies for a breach of Article
XI of this Agreement, but shall be in addition to all other remedies

3. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_.

4. _Directors and Officers_. The directors and officers of Newco at the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office from the Effective Time until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in the manner provided in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or as otherwise provided by law.

  



  

5. _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of this Merger Agreement and without any further action on the part of PCBC, PCBNA, PCCI, Newco, or any holder of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of PCCI (the "PCCI Common Stock"):

  



  

(a) Each share of PCCI Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior

owned, directly or indirectly, by PCCI, Bank, PCBC, PCBNA, or Newco (except
for Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares, as such terms are defined in Section

Stock converted into the Per Share Consideration pursuant to this Section
5(a) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each

Consideration upon the surrender of such Certificates in accordance with
Section 1.06 of the Reorganization Agreement, without any interest thereon.

Option") issued pursuant to the 1993 Pacific Crest Capital, Inc. Equity
Incentive Plan, as amended, or the Pacific Crest Capital, Inc. 2002 Equity
Incentive Plan, whether or not vested, who has delivered the Optionee
Agreement (as defined in the Reorganization Agreement), in an amount equal to
(i) the difference (if a positive number) between (A) the Per Share
Consideration, and (B) the exercise price of such PCCI Stock Option

such PCCI Stock Option (net of all applicable withholding and payroll taxes
with respect to amounts paid pursuant to this Section 6(a)). Any
payment pursuant to this Section 6(a) shall take place only after the
satisfaction or fulfillment or waiver of the conditions to Closing (as

Capital, Inc. Equity Incentive Plan and Section 15(b) of the Pacific Crest
Capital, Inc. 2002 Equity Incentive Plan, each PCCI Stock Option granted that
is outstanding and unexercised shall be proportionately adjusted such that
each PCCI Stock Option shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of
PCCI Common Stock and shall instead, as adjusted, represent the right to
receive upon exercise and delivery of the applicable exercise price an amount
in cash equal to the Per Share Consideration.

  



  

7. _Stock Transfer Books_. The stock transfer books of PCCI shall be closed as of the close of business at the Effective Time, and no transfer of record of any of the shares of PCCI Stock shall take place thereafter.

  



  

8. _Shareholder Approval_. Upon approval by (i) the requisite vote of the holders of the outstanding shares of PCCI Common Stock as and to the extent required by the DGCL and (ii) the sole shareholder of Newco, this Merger Agreement shall be made effective as soon as practicable thereafter in the manner provided in Section 14 hereof.

  



  

9. _Conditions to Consummation of the Merger_.  Consummation of the Merger as provided herein shall be conditioned upon the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Reorganization Agreement, any or all of which may be waived in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Reorganization Agreement.

terms and provisions of the Reorganization Agreement.

  



  

12. _Representations and Warranties of Newco_. Newco is a corporation, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.

13. _Waiver, Amendment and Modification_. Any of the terms or conditions of this Merger Agreement may be waived at any time, whether before or after action thereon by the shareholders of PCCI, by the party that is entitled to the benefits thereof. This Merger Agreement may be modified or amended at any time, whether before or after action thereon by the shareholders of PCCI, by PCBC, PCBNA, Newco and PCCI; provided, however, that in no event may any amendment hereto be made after action by the shareholders of PCCI that affects the value of the consideration to be received by the shareholders of PCCI specified in Section 5 of this Merger Agreement or that materially and adversely affects the rights of PCCIs shareholders hereunder without the requisite approval of such shareholders. Any waiver, modification or amendment of this Merger Agreement shall be in writing.

  



  

14. _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State, or at such subsequent date or time as PCBC, PCBNA, Newco and PCCI shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (such time being referred to herein as the "Effective Time").

  



  

15. _Multiple Counterparts_. For the convenience of the parties hereto, this Merger Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all counterparts hereof so executed by the parties hereto, whether or not such counterpart shall bear the execution of each of the parties hereto, shall be deemed to be, and shall be construed as, one and the same Merger Agreement. A telecopy or facsimile transmission of a signed counterpart of this Merger Agreement shall be sufficient to bind the party or parties whose signature(s) appear thereon.

4

the officers and directors of the parties hereto are fully authorized in the
name of their respective corporate names to take any and all such actions.

19. _Specific Performance_. Each party acknowledges that there is not an adequate remedy at law to compensate the other party relating to the non-consummation of the Merger. To this end, each party, to the extent permitted by law, irrevocably waives any defense it might have based on the adequacy of a remedy at law which might be asserted as a bar to specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable relief.

 **Re:** ** Option Agreement**

  



  

Dear [Optionee]:

  



  

Pacific Crest Capital, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("PCCI"), has previously
granted you ("You") one or more stock options (the "Options") pursuant to
which You have the right and option to purchase a specified number of shares
of PCCI common stock pursuant to and subject to the provisions of the
respective option agreements between You and PCCI ("Option Agreement").

  



  

As you know, PCCI has signed an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated
as of October 16, 2003 (the "Reorganization Agreement"), providing for the
acquisition of PCCI by Pacific Capital Bancorp, a California corporation
("PCBC"), subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals and certain other
conditions.  The acquisition will be accomplished by means of a merger of a
direct or indirect subsidiary of PCBC with and into PCCI (the "Merger"). As a
result of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of PCCI common stock
will be converted into the right to receive $26.00 in cash (the "Per Share
Consideration").

  



  

In connection with the Merger, PCCI will pay PCCI optionees who have not
previously exercised their PCCI options the net value of the options in
cancellation thereof prior to the Effective Time (as defined in the
Reorganization Agreement) of the Merger.

  



  

You have agreed with PCCI to cancel the Options and terminate the Option
Agreement on the terms set forth below (which shall constitute a
"Cancellation Agreement"):

  



  

1. You agree that, except as otherwise provided in this Cancellation Agreement, You may exercise the vested portion of the Options, or any part thereof, until the close of business on February 28, 2004 (the "Option Deadline") and that after the Option Deadline, You will not, and shall have no right to, exercise the Options, in whole or in part, or sell, assign, donate, pledge, convey, or otherwise dispose of any portion (whether or not vested) of the Options, _provided_ , _however_ , that You may exercise (up until the day immediately prior to the Effective Time) Options that would otherwise expire within 20 days of the date of exercise.

  



  

2. You agree that the Option Agreement shall be terminated and the Options shall be canceled (if not sooner canceled, terminated, or expired in accordance with its terms) effective immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger. PCCI shall pay to You the consideration set forth in paragraph 3 immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger.

  



  

3. As consideration for Your agreement to terminate and cancel the Options, You shall receive an amount equal to the product of (a) the difference (if a positive number) between (i) the

  

      
   



  

Per Share Consideration and (ii) the per share option exercise price of the
Options multiplied by (b) the number of shares subject to the Options
(whether or not otherwise vested as of the Effective Time of the Merger),
_less_ the number of shares subject to the Options exercised by You after the
execution of this Cancellation Agreement and prior to the Option Deadline.
The calculation of the payment is set forth on _Exhibit A_ hereto. The
amounts required to be paid to You hereunder may be subject to federal and/or
state withholding taxes as required by law, in which event the net amount
paid to You hereunder shall be reduced accordingly.

  



  

4. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, PCCI shall be under no obligation to make any payment to You hereunder if You voluntarily terminate Your employment with PCCI or if Your employment is involuntarily terminated for cause at any time prior to the Effective Time of the Merger. In the event of any such voluntary or involuntary termination of employment, PCCI may, in its sole discretion, rescind this Cancellation Agreement. In that event, the Option Agreement shall be restored to full force and effect as if this Cancellation Agreement had never been entered into by the parties, and You shall be restored to whatever option exercise rights are provided by the Option Agreement under circumstances of employment termination, except that the exercise period for the Options shall terminate at the earlier of (a) the close of business on the fifth business day immediately preceding the date of the Effective Time of the Merger or (b) the end of the exercise period specified in the Option Agreement.

  



  

5. Upon cancellation of the Options pursuant hereto, and except in the event of rescission of this Cancellation Agreement as herein provided, You shall have no further rights or interest under the Options or the Option Agreement. Simultaneous with the execution of this Cancellation Agreement, You shall return the original Option Agreement to PCCI.

  



  

6. This Cancellation Agreement shall be binding on the parties hereto immediately upon execution. If the Reorganization Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, this Cancellation Agreement shall automatically be rescinded, and the Option Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as if this Cancellation Agreement had never been entered into by the parties. In that event, You agree promptly to return any and all payments made hereunder by PCCI to You, if any, and PCCI agrees promptly to return the Option Agreement to You.

  



  

7. Each of the parties hereto represents that he, she, or it has the requisite capacity to enter into and perform that persons obligations under this Cancellation Agreement, and each of the parties agrees that the provisions of this Cancellation Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns of the parties hereto.

  



  

8. This Cancellation Agreement is made and entered into in the State of California and the laws of that State shall govern the validity and interpretation hereof and the performance of the parties hereto of their respective duties and obligations hereunder.

  



  

9. In the event any of the parties to this Cancellation Agreement brings an action or suit against any other party by reason of any breach of any covenant, agreement, representation, warranty or other provision hereof, or any breach of any duty or obligation created hereunder by such other party, the prevailing party in whose favor final judgment is entered shall be entitled to have and recover from the losing party all reasonable costs and expenses incurred or sustained by

  



  

2      
   



  

such prevailing party in connection with such suit or action, including
without limitation, legal fees and court costs.

  



  

10. The parties hereto recognize and agree that monetary damages will not compensate adequately the parties hereto for non-performance.  Accordingly, each party agrees that his, her, or its obligations shall be enforceable by court order requiring specific performance.

  



  

11. The making, execution and delivery of this Cancellation Agreement by the parties hereto have been induced by no representations, statements, warranties or agreements other than those expressed herein. This Cancellation Agreement embodies the entire understanding of the parties and there are no further or other agreements or understandings, written or oral, in effect between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof, except as expressly referred to by reference herein.

  



  

Please signify Your acceptance of the terms of this Cancellation Agreement by
executing the copy of this letter where your name is indicated below and
returning it to  , 
, of PCCI prior to    , 2003.

 **OPINION MATTERS OF COUNSEL TO PCCI**

  

      
   



  

 ** _EXHIBIT "C"_**

  

 ** _ _**

  

OPINION MATTERS OF COUNSEL TO PCCI

  



  

1. PCCI is a corporation, duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and is qualified to do business in the State of California, and has the corporate power and corporate authority to own its property and carry on its business as now conducted.

  



  

2. The Bank is a California banking corporation, duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of California and has the corporate power and corporate authority to own its property and carry on its business as now conducted.

  



  

3. Each of the Agreement and the Merger Agreement delivered by PCCI to PCBC, PCBNA and Newco has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of PCCI, has been executed and delivered by PCCI, and constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of PCCI, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms as to PCCI except that the opinion in this paragraph with respect to the enforceability of the Agreement and the Merger Agreement is qualified by the following:

  



  

(i) such opinion assumes that the Agreement and the Merger Agreement
constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of PCBC, PCBNA or Newco
enforceable against PCBC, PCBNA or Newco in accordance with its terms;

  



  

(ii) such counsel expresses no opinion as to the effect of bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or
affecting the relief of debtors or the rights and remedies of creditors
generally, including without limitation the effect of statutory or other law
regarding fraudulent transfers, preferential transfers and equitable
subordination,

  



  

(iii) such counsels opinion is qualified by the limitations imposed by
general principles of equity upon the availability of equitable remedies for
the enforcement of provisions of the Agreement and the Merger Agreement, and
by the effect of judicial decisions which have held that certain provisions
are unenforceable when their enforcement would violate the implied covenant
of good faith and fair dealing, or would be commercially unreasonable,

  



  

(iv) such counsel expresses no opinion as to the effect of judicial
decisions, which may permit the introduction of extrinsic evidence to modify
the terms or the interpretation of the Agreement and the Merger Agreement,
and

  



  

(v) such counsel expresses no opinion as to the treatment of PCCI Stock
Options under the PCCI Stock Option Plans.

  



  

4. The execution, delivery and performance by PCCI of this Agreement and the Merger Agreement will not violate the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of PCCI, and assuming PCBC and PCBNA have obtained and have complied with all governmental and regulatory approvals required to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and the Merger Agreement, will not violate any provision of law applicable to PCCI which, in such counsels experience, is normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the

  

      
   



  

Agreement and the Merger Agreement, and, to such counsels knowledge, (i)
will not violate any order of any court or governmental agency applicable to
PCCI or (ii) will not result in the creation or imposition of any lien,
charge or encumbrance (collectively, "Liens") upon the assets of PCCI
pursuant to the provisions of any indenture, mortgage, trust, franchise,
permit, license, note or other agreement or instrument to which PCCI is a
party and which is identified in the Exhibit Index of the periodic reports
filed by PCCI with the SEC since January 1, 2003, except such Liens which if
created or imposed would not have a Material Adverse Change on PCCI on a
consolidated basis.

  



  

5. To the knowledge of such counsel, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or threatened against or affecting PCCI or the Bank at law or in equity or before or by any governmental department, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality, domestic or foreign, that questions the validity of the Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, that seeks to enjoin or otherwise restrain the transactions contemplated by the Agreement.

  



  

6. The authorized capital stock of PCCI consists of (i) 10,000,000 shares of common stock, $.01 par value per share, and (ii) 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $.01 par value per share. To such counsels knowledge, other than shares of common stock of PCCI, there are no other outstanding shares of capital stock of any kind or character. To such counsels knowledge, none of the issued and outstanding shares of the capital stock of PCCI has been issued in violation of the preemptive rights of any person.

  



  

In giving the foregoing opinions, such counsel may rely upon the opinion of
other legal counsel reasonably satisfactory to PCBC and upon certificates of
public officials and officers and directors of PCCI.  Such counsel may also
state that the opinions in paragraph 4 are not given with respect to the
Affiliate Merger, the assumption by PCBC of the obligations of PCCI under the
Indentures or any other transactions occurring after the Effective Time
involving PCBC and any of its then direct or indirect Subsidiaries. Such
opinions may be based on such assumptions and subject to such qualifications
and limitations and in such form as are customary in legal opinions in
similar situations.

any such verification.

employment had he sought such other employment.

  



  

14) _BUSINESS RELATED EXPENSES_ :

  



  

Executive shall be reimbursed for his reasonable and actual out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by Executive in performance of his duties and

expenses.

  



  

15) _TERMINATION BY EXECUTIVE_ :

  



  

Executive shall have no personal liability for damages to PCBC for
voluntarily terminating his employment at any time, so long as he gives at
least ninety (90) days prior written notice to PCBC; provided, however,
Executive will not be entitled to the

  



  

6      
   



  

Stay Put Bonus set forth in section 11 herein if he resigns his employment
effective prior to December 31, 2004.

  



  

16) _CHOICE OF LAW AND FORUM:_

  



  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of California, without regard to choice of law principles.

breach or interpretation of this Agreement as provided in section 20 below.

  



  

(c) The Agreement shall be construed and enforced according to the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"), as amended, and the laws of

17) _INDEMNIFICATION_ :

  



  

To the fullest extend permitted by law and PCBCs by-laws, PCBC shall
indemnify Executive (including the advancement of expenses) for any

defense of any lawsuit or other claim to which he is made a party by reason
of being an officer, director or employee of PCBC or any of its subsidiaries
for acts committed in the course and scope of his employment.

  



  

18) _BINDING EFFECT_ :

  



  

This Agreement shall be binding on and inure to the benefit of the heirs and
representatives of Executive and the successors and assigns of PCBC. PCBC
shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger,
reorganization, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, liquidation
or otherwise) to all or a substantial portion of its assets to assume and
agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent
that PCBC would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken
place; provided, Executive shall have the same obligations to the successor
as he would have had to PCBC.  Regardless of whether such an assumption
agreement is executed, this Agreement shall be binding on any successor of
PCBC in accordance with the operation of law, and such successor shall be
deemed "Employer" for all purposes under this Agreement.

  



  

19) _NOTICES_ :

writing and shall be deemed to have been given if delivered anywhere by hand

continental United States by first class certified mail, return receipt
requested, postage prepaid, addressed as follows:

California, 91303.

  



  

Such addresses may be changed by written notice sent to the other party at
the last recorded address of that party. Failure to send a copy to the
applicable attorney shall not render a Notice ineffective, so long as it is
actually received by PCBC or Executive, as applicable.

  



  

20) _ARBITRATION OF ALL DISPUTES_ :

  



  

Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
breach thereof shall be settled by arbitration in the County of Los Angeles
in accordance with the laws of the State of California by an arbitrator
selected by the parties pursuant to the rules of the American
Arbitration Association. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance
with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. PCBC shall advance
the arbitrators fees and AAA administrative costs. Any arbitration decision
shall be in writing and shall describe the basis for the decision. Judgment

jurisdiction thereof. Any award of the arbitrator shall include interest at a
rate or rates considered just under the circumstances by the arbitrator.

  



  

21) _ATTORNEY FEES AND OTHER EXPENSES_ :

  



  

If any party prevails on a claim under a state or federal statute that
affords the prevailing party attorneys fees, the arbitrator may award
reasonable fees to the prevailing party, taking into account  such factors
as the significance of the issue(s) on which each party prevailed, the
reasonableness of each partys position(s), and ability to pay.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that it shall be necessary or
desirable for Executive to retain legal counsel or incur other costs and
expenses in connection with enforcement of his rights under this Agreement,
Executive shall be entitled to an advance from PCBC of his reasonable
attorneys fees and costs and expenses in connection with the enforcement of
his rights (including the enforcement of any arbitration award in Court).
Payment shall be made to Executive by PCBC at the time the attorneys fees
and costs and expenses are incurred by Executive. If, however,
the arbitrator should later determine that under the circumstances Executive
could have had no reasonable expectation of prevailing on the merits at the
time he initiated the arbitration based on the information then available to
him, he shall repay any such payments to PCBC in accordance with the order of
the arbitrator.

  



  

8      
   



  

22) _NON-ALIENATION_ :

  



  

Executive shall not have any right to pledge, hypothecate, anticipate or in
any way create a lien upon any amounts provided under this Agreement; and no
benefits payable hereunder shall be assignable in anticipation of payment
either by voluntary or involuntary acts, or by operation of law. Nothing in
this paragraph shall limit Executives rights or powers which his executor or
administrator would otherwise have.

  



  

23) _AMENDMENT_ :

  



  

This Agreement may be amended or canceled by mutual agreement of the parties
in writing and, so long as Executive lives, no person, other than the parties
hereto, shall have any rights under or interest in this Agreement or the
subject matter hereof.

  



  

24) _SCOPE OF AGREEMENT_ :

  



  

(a) This Agreement supersedes any other document or oral agreement that
conflicts with it regarding any of the matters set forth herein with the
exception of benefit and compensation plan documents. It is not intended to
preempt or supersede other documents, including plan documents, that provide
additional, non-conflicting rules or terms.

  



  

(b) No promises or inducements have been made by either party other than
those reflected herein. This Agreement cannot be amended except by a written
agreement signed by the parties, and only the Board has authority to
authorize such an amendment on behalf of PCBC.

  



  

25) _SEVERABILITY_ :

  



  

Each term of this Agreement is deemed severable, in whole or in part, and if
any provision of this Agreement or its application in any circumstance is
found to be unlawful or invalid, the remaining terms and provisions shall
remain in full force and effect. In addition, a court may re-write the
invalid provision(s) so as to be consistent with applicable law and still, to
the extent possible, achieve the intended effect of this Agreement.

  



  

26) _EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS_ :

  



  

This Agreement may be executed by the parties hereto in two (2) or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such
counterparts shall constitute one and the same instrument, and all signatures
need not appear on any one counterpart.

  



  

27) _CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION; COMPETITION_ :

  



  

(a) Employee acknowledges that, in the course of employment hereunder,
Employee has and will become acquainted with confidential information
belonging to

  



  

9      
   



  

PCBC. This information may relate to persons, firms and corporations which
are or become customers or accounts of PCBC or of a subsidiary or affiliate
of PCBC during the term of this Agreement. None of the confidential
information which Employee may have or may obtain prior to the termination of
this Agreement shall be disclosed to any other person either before or after
the termination of this Agreement without the prior written permission of
PCBC, except such disclosures as may be necessary to the performance by
Employee or Employees duties hereunder or unless such information is a part
of the public domain, is within the prior knowledge of any such other person
or is published anywhere without employees fault. Employee shall return all
tangible evidence of all such confidential information, whether in electronic
or documentary form to PCBC prior to or at the termination of Employees
employment.

  



  

(b) Employee expressly covenants and agrees that for a period of two years
after the date of termination of Employees employment with PCBC, Employee
will not, acting alone or in conjunction with others, directly or indirectly,
solicit business of any type engaged in by PCBC (or any subsidiary or
affiliate of PCBC) from any person or business which is an account, customer
or client of PCBC (or any subsidiary or affiliate of PCBC), or induce or
attempt to influence any such account, customer or client to curtail or
cancel its business with PCBC (or any subsidiary or affiliate of PCBC), or
solicit or induce any employee to leave employment with PCBC.

  



  

(c) Because the remedy at law for any breach of the provisions of this
section 27 would be inadequate, Employee hereby consents to the granting, by
any court having jurisdiction and without the necessity of proving actual
monetary loss, of an injunction or other equitable relief enjoining any
breach of such provisions. In the event either party breaches any of the
provisions, covenants or promises set forth in section 27, in addition to any
other relief to which the non-breaching party may be entitled under
section 27 of this Agreement, or any other provision of this Agreement,
the non-breaching party shall also be entitled to injunctive relief from a
court of competent jurisdiction, enjoining the breaching party, or its or his
agents, attorneys, and all others acting on is or his behalf from any
further disclosure or dissemination of information in breach of section 27 of
this Agreement.

  



  

(d) Employee and PCBC recognize that the laws and public policies of the
various states of the United States may differ as to the validity and
enforceability of covenants and undertakings similar to those set forth in
paragraph (b) of section 27. It is the intention of Employee that the
provisions of paragraph (b) of section 27 shall be enforced to the fullest
extent permissible under the laws and public policies of each state and
jurisdiction in which such enforcement is sought, and that
the unenforceability (or the modification to conform to such laws or
public policies) or any provision of such paragraph shall not render
unenforceable, or impair, the remainder of the provisions of such paragraph.
Accordingly, if any provisions of such paragraph shall be determined to be
invalid

  



  

10      
   



  

or unenforceable, either in whole or in part, under the laws or
public policies of any state or jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought,
as to such state or jurisdiction the provisions of such paragraph shall be
deemed amended to delete or modify, as necessary, the offending provision and
to alter the balance hereof in order to render it valid and enforceable in
such state or jurisdiction.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding any termination of Employees employment, all of the
covenants and agreements of Employee under this section 27 shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with the terms hereof, even if such
termination is for cause.

Re: **_Pacific Crest Capital, Inc._**

  



  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

This opinion is being delivered to you pursuant to Section 2.02(l) of the
Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the "Agreement") made and entered into
as of the 16th day of October, 2003, by and between Pacific Capital Bancorp,
a California corporation ("PCBC"), and Pacific Crest Capital, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"), which provides for PCBCs acquisition
of the Company pursuant to a merger (the "Merger") of a direct or indirect
subsidiary of PCBC ("Newco") into the Company and the conversion of all
outstanding shares of common stock of the Company ("Common Stock") into the
right to receive $26.00 per share in cash. The Merger is to be
effected pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger by and between Newco and
the Company (the "Merger Agreement") to be attached to the Agreement as
an exhibit. In accordance with Section 2.02(l) of the Agreement, this
opinion relates to the adjustment, in connection with the Merger, of the
options granted under and pursuant to the Pacific Crest Capital, Inc. 1993
Equity Incentive Plan (the "1993 Plan") and the Pacific Crest Capital, Inc.
2002 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2002 Plan" and, together with the 1993 Plan,
the "Plans") which have not expired and are outstanding as of the effective
time (the "Effective Time") of the Merger (the "Company Options").

  



  

For purposes of rendering this opinion, the Company has provided to us and we
have reviewed the Agreement; the Plans; the Form of Stock Option Agreement
that we understand has been entered into by the Company and each holder of
Company Options (the "Stock Option Agreement"); resolutions of the
Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the board of directors of the
Company (the "Board") dated October 16, 2003 (the "Committee Resolutions")
relating to the adjustment of Company Options at the Effective Time; and
resolutions of the Board dated October 16, 2003 (the "Board Resolutions")
relating to the adjustment of Company Options at the Effective Time.

  

      
   



  

We have not reviewed any other documents for purposes of rendering this
opinion (including any documents referred to in or attached as exhibits to
the documents listed above) and have assumed that there are no documents that
are contrary to or inconsistent with the opinion expressed herein. We also
have assumed that Delaware law, which was chosen as the governing law of the
Plans as stated therein, would in fact be applied by a court construing the
Plans; that the Plans, the Agreement and the Merger Agreement were duly
authorized by the Company and that the Company Options were validly granted
thereunder; that the Committee Resolutions and the Board Resolutions were
duly adopted by the Committee and the Board, respectively, and will not be
modified or rescinded; and that the Merger will be consummated at the
Effective Time in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and the
Merger Agreement. In addition, because the matters addressed herein are
primarily matters of contract interpretation under Delaware law, we have
assumed that there is no relevant extrinsic evidence relating to the
interpretation of the provisions of the Plans or the Stock Option Agreement
relevant to the opinion expressed herein.

  



  

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, and limited in all respects to
matters of Delaware law, it is our opinion that, immediately following the
Effective Time, pursuant to and in accordance with the Committee Resolutions
and the Board Resolutions, (a) the number of shares of Common Stock covered
by each Company Option shall be zero and such Company Options shall not be
exercisable for or represent the right to acquire any shares of Common Stock,
and (b) the holders of Company Options shall have the right to receive from
the Company, upon exercise of a Company Option and delivery of the applicable
exercise price, an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Consideration (as
defined in the Agreement) [or, if a holder has executed and delivered to the
Company an Optionee Agreement agreeing to the cancellation of such Company
Option, the difference between the applicable exercise price and such Per
Share Consideration.] The reasons for our opinion are discussed below.

  



  

Under Delaware law, the effect on the Company Options of the Merger and of
the Committee Resolutions and the Board Resolutions is primarily a matter of
contract. In other words, the rights of holders of Company Options are
determined first and foremost by the terms of the Plans under which they were
granted and the terms of the applicable Stock Option Agreement for each such
Company Option.(1)   _See_ 8 _Del. C._ § 157 (corporation may issue options,
terms of which shall be set forth or incorporated in instrument evidencing
option). Delaware courts apply settled principles of contract interpretation
in construing option plans and option agreements. _See Vague v. Bank One
Corp._ , 2003 WL 22071564 at *2 n. 20 (Del. Ch. Aug. 27, 2003) (noting that
an employees option agreement and option plan "collectively define the
contractual relationship" between the employee and employer); _Comrie v.
Enterasys Networks, Inc._ , 2003 WL 22078655 at *9 (Del. Ch. Sep. 4, 2003)
(stating, in construing an option agreement, that "[t]he primary goal of
contract interpretation is to attempt to fulfill, to the extent possible, the
reasonable shared expectations of the parties at the time they
contracted") (quotation omitted). A Delaware court will first look to the
entire agreement to assess whether the parties intent can be determined from
the express words of the contract. _Comrie, supra,_ at *9. __ If the terms of
the contract "are clear on their face,. . . the court must apply the meaning
that would be ascribed to the language by a reasonable third party." _Id._
(quotation omitted). If the

  

    

(1) The Stock Option Agreement states that each Company Option is granted
under one of the Plans.

  



  

2      
   



  

terms of the contract are ambiguous, the court may consider extrinsic
evidence to uphold "to the extent possible, the reasonable shared
expectations of the parties at the time of contracting." _Id._ (citation
omitted).

  



  

The Delaware Court of Chancery has applied these basic contract principles to
option agreements in two recent cases. In _Vague v. Bank One Corp._ , the
court applied the "plain language" of an option agreement and option plan to
bar a former employee from exercising options to purchase stock of his
employer because the employee did not comply with a provision in the option
agreement that required the employee to exercise his options within six
months of his retirement from the company. _Vague, supra,_ at *5.  In
_Comrie,_ the court found that the term "replacement value," as used in an
option contract, was ambiguous and therefore analyzed the parties drafting
history to determine whether options should be valued as of the date they
were granted or as of the date they were to be replaced _. Comrie,_ _supra,_
 at * 9-12.(2)

  



  

Turning to the key terms of the agreements most relevant in the present
circumstances, Section 15(b) of the 2002 Plan, and Section 16(b) of the 1993
Plan, each authorizes the Board to make adjustments to the Company Options
"in the event of any change in capitalization affecting the Common Stock"
such as a merger. Specifically, the relevant section in each Plan (referred
to hereinafter in this opinion as the "Adjustment Provision") provides:

  



  

ADJUSTMENTS UPON CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION, ETC.

     

(b) In the event of any change in capitalization affecting the Common Stock
of the Company after the Effective Date, such as a stock dividend, stock
split, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, split-up, combination,
exchange of shares, other form of reorganization, or any other change
affecting the Common Stock, such proportionate adjustments, if any, as the
Board in its discretion may deem appropriate to reflect such change shall be
made with respect to (i) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock for
which Awards in respect thereof may be granted under the Plan, (ii) the
maximum number of shares of Common Stock which may be sold or awarded to any
Participant, (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock covered by each
outstanding Award, and (iv) the price per share in respect of outstanding
Awards.

  



  

Section 3(c) of the 2002 Plan, and Section 3(c) of the 1993 Plan, each
provides that the Committee has conclusive authority to construe and
interpret the Plans:

  

    

(2) The Court of Chancery has also recently stated that option holders who
are cashed out through a merger transaction are not entitled to appraisal
rights. _Andaloro v. PFPC Worldwide, Inc._ , 830 A.2d 1232, 1233 (Del. Ch.
2003).

  



  

3      
   



  

The Committee is authorized to construe and interpret the Plan to promulgate,
amend, and rescind rules and procedures relating to the implementation of the
Plan and to make all other determinations necessary or advisable for
the administration of the Plan. Any determination, decision, or action of
the Committee in connection with the construction, interpretation,
administration, or application of the Plan shall be binding upon all
Participants and any person claiming under or through any Participant.

  



  

In addition, Section 7 of the Stock Option Agreement provides that each
holder of a Company Option is required to accept any interpretation of the
Committee relating to the Plans:

  



  

The Optionee acknowledges receipt of a copy of the [Plan], a copy of which is
attached hereto, and represents that he or she is familiar with the terms and
provisions thereof, and hereby accepts the Option subject to all the terms
and provisions thereof. The Optionee hereby agrees to accept as binding,
conclusive and final all decisions or interpretations of the Committee upon
any questions arising under the [Plan].

  



  

At the Effective Time of the Merger, each outstanding share of Common Stock
(other than certain shares to be cancelled and shares held by stockholders
who exercise appraisal rights under Delaware law) will be converted into the
right to receive the Per Share Consideration of $26.00. In our view, this
conversion of the Common Stock falls within the operative language of the
adjustment provision, i.e., "any change in capitalization affecting the
Common Stock . . . such as a . . . merger."  The conversion of all
outstanding Common Stock into the right to receive cash is clearly a "change"
with respect to each outstanding share, which will no longer remain
outstanding. Although in our view this proposition is clear as a matter of
plain meaning, we note that the analysis of the Delaware Court of Chancery in
a recent case further supports this conclusion. In _Mariner LDC v. Stone
Container Corp._ , Del. Ch., C.A. No. 16724-NC, Lamb, V.C. (Nov. 13, 1998),
the terms of a series of preferred stock that was convertible into common
stock required that the conversion rights be amended in any merger other than
a merger that did not result in a "change" in the outstanding shares of
common stock. Plaintiffs argued that no such amendment was required in a
merger in which the corporation survived and in which outstanding common
stock converted into stock of the acquiror, essentially arguing that such a
conversion was not a "change" to the rights of the common stock. The court
rejected this argument, finding that a conversion of all outstanding common
stock into different stock was clearly a "change" in that stock under the
plain dictionary meaning of the word. The court also noted that its
conclusion would protect the conversion feature of the preferred stock
because the amendment at issue would make the preferred convertible into what
the common received in the merger. _Id._ at 18 (stating that the
courts interpretation was "consistent with the common meaning of the words
and supportive of the proper functioning of the protective provisions" of
the preferred stock).(3) Finally, the court distinguished a prior case

  

    

(3) The court also stated that the conversion feature could be undermined if
target "remained free to engage in mergers in which all of its outstanding
common stock was exchanged for some property,

  



  

4      
   



  

that had construed the words "alter or change" more narrowly in a preferred
stock provision that did not, unlike the provision at issue in
_Stone Container_ or the Adjustment Provision at issue here, expressly
apply in mergers.(4)

  



  

Under the Adjustment Provision, if there is a change in capitalization
affecting the Common Stock, the Board is authorized to make "such
proportionate adjustments, if any, as the Board in its discretion may deem
appropriate to reflect such change . . . with respect to . . . the number of
shares of Common Stock covered by each outstanding Award. . . ."
 Accordingly, the Adjustment Provision gives the Board discretion to
make appropriate adjustments to protect the value of Company Options in
certain situations. In the present case, the Board has exercised such
discretion to adjust the number of shares subject to each Company Option down
to zero so that from and after the Effective Time, such Company Options are
no longer exercisable to receive shares of Common Stock; at the same
time, the Board and the Committee have provided that holders of Company
Options can exercise their options to receive the cash that the Common Stock
received in the Merger. This adjustment is being made in connection with the
Merger and in recognition of the fact that all the outstanding Common Stock
of the Company will be eliminated at the Effective Time and converted into
the right to receive cash. Accordingly, the adjustment maintains the linkage
between the Company Options and the value of the Common Stock for which they
were exercisable prior to the Merger.

  



  

We recognize that it might be argued that because the Adjustment Provision
authorizes the Board to make "proportionate adjustments," the Adjustment
Provision should not be construed to allow the Board to decrease the number
of shares subject to the Company Options to zero at the Effective Time, i.e.,
it might be argued that such an adjustment is not "proportionate." In the
context of a merger where all shares are effectively eliminated for cash, we
believe parallel treatment of the options is "proportionate" within
the meaning of the Adjustment Provision  in other words, the Company Options
are effectively being adjusted to give the holders thereof a pro rata right
to exercise such options for the cash that they would have received for their
shares in the Merger if they had exercised their options prior to the
Merger.(5)

  

    

including cash, but, simply because the common stock of [target] survived the
transaction [e.g., if target survived and its charter were not amended, but
all outstanding shares were cashed out] ,the conversion feature of [the
preferred stock] was not adjusted to make those shares convertible into such
other property."   _Id._ at 16.

  



  

(4) _ __Warner Communications v. Chris-Craft Indus._ , 583 A.2d 962 (Del.
Ch. 1989), _aff d, _567 A.2d 419 (Del. 1989) (Table) (holding that preferred
stockholders were not entitled to a vote on a proposed merger whereby their
holdings were converted into a new series of preferred stock because the
certificate of designation provided class voting only for amendments to the
certificate of incorporation and did not provide class voting for amendments
to the certificate effected through a merger); _Compare Elliott Assoc. v.
Avatex Corp._ , 715 A.2d 843 (Del. 1998) (focusing on the word "merger" in
the certificate of incorporation to hold that preferred stockholders were
entitled to a class vote on a merger and distinguishing such provision from
_Warner_ , where the provision at issue did not reference class voting for
mergers); _See also Benchmark Capital Partners IV, L.P. v. Vague_ , 2002 WL
1732423 (Del. Ch. July 15, 2002), _aff d, _822 A.2d 396 (Del. 2003) (Table)
(applying _Warner_ to certificate of incorporation provisions that did not
specifically provide the preferred stockholders class voting rights for
mergers).

  



  

(5) We note also that under its dictionary meaning, the word "proportionate"
may be used to mean equal or pro rata treatment, which is literally the case
when every Company Option is adjusted to cover

  



  

5      
   



  

Moreover, the Adjustment Provision expressly grants the Board discretion to
make such proportionate adjustments as it deems appropriate, and further
grants the Committee conclusive, binding authority to interpret the Plans.
The Committee Resolutions clearly show that the Boards exercise of
discretion under the Plans is consistent with and authorized by
the Committees interpretation of the Adjustment Provision. Under the Stock
Option Agreement, all holders of Company Options are bound by the Committees
determination. In such circumstances, we do not believe that the phrase
"proportionately adjust" in the Adjustment Provision would be read by a court
applying Delaware law to limit the Boards authority to make the adjustments
set forth in the Committee Resolutions and the Board Resolutions.(6)

zero shares. _See, e.g.,_ Blacks Law Dictionary 1219 (6th ed.
1990) ("Proportionate. Adjusted to something else according to certain rate
of comparative relation. See Pro rata."); Websters Third New International
Dictionary 1819 (3rd ed. 1993) (including as definitions, inter alia,
 "relative size," "ratio," "reasonable or desirable estimation or assignment
of relative value," "proper or equal share"). Although dictionary definitions
are not dispositive for purposes of contract construction under Delaware law,
the Delaware courts have looked to such definitions in cases construing
adjustment provisions, such as _Stone Container_. _Stone, supra_ , at 16.

  



  



  

(6) It might also be argued that although the Adjustment Provision authorizes
an adjustment to the number of shares of Common Stock covered by outstanding
options, it does not necessarily allow the Board to substitute other
consideration for the Common Stock. This argument should fail because,
in addition to the reasons discussed above, the terms of the Adjustment
Provision show that the Adjustment Provision in fact does apply in situations
where other securities or consideration will be substituted for the Common
Stock. Specifically, the Adjustment Provision applies in any "consolidation,"
in which the Company and the Common Stock would necessarily cease to exist.
_See_ 8 _Del. C._ § 251; _Avatex_ , _supra_ (focusing on the inclusion of
the word "consolidation" in construing a preferred stock voting provision).
