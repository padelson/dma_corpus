   | 
  

DATE:

 |  | DECEMBER 9, 2003 
 



BACKGROUND 



(1) The respective boards of directors of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the
Company have each determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of
their respective stockholders for Parent to acquire the Company upon the terms
and provisions of and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.



(2) In furtherance of the acquisition of the Company by Parent, the
respective boards of directors of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company have
each approved a merger (the "Merger") of Acquisition Sub with and into the
Company, with the Company as the surviving corporation, upon the terms and
provisions of and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.



(3) By resolutions duly adopted, the board of directors of the Company has, in
light of and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, (i) determined that
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders; and (ii) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the
Company approve and adopt this Agreement.



(4) Capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings set forth
in Exhibit A hereto.



INTENDING TO BE LEGALLY BOUND, in consideration of the mutual agreements
contained herein and subject to the satisfaction of the terms and conditions
set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows: Section 1: MERGER TRANSACTION



1.2 _Merger of Acquisition Sub into the Company._ Upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the
Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL"), at the Effective Time, Acquisition
Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate existence of
Acquisition Sub shall cease and the Company will continue as the surviving
corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").



1.3 _Effect of the Merger_ _._ The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time,
all property of the Company and Acquisition Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all Obligations and duties of the Company and Acquisition
Sub shall become Obligations and duties of the Surviving Corporation.



1.4 _Closing; Effective Time_ _._ Unless this Agreement shall have been
terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby shall have been abandoned
pursuant to Section 8 hereof, the consummation of the Merger (the "Closing")
shall take place at the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania offices of Blank Rome LLP,
at 10:00 a.m., local time, on a date to be designated by Parent (the "Closing
Date"), which shall be no later than the fifth (5th) Business Day after the
satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions
set forth in Section 7 (other than delivery of items to be delivered at the
Closing and other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, it being understood that the occurrence of the
Closing shall remain subject to the delivery of such items and the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), unless another
date, time or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. Subject to
the provisions of this Agreement, a certificate of merger satisfying the
applicable requirements of the DGCL shall be duly executed by the Company and,
concurrently with or as soon as practicable following the Closing, filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Merger shall become
effective upon the date and time of the filing of such certificate of merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time
as is specified in the certificate of merger (the "Effective Time").



1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers_ _._
Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time:



(a) subject to Section 6.5(a), the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time
to conform to the certificate of incorporation of Acquisition Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time until thereafter changed or amended
in accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable Law;



(b) subject to Section 6.5(a), the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall
be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to conform to the bylaws of
Acquisition Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time until
thereafter changed or amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and
applicable Law;



(c) the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective
Time shall be the respective individuals who are directors of Acquisition Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time until the earlier of their resignation
or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified, as the case may be; and



 

2 (d) the officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective
Time shall be the respective individuals who are officers of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time until the earlier of their resignation
or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified, as the case may be.



Section 2: CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 



2.1 _Conversion of Shares._



(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
further action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company or any
stockholder of the Company:



(i) any shares of Company Common Stock, including any Right associated
therewith, then held by the Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company (or held in the Companys treasury) shall be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor;



 

(ii) any shares of Company Common Stock, if any, including any Right
associated therewith, then held by Parent, Acquisition Sub or any other
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;



(iii) except as provided in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" above and subject to
Sections 2.1(b), 2.1(c) and 2.3, each share of Company Common Stock
(including each Right associated therewith), then outstanding shall be
converted into the right to receive Sixteen Dollars and Fifty Cents ($16.50)
in cash (the "Merger Consideration"), without interest; and



(iv) each of the shares of the common stock, $1.00 par value per share,
of Acquisition Sub then outstanding shall be converted into one share of
Company Common Stock.



(b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a different number
or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of
shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the
Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change
or transaction.



(c) If, any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of
forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase
agreement or other agreement with the Company or under which the Company has
any rights, then the Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto will
also be unvested and subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture
or other condition. The Company shall take all action that may be necessary
to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, Parent is entitled to
exercise any such repurchase option or other right set forth in any such
restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of restricted
Company Common Stock awarded under the Companys Employees Restricted Stock
Purchase Plan which remains restricted under the terms of that plan will be



 

3 replaced with an unrestricted share of Company Common Stock (which
unrestricted share will be freely transferable and not subject to repurchase
or forfeiture).



2.2 _Surrender of Certificates; Stock Transfer Books._



(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the "Paying
Agent") for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock to receive the funds
to which holders of such shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section
2.1. Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the
Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Earnings from such investments shall be
the sole and exclusive property of Parent and the Surviving Corporation, and
no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of shares of
Company Common Stock.



(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each Person who was, at the Effective
Time, a holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the certificates evidencing such shares (the
"Certificates") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the
Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such
instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common
Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificate, and such Certificate shall then
be canceled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration
payable upon the surrender of any Certificate for the benefit of the holder of
such Certificate. If the payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to
a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate
formerly evidencing shares of Company Common Stock is registered on the stock
transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid
all transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of Acquisition Sub that such Taxes either have been paid or are
not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2(b),
each Certificate shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each share of
Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificate. If any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of the Merger
Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by
such Certificate, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such
sum as Parent may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation with
respect to such Certificate.



(c) At any time following the sixth (6th) month after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver
to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and not
disbursed to holders of shares of Company Common Stock (including all
interest and other income received by the Paying Agent



 

4 in respect of all funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders
shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat and other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof
with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent shall be liable
to any holder of a share of Company Common Stock for any Merger Consideration
delivered in respect of such share to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Law. If any Certificates shall
not have been surrendered prior to five (5) years after the Effective Time (or
immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Body), any amounts payable in respect of such Certificate
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.



(d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company with respect to the shares of Company Common
Stock shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise provided herein or
by applicable Law.



(e) Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and
withhold) from the consideration otherwise payable in the Merger to any holder
of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to Taxes; provided, however, the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or Acquisition Sub, as the case may be, promptly pays when
due such amount deducted and withheld to the appropriate Governmental Body
for the account of such holder. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and
paid, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common
Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.



2.3 _Shares Subject to Appraisal Rights._



(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, to
the extent that the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL are or, prior to the
Effective Time become, applicable to the Merger, any shares of Company Common
Stock that, as of the Effective Time, are held by holders who have as of the
Effective Time preserved appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL with
respect to such shares ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or
represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with
Section 2.1(a), and the holder or holders of such shares shall be entitled
only to such rights as may be provided to such holder or holders pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that if such appraisal rights
shall not be perfected or the holders of such shares shall otherwise lose
their appraisal rights with respect to such shares, then, as of the later of
the Effective Time or the time of the failure to perfect such status or the
loss of such rights, such shares shall automatically be converted into and
shall represent only the right to receive (upon the surrender of the
certificate or certificates representing such shares) the
Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1.



 

5 (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demand
received by the Company prior to the Effective Time to require the Company to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
and of any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior
to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL, and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not make any payment or
settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such
demand unless Parent shall have consented in writing to such payment or
settlement offer.



2.4 _Further Action_ _._ If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is determined by Parent to be reasonably necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation
with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of
Acquisition Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Acquisition
Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.



Section 3: REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY



Knowing that Parent and Acquisition Sub rely thereon, except as set forth in
the Company Disclosure Letter (it being acknowledged that disclosure in the
Company Disclosure Letter with respect to any particular Section of the
Agreement shall be deemed disclosure with respect to another Section of the
Agreement only if the applicability of such disclosure to the subject matter
of such other Section is reasonably clear on its face), the Company represents
and warrants to Parent and Acquisition Sub as follows:



3.1  _Organization_ _._ Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Law of the
jurisdiction of its formation. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries
possesses all requisite power and authority to own its Assets and to conduct
its business as and where presently conducted. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is duly qualified or registered to do business in each
jurisdiction where such qualification or registration is required by
applicable Law, except where the failure to be so qualified or registered
would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Section 3.1
of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company has no Subsidiaries and does
not own any securities of any corporation or any other interest in any Person.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any predecessors (by
merger, consolidation, acquisition or similar transaction) other than as set
forth in Section 3.1 of the Company Disclosure Letter. Section 3.1 of the
Company Disclosure Letter states, for each of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(a) its exact legal name; (b) its business form and jurisdiction and date of
formation; (c) its federal employer identification number; (d) its
headquarters address, telephone number and facsimile number; (e) its directors
and officers, indicating all current title(s) of each individual; (f) all
fictitious, assumed or other names of any type that are registered or used by
it or under which it has done business at any time since such companys date
of incorporation or formation; and (g) any name changes, recapitalizations,
mergers, reorganizations or similar events since its date of incorporation or
formation. None of the Acquired Companies has agreed or is obligated to make,
or is bound by any Contract under which it may become obligated to make, any
future equity or similar investment in or capital contribution to any
other Person. Accurate and complete copies of articles or certificates of
incorporation, bylaws and other organization and related documents of each of
the Acquired Companies, each as amended to date, and all Contracts relating to
the acquisition, if applicable, of each of the Acquired Companies have been
made available to Parent.

in ERISA or the Code) or waivers of such deficiencies. The Acquired
Companies have delivered or made available to Parent an accurate and complete
copy of the most current Form 5500 and any other form or filing required to be

Benefit Plans are, and have been, operated in material compliance with their
provisions and with all applicable Law including, to the extent applicable,
ERISA and the Code and the regulations and rulings thereunder. The Acquired
Companies and, to the knowledge of the Company, all fiduciaries of the

execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the

Benefit Plans or under any Contract to which any of the Acquired Companies is
a party, (y) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any of
the Companys Employee Benefit Plans or under any Contract to which any

Companys Employee Benefit Plans, the Assets of any of the trusts under such
plans, the plan sponsor, the plan administrator or, to the Companys
knowledge, any fiduciary of any such plan (other than routine benefit
claims), and, to the Acquired Companies knowledge, there are no facts which
could form the basis for any such Proceeding. There are no investigations or
audits of any of the Companys Employee Benefit Plans, any trusts under such
plans, the plan sponsor or the plan administrator of any such plan that have
been instituted or, to the Acquired Companies knowledge, threatened, and, to

Proposal.

 



(b) Except as set forth in this Section 5.3(b), neither the board
of directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or
modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or
Acquisition Sub, the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend,
or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) enter
into any agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement entered into in accordance with Section 5.3(a)).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to compliance with the provisions of
this Section 5.3, prior to the Effective Time, the Companys board of
directors, after consulting with independent legal counsel, may withdraw or
modify the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or
Acquisition Sub, approve or recommend a Superior Proposal, or enter into an
agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, if the board determines in good
faith, after consulting with independent legal counsel to the Company, that
such action is required to discharge the boards fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law, provided that in each case the
Company has given Parent written notice at least three (3) Business Days in
advance of such action that the board of directors of the Company has
received a Superior Proposal which it intends to accept, specifying the
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying the
Person making such Superior Proposal. 



(c) Nothing in this Section 5.3, and no action taken by the board of
directors of the Company pursuant to this Section 5.3, will (i) permit the
Company to enter into any agreement providing for any transaction contemplated
by an Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement to the
extent permitted under this Section 5.3 hereof) for as long as this Agreement
remains in effect or (ii) affect in any manner any other obligation of the
Company under this Agreement.



(d) For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means any bona fide
offer, proposal or other indication of interest regarding any of the
following (other than the transactions provided for in this Agreement
involving the Company): (i) any merger, consolidation, share exchange,
recapitalization, business combination or other similar transaction involving
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) any sale, lease, exchange,



 

34 mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition of all or a significant
portion of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
including, without limitation, any license, lease or other transfer or
disposition of all or a significant portion of the Software and Intangibles of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a single transaction
or series of related transactions; (iii) any purchase of or tender offer or
exchange offer for ten percent (10%) percent or more of the outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Company, or the filing of a registration statement
under the Securities Act in connection therewith; or (iv) any public
announcement of a proposal, plan or intention to do any of the foregoing or
any agreement to engage in any of the foregoing. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means an Acquisition Proposal not solicited
after October 28, 2003 on terms which the board of directors of the Company
determines in good faith, taking into consideration such matters that it deems
relevant (including, without limitation, the additional time necessary to
consummate the Acquisition Proposal), to be more favorable to the Companys
stockholders than the Merger (based on the written advice of an independent
financial advisor to the Company that the value of the consideration provided
for in such proposal is superior to the value of the consideration provided
for in the Merger), for which financing, to the extent required, is (based
upon the written advice of an independent financial advisor to the
Company) reasonably capable of being obtained; provided, however, that for
purposes of this definition, "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to refer
only to a transaction involving a majority of the outstanding voting
securities of the Company or all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company.



(e) The Company agrees not to release or permit the release of any Person
from, or to waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, any
confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement to which any of the
Acquired Companies is a party or under which any of the Acquired Companies
has any rights, and will use its best efforts to enforce or cause to be
enforced each such agreement at the request of Parent. The Company also will
promptly request each Person that has executed a confidentiality agreement
prior to the date hereof in connection with its consideration of a possible
Acquisition Proposal or equity investment to return all confidential
information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of any of
the Acquired Companies.



5.4 _Certain Resolutions._ The board of directors of the Company or the
compensation committee thereof shall pass any necessary resolutions as soon as
practicable after the date hereof to provide for the treatment of Company
Options as set forth in Section 6.3 of this Agreement. 



Section 6: ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES 



6.1 _Stockholder Approval; Proxy Statement._  



(a) The Company shall, as soon as practicable following the date hereof,
prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement and shall use all reasonable
best efforts to respond to any comments of the SEC or its staff and to cause
the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders, as promptly
as practicable. The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff
for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional
information and will supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between
the Company or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its
staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company
shall give Parent an opportunity to comment on any correspondence with the
SEC or its staff or any proposed material to be included in the



 

35 Proxy Statement prior to transmission to the SEC or its staff and shall not
transmit any such material to which Parent reasonably objects. If at any time
prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting there shall occur any event that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the
Company shall promptly prepare such an amendment or supplement and after
obtaining the consent of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, to
such amendment or supplement, shall promptly transmit such amendment or
supplement to the Companys stockholders. Once the Company Stockholders
Meeting has been called and noticed, the Company shall not postpone or adjourn
(other than for the absence of a quorum and then only to the next possible
future date) the Company Stockholders Meeting without Parents consent.



(b) The Company shall promptly following the date that the Proxy Statement is
cleared by the SEC take all action necessary under all applicable Law to call,
give notice of and hold a meeting of the holders of Company Common Stock to
vote on the approval and adoption of this Agreement (the "Company
Stockholders Meeting"). The Company shall ensure that all proxies solicited
in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting are solicited in
compliance with all applicable Law.



(c) Once the Company Stockholders Meeting has been called and noticed, the
Company shall not postpone or adjourn (other than for the absence of a quorum
and then only to the next possible future date) the Company Stockholders
Meeting without Parents consent. Subject to Section 5.3: (A) the Company
shall include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement; and
(B) the Company Board Recommendation shall not be withdrawn or modified in a
manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition Sub, and no resolution by the Board of
Directors of the Company or any committee thereof to withdraw or modify the
Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition Sub
shall be adopted or proposed. The Board of Directors of the Company shall
submit this Agreement to the holders of Company Common Stock, whether or not
the Board of Directors of the Company at any time changes, withdraws or
modifies the Company Board Recommendation. Subject to Section 5.3, the Company
shall solicit from the holders of Company Common Stock proxies in favor of
the Merger and shall take all other action necessary or advisable to secure
the vote or consent of the holders of Company Common Stock required by the
DGCL and the certificate of incorporation and by-Laws of the Company
to authorize, approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) the Company agrees that its
obligation to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the
holders of Company Common Stock, as required by this Section 6.1, shall not
be affected by the withdrawal, amendment or modification of the Company Board
Recommendation and (ii) the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to
this Section 6.1 shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal,
public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal
or Superior Proposal.



(d) Parent agrees to cause all shares of Company Common Stock, if any, owned
by Parent or any subsidiary of Parent to be voted in favor of the
approval and adoption of the Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting.



(e) Subject to Parents and Acquisition Subs fulfillment of their respective
obligations with respect thereto, Company agrees and covenants that the Proxy
Statement shall contain (and shall be amended in a timely manner so as to
contain) all information which is required to be included therein in
accordance with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and
any other applicable Law and shall conform in all material respects

 



 

36 with the requirements of the Exchange Act and any other applicable Law, and
the Proxy Statement shall not, at the time it is filed with the SEC or
published, sent or given to the Companys stockholders, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading; provided,
however, that no covenant is hereby made by the Company with respect to any
information supplied by Parent or Acquisition Sub in writing for inclusion in,
or with respect to Parent or Acquisition Sub information derived from
Parents public SEC filings which is included or incorporated by reference in,
the Proxy Statement.



(f) None of the information supplied or to be supplied in writing by or on
behalf of Parent for inclusion in the Proxy Statement shall, at the time the
Proxy Statement is mailed to the stockholders of the Company or at the time of
the Company Stockholders Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement
thereof), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading.



(g) If at any time after the date the Proxy Statement is mailed
to stockholders and prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting any
information relating to the Company, Parent or Acquisition Sub, or any of
their respective affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by the
Company, Parent or Acquisition Sub which is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement
will not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and to the extent required by applicable Law,
disseminated to the stockholders.



6.2 _Regulatory Approvals._ Each party shall use all reasonable efforts to
file, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, all notices,
reports and other documents required to be filed by such party with any
Governmental Body with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and to submit promptly any additional
information requested by any such Governmental Body. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall, promptly after the
date of this Agreement, prepare and file any notifications required under any
applicable antitrust Laws in connection with the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall
respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries or requests received from
any antitrust authority or other Governmental Body in connection with
antitrust or related matters. Each of the Company and Parent shall (a) give
the other party prompt notice of the commencement or threat of commencement of
any Proceeding by or before any Governmental Body with respect to the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b)
keep the other party informed as to the status of any such Proceeding or
threat, and (c) promptly inform the other party of any communication to or
from any Governmental Body regarding the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except as may be prohibited by
any Governmental Body or by any Law, (y) each party will consult and cooperate
with the other, and will consider in good faith the views of the other, in
connection with any analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief,
Proceeding under or relating to any foreign, federal or state antitrust or
fair trade Law, and (z) in connection with any such Proceeding, each
party will permit, upon the approval of the other party which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, authorized Representatives of the other to be present
at each meeting or conference relating to



 

37 any such Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with
any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Body
in connection with any such Proceeding. At the reasonable request, and only at
the reasonable request, of Parent, the Company shall agree to divest, sell,
dispose of, hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action that
limits its freedom of action with respect to its or its Subsidiaries ability
to operate or retain any of the businesses, product lines or assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, provided that any such action
is conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger.



6.3  _Stock Options._



(a) As of the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Option granted under
the 1994 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan which has not been exercised
prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable or vested, shall
be cancelled and, in consideration of the cancellation, shall receive the
Option Cash Amount (defined below).



(b) As soon as practicable after the date hereof, the Company shall offer to
amend the outstanding Company Options (other than the Company Options which,
by their terms, expire prior to or at the Effective Time, including the
October Options) (the "Eligible Options") granted under the Companys 1994
Long-Term Incentive Plan and the Companys 1990 Employees Stock Option Plan
(collectively, the "Specified Option Plans"), which amendment (the "Option
Amendment") will provide that each holder of such Company Options shall be
entitled to receive, subject to and effective as of the Effective Time, the
Option Cash Amount for all of such holders Eligible Options, whether or not
then exercisable or vested, in consideration of the cancellation of all
Company Options held by such holder (including any Company Options with
exercise prices per share equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration),
all subject to and effective as of the Effective Time. The Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to have each such holder of Company Options
consent to the Option Amendment. To the extent that any holder does not
consent to the Option Amendment, the Eligible Options held by such holder
shall continue to remain outstanding under the Specified Option Plans after
the Effective Time, subject to the right of the board of directors of the
Company to settle in cash any exercise of the Company Options pursuant to the
terms of the Specified Option Plans. The Company shall provide Parent with
copies of all material documents in connection with the Option Amendment and
allow Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and make reasonable changes
to any documents which are proposed to be sent to the holders of Company
Options. For purposes of this Section 6.3, "Option Cash Amount" shall mean the
product of (X) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per share of the applicable Company Option and (Y) the number
of shares subject to the applicable Company Option; provided, however, that
the Option Cash Amount shall be paid net of any applicable Tax withholdings,
which the Surviving Corporation or the Parent, as the case may be, shall
promptly pay when due to the appropriate Governmental Body for the account of
each holder of the Company Option.



(c) Except with respect to the Specified Option Plans pursuant to which there
are Company Options outstanding as of the Effective Time, all stock
option plans established by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall
terminate as of the Effective Time and the provisions in any other plan,
program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other
interest in respect of the capital stock of Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company (including the Companys Restricted Stock Purchase Plan and its
Employee Stock Purchase Plan) shall be terminated and of no further force or
effect as of the Effective Time. Prior to the 



 

38 Effective Time, at the request of Parent, the Company shall take all action
(including amending any and all of the Companys existing stock option plans
and program and any and all stock option agreements, in each case subject to
obtaining any consent from option holders (to the extent required), which the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain) that Parent
determines may be reasonably necessary (under the plans pursuant to which
Company Options are outstanding and otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of
this Section 6.3 and to ensure that, from and after the Effective
Time, holders of Company Options have no rights with respect thereto other
than those specifically provided in this Section 6.3.



6.4 _Employee Benefits._



(a) Parent agrees that all employees of the Acquired Companies who continue
employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of
the Parent or the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time ("Continuing
Employees") shall be eligible to continue to participate in the Surviving
Corporations health and welfare benefit plans; provided, however, that (i)
nothing in this Section 6.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the
right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate any such
health or welfare benefit plan at any time (including as of the Effective
Time), and (ii) if Parent or the Surviving Corporation terminates any such
health or welfare benefit plan, then the Continuing Employees shall be
immediately eligible to participate in a similar health or welfare benefit
plan (if any) of Parent (all of such plans collectively, "Parent Employee
Benefit Plans") to substantially the same extent as similarly situated
employees of Parent. Immediately after the Effective Time, the Continuing
Employees shall be entitled to participate in a plan that contains a cash
or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code
sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Parent or its Subsidiaries (a
"Parent 401(k) Plan"). Each Continuing Employees period of service and
compensation history with the Company and the Acquired Companies shall be
counted in determining eligibility for, and the amount and vesting of,
benefits under each Parent Employee Benefit Plan. Each Continuing Employee who
participates in a Parent Employee Benefit Plan that provides health care
benefits (whether or not through insurance) shall participate without regard
to any waiting period or any condition or exclusion based on pre-existing
conditions, medical history, claims experience, evidence of insurability, or
genetic factors, and shall receive full credit for any co-payments or
deductible payments, or net account balances under any cafeteria or flexible
spending plan made before the Closing Date. In the event that any Continuing
Employee receives an "eligible rollover distribution" (within the meaning of
Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) from any of the Companys Employee Benefit
Plans intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (a "Company
401(k) Plan"), Parent shall cause a Parent 401(k) Plan to accept a direct
rollover of such eligible rollover distribution (including any portion of such
eligible rollover distribution comprised of the outstanding balance of a loan
from such Company 401(k) Plan). Nothing in this Section 6.4(a) or elsewhere
in this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any employee to
employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of
the Parent and, unless set forth on Section 6.4(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, the employment of each Continuing Employee shall be "at will"
employment. Each Continuing Employee is an intended third party beneficiary of
this Section 6.4(a). Parent agrees to maintain, for the benefit of the
employees of the Acquired Companies, the severance policy set forth on Exhibit
B attached to this Agreement, for a period of one (1) year from the Effective
Time; provided, however, that any severance payable under the policy shall in
all cases be subject to the employees execution of Parents standard form
employee release.



 

39 (b) If Parent directs any Acquired Company, the Acquired Company shall
terminate, effective as of the day immediately prior to and contingent upon
the Acquired Company becoming a member of the same Controlled Group of
Corporations (as such term is defined in Section 414(b) of the Code) as Parent
(the "401(k) Termination Date"), any 401(k) Plan sponsored by any of the
Acquired Companies (or to which any of the Acquired Companies contribute). The
Acquired Companies shall provide Parent evidence that such 401(k) Plans have
been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the board of directors of the
applicable Acquired Company (the form and substance of such resolutions shall
be subject to review and approval of Parent) effective as of the 401(k)
Termination Date.



6.5 _Indemnification of Officers and Directors._



(a) All rights to indemnification existing in favor of those Persons who are
or have at any time been directors and officers of the Company (the
"Indemnified Persons") for their acts and omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time, as provided in the Companys bylaws and certificate of
incorporation as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, shall survive
the Merger and shall be observed by the Surviving Corporation to the fullest
extent available under Delaware law for a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time.



(b) Provided that the officers of the Company as of the date hereof prepare
and execute the application with respect thereto, the Surviving Corporation
shall maintain in effect, for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons with
respect to their acts and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, a
"tail" policy of directors and officers liability insurance (the "Tail
Policy") covering the period of time from the Effective Time until up to the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, providing comparable coverage
to the existing directors and officers liability Insurance Policy
maintained by the Company as of the date hereof; provided, however, that the
Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an aggregate premium for
such Tail Policy in excess of $1,500,000, and, in the event the aggregate
premium for such Tail Policy exceeds $1,500,000, the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to alter the amount of such coverage under the Tail Policy
to such amount that can be obtained for an aggregate premium equal to
$1,500,000. 



(c) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary to effectuate the
purposes of this Section 6.5, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.5, and none of the actions described in clause "(i)" or clause
"(ii)" shall be taken until such provision is made.



(d) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all of the
Surviving Corporations obligations under this Section 6.5. The provisions
of this Section 6.5 shall be enforceable by each Indemnified Person and his
heirs and representatives, and are in addition to and not in substitution for,
any other right to indemnification or contribution that such Indemnified
Person may have under the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Company or the Surviving Corporation, under any acquisition Contract, under
the DGCL or otherwise.



(e) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
provisions of this Section 6.5 may not be amended or modified without
the approval of each of the Indemnified Persons.



 

40 6.6 _Additional Agreements._



(a) Subject to Section 6.6(b), Parent and the Company shall use all reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to consummate
the Merger and make effective the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject to
Section 6.6(b), each party to this Agreement (i) shall make all filings with
a Governmental Body and shall use all reasonable effort to give all notices
required to be made and given by such party in connection with the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) shall use
all reasonable efforts to obtain each Consent (if any) required to be
obtained (pursuant to any applicable Law or Contract, or otherwise) by such
party in connection with the Merger and each of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) shall use all reasonable efforts to
lift any restraint, injunction or other legal bar to the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party shall promptly
deliver to the other parties a copy of each such filing made, each such
notice given and each such Consent obtained by such party during the Pre-
Closing Period.



(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Parent shall not have any obligation under this Agreement: (i) to dispose of
or transfer or cause any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of or transfer any
assets, or to commit to cause any of the Acquired Companies to dispose of any
assets; (ii) to discontinue or cause any of its Subsidiaries to discontinue
offering any product or service, or to commit to cause any of the Acquired
Companies to discontinue offering any product or service; (iii) to license or
otherwise make available, or cause any of its Subsidiaries to license or
otherwise make available, to any Person, any technology, Software or
Intangible, or to commit to cause any of the Acquired Companies to license or
otherwise make available to any Person any technology, Software or Intangible;
(iv) to hold separate or cause any of its Subsidiaries to hold separate any
assets or operations (either before or after the Closing Date), or to commit
to cause any of the Acquired Companies to hold separate any assets or
operations; (v) to make or cause any of its Subsidiaries to make any
commitment (to any Governmental Body or otherwise) regarding its future
operations or the future operations of any of the Acquired Companies; or (vi)
to contest any Proceeding relating to the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement if Parent determines in good
faith that contesting such Proceeding might not be advisable.



6.7 _Disclosure._ Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before
issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement with
respect to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall
not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries or any Representative of any
of the Acquired Companies to, make any disclosure that is disseminated to
all, substantially all, or a significant portion of the employees of the
Acquired Companies, to the public or otherwise, in each case regarding the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless
(a) Parent shall have been given the opportunity to review and comment upon
such disclosure and shall have approved such disclosure, (b) solely with
respect to such disclosure that is disseminated to all, substantially all, or
a significant portion of the employees of the Acquired Companies, such
disclosure is consistent with the guidelines mutually agreed to by the parties
in writing, or (c) the Company shall have been advised in writing by its
outside legal counsel that such disclosure is required by applicable law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this Agreement or
any other agreement relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, each party to this Agreement (and any employee, Representative or
other agent of such party) may disclose to



 

41 any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the U.S. Federal income
tax treatment and U.S. Federal income tax structure of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and all materials of any kind (including
opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to it relating to such tax
treatment and tax structure, except that (i) this provision shall not permit
disclosure until the earliest of (A) the date of the public announcement of
discussions relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B)
the date of the public announcement of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (C) the date of the execution of an agreement (with or without
conditions) to enter into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) tax treatment and tax structure shall not include the identity of any
existing or future party (or any affiliate of such party) to this Agreement
and (iii) this provision shall not permit disclosure to the extent that
nondisclosure is necessary in order to comply with applicable securities Laws.
Nothing in this Agreement shall in any way limit any partys ability to
consult any tax advisor (including a tax advisor independent from all other
entities involved in any or all of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) regarding the tax treatment or tax structure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement,
the terms "tax treatment" and "tax structure" shall have the meanings ascribed
to such terms in United States Treasury Regulation Sections 1.6011-4(c)(8) and
(9). 



6.8 _Resignation of Officers and Directors._ The Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent on or prior to
the Effective Time the resignation of each director of each of the Acquired
Companies and such officers of the Acquired Companies as Parent shall
request.



6.9 _General Cooperation._ From the date hereof through the Effective Time,
the Acquired Companies will use their commercially reasonable good faith
efforts to operate their businesses in such a manner as to achieve a smooth
transition consistent with the respective business interests of the Acquired
Companies and Parent. In this regard, the Acquired Companies and Parent agree
that they will enter into good faith discussions concerning the businesses of
the Acquired Companies, including personnel policies and procedures, and
other operational matters.



6.10 _Acquisition Sub._ Parent shall take all action necessary to cause
Acquisition Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to
consummate the Merger on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement.



6.11 _Section 16 Matters_. The board of directors of the Company shall adopt
a resolution in advance of the Effective Time providing that the disposition
by the officers and directors of the Company of Company Common Stock, Company
Options or other equity securities of the Company pursuant to the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement is intended to be exempt
from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

each of the following conditions:

Agreement shall be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement, or as
a date subsequent to the date of this Agreement (as if made on such
subsequent date) (except to the extent such representations and warranties
expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case such representations and
warranties shall be true and correct as of such earlier date), except where
the failure to be true and correct does not have a material adverse effect on
the ability of Parent or Acquisition Sub to consummate the Merger.

relating to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will
