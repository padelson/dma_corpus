applicable portion of the Final Merger Consideration as determined pursuant to
Section 2.7.1 hereof.

2.4.3. Company Options. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all actions necessary to cancel each Company Option outstanding under the
Company's 2011 Equity Incentive Plan as of the Effective Time in exchange for
the right to receive the applicable portion of the Final Merger Consideration
as determined pursuant to Section 2.7.1 hereof. Any other unexercised Company

appraisal rights ("Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into or
represent a right to receive a portion of the Final Merger Consideration
hereunder, but the holder thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are
granted by the GBCC. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 2.4.4, if
any holder of Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through
failure to perfect or otherwise) such appraisal rights, then, as of the later

right to receive the applicable portion of the Final Merger Consideration to
which such holder would otherwise be entitled hereunder. The Company shall

the Company pursuant to the applicable provisions of the GBCC. Buyer shall
have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to such demands for appraisal. The Company shall not, except with the prior

appraisal.

2.7.1. Final Merger Consideration. The "Unadjusted Merger Consideration" shall
consist of an amount in cash equal to $170,000,000.00. The Unadjusted Merger
Consideration shall be adjusted as provided in this Agreement (as adjusted,
the "Final Merger Consideration"). Subject to the requirements of Sections
2.4.4 and 2.7.3, the Final Merger Consideration shall be allocated and paid
among the Shareholders such that each Shareholder shall receive its Pro Rata
Portion of the Closing Payment and any other payment hereunder that

2.7.2. Closing Payment. The "Closing Payment" shall be equal to the Unadjusted
Merger Consideration, minus the Estimated Working Capital Deficit (if any),
plus the Estimated Working Capital Excess (if any), minus the Indemnity Escrow
Amount, minus the Adjustment Escrow Amount, minus the Holder Representative
Expense Amount, minus the Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness, minus the
Estimated Company Transaction Expenses. Concurrently with the Effective Time,
Buyer shall (i) pay the Closing Payment to the Payments Administrator for
further distribution to the Shareholders, (ii) repay the Closing Date Funded
Indebtedness on behalf of the Company pursuant to the instructions specified
in the Estimated Closing Statement, (iii) pay to the Company, by wire transfer

(iv) pay to the Escrow Agent the Indemnity Escrow Amount, the Adjustment
Escrow Amount and the Holder Representative Expense Amount in accordance with
Section 2.7.4. Promptly following receipt by the Payments Administrator of the
Closing Payment from Buyer, the Holder Representative shall cause the Payments
Administrator to pay each Shareholder that has complied with the requirements
of Section 2.7.3(a) hereof such holder's Pro Rata Portion of the Closing
Payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Buyer
shall not assume any Funded Indebtedness of the Company by reason of this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

2.7.3. Surrender and Payment.

(a) Promptly following the receipt of shareholder approval pursuant to Section
2.6, the Holder Representative shall cause the Payments Administrator to

transmittal substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (a
"Transmittal Document") to be tendered in respect of the shares of Common
Stock held by such holder and acknowledging the termination and cancellation
of any Company Options held by such holder, in exchange for the payments
provided for in this Agreement. Each Shareholder who has properly completed,
executed and delivered to the Payments Administrator a (i) Transmittal
Document and (ii) an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E (or other

(b) All shares of Common Stock (other than treasury shares cancelled pursuant
to Section 2.4.1 hereof and Dissenting Shares) and each Company Option shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such delivery the portion of the Final Merger Consideration, if
any, that is due to such holder hereunder.

(c) All payments to a Shareholder hereunder shall be made pursuant to the
instructions provided in such holder's Transmittal Document; provided that, if
a holder of Company Options was an employee of the Company at the time such
Company Options were granted or is an employee of the Company at the time any
payment in respect of such Company is to be made under this Agreement, Buyer
may make such payment to the Company on behalf of such holder and, subject to
Section 2.7.3(d) hereof, the Company shall promptly pay such payment to such
holder.

(d) Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, or the Payments Administrator shall
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, or the Payments
Administrator is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign
Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation, or the Payments Administrator and paid to the appropriate
Government Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person who otherwise would have
received the payment in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, or the Payments Administrator.

(e) Payments of fair value in respect of Dissenting Shares, if any, pursuant
to the GBCC shall be made, first, from that portion of the Final Merger
Consideration allocable to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 2.7.1
hereof and, second, by Buyer or the Surviving Corporation directly. After any
such payments have been made, any such Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled.

(f) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of any shares
of capital stock thereafter on the records of the Company.

(the "Indemnity Escrow Amount") to SunTrust Bank (the "Escrow Agent") to be
held and delivered by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms and
provisions of a certain escrow agreement that shall be executed and delivered
by Buyer, the Holder Representative and the Escrow Agent at the Closing
substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the "Escrow

for Buyer Losses pursuant to Article VIII hereof, and for any negative Post-

transactions, including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(collectively, as such agreements are in effect as of the Closing, the
"Transaction Bonus Arrangements"). All payments that the Surviving Corporation
is obligated to pay pursuant to the Transaction Bonus Arrangements shall be
deemed Company Transaction Expenses hereunder and shall be paid as follows:
(x) with respect to payments due in connection with Closing, such payments
shall be deemed paid upon payment to the Payments Administrator of the Closing
Payment in accordance with Section 2.7.2 for further distribution to the
applicable recipients, (y) with respect to payments, if any, due in connection
with payment of the Post-Closing Adjustment, such payments shall be deemed

distribution to the applicable recipients, and (z) with respect to payments
due in connection with the release of the Indemnity Escrow Amount, the
Adjustment Escrow Amount or the Holder Representative Expense Amount to the
Shareholders, such payments shall be released from the Indemnity Escrow
Account, the Adjustment Escrow Account or the Holder Representative Expense
Account, as applicable, to the Payments Administrator for payment to the

--- 
| | 

3063972

|

6 

good faith estimate of (i) the Closing Date Working Capital (the "Estimated
Working Capital"), (ii) the Closing Date Indebtedness (the "Estimated Closing
Date Indebtedness"), and (iii) the Company Transaction Expenses (the
"Estimated Company Transaction Expenses"). The Estimated Closing Statement
shall include instructions for repayment of the Closing Date Indebtedness.

2.8.2. Post-Closing Adjustment.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and in any
event within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer, at its sole cost
and expense, shall prepare and deliver to the Holder Representative an
unaudited statement ("Buyer's Closing Statement") setting forth Buyer's good
faith calculation of (i) the Closing Date Working Capital (ii) the Closing
Date Indebtedness and (iii) the Company Transaction Expenses. The Holder
Representative and its accountants and representatives may review Buyer's
Closing Statement and may make inquiry of the representatives of Buyer's
accountants and Buyer, who shall reasonably cooperate with the Holder
Representative. Following the delivery of Buyer's Closing Statement, the
Holder Representative and its representatives and agents shall be afforded
reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior
notice, to the books and records of the Surviving Corporation and reasonable
access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice, to such
personnel and representatives of the Surviving Corporation and Buyer,
including to the individuals responsible for preparing Buyer's Closing
Statement, for the purposes of preparing and reviewing the calculations
contemplated by this Section 2.8.2(a). The calculations regarding the Closing
Date Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness and Company Transaction
Expenses contained in Buyer's Closing Statement shall be binding and
conclusive upon, and deemed accepted by, the Holder Representative unless the
Holder Representative shall have notified Buyer in writing within thirty (30)
days after receipt of Buyer's Closing Statement of any objections thereto
(which written objection must set forth in reasonable detail the basis for any
such disagreement and the Holder Representative's good faith calculation of
the items in Buyer's Closing Statement). At the request of either the Holder
Representative or Buyer, any dispute between the Parties relating to the
calculations in Buyer's Closing Statement (such disputed amounts, the
"Disputed Amounts") that cannot be resolved by them within ten (10) days after
Buyer's receipt of notice of any objections to such calculation pursuant to
this Section 2.8.2(a) shall be referred to Deloitte and Touche LLP (the
"Disputes Auditor") for decision, which decision shall be final and binding on
the Parties. In no event shall the Disputes Auditor assign a value to Closing
Date Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness or Company Transaction
Expenses that is greater than the highest or less then the lowest calculation
thereof proposed by Buyer in the Buyer's Closing Statement or the Holder
Representative in the Disputed Amounts. The Parties agree that they will
request that the Disputes Auditor render its decision within thirty (30) days
after referral of the dispute to the Disputes Auditor for decision pursuant
hereto. Each Party shall bear the fees and disbursements of their respective
representatives incurred in connection with their preparation or review of the
Disputed Amounts. The Holder Representative (on behalf of the Shareholders)
shall pay (through a disbursement from the Holder Representative Expense
Account) a portion of the fees and expenses of the Disputes Auditor equal to
100%

3063972

|

7 

multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Disputed Amounts
submitted to the Disputes Auditor that are resolved in favor of Buyer (that
being the difference between the Disputes Auditor's determination and the
Holder Representative's determination) and the denominator of which is the
total amount of Disputed Amounts submitted to the Disputes Auditor (that being
the sum total by which Buyer's determination and the Holder Representative's
determination differ from the determination of the Disputes Auditor). Buyer
shall pay that portion of the fees and expenses of the Disputes Auditor that
the Holder Representative is not required to pay hereunder. The date on which
the Closing Date Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness and Company
Transaction Expenses are finally determined in accordance with this Section
2.8.2(a) is hereinafter referred to as the "Determination Date."

(b) The "Post-Closing Adjustment" shall equal the Final Working Capital Excess
(if any), minus the Final Working Capital Deficit (if any), minus the Closing
Date Indebtedness Excess (if any), minus the Company Transaction Expense
Excess (if any), each as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.8.2(a)
hereof. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative amount, then within five
(5) Business Days after the Determination Date, Buyer and the Holder
Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to (x) pay to Buyer out of the
Adjustment Escrow Account an amount equal to the absolute value of the Post-
Closing Adjustment (provided that, if no funds remain available in the
Adjustment Escrow Account, Buyer shall be entitled to recover the remainder of
the Post-Closing Adjustment from the Indemnity Escrow Account, to the extent
funds remain available in such account) and (y) following the payment of any
such Post-Closing Adjustment to Buyer, pay any amounts remaining in the
Adjustment Escrow Account to the Payments Administrator for further
distribution to the former Shareholders in accordance with their respective
Pro Rata Portions. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive amount, then
within five (5) Business Days after the Determination Date, (i) Buyer will pay
an amount equal to the Post-Closing Adjustment, and (ii) Buyer and Holder
Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to pay all amounts remaining in
the Adjustment Escrow Account, in each case to the Payments Administrator for
further distribution to the former Shareholders in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Portions.

Subject to such exceptions as are disclosed in the corresponding sections or
subsections (or other sections or subsections as provided in Section 10.11
hereof) of the disclosure schedule attached as Schedule 3 hereto (the
"Disclosure Schedule"), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Buyer as
follows:

3.1 Organization. The Company is duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of the State of Georgia and has the requisite
corporate power and authority to carry on its business as now being conducted.
The Company is duly qualified to do business, and is in good standing, in each
of the jurisdictions listed in Section 3.1 of the Disclosure Schedule, which
are the only jurisdictions where the character of its properties held under
lease or the nature of its activities makes such qualification or good
standing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified and in good
standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Other than as set forth on
Section 3.1 of the Disclosure Schedule, the Company does not own any equity
interests in any other Person. The Company has heretofore furnished to Buyer a
complete and correct copy of the Company Charter and the bylaws of the
Company, each as amended to date. Such Company

Charter and bylaws are in full force and effect, and the Company is not in
violation of the provisions of the Company Charter or the bylaws of the
Company.

3.2 Authority.

3.2.1. Corporate Authorization. The Company has all requisite power and
authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company, and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the

action is required on the part of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries to
authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
the Company. Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the other Parties hereto, this Agreement constitutes the valid
and binding obligation of the Company enforceable in accordance with its
terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by the Laws of general
application relating to bankruptcy and insolvency and the relief of debtors
and to rules of Law governing specific performance, injunctive relief or other
equitable remedies. Except for the approval and adoption of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby by the requisite shareholders of the
Company in accordance with Section 14-2-1103 of the GBCC, no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize the
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The affirmative vote of holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock is the only vote of the
holders of any securities of the Company necessary to approve and adopt this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. The
Board of Directors of the Company, at a meeting duly called and held at which
all directors of the Company were present, duly and unanimously adopted
resolutions (a) determining that the terms of this Agreement, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby are fair to and in the best
interests of the Company's shareholders, (b) approving and declaring advisable
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger,

proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring

the Closing, to the fullest extent that the Company or the applicable
Subsidiary would have been permitted under the applicable Law and its charter
or bylaws in effect on the date hereof to indemnify such person (including the
advancing of expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under

provides an undertaking to the Surviving Corporation to repay such advances if
it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to
indemnification. The Company shall obtain as of the Closing Date a "tail"
insurance policy with a claims period of six years from the Closing Date with
at least the same coverage and amounts, and containing terms and conditions

such Consent (other than filing fees incurred in connection with regulatory
filings made pursuant to Section 5.3, which shall, in any event, be paid by
Buyer). If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby under any Competition Law or if any suit or proceeding is

challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violating any
Competition Law, each of the Parties (other than the Holder Representative)
shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly resolve such objections in
order to enable the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated as promptly as practicable, provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, that each of the Parties shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to defend any lawsuits or other legal proceedings,
whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any
Competition Law, including but not limited to seeking to have any stay,
injunction, or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other

asserted on or prior to the applicable Survival Termination Date; provided,
that as to any Buyer Losses for which a Claim Notice has been given in
accordance with the requirements of this Article VIII on or prior to the
applicable Survival Termination Date, the indemnification obligation hereunder
shall continue until the liability to be satisfied, if any, shall have been
determined pursuant to this Article VIII, and all Buyer Indemnitees shall have
been reimbursed for such Buyer Losses in accordance with the terms hereof.

8.2.2. The Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification for the
first Buyer Losses validly claimed by them pursuant to clause (i) of Section

Shareholders shall be severally, but not jointly, liable (on a pro rata basis
in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Portions) for such unrecovered

8.2.6. For purposes of claims for indemnification under clauses (i) and (ii)
of Section 8.2, in calculating the amount of any Buyer Losses for which
indemnification is sought by a Buyer Indemnitee pursuant to this Article VIII,
all "material", "materially", "in all material respects" and "Material Adverse
Effect" qualifications contained in the applicable representations and
warranties of the Company shall be disregarded. For the avoidance of doubt,
all such "material", "materially", "in all material respects" and "Material
Adverse Effect" qualifications shall be respected for purposes of determining
whether there has been a breach of any representation or warranty of the
Company in this Agreement.

8.2.7. In calculating the amount of Losses related to a breach of or
inaccuracy in a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement hereunder, the
Shareholders shall have no liability for any Losses to the extent such Losses

Capital or were included in Company Transaction Expenses or Closing Date
Indebtedness.

8.3 Indemnification of Seller Indemnitees. Subject to the limitations
contained in this Section 8.3, Buyer shall save, defend, indemnify and hold
harmless the Shareholders and their respective directors, officers, employees,
agents, representatives, shareholders, successors and assigns (collectively,
the "Seller Indemnitees") from and against any and all Losses incurred,
suffered or sustained by, or asserted against, any Seller Indemnitee as a
result of, arising out of or relating to (i) any breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty of Buyer contained in this Agreement, or (ii) any
failure of Buyer to perform any covenant, obligation or other agreement of
Buyer contained in this Agreement (the "Seller Losses").

8.3.1. Each claim for indemnification for any Seller Losses may only be
asserted on or prior to the applicable Survival Termination Date set forth in
Section 8.1; provided that as to any Seller Losses for which a Claim Notice
has been given in accordance with the requirements of this Article VIII on or
prior to the applicable Survival Termination Date, the indemnification
obligation hereunder shall continue until the liability to be satisfied, if
any, shall have been determined pursuant to this Article VIII, and all Seller
Indemnitees shall have been reimbursed for such Seller Losses in accordance
with the terms hereof.

8.4 Notice and Determination of Claims.

8.4.1. If any Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee seeking indemnification
wishes to make a claim for indemnification under Section 8.2 or Section 8.3
hereof, such Buyer Indemnitee(s) or Seller Indemnitee(s) (individually or
collectively, the "Claiming Party") shall deliver notice (a "Claim Notice") in
respect thereof to the Holder Representative, on behalf of the Shareholders,
or to Buyer, as applicable (the Shareholders, or Buyer, as applicable, the
"Indemnifying Party") as promptly as possible after becoming aware of such
claim, and shall provide the Indemnifying Party with the facts giving rise to
such claim for indemnification hereunder and any other information with
respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure
to deliver a Claim Notice, however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party
from any of its obligations under this A

|

41 

rticle VIII except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially
prejudiced by such failure. The Claim Notice shall describe in reasonable
detail the Loss and the method of computation of such Loss, and contain a
reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such Loss
shall have occurred. The Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to require
that any action be made or brought against any other Person before any action
is brought or claim is made against it hereunder by the Claiming Party. At the
time of delivery of a Claim Notice to the Holder Representative (with respect
to Buyer Losses), a duplicate copy of such Claim Notice shall be delivered by
the Claiming Party to the Escrow Agent, and if the Claiming Party is not or
does not include Buyer, such Claim Notice must be accompanied by a certificate
from Buyer confirming that each Claiming Party is a Buyer Indemnitee. For the
avoidance of doubt, in each case where the Claiming Party or the Indemnifying
Party is, collectively, the Shareholders, then in each such case all
references to such Claiming Party or Indemnifying Party, as the case may be,
in this Article VIII shall be deemed (except for provisions relating to an
obligation to make or a right to receive any payments) to refer to the Holder
Representative acting on behalf of such Claiming Party or Indemnifying Party,
as applicable. The Claiming Party shall reasonably cooperate and assist the
Indemnifying Party in determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by
the Claiming Party and in otherwise resolving such matters. Such assistance
and cooperation shall include providing, at reasonable times and upon
reasonable notice and without undue interruption to the Claiming Party's
business or personnel, access to and copies of information, records and
documents relating to such matters and access to the Claiming Party's
personnel. The Indemnifying Party shall bear all of the out-of-pocket costs
and expenses reasonably incurred by the Claiming Party in connection with
determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by the Claiming Party and
in otherwise resolving such matters, including providing such books and
records, information or personnel.

8.4.2. Until the thirtieth (30th) day following delivery of a Claim Notice, a
written objection (an "Objection") to the claim made in such Claim Notice may
be delivered by the Indemnifying Party to the Claiming Party. At the time of
delivery of any Objection to a Buyer Indemnitee (with respect to Buyer
Losses), a duplicate copy of such Objection shall be delivered to the Escrow
Agent.

8.4.3. With respect to Buyer Losses, unless the Holder Representative shall
have delivered an Objection in accordance with Section 8.4.2, the Escrow Agent
shall, on the thirtieth (30th) day (or such earlier day as the Holder
Representative shall authorize in writing to the Escrow Agent) after receipt
of a Claim Notice with respect to indemnification for a specified amount of
Buyer Losses, deliver to Buyer, for its account or for the account of each
Buyer Indemnitee named in such Claim Notice, an amount equal to the specified
amount of Buyer Losses, which amount shall be paid from the Indemnity Escrow
Account. With respect to Seller Losses, unless Buyer shall have delivered an
Objection in accordance with Section 8.4.2, on the thirtieth (30th) day (or
such earlier day as Buyer may elect in its sole discretion) after receipt of a
Claim Notice with respect to indemnification for a specified amount of Seller
Losses, Buyer shall deliver to the Payments Administrator for further
distribution to each Seller Indemnitee named in such Claim Notice, an amount
equal to the specified amount of Seller Losses.

8.4.4. With respect to Buyer Losses, upon receipt of an Objection properly
made by the Holder Representative, the Escrow Agent shall (i) deliver to
Buyer, for its account or for the account of each Buyer Indemnitee named in
the applicable Claim Notice, funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account equal to
that portion of the amount subject to such Claim Notice, if any, which is not
disputed by the Holder Representative and (ii) designate and segregate out
such portion of the funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account equal to the amount
subject to such Claim Notice which is disputed by the Holder Representative.
Thereafter, the Escrow Agent shall not dispose of such segregated funds from
the Indemnity Escrow Account until the Escrow Agent shall have received a copy
of the final decision of a court of competent jurisdiction as contemplated by
Section 8.5 hereof or the Escrow Agent shall have received a copy of the
written agreement between the Claiming Party and the Holder Representative
resolving such dispute in whole or in part and setting forth the amount, if
any, which such Claiming Party is entitled to receive. The Escrow Agent will
deliver to Buyer, for its account or for the account of each Buyer Indemnitee
entitled to payment, funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account equal to the amount
that the Claiming Party is entitled to receive as set forth in the final
decision promptly after the Escrow Agent's receipt of such decision or, in the
event that the amount to which the Claiming Party is entitled is established
pursuant to an agreement between the Claiming Party and the Holder
Representative promptly after the Escrow Agent's receipt of such agreement.

8.5 Resolution of Conflicts With Respect to Buyer Losses.

8.5.1. With respect to Buyer Losses, the Claiming Party shall deliver a
written response to the Holder Representative in respect of any Objection
properly delivered. If after twenty (20) days following delivery of such
response there remains a dispute as to any claims, the Claiming Party and the
Holder Representative shall attempt in good faith for thirty (30) days to
agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such
claims. If the Claiming Party and the Holder Representative should so agree, a
memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by Buyer
and the Holder Representative and shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and shall
distribute funds from the Indemnity Escrow Account in accordance with the
terms thereof.

8.5.2. If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation,
unless the amount of the Buyer Losses is at issue in pending litigation with a
third Person, in which event no action shall be commenced until such amount is
ascertained, the matter shall be settled in accordance with Section 10.13
hereof. A final, nonappealable decision by a court of competent jurisdiction
as to the validity and amount of any claim shall be binding, and conclusive,
and notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.5, if applicable, the Escrow
Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance with such decision and make or
withhold payments out of the Indemnity Escrow Account in accordance therewith.

8.6 Third Person Claims.

8.6.1. If the Claiming Party seeks indemnification under this Article VIII
with respect to any pending or threatened action at law or suit in equity by a
third Person against such Claiming Party (each such action being a "Third
Person Claim"), the

| | 

3063972

|

43 

Indemnifying Party will be entitled, if it so elects by written notice
delivered to the Claiming Party no later than thirty (30) days after receiving
the Claim Notice, and such notice (a) includes the Indemnifying Party's
acknowledgment that as between the Indemnifying Party and the Claiming Party,
the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for all Losses associated with
such Third Person Claim in accordance with the terms set forth in this
Agreement and (b) provides reasonably satisfactory evidence of its financial
ability to satisfy in the aggregate all such indemnification and cost and
expense reimbursement obligations (which evidence may include funds under the
Indemnity Escrow Account but only to the extent such funds are not reserved
for, or the subject of, any other claims, subject to Section 8.6.2, to conduct
and control the defense, compromise or settlement of such Third Person Claim
with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Claiming Party and at the expense of
the Indemnifying Party. In any such case, the Claiming Party shall cooperate
in connection therewith and shall furnish such records, information and
testimony and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials
and appeals as may be reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party in
connection therewith; provided that the Claiming Party may participate,
through counsel chosen by it, in the defense of any such Third Person Claim as
to which the Indemnifying Party has so elected to conduct and control the
defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the
expense of the Claiming Party unless (i) the employment of such counsel at the
Indemnifying Party's expense shall have been specifically authorized in
writing by the Indemnifying Party or (ii) the named parties to the Third
Person Claim (including any impleaded parties) include both the Claiming Party
and the Indemnifying Party, and the Claiming Party reasonably determines that
representation by counsel to the Indemnifying Party of both the Indemnifying
Party and such Claiming Party may present such counsel with a conflict of
interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be
entitled to assume the defense of any Third Person Claim that involves claims
for equitable or injunctive relief, any claim that would impose criminal
liability, or any claim for damages exceeding the Indemnifying Party's
responsibility therefor under the terms hereof, and the Claiming Party shall
have the right to defend, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party (to the
extent such expenses constitute Losses validly claimed under Section 8.2 or
Section 8.3, as applicable), any such Third Person Claim. The Indemnifying
Party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the
Claiming Party for any period during which the Indemnifying Party has failed
to assume the defense thereof (to the extent such fees and expenses constitute
Losses validly claimed under Section 8.2 or Section 8.3, as applicable). If
the Indemnifying Party does not expressly elect to assume the defense of such
Third Person Claim within the time period and otherwise in accordance with the
first sentence of this Section 8.6.1, the Claiming Party shall have the sole
right to assume the defense of such Third Person Claim.

8.6.2. Neither the Indemnifying Party, on the one hand, nor the Claiming
Party, on the other hand, shall admit liability to, or settle, compromise or
discharge any Third Person Claim without the prior consent of the other Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
provided, however, if the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third
Person Claim, the Indemnifying Party may admit any liability with respect to,
or enter into any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to such Third Person Claim if such settlement,


 

--- 
| | 

3063972

|

44 

compromise or judgment (i) does not involve a finding or admission of
wrongdoing, (ii) includes an unconditional written release by the applicable
claimant or plaintiff of the Claiming Party from all liability in respect of
such Third Person Claim and (iii) imposes no equitable remedies on the
Claiming Party.

8.7 Exclusive Remedy. Except for claims based on fraud, claims seeking
injunctive and provisional relief (including specific performance) and/or
claims by the Holder Representative pursuant to Section 9.3, if the Closing
occurs, this Article VIII shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy for
breaches of this Agreement or otherwise arising out of, concerning or
relating, directly or indirectly, to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

8.8 Tax Matters.

8.8.1. Pre-Closing Tax Returns. The Company, at the expense of the
Shareholders (which may be paid on their behalf by the Holder Representative
from funds in the Holder Representative Expense Account), shall retain
McGladrey LLP or such other accounting firm as is reasonably acceptable to
both the Holder Representative and Buyer to timely prepare and file all Tax
Returns that are required to be filed by or on behalf of the Company or any
Subsidiary for the Pre-Closing Tax Period and, at the Company's expense, Tax
Returns for any Straddle Period. The Company shall (i) prepare (or cause to be
prepared) such Tax Returns consistent with this Agreement and past practice,
unless required by applicable law and (ii) provide copies of such proposed Tax
Returns to the Holder Representative for its review and comment at least forty
(40) days prior the due date (including extensions) of any such Returns. In
the event the Holder Representative reasonably objects to any item or items in
such proposed Tax Returns at least fifteen (15) days prior to the due date
(including extensions of such Tax Returns), the Company shall revise such Tax
Returns to reflect the comments of the Holder Representative to the extent the
Company and Buyer agree with such comments. In the event that the Holder
Representative and Buyer are unable to resolve such comments at least ten (10)
days prior to the due date (including extensions) of such Tax Return, such
dispute shall be resolved by the Disputes Auditor prior to the due date
(including extensions) of such Tax Return. The Shareholders shall timely remit
(or cause to be timely remitted) to the Company all Taxes due with respect to
any such Pre-Closing Tax Periods and the Shareholders' portion of any Taxes
with respect to any Straddle Periods to the extent such Taxes were not taken
into account in determining the Closing Date Working Capital, and Buyer shall
timely remit (or cause to be timely remitted) all such amounts to the
applicable Government Authority. For the avoidance of doubt, the Holder
Representative in its sole discretion may elect to pay to Buyer on the
Shareholders' behalf any amounts owed to Buyer by the Shareholders pursuant to
the previous sentence from funds in the Holder Representative Expense Account.

8.8.2. Tax Indemnification. Subject to the terms of this Article VIII, the
Shareholders, severally and not jointly, on a pro rata basis in accordance
with their respective Pro Rata Portions, shall save, defend, indemnify and
hold harmless the Buyer Indemnitees for, without duplication, all (a) Excluded
Taxes that were not taken into account in determining the Closing Date Working
Capital , (b) Taxes arising out of, attributable to,


 

--- 
| | 

3063972

|

45 

relating to or resulting from the breach or failure of any of the
representations or warranties made by the Company in Section 3.9 (Tax Status),
(c) any Taxes arising out of, attributable to, relating to or resulting from
the breach by the Company or any Subsidiary of any covenant or agreement
contained herein which is to be performed on or before the Closing Date and
(d) costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses
attributable to any item in clauses (a)-(c) of this Section 8.8.2
(collectively, "Indemnified Taxes"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the obligations of the Shareholders to indemnify
and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to this Section 8.8.2 shall
terminate upon forty-five (45) days after the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations; provided that as to any Tax Claim for which written
notice has been duly given in accordance with this Section 8.8 on or prior to
the expiration of the statute of limitations, the indemnification obligation
pursuant to this Section 8.8 shall survive as to such Tax Claim until such Tax
Claim shall have been finally resolved.

8.8.3. Straddle Period Allocations. In the case of any Taxes that are imposed
on the Company or any Subsidiary with respect to a Straddle Period, (a)
property Taxes of the Company and any Subsidiary allocable to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period shall be equal to the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle
Period (excluding any additional tax assessed for the period (or portion
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date) multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle Period that are
in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number of
days in the entire Straddle Period; and (b) Taxes (other than property Taxes)
of the Company and any Subsidiary allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period
shall be computed as if such taxable period ended on and included the Closing
Date; provided that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated
on an annual basis shall be allocated between the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date and the portion of the Straddle Period
ending after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each such
period.

8.8.4. Tax Proceedings.

(a) If any Tax Claim is asserted, then the Party first receiving notice of
such Tax Claim promptly shall provide written notice thereof to the other
Parties; provided, however, that the failure to so notify shall not relieve
the party from whom indemnification is being sought of its obligations
hereunder, except to the extent that the party from whom indemnification is
being sought is materially prejudiced by such failure. Such notice shall
specify in reasonable detail, to the extent known, the basis for such Tax
Claim and shall include, if applicable, a copy of the relevant portion of any
correspondence received from the Tax Authority.

(b) Buyer shall have the right to control any audit, examination, contest,
litigation or other proceeding against any Governmental Entity (a "Tax
Proceeding") in respect of Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period; provided, however, that (A) Buyer shall
provide the Holder Representative with a timely and reasonably detailed
account of each phase of such Tax Proceeding, (B) Buyer shall consult with the
Holder Representative before taking any significant action in connection with
such Tax Proceeding, (C) Buyer shall consult with the


 

--- 
| | 

3063972

|

46 

Holder Representative and the Holder Representative shall be provided a
reasonable opportunity to comment before submitting any written materials
prepared or furnished in connection with such Tax Proceeding, (D) the Holder
Representative shall, at the expense of the Shareholders, be entitled to
participate in such Tax Proceeding and receive copies of any written materials
relating to such Tax Proceeding received from the relevant Tax Authority, and
(E) Buyer shall not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding
without obtaining the prior written consent of the Holder Representative,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer shall
have the exclusive right to control (A) any Tax Proceeding in respect of the
Company or any Subsidiary not described in Section 8.8.4(b) and (B) any Tax
Proceeding in respect of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries described in
Section 8.8.4(b) if such Tax Proceeding is not reasonably expected to give
rise to any indemnification obligation pursuant to this Article VIII.

8.8.5. Tax Matters Generally.

(a) Tax Sharing Agreements and Power of Attorney. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall terminate (or cause to be
terminated) on or before the Closing Date all Tax sharing, allocation,
indemnity or similar agreements or arrangements (other than this Agreement),
if any, to which the Company or any Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any
person (other than the Company or any Subsidiary), on the other hand, are
parties to, and neither Buyer, the Company, any Subsidiary or their respective
Affiliates shall have any obligations thereunder after the Closing. In
addition, the Company shall terminate (or cause to be terminated) on or before
the Closing Date, any power of attorney executed or filed with any
Governmental Entity in respect of Taxes or any Tax Return of the Company or
any Subsidiary.

(b) Tax Cooperation. The Holder Representative, Buyer and the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate with each other in connection with (i) the Buyer's
or the Surviving Corporation's preparation and filing of any U.S. federal,
state, local or foreign Tax Returns that include the business and operations
of the Company and the Subsidiaries (including by executing and filing Pre-
Closing Tax Period Tax Returns and Straddle Period Tax Returns prepared in
accordance with Section 8.8.1; provided that the Holder Representative shall
not be required to execute or file any Tax Returns) and (ii) any audit or
examination by any Governmental Entity of any Tax Returns for a Pre-Closing
Tax Period. Such cooperation shall include the furnishing or making available
of Buyer's or the Surviving Corporation's employees on a mutually convenient
basis and records, books of account or other materials of the Company and the
Subsidiaries necessary or helpful for the defense against assertions of any
Governmental Entity as to any Tax Returns for a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

(c) Transfer Taxes. All federal, state, local and foreign transfer, excise,
sales, use, value added, registration, stamp, recording, property and similar
Taxes or fees (other than Taxes permitted to be withheld pursuant to Section
2.7.3(d)) imposed on the


 

--- 
| | 

3063972

|

47 

Merger (the "Transfer Taxes") shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by each of
Buyer and the Shareholders.

(d) Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments and Indemnified Taxes. The Parties
agree to treat any payment made pursuant to Article VIII as an adjustment to
the Final Merger Consideration for all Tax purposes except to the extent
otherwise required by applicable Law. Claims for Indemnified Taxes shall be
governed exclusively by this Section 8.8 and the last sentence of Section
8.2.4, and the other Sections of Article VIII shall not apply to the extent
inconsistent with this Section 8.8 and the last sentence of Section 8.2.4.

8.9 Remedies Not Affected by Investigation, Disclosure or Knowledge. If the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, each Party expressly
reserves the right to seek indemnity or other remedy, to the extent permitted
by Section 10.7, for any Losses arising out of or relating to any breach of
any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein, notwithstanding any
investigation by, disclosure to, knowledge or imputed knowledge of such Party
or any of its representatives in respect of any facts or circumstances that
reveal the occurrence of any such breach, whether before or after the
execution and delivery hereof.

ARTICLE IX 
HOLDER REPRESENTATIVE

9.1 Holder Representative. By voting in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement, the approval of the principal terms of the Merger, execution and
delivery of their respective Transmittal Documents, and/or the consummation of
the Merger or participating in the Merger and receiving the benefits thereof,
including the right to receive the consideration payable in connection with
the Merger, each Shareholder shall be deemed to have approved the designation
of, and hereby designates and ratifies, Shareholder Representative Services
LLC as the representative, agent and attorney-in-fact of each Shareholder (the
"Holder Representative") under the terms of this Agreement. The Holder
Representative shall have the right to resign, or may be removed or replaced,
on thirty (30) days advance notice to the Company, Buyer, and the Escrow
Agent; provided, that the Holder Representative may not be removed or replaced
unless Shareholders representing at least a majority of the Pro Rata Portions
consent in writing to such removal or replacement and the identity of the
substituted representative. A vacancy in the position of Holder Representative
may be filled by written consent of Shareholders representing at least a
majority of the Pro Rata Portions.

9.2 Authority and Rights. The Holder Representative shall have full power and
authority to represent all of the Shareholders and their successors with
respect to all matters arising under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the
Payments Agreement and any agreements ancillary to the foregoing, including
the power to (i) execute and deliver the Escrow Agreement and the Payments
Agreement on behalf of and in the name of each such holder, (ii) authorize the
release or delivery of funds held in the Indemnity Escrow Account in
satisfaction of claims for Buyer Losses under Section 8.2 hereof or for any
other purpose provided hereunder or the Adjustment Escrow Account in
satisfaction of a negative Post-Closing Adjustment as provided in Section
2.8.2 hereof or for any other purpose provided

| | 

3063972

|

48 

hereunder, (iii) authorize the release or delivery of funds held in the Holder
Representative Expense Account for the payment of Disputes Auditor expenses as
provided in Section 2.8.2(a) hereof, the payment of Taxes as provided in
Section 8.8.1 hereof or for any other purpose provided under Section 9.3
hereof, (iv) agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of,
and comply with orders of courts with respect to any claims for Buyer Losses
under Section 8.2 hereof or any claims with respect to a Post-Closing
Adjustment, (v) resolve, negotiate, settle or compromise any such claim, (vi)
take any and all other actions necessary or appropriate in connection with
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any agreements ancillary to the
foregoing and (vii) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment
of the Holder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing. The
Holder Representative may take any and all actions that it believes are
necessary or appropriate in connection with this Agreement for and on behalf
of the Shareholders, as fully as if such Shareholders were acting on their own
behalf. All actions taken by the Holder Representative under this Agreement
and the agreements ancillary hereto shall be binding upon all Shareholders and
their successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by each of
them. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Holder
Representative shall have full power and authority to interpret all terms and
provisions of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the agreements
ancillary to the foregoing and to consent to any amendment hereof or thereof
on behalf of the Shareholders and their successors. Buyer and the Company
shall be entitled to rely on the appointment and treat the Holder
Representative as the duly appointed representative of the Shareholders.

9.3 Limitations on Liability; Expenses. The Holder Representative will incur
no liability of any kind with respect to any action or omission by the Holder
Representative in connection with the Holder Representative's services
pursuant to this Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto, except in the
event of liability directly resulting from the Holder Representative's gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Shareholders shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Holder Representative from and against any and all losses,
liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees,
costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and
their staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment)
(collectively, "Representative Losses") arising out of or in connection with
the Holder Representative's execution and performance of this Agreement and
the agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such Representative Loss is
suffered or incurred; provided, that in the event that any such Representative
Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Holder Representative, the Holder
Representative shall reimburse the Shareholders the amount of such indemnified
Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such gross negligence or
willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Holder Representative by the
Shareholders, any such Representative Losses may be recovered by the Holder
Representative from (i) the Indemnity Escrow Amount (but only at such time as
amounts remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account would otherwise be
distributable to the Shareholders), and (ii) the Holder Representative Expense
Amount; provided, that while this section allows the Holder Representative to
be paid from the Holder Representative Expense Amount and the Indemnity Escrow
Amount, this does not relieve the Shareholders from their obligation to
promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor
does it prevent the Holder Representative from seeking


 

--- 
| | 

3063972

|

49 

any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the Holder
Representative be required to advance its own funds on behalf of the
Shareholders or otherwise. The Shareholders acknowledge and agree that the
foregoing indemnities will survive the resignation or removal of the Holder
Representative or the termination of this Agreement.

10.2 Amendment. This Agreement may only be amended by the Parties hereto by
execution of an instrument in writing signed by (a) Buyer and (b) the Company
(if prior to the Closing) or the Holder Representative (if after the Closing).

10.3 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Closing, and to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, Buyer and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations of the other Party hereto,
(ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such

in writing signed on behalf of such Party. No failure on the part of any Party
hereto to exercise or to delay in exercising any right hereunder shall be
deemed a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise preclude any
further or other exercise of such or any other right.

10.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the exhibits hereto, the Disclosure
Schedule, and the other documents and instruments and other agreements among
the Parties hereto referenced herein constitute the entire agreement among the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings both written


 

--- 
| | 

3063972

|

51 

and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and,
except as specifically provided herein, are not intended to confer upon any
Person other than the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder.

10.5 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any rights or obligations
hereunder may be assigned by any Party without the written consent of Buyer,
the Company and the Holder Representative; provided, that Buyer may assign any
of its rights but not its obligations hereunder to one of its subsidiaries.
Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the Parties hereto and their permitted successors and assigns.

10.6 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect so long as the economic and
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby are not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any Party. The Parties further agree to
replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid
and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

10.7 Equitable Remedies; Cumulative Remedies. The Parties hereto acknowledge
that monetary damages may be inadequate to compensate a Party for a breach of
this Agreement by any other Party. Accordingly, each Party hereto shall be
entitled to seek injunctive relief (including the remedy of specific
performance) ("Equitable Relief") in the event of a breach of this Agreement
by any other Party. Any such action for Equitable Relief shall be brought in,
and each Party agrees to and does hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction
and venue of, any New York State or federal court located in the Borough of
Manhattan in The City of New York (or, if such court lacks subject matter
jurisdiction, in any appropriate New York State or federal court). Except as
otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred
upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other
remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise
by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy. Each of the Parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any
action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b)
any requirement under any law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief.

10.8 Governing Law. This Agreement and all disputes or controversies arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the
State of New York, without regard to the laws of any other jurisdiction that
might be applied because of the conflicts of laws principles of the State of
New York, except to the extent that mandatory provisions of the GBCC govern.

10.9 Interpretation. The words (i) "include," "includes" and "including" when
used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without
limitation" and (ii) "herein," "hereof," "hereby," "hereto," and "hereunder"

may require, the singular tense and
