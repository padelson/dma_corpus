Section 2.5 _Assignment of Certain Contracts_.

 



 

(a) The Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,

practicable following the date hereof, additional Assumed Agreements, if any,
for which the Sellers recommend that the Buyer obtain consent of, or provide
notice to, the applicable Third Party in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that nothing in this Section 2.5
shall obligate the Buyer to take any action with respect to such additional
Assumed Agreements.

 



 

(b) The Buyer and the Sellers shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts prior to the Closing to obtain, and to cooperate in
obtaining, all consents and Governmental Authorizations from Governmental
Authorities and third parties necessary to assume and assign each Assumed
Agreement and the other Purchased Assets to the Buyer or related to any
material Contract to which any Acquired Entity is a party; provided, however,
that neither the Sellers nor the Buyer shall be required to pay or commit to
pay any amount to (or incur any material obligation in favor of) any Person
from whom any such consent or Governmental Authorization may be required other
than _de minimis_ and ordinary course filing and administrative fees.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent
that the sale, transfer, assignment, conveyance or delivery or attempted sale,
transfer, assignment, conveyance or delivery to Buyer of any asset that would
be a Purchased Asset or an Assumed Liability, or any material Contract to
which any Acquired Entity is a party, or any claim or right or any benefit
arising thereunder or resulting therefrom is prohibited by any applicable
Legal Requirement or would require any consent from any Governmental Authority
or any other Third Party and such consents shall not have been obtained prior
to the Closing (or is not in full force and effect), the Closing shall proceed
without the sale, transfer, assignment, conveyance or delivery of such asset
(and without reduction in the Purchase Price) unless there is a failure of one
or more of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_, in which event the
Closing shall proceed only if each failed condition is waived by the Party
entitled to the benefit thereof. In the event that any failed condition is
waived and the Closing proceeds without the transfer or assignment of any such
asset, then following the Closing, the Buyer and the Sellers shall use their
respective commercially

 



      
 

 



 

reasonable efforts, and reasonably cooperate with each other, to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirement and the applicable Purchased
Asset, Assumed Liability or Contract, to obtain promptly such consent as
quickly as practicable. Pending such consent, the parties shall reasonably
cooperate with each other to provide Buyer with all of the benefits of use of
such asset (or any right or benefit arising thereunder, including the
enforcement for the benefit of Buyer of any and all rights of Sellers against
a Third Party thereunder) free of any cost or expense. Once consent for the
sale, transfer, assignment, conveyance or delivery of any such asset not sold,
transferred, assigned, conveyed or delivered at the Closing is obtained, the
Sellers shall promptly transfer, assign, convey and deliver such asset to
Buyer at no additional cost or expense pursuant to a special-purpose
assignment and assumption agreement substantially similar in terms to those of
the Assumption Agreement (which special-purpose agreement the parties shall
prepare, execute and deliver in good faith at the time of such transfer). To
the extent that any such asset cannot be transferred or the full benefits or
use of any such asset cannot be provided to Buyer the Closing but in any event
no later than the date that is 180 days after the Closing pursuant to this
_Section 2.5_, then the Buyer and the Sellers shall enter into such
arrangements (including subleasing, sublicensing or subcontracting) to provide
to the parties hereto the economic (taking into account Tax costs and
benefits) and operational equivalent of obtaining such consent.

 



 

(d) If, following the Closing, any Seller receives or becomes aware that it
holds any asset, property or right which constitutes a Purchased Asset
(including any of the assets described in Section 2.2(e) to the transfer of
which the applicable Employee has consented in writing), then such Seller
shall transfer such asset, property or right to Buyer as promptly as
practicable for no additional consideration. If, following the Closing, Buyer
receives or becomes aware that it holds any asset, property or right which
constitutes an Excluded Asset, then Buyer shall transfer such asset, property
or right to the Sellers as promptly as practicable for no additional
consideration.

(b) _Timing_. The Buyer shall notify the Sellers of the achievement of each
milestone promptly following its determination that a payment in respect of
such milestone is payable, setting forth the clause in Section 3.2(a) giving
rise to such payment obligation and the amount thereof. The Buyer shall make
payment of such amount within thirty (30) days of delivering the foregoing

(80%) of the combined sales (on a unit volume basis) of birinapant and Generic
Versions of birinapant in such calendar year according to IMS market share

Party and (ii) the costs (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses)

complete and accurate records of

 



      
 

 



 

their sales of Products in sufficient detail to allow the accruing milestone
and Earn-Out Payments to be determined accurately. Sellers shall have the
right for a period of one (1) year after receiving any report or statement
with respect to milestone and Earn-Out Payments due and payable to appoint an
independent certified public accountant reasonably acceptable to Buyer to
inspect the relevant records to verify such report or statement. Buyer and its
Affiliates, sublicensees and transferees or assignees shall each make its
records available for inspection by such independent certified public
accountant during regular business hours at such place or places where such
records are customarily kept, upon reasonable notice from Sellers, solely to
verify the accuracy of the reports and payments. Such inspection right shall
not be exercised more than once in any calendar year. Sellers agree to hold in
strict confidence all information concerning milestone and Earn-Out Payments
and reports, and all information learned in the course of any audit or
inspection (and not to make copies of such reports and information), except to
the extent necessary for Sellers to reveal such information in order to
enforce its rights under this Agreement or if disclosure is required by
applicable Legal Requirement. The results of each inspection, if any, shall be
binding on both parties. Sellers shall pay for such inspections, except that
in the event there is any upward adjustment in aggregate Earn-Out Payments
payable for any year shown by such inspection of more than ten percent (10%)
of the amount paid, Buyer shall pay for such inspection. Buyer shall include
in each sublicense or marketing agreement entered into by it pursuant to this
Agreement a provision requiring the sublicensee or marketing partner to keep
and maintain adequate records of sales made pursuant to such sublicense or
marketing agreement and to grant access to such records by the aforementioned
independent public accountant for the reasons specified in this Section. Any
overpayments shall be fully creditable against amounts payable in subsequent
payment periods. Sellers agree that all information subject to review under
this Section or under any sublicense or marketing agreement is confidential
and that Sellers shall retain and cause their representative to retain all
such information in confidence.

Efforts to (i) initiate a Phase III Clinical Trial for SHP-141 in accordance
with the timeline specified in the Merger Agreement; (ii) solely to the extent
the condition to Closing set forth in Section 8.2(e) is satisfied (and not
waived by the Buyer) and the applicable affiliate of Merck actually supplies
KEYTRUDA in the manner contemplated by such confirmation, commence a proof of
concept clinical trial of birinapant in combination with KEYTRUDA in solid
tumors (NCT02587962); and (iii) support with reasonable supplies of birinapant
the Jonnson Comprehensive Cancer Center sponsored clinical trial of birinapant
in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in ovarian cancer
(NCT02756130). The parties acknowledge and agree that the remedy for breach by
Buyer of its obligations under this Section 3.4 shall be only as follows,
notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, including Section 7.8: (x) in the
case of a breach by the Buyer of Section 3.4(i), the Buyer shall pay to the
Sellers the amount specified in Milestone 1 under Section 3.2(a); (y) in the
case of a breach by the Buyer of Section 3.4(ii), the Buyer shall pay to the
Sellers 50% of the amount specified in Milestone 4 under Section 3.2(a); and
(z) in the case of a breach by the Buyer of Section 3.4(iii), the Buyer shall
pay to the Sellers 50% of the amount specified in Milestone 4 under Section
3.2(a) (such amounts, collectively, the " _Liquidated Damages_ "). The parties
intend that the Liquidated Damages constitute compensation, and not a penalty.
The parties acknowledge and agree that the Sellers harm caused by the Buyers
breach of this Section 3.4 would be impossible or very difficult to accurately
estimate as of the date hereof, and that the Liquidated Damages are a
reasonable estimate of the anticipated or actual harm that might arise from
the Buyers breach. The Buyers payment of the applicable portion of the
Liquidated Damages is the Sellers sole liability and entire obligation and
the Sellers exclusive remedy for any breach by the Buyer of this Section 3.4.
To the extent all or any portion of the Liquidated Damages becomes payable
hereunder, the breach by the Buyer giving rise to such payment obligation
shall be considered an achievement of such milestone (or the applicable
portion of such milestone) for all purposes hereunder (including Section
3.2(c)). Amounts payable under this Section 3.4 shall be payable in the manner
specified in Section 3.2(b).

purpose entity or person, on the other hand, or any "off balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange

avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, TLOG or any of its Subsidiaries in TLOGs or such Subsidiarys
published financial statements or other TLOG SEC Documents.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Taxes_.

 



 

(a) All Tax Returns relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets that are
required to be filed by any Seller or any of its Affiliates (including any Tax
Returns required to be filed in any jurisdiction by any of the Affiliates
being acquired by the Buyer), either separately or as members of a group of
corporations, on or before the Closing Date have been duly filed on a timely
basis with the appropriate Governmental Authority and all amounts set forth
thereon have been paid in full. All such Tax Returns are true, correct and
complete in all material respects and correctly reflect the taxable income or
loss (or other measure of Tax) of the Sellers and their Affiliates. All Taxes
that are due and payable on or before the Closing Date by the Sellers or any
of their Affiliates with respect to the Business (or as to which the Buyer
could be liable as a transferee or otherwise) have been paid in full and all
deposits required to be made with respect to any such Taxes have been duly
made. The unpaid Taxes of the Sellers or any of their Affiliates (i) did not,
as of the date of the latest balance sheet, exceed the reserves for Tax
Liability set forth on the face of the latest balance sheet, and (ii) will not
exceed the reserve described in clause (i) as adjusted for the passage of time
through the Closing Date in accordance with past custom and practice of the
Sellers or their Affiliates in filing their Tax Returns. No Seller or any of
its Affiliates has waived any statute of limitations or extended the period
for the assessment of collection with respect to any Tax concerning or
attributable to the Business (or as to which the Buyer could be liable as a
transferee or otherwise). There is no material dispute or claim concerning any
Tax liability of the Sellers attributable to the Business or attributable to
any of the Acquired Entities either (i) claimed or raised by any Governmental
Authority in writing or (ii) as to which any of the Sellers has Knowledge. To
the Knowledge of the Sellers, no written claim has been made by any
Governmental Authority in any jurisdiction in which any Seller or its
Affiliates currently does not pay Taxes or file Tax Returns that such Seller
or its Affiliates is required to pay Taxes or file Tax Returns with respect to
the Business (or as to which Buyer could be liable as a transferee or
otherwise). There are no Liens on the Purchased Assets with respect to any Tax
other than Permitted Encumbrances.

 



 

(b) Each Seller and its Affiliates: (i) have complied with all applicable
legal and information reporting requirements with respect to payments made to
employees and third parties and the withholding and payment of withheld Taxes
with respect to the Business (or as to which the Buyer could be liable as a
transferee or otherwise) and timely paid over to the proper Governmental
Authorities all amounts required to be so withheld and paid over for all
periods in the manner required by any applicable Legal Requirement, and (ii)
have duly collected and remitted any sales, value-added and similar Taxes
required to be collected and remitted with respect to the Business (or as to
which the Buyer could be liable as a transferee or otherwise), except for any
items described in (i) and (ii) that are not yet due to be paid or remitted.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) There is no Tax sharing agreement, Tax allocation agreement, Tax indemnity
or assumption obligation or similar written or unwritten agreement,
arrangement, understanding or practice with respect to Taxes to which any
Seller or any of its Affiliates is a party, subject, obligated or bound in any
manner under which the Buyer could be liable for or become obligated to pay
Taxes. No Purchased Asset is: (i) "tax-exempt use property" within the meaning
of Section 168(h) of the Code, or (ii) secures any debt the interest on which
is exempt from tax under Section 103 of the Code.

 



 

(d) No Seller or any of Affiliates is subject to withholding under Section
1445 of the Code or subject to Code Section 1446 (or any similar state law
withholding requirements) or subject to withholding on any portion of the
Purchase Price in any foreign jurisdiction, including, but not limited to, the
United Kingdom or Australia, and, at the Closing Date, each Seller shall
deliver to the Buyer a certificate or certificates to that effect. To the
extent any withholding is required, any amount withheld shall be treated as
paid to the Seller.

 



 

Section 5.12 _No Bankruptcy_. There are no Proceedings by or before any
Governmental Authority or any Proceeding pending, or threatened in writing
against any Seller or Acquired Entity, or any of their respective properties,
including outstanding federal and state tax liens, garnishments or insolvency
or bankruptcy proceedings and proceedings affecting its business and
properties, or the ownership, management, repair, use, occupancy, possession
or operation thereof. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no
Seller or any of the Acquired Entities or anyone acting on their behalf has
filed or maintained or caused or permitted to be filed or maintained any
petition for protection under the Bankruptcy Code for or against any Seller or
any Acquired Entity; and (ii) to the Knowledge of the Sellers, none of the
creditors or any other Person has filed or maintained or caused or threatened
to file any voluntary or involuntary petition under the Bankruptcy Code for or
against any Seller or any Acquired Entity. Each Seller acknowledges and agrees
that the Purchase Price to be paid hereunder is reasonably equivalent to the
value of the Purchased Assets.

 



 

Section 5.13 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_ **. **Since June 30, 2016,

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the Business has been
conducted in the ordinary course of business and there has not been or
occurred:

 



 

(a) any Material Adverse Effect or any event, condition, change or effect that
could reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect; or

 



 

(b) any event, condition, action or effect that, if taken during the period
from the date of this Agreement through the Closing, would constitute a breach
of Section 7.1.

_Insurance Policies_ "); and (b) with respect to the Business, the Purchased
Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, a list of all pending claims and the claims
history for the Business since January 1, 2013. No Seller or any of its
Affiliates has received any written notice of cancellation of, premium
increase with respect to, or alteration of coverage under, any of such
Insurance Policies. All premiums due on such Insurance Policies have either
been paid or, if not yet due, accrued. All such Insurance Policies (a) are in
full force and effect and enforceable in accordance with their terms; and (b)
have not been subject to any lapse in coverage. No Seller or any of its
Affiliates is in default under, or has otherwise failed to comply with, in any
material respect, any provision contained in any such Insurance Policy. The
Insurance Policies are of the type and in the amounts customarily carried by
Persons conducting a business similar to the Business and are sufficient for
compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements and Contracts to which any
Seller or any of

 



      
 

 



 

its Affiliates is a party or by which it is bound. True and complete copies of
the Insurance Policies have been made available to the Buyer.

agree upon an allocation of the sum of the Purchase Price and the Assumed
Liabilities (and any adjustments thereof) among the Purchased Assets as of the

Allocation on or prior to the Closing Date, the parties shall appoint by
mutual agreement the office of an impartial nationally recognized firm of
independent certified public accountants that has not been retained by any
Seller or the Buyer in the past three (3) years who, acting as experts and not
arbitrators, shall resolve any disputes with respect to the Allocation. Except
as otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirements, the Buyer and the
Sellers shall report for all Tax purposes all transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in a manner consistent with the Allocation, if any, and shall
not take any position inconsistent therewith in any Tax Return, in any refund
claim, in any litigation or otherwise.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Adjustments to Purchase Price_. Any payments made in accordance with this
Agreement (including payments made pursuant to Section 3.2, 3.3 and
indemnification payments) shall be treated as Purchase Price adjustments for
Tax purposes.

 



 

(d) _Proration of Taxes_. For a Straddle Period, the portion of any personal
property Taxes and real property Taxes that shall be deemed to be payable for
the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date shall be the amount of
such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on
an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding
period) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in the period ending on (and including) the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire period. The
portion of any other Taxes for a Straddle Period (including income Taxes,
sales and use Taxes and Taxes based on gross or net receipts or payments) that
shall be deemed to be payable for the portion of the period ending on the
Closing Date shall be determined based on a closing of the books as of the
Closing Date, provided that all permitted allowances, exemptions and
deductions that are normally computed on the basis of an entire year or period
(such as depreciation and amortization deductions) shall accrue on a daily
basis and shall be allocated in proportion to the number of days in each such
period.

 



 

(e) _Amended Returns and Retroactive Elections_. Except as required by
applicable Legal Requirement, the Sellers shall not, and shall not cause or
permit the Acquired Entities to, (i) amend any Tax Returns (other than related
to Income Taxes) with respect to the Business or the Purchased Assets filed
with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period that has prospective effect to the
period after the Closing, or (ii) make any Tax election for the Acquired
Entities that has prospective effect to the period after the Closing, without
the prior written consent of the Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed. Except as required by applicable Legal
Requirement, the Buyer shall not, and shall not cause or permit the Acquired
Entities to, (i) amend any Tax Returns filed with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period or (ii) make any Tax election that has retroactive effect to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period, in each such case without the prior written consent of the
Sellers, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.

 



 

(f) _Acquired Entity Tax Returns_.

 



 

(i) Prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall, or shall cause the Acquired
Entities to, prepare and file, on a timely basis and on a basis consistent
with past practice, all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by any of
the Acquired Entities (taking account of extensions) prior to the Closing Date
and shall cause the Acquired Entities to pay all Taxes with respect thereto.

 



 

(ii) The Buyer shall timely prepare or cause to be prepared and will file or
cause to be filed any Tax Returns for the Acquired Entities that are due after
the Closing Date. The Sellers and the Buyer will, if permitted by applicable
Legal Requirement, close the taxable period of each Acquired Entity as of the
close of business on the Closing Date. Except as otherwise required by
applicable Legal Requirement, neither the Sellers nor the Buyer shall take any
position inconsistent with the preceding sentence on any Tax Return. Any such
Tax Returns that relates to a Straddle Period shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the respective Acquired Entitys past practice, except as
otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirement. The Buyer shall deliver to
the Sellers for their review a draft of each Tax Return of each Acquired
Entity to be filed after the Closing Date which may give rise to any Tax
liability of any Seller or any Tax liability of each Acquired Entity for which
any Seller is liable under to this Agreement not fewer than thirty (30) days
prior to the deadline for filing such Tax Return (including extensions). The
Sellers shall notify the Buyer in writing if they reasonably object to any
portion of the draft Tax Return within fifteen (15) days after the draft Tax
Return is delivered to the Sellers, and such notice of objection shall specify
with particularity any such items and state the specific factual or legal
basis for any such objection. If the Buyer does not receive a written
objection by the end of

 



      
 

 



 

the fifteen (15)-day period, the Buyer may file the applicable Tax Return. If
the Sellers notify the Buyer that they reasonably object to any portion of the
draft Tax Return on or before the end of such review period, the Buyer and the
Sellers shall negotiate in good faith and use commercially reasonable efforts
to resolve such dispute. Any disagreements regarding the draft Tax Returns
that are not resolved within another fifteen (15) days by the parties shall be
resolved by an independent third party nationally recognized certified public
accounting firm that is acceptable to both parties, and any determination by
such independent certified public accountant shall be final. The costs, fees
and expenses of the independent certified public accountant shall be borne
equally by the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand. The
Sellers shall pay the Buyer for any Taxes that are the responsibility of the
Sellers pursuant to this Agreement (and payable by the Buyer or the Acquired
Entities to the applicable Governmental Authority) within five (5) days after
such amount is agreed upon by the applicable parties (or finally determined)
as contemplated by Section 7.6.

 



 

(g) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Buyer and the Sellers shall fully cooperate,
to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, with respect to the
filing of Tax Returns, filing of Tax elections, and any audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and provision of records and information relevant to such audit,
litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information. Buyer and the Sellers
agree to retain records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Acquired
Entities until the expiration of the relevant statute of limitations. Buyer
and the Sellers further agree to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain
any certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that may be imposed.

Buyer in writing, any of the Purchased Assets (including software) that can be
transmitted to the Buyer electronically will be so delivered to the Buyer
promptly following the Closing and will not be delivered to the Buyer on any
tangible medium. Promptly following any electronic transmission, the Sellers
shall execute and deliver to the Buyer a certificate in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Buyer and containing, at a minimum, the following
information: (i) the date of transmission; (ii) the time the transmission was
commenced and concluded; (iii) the name of the individual who made the

possession of the Purchased Assets, and, at the Buyers expense, to transfer
the same to a location specified by the Buyer as promptly as practicable
following the Closing. Each Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and
Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with the Buyer in connection with the
foregoing.

 



 

(c) After the Closing, if the Sellers or any of their Affiliates receives any
payment, refund or other amount which is or relates to a Purchased Asset or
which is otherwise properly due and owing to the Buyer, the Sellers shall
promptly remit, or shall cause to be remitted, such amount to the Buyer. The
Sellers shall promptly endorse and deliver to the Buyer any notes, checks,
negotiable instruments or other documents which are or relate to Purchased
Assets or are otherwise properly due and owing to the Buyer, and the Buyer
shall have the right and authority to endorse, without recourse, the names of
the Sellers on any such instrument or document. After the Closing, if the

which is properly due and owing to the Sellers, the Buyer shall promptly
remit, or shall cause to be remitted, such amount to the Sellers. The Buyer
shall promptly endorse and deliver to the Sellers any notes, checks,

Section 7.8 _Indemnification._

 



 

(a) Each Seller shall indemnify and hold Buyer and its Affiliates, and their
employees, officers and directors harmless against any loss, damages, action,
suit, claim, demand, liability, expense (including reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses), bodily injury, death or property damage (a " _Loss_ "), that
may be brought, instituted or arise against or be incurred by such persons to
the extent such Loss is based on or arises out of (i) any Excluded Asset or
Excluded Liability or the conduct of the Business prior to the Closing, (ii)
the breach by either Seller of any of its covenants set forth in this
Agreement, (iii) the breach by either Seller of any of its representations or
warranties set forth in this Agreement, or (iv) the development, manufacture,
use, sale, storage or handling of a drug substance or a drug product prior to
the Closing by the Sellers or their Affiliates or their representatives,
agents or subcontractors, or any actual or alleged violation of Legal
Requirement resulting therefrom; provided however, that the foregoing
indemnification shall not apply to any Loss to the extent such Loss is caused
by the willful misconduct of the Buyer or its Affiliates.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall indemnify and hold the Sellers, and their Affiliates, and
their employees, officers and directors harmless against any Loss that may be
brought, instituted or arise against or be incurred by such persons to the
extent such Loss is based on or arises out of:

 



 

(i) the development, manufacture, use, sale, storage or handling of a drug
substance or a drug product after the Closing by the Buyer or its Affiliates
or their representatives, agents or subcontractors, or any actual or alleged
violation of Legal Requirement resulting therefrom; or

 



 

(ii) the breach by the Buyer of any of its covenants set forth in this
Agreement;

 



 

(iii) the breach by the Buyer of any of its representations and warranties set
forth in this Agreement;

 



 

provided however, that the foregoing indemnification shall not apply to any
Loss to the extent such Loss is caused by the willful misconduct of Seller or
its Affiliates.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary: (i) (A)
the Sellers shall not have liability under Section 7.8(a) until the aggregate
amount of the Loss to be indemnified to the Buyer exceeds an amount equal to
One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) (the " _Threshold Amount_ ") in which
event the Sellers shall be responsible for the aggregate amount of Loss in
excess of the Threshold Amount up to the Indemnification Cap (as defined
below) and (B) the maximum aggregate liability of the Sellers under Section
7.8(a) shall be an amount equal to the aggregate of One Million, Two Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($1,200,000) (the " _Indemnification Cap_ "); and (ii) (A)
the Buyer shall not have liability under Section 7.8(b) until the aggregate
amount of the Loss to be indemnified to the Sellers exceed and amount equal to
the Threshold Amount in which event the Buyer shall be responsible for the
aggregate amount of Loss in excess of the Threshold Amount up to the
Indemnification Cap and (B) the maximum aggregate liability of the Buyer under
Section 7.8(b) shall be an amount equal to the Indemnification Cap; provided,
however, that the foregoing limitations in this clause (c) shall not apply to
any Loss based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of (w) any
claim for indemnity under Section 7.8(a)(iii) in respect of any inaccuracy in
or breach of any Fundamental Representation, (x) fraud, (y) a claim for
indemnity under Section 7.8(a)(i) with respect to the Excluded Liabilities
described in

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.4(a) or under Section 7.8(a)(iii) in respect of any inaccuracy in or
breach of any representation and warranty in Section 5.11, or (z) a claim for
indemnity under Section 7.8(a)(ii) or Section 7.8(b)(ii) in respect of a
breach of any of the covenants set forth in Section 7.7(c) or Section 7.11.

 



 

(d) Each party entitled to be indemnified by the other party (an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") pursuant to Section 7.8(a) or 7.8(b) shall give notice
to the other party (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") promptly after such
Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of any threatened or asserted claim as
to which indemnity may be sought, and shall permit the Indemnifying Party to
assume the defense of any such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom;
provided that:

 



 

(i) counsel for the Indemnifying Party, who shall conduct the defense of such
claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, shall be approved by the
Indemnified Party (whose approval shall not unreasonably be withheld) and the
Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at such partys expense
(unless (i) the employment of counsel by such Indemnified Party has been
authorized by the Indemnifying Party; or (ii) the Indemnified Party shall have
reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party in the defense of such action, in
each of which cases the Indemnifying Party shall pay the reasonable fees and
expenses of one law firm serving as counsel for the Indemnified Party, which
law firm shall be subject to approval, not to be unreasonably withheld, by the
Indemnifying Party); and

 



 

(ii) The failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this
Agreement to the extent that the failure to give notice did not materially
prejudice the Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(iii) No Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation,
shall, except with the approval of each Indemnified Party, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, consent to entry
of any judgment or enter into any settlement which (1) would result in
injunctive or other relief being imposed against the Indemnified Party; or (2)
does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant
or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in
respect to such claim or litigation.

 



 

(iv) Each Indemnified Party shall furnish such information regarding itself or
the claim in question as an Indemnifying Party may reasonably request in
writing and shall be reasonably required in connection with the defense of
such claim and litigation resulting therefrom.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7.8(d),
following the winding up or dissolution of any Seller, such Seller shall not
have the right to assume the defense of any threatened or asserted claim for
which indemnification is sought, except that a successor which was created
primarily for tax planning purposes or to change a Sellers business form or
jurisdiction may assume the defense of any such claim or litigation resulting
therefrom.

 



 

(e) Buyer may, at its sole discretion, claim any payment (or any portion
thereof) to which it is finally determined to be entitled pursuant to Section
7.8(g) directly from either Seller or any amounts due to the Sellers under
Section 3.2 or Section 3.3, and in the latter case may set-off such payment
against such amounts. This right of set-off shall not be Buyers sole remedy
for amounts owed pursuant to this Section 7.8, and nothing contained herein
shall limit Buyers right to insist on payment directly from a Seller as set
forth in this Section 7.8.

 



 

(f) The representations, warranties and covenants of the Indemnifying Party,
and the Indemnified Partys right to indemnification with respect thereto,
shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of any investigation made by
or on behalf of the Indemnified Party (including by any of its

 



      
 

 



 

Representatives) or by reason of the fact that the Indemnified Party or any of
its Representatives should have known that any such representation or warranty
is, was or might be inaccurate or by reason of the Indemnified Partys waiver
of any condition set forth in Article VIII, except to the extent the
Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of the inaccuracy of such
representation or warranty. For purposes of this Section 7.8, any inaccuracy
in or breach of any representation or warranty or the amount of indemnifiable
Loss with respect thereto shall be determined without regard to any
materiality, Material Adverse Effect or other similar qualification contained
in or otherwise applicable to such representation or warranty.

 



 

(g) Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party or finally adjudicated
to be payable pursuant to this Section 7.8, the Indemnifying Party shall
satisfy its obligations within ten (10) Business Days of such agreement or
final, non-appealable adjudication by wire transfer of immediately available
funds. The parties hereto agree that should an Indemnifying Party not make
full payment of any such obligations within such ten (10) Business Day period,
any amount payable shall accrue interest from and including the date of
agreement of the Indemnifying Party or final, non-appealable adjudication to
but excluding the date such payment has been made at the prime lending rate
prevailing during such period as published in _The Wall Street Journal,
Eastern Edition_. Any interest payable hereunder shall be calculated on a
daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be paid until (but
excluding) the date of actual payment, and on the basis of a 360-day year.

 



 

Section 7.9 _No Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) TLOG shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall not
authorize or permit its Representatives and its Subsidiaries Representatives
to, directly or indirectly, solicit an Alternative Transaction Proposal or the
making of any proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to any
Alternative Transaction Proposal, or, subject to Section 7.9(b), (i) conduct
or engage in any discussions or negotiations with, disclose any non-public
information relating to TLOG or any of its Subsidiaries to, afford access to
the business, properties, assets, books or records of TLOG or any of its
Subsidiaries to, or knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage
any effort by, any Third Party that is seeking to make, or has made, any
Alternative Transaction Proposal, (ii) (A) amend or grant any waiver or
release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of
equity securities of TLOG or any of its Subsidiaries or (B) approve any
transaction under, or any Third Party becoming an "interested shareholder"
under, Section 203 of the DGCL, other than the Senior Note Conversion, or
(iii) enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other Contract relating to any Alternative
Transaction Proposal (each, a " _TLOG Acquisition Agreement_ "). Subject to
Section 7.9(b), neither the TLOG Board nor any committee thereof shall fail to
make, withdraw, amend, modify or materially qualify, in a manner adverse to
the Buyer, the TLOG Board Recommendation, or recommend an Alternative
Transaction Proposal, fail to recommend against acceptance of any tender offer
or exchange offer for the shares of TLOG Common Stock within ten (10) Business
Days after the commencement of such offer, or make any public statement
inconsistent with the TLOG Board Recommendation, or resolve or agree to take
any of the foregoing actions (any of the foregoing, a " _TLOG Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "). TLOG shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, to
cease immediately and cause to be terminated, and shall not authorize or
knowingly permit any of its Representatives or its Subsidiaries
Representatives to continue, any and all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations, if any, with any Third Party conducted prior to the date hereof
with respect to any Alternative Transaction Proposal and shall terminate any
such Third Partys and its Representatives access to any virtual data room
maintained by the Sellers, including the Project Tulip VDR.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding Section 7.9(a), prior to the receipt of the approval of
the TLOG Shareholders and the TLOG Noteholders Consent (collectively, the "
_Requisite Approvals_ "), the TLOG Board, directly or indirectly through any
Representative, may, subject to Section 7.9(c), (i)

 



      
 

 



 

participate in negotiations or discussions with any Third Party that has made
(and not withdrawn) a bona fide, unsolicited Alternative Transaction Proposal
in writing that the TLOG Board believes in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, (ii) thereafter
furnish to such Third Party non-public information relating to TLOG or any of
its Subsidiaries pursuant to an executed confidentiality agreement that
constitutes an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, (iii) following receipt
of and on account of a Superior Proposal, make a TLOG Adverse Recommendation
Change, and/or (iv) take any action that any court of competent jurisdiction
orders TLOG to take (which order remains unstayed), but in each case referred
to in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv), only if the TLOG Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to cause the TLOG
Board to be in breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Legal
Requirement. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the TLOG Board from
disclosing to TLOGs Shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and
Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an Alternative
Transaction Proposal, if TLOG determines, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that failure to disclose such position would constitute a
violation of applicable Legal Requirement.

 



 

(c) The TLOG Board shall not take any of the actions referred to in clauses
(i) through (iv) of Section 7.9(b) unless TLOG shall have delivered to the
Buyer a prior written notice advising Buyer that it intends to take such
action. TLOG shall notify Buyer promptly (but in no event later than twenty-
four (24) hours) after receipt by TLOG (or any of its Representatives) of any
Alternative Transaction Proposal, any inquiry that would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Alternative Transaction Proposal, any request for non-
public information relating to TLOG or any of its Subsidiaries or for access
to the business, properties, assets, books or records of TLOG or any of its
Subsidiaries by any Third Party. In such notice, TLOG shall identify the Third
Party making, and details of the material terms and conditions of, any such
Alternative Transaction Proposal, indication or request. TLOG shall keep Buyer
fully informed, on a current basis, of the status and material terms of any
such Alternative Transaction Proposal, indication or request, including any
material amendments or proposed amendments as to price and other material
terms thereof. TLOG shall provide Buyer with at least forty-eight (48) hours
prior notice of any meeting of the TLOG Board (or such lesser notice as is
provided to the members of the TLOG Board) at which the TLOG Board is
reasonably expected to consider any Alternative Transaction Proposal. TLOG
shall promptly provide Buyer with a list of any non-public information
concerning TLOGs business, present or future performance, financial condition
or results of operations, provided to any Third Party, and, to the extent such
information has not been previously provided to the Buyer, copies of such
information.

 



 

(d) Except as set forth in this Section 7.9(d), the TLOG Board shall not make
any TLOG Adverse Recommendation Change or enter into (or permit any Subsidiary
to enter into) a TLOG Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at
any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite Approvals, the TLOG Board may
make a TLOG Adverse Recommendation Change or enter into (or permit any
Subsidiary to enter into) a TLOG Acquisition Agreement, if: (i) TLOG promptly
notifies Buyer, in writing, at least five (5) Business Days (the " _Notice
Period_ ") before making a TLOG Adverse Recommendation Change or entering into
(or causing a Subsidiary to enter into) a TLOG Acquisition Agreement, of its
intention to take such action with respect to a Superior Proposal, which
notice shall state expressly that TLOG has received an Alternative Transaction
Proposal that the TLOG Board intends to declare a Superior Proposal and that
the TLOG Board intends to make a TLOG Adverse Recommendation Change and/or
TLOG intends to enter into a TLOG Acquisition Agreement; (ii) TLOG attaches to
such notice the most current version of the proposed agreement (which version
shall be updated on a prompt basis) and the identity of the Third Party making
such Superior Proposal; (iii) TLOG shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
during the Notice Period, negotiate with the Buyer in good faith to make such

 



      
 

 



 

adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Alternative Transaction Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, if
Buyer, in its discretion, proposes to make such adjustments (it being agreed
that in the event that, after commencement of the Notice Period, there is any
material revision to the terms of a Superior Proposal, including, any revision
in price, the Notice Period shall be extended, if applicable, to ensure that
at least three (3) Business Days remains in the Notice Period subsequent to
the time TLOG notifies Buyer of any such material revision (it being
understood that there may be multiple extensions)); and (iv) the TLOG Board
determines in good faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor, that such Alternative Transaction Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal after taking into account any adjustments made
by the Buyer during the Notice Period in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.10 _Shareholders and Noteholders Meetings; Preparation of Proxy
Materials_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms set forth in this Agreement, TLOG shall take all
action necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the TLOG
Shareholders Meeting and obtain the TLOG Noteholders Consent as soon as
reasonably practicable after the date the SEC confirms that it has no further
comments on the TLOG Proxy Statement, and, in connection therewith, TLOG shall
mail the TLOG Proxy Statement to the holders of its Common Stock in advance of
such meeting (and in any event not more than thirty (30) days after the date
hereof). Except to the extent that the TLOG Board shall have effected a TLOG
Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by Section 7.9(b) hereof, the TLOG
Proxy Statement shall include the TLOG Board Recommendation. Subject to
Section 7.9 hereof, TLOG shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
solicit from (A) the holders of TLOG Common Stock proxies in favor of the
approval of the transactions contemplated hereby and (B) the holders of TLOG
Senior Notes consent to the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) take all
other actions necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the
holders of TLOG Common Stock and TLOG Senior Notes required by applicable
Legal Requirement to obtain such approval or consent. TLOG shall keep Buyer
updated with respect to proxy solicitation results as requested Buyer.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, TLOG may, in
its sole discretion, adjourn, recess or postpone the TLOG Shareholders Meeting
(i) to the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the
TLOG Proxy Statement required by applicable Legal Requirement is provided to
the TLOG Shareholders within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the
TLOG Shareholders Meeting, (ii) if as of the time for which the TLOG
Shareholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the TLOG Proxy
Statement) there are insufficient shares of TLOG capital stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business of the TLOG Shareholders Meeting, or (iii) to solicit additional
proxies if TLOG reasonably believes it may be necessary to obtain TLOG
stockholder approval. TLOG shall not be required to hold the TLOG Shareholders
Meeting or obtain the TLOG Noteholders Consent if this Agreement is terminated
before such meeting is held or consent received.

 



 

(c) None of the information included or incorporated by reference in the
letter to the TLOG Shareholders or the TLOG Noteholders, notice of meeting,
proxy statement and forms of proxy (collectively, the " _TLOG Proxy Statement_
"), to be filed with the SEC in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, will, at the date it is first mailed to the TLOG
Shareholders or at the time of the TLOG Shareholders Meeting or at the time of
any amendment or supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
representation or warranty is made by TLOG with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by the Buyer
expressly for inclusion or

 



       
 

 



 

incorporation by reference in the TLOG Proxy Statement. The TLOG Proxy
Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act.

 



 

(d) In connection with the TLOG Shareholders Meeting, as soon as reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement TLOG shall prepare and file
the TLOG Proxy Statement with the SEC. The Buyer and the Sellers will
cooperate and consult with each other in the preparation of the TLOG Proxy
Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Buyer will
furnish TLOG the information relating to the Buyer required by the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in
the TLOG Proxy Statement. TLOG shall not file the TLOG Proxy Statement, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, without providing Buyer a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon (which comments shall be reasonably
considered by TLOG). TLOG shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve, and each party agrees to consult and cooperate with the other party
in resolving, all SEC comments with respect to the TLOG Proxy Statement as
promptly as practicable after receipt thereof and to cause the TLOG Proxy
Statement in definitive form to be cleared by the SEC and mailed to the TLOG
Shareholders and TLOG Noteholders as promptly as reasonably practicable
following filing with the SEC. TLOG agrees to consult with the Buyer prior to
responding to SEC comments with respect to the preliminary TLOG Proxy
Statement. Each of Buyer and the Sellers agrees to correct any information
provided by it for use in the TLOG Proxy Statement which shall have become
false or misleading and TLOG shall promptly prepare and mail to its
shareholders an amendment or supplement setting forth such correction. TLOG
shall as soon as reasonably practicable (i) notify Buyer of the receipt of any
comments from the SEC with respect to the TLOG Proxy Statement and any request
by the SEC for any amendment to the TLOG Proxy Statement or for additional
information and (ii) provide Buyer with copies of all written correspondence
between TLOG and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the
other hand, with respect to the TLOG Proxy Statement.

 



 

Section 7.11 _Intercompany Payables and Other Arrangements_. On or prior to
the Closing, the Sellers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, take such
action as may be necessary to terminate, prior to or concurrently with the
Closing, the intercompany payables and other obligations between any Seller or
any Affiliate of any Seller (other than the Acquired Entities), on the one
hand, and any of the Acquired Entities, on the other hand, and to take or
cause to be taken the other actions described in Schedule 7.11.

 



 

Section 7.12 _Continuation of Shape Phase II Clinical Trial_. From the date
hereof and until the Closing, the Sellers shall, and shall cause their
Affiliates to, (a) use commercially reasonable efforts to continue the SHAPE
Phase II Clinical Trial in a manner substantially similar to the manner being
conducted as of the date of this Agreement and (b) pay as they become due all
accrued amounts to the applicable contract research organization in connection
therewith as described in Schedule 7.12 attached hereto. On or prior to the
Closing Date, the Sellers shall pay or cause to be paid all expenses of the
type described in Schedule 7.12(iii). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, in the event this Agreement is terminated prior to the
Closing for any reason other than pursuant to Section 9.1(g) or Section
9.1(h), promptly following such termination, the Buyer shall (x) reimburse the
Sellers for expenses of the type described in Schedule 7.12(iv) to the extent
such amounts have actually been paid to the applicable contract research
organization as of the date of such termination (and any such payment shall be
made consistent with the procedures described in Section 7.8(g)) and (y) pay
the applicable contract research organization directly for any accrued but
unpaid expenses of the type described in Schedule 7.12(iv) as of the date of
such termination.

terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(c) on account of such
inaccuracy or breach: (A) during the ten Business Day period commencing on the
date on which the Sellers receive notice of such inaccuracy or breach; or (B)
after such ten Business Day period if such inaccuracy or breach shall have
been fully cured during such period in a manner that does not result in a
material breach of any covenant or obligation of the Sellers;

 



 

(f) the Sellers or the Buyer, if (x) any Legal Requirement shall be enacted
that makes consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby illegal or
otherwise prohibited, or (y) consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby would violate any nonappealable final order, decree or judgment of any
court or Governmental Authority having competent jurisdiction; provided,
however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section

warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement has been the cause

such Legal Requirement;
