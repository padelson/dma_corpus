 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

 



 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " ** _Agreement_** "), dated September
15, 2015, is entered into by and among GTT Communications, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" ** _Parent_** "), Global Telecom and Technology Americas, Inc., a
Virginia corporation (" ** _Purchaser_** "), Duo Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" ** _Merger Sub_** "), One Source Networks Inc., a Texas
corporation (the " ** _Company_** "), Ernest Cunningham, as the representative
of Equityholders (the " ** _Shareholder Representative_** "), and, solely for
the purposes of _Sections 4.5_, _5.3_ , _5.4_ , _8.9_ and _Article X_, the
Key Shareholders. Parent, Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Company and the
Shareholder Representative are sometimes referred to herein individually as a
" ** _Party_** " and, collectively, as the " ** _Parties_** ". Capitalized
terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in
_Annex A_.

 



 

 **RECITALS:**

 



 

A. The outstanding equity securities of the Company as of the date hereof
consist of: (1) 20,090,501 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Company (the " ** _Company Common Stock_** ") (such shares,
collectively, the " ** _Shares_** "), (2) warrants to purchase up to 4,739,049
shares of Common Stock (such warrants, collectively, the " ** _Warrants_** ")
and (3) 930,000 shares subject to Phantom Stock Agreements (the " ** _Phantom
Stock Agreements_** ") (such shares, collectively, the " ** _Participation
Shares_** ").

 



 

B. Purchaser desires to acquire the Company through the merger (the " **
_Merger_** ") of Merger Sub with and into the Company pursuant to the Texas
Business Organizations Code (the " ** _TBOC_** ") and the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the " ** _DGCL_** "), with the Company being the surviving
corporation in the Merger.

 



 

C. The Board of Directors of each of Parent, Purchaser, Merger Sub and the
Company have each determined that it is advisable for, and in the best
interest of, their respective shareholders for Purchaser to acquire the
Company through the Merger, after which the Company shall be a wholly owned
subsidiary of Purchaser.

 



 

 **AGREEMENT:**

 



 

Now, therefore, in consideration of the premises and the representations and
warranties and mutual covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound, the Parties
agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I 
MERGER**

 



 

Section 1.1 _Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
and in accordance with the TBOC and the DGCL, at and as of the Effective Time,
Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company and the separate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation after the Merger (the " ** _Surviving Corporation_** "). At and as
of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent.

      
 

 



 

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " ** _Closing_** ")
shall take place: (a) at the offices of Goodwin Procter LLP, located at 901
New York Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20001, (b) at 10:00 a.m. (New York time) on
the later of October 22, 2015 or the fourth (4th) Business Day after the date
on which the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in
_Article VI_ (other than conditions which, by their nature, are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the waiver or satisfaction of those
conditions) has been satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement; or
(c) at such other place, time and date as Purchaser and the Company shall
mutually agree in writing. The " ** _Closing Date_** " shall be the date upon
which the Closing occurs.

 



 

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective by the filing
with the Secretary of State of the State of Texas in accordance with the TBOC
and the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the
DGCL of certificates of merger in the forms attached hereto as _Exhibit A_
(the " ** _Certificates of Merger_** ") on the Closing Date. The time at which
the Merger becomes effective, which shall be the time that the Secretary of
State of Delaware accepts the Certificate of Merger for filing, is referred to
as the " ** _Effective Time_** ".

 



 

Section 1.4 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the TBOC and the
DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,
at the Effective Time:

 



 

(a) _General Effect_. All the property, rights, privileges, powers, franchises
and assets of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations and duties of the Company
and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations and duties of
the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) _Certificate of Formation_. The certificate of formation of the Company,
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended so that
Section 3 thereof reads in its entirety as follows: "The aggregate number of
shares of capital stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue is
1,000, par value $0.01 per share, designated Common Stock. Each share of such
Common Stock shall have identical rights and privileges in every respect." As
so amended, such certificate of formation shall be the certificate of
formation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as
provided therein or by applicable Law.

 



 

(c) _Bylaws_. The bylaws of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 



 

(d) _Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

 



 

(e) _Officers_. The officers of the Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 1.5 _Treatment of Equity Interests_. As of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any Party hereto,
the following shall occur:

 



 

(a) _Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of the Merger Subs capital stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) _Treatment of Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any Dissenting
Shares) shall convert into the right to receive, from Purchaser, the Closing
Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest, and, from or at the
direction of Shareholder Representative in accordance with _Schedule 1.5_ ,
any amounts that may become payable in respect of such share of Company Common
Stock in the future from the Escrow Amount, the Shareholder Representative
Deposit Amount or in respect of any post-closing merger consideration
adjustment pursuant to _Section 1.11_ (the " ** _Post-Closing Adjustment_**
"), at the respective times and subject to the contingencies specified herein.
All such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist at the
Effective Time, and each certificate previously evidencing any such shares
shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
The holders of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall from and after the Effective
Time cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common
Stock, except payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Treatment of Participation Shares_. In accordance with the terms of each
Phantom Stock Agreement, the Phantom Stock Agreements and each unvested
Participation Share shall be terminated immediately prior to the Closing (but
conditioned upon consummation of the Closing), and each vested Participation
Share shall entitle the holder thereof to receive from the Company only the
amount set forth on _Schedule 1.5_ with respect to such Participation Share
(subject to withholding pursuant to _Section 1.12_).

 



 

(d) _Treatment of Warrants_ _._ Each Warrant outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be assigned to Purchaser in exchange for the right to
receive, without interest, for each share of Common Stock receivable upon
exercise in full thereof (assuming satisfaction of all conditions to exercise
thereunder), (i) (A) the Closing Per Share Merger Consideration less (B) the
per share exercise price of such Warrant (the " ** _Closing Warrant
Consideration_** "), and (ii) from or at the direction of Shareholder
Representative in accordance with _Schedule 1.5_ , such Warrant holders share
of the Escrow Amount, the Shareholder Representative Deposit Amount or the
Post-Closing Adjustment, in each case if any, which share (represented as a
percentage) and Allocation Percentage is set forth on _Schedule 1.5_. Each
Warrant, when so terminated, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and each holder of such Warrant shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
foregoing payments for each share of Company Common Stock that would have been
receivable upon exercise in full thereof.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _Allocation of Merger Consideration_. Each Equityholders Allocation
Percentage and share (represented as a percentage) of (i) the Merger
Consideration payable by Purchaser and (ii) any amounts released by or at the
direction of Shareholder Representative from the Escrow Amount, the
Shareholder Representative Deposit Fund or with respect to any Post-Closing
Adjustment is set forth on _Schedule 1.5_, which may be updated by the
Company at any time prior to delivery of the Estimated Closing Statement (but
not to increase or decrease the aggregate percentages shown thereon ( _i.e.,_
the aggregate percentages must remain at 100%)). Except as expressly provided
in this Agreement or in the Escrow Agreement, no interest shall be paid or
accrued for the benefit of the Equityholders on the Merger Consideration.

 



 

Section 1.6 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, including _Section 1.5(b)_, Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a
holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented
thereto in writing and who has properly exercised dissenters rights of such
Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 10.356 of the TBOC (such
Company Common Stock being referred to collectively as the " ** _Dissenting
Shares_** " until such time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses
such holders dissenters rights under the TBOC with respect to such Company
Common Stock) shall not be converted into a right to receive a portion of the
Merger Consideration, but instead shall be entitled to only such rights as are
granted by Subchapter H of Chapter 10 of the TBOC; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or
loses such holders right to appraisal pursuant to Subchapter H of Chapter 10
of the TBOC or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Subchapter H of Chapter 10 of
the TBOC, such shares of Company Common Stock shall be treated as if they had
been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the portion
of the Merger Consideration, if any, to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to _Section 1.5(b)_, without interest thereon. The Company shall provide
Purchaser prompt notice of exercise of dissenters rights delivered to the
Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the TBOC, and, in any event
shall provide such notice prior to the Effective Time. The Company agrees that
prior to the Effective Time it will not, except with the prior written consent
of Purchaser, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any Dissenting
Shares, or settle or offer to settle with any holder of Dissenting Shares.

 



 

Section 1.7 _Surrender and Payment_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, all Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and, subject to _Section 1.6_, each holder of a
certificate formerly representing any Company Common Stock (each, a " **
_Certificate_** ") shall cease to have any rights as a shareholder of the

that (I) the aggregate amount to be paid to each Compensatory Holder and (II)
the amount of any Transaction Payroll Taxes owed by the Company as a result of
such payments to such Compensatory Holder shall instead by paid to the Company

each Warrant shall not be transferable on the books of the Surviving
Corporation after the Effective Time, and shall be deemed from and after the
Effective Time, for all purposes, to evidence the right to receive the portion

there shall be no transfers on the stock or warrant transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of Shares or Warrants which were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If after the Effective Time any Certificate or
Warrant is delivered to Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation it shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Section 1.7_.

 



 

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Warrant is
registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) such Certificate
or Warrant shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for
transfer, and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to Purchaser
any transfer or other Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Warrant or establish
to the reasonable satisfaction of Purchaser that such Tax has been paid or is
not payable.

 



 

(d) Each holder of a Certificate or Warrant who has not theretofore complied
with the exchange procedures set forth in and contemplated by this _Section
1.7_ shall look only to Purchaser (subject to abandoned property, escheat and
similar applicable Law) for its claim, only as a general unsecured creditor
thereof, to any portion of the Merger Consideration payable or issuable
pursuant to this Agreement in respect of such Certificate or Warrant.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if any Certificate
or Warrant has not been surrendered prior to the earlier of the first
anniversary of the Effective Time and such date on which the applicable
portion of the Merger Consideration payable or issuable pursuant to this
Agreement in respect of such Certificate or Warrant would otherwise escheat
to, or become the property of, any Governmental Authority, any amounts payable
in respect of such Certificate or Warrant shall, to the extent permitted by
Law, become the property of Purchaser, free and clear of all claims or
interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

Section 1.8 _Determination of Merger Consideration_. The aggregate
consideration for the Merger shall be: (a) One Hundred Seventy-Five Million
Dollars and 00/100 ($175,000,000.00), (b) _plus_ the Closing Date Cash, if

if any, of any Closing Indebtedness that is not Funded Debt and (f) _minus_
the amount of any Unpaid Taxes, in each case as set forth in the Estimated

with this Agreement, including _Section 1.11(f)_.

 



 

Section 1.11 _Post-Closing Merger Consideration Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall prepare and deliver to the Shareholder Representative a statement (the "
** _Closing Statement_** ") setting forth Purchasers good faith determination
of: (i) the Net Working Capital; (ii) the Closing Date Cash, (iii) the Closing
Date Indebtedness, (iv) the Closing Date Company Transaction Expenses, (v) any
Unpaid Taxes and (vi) the amount by which (A) the sum (which may be a negative
number) of the Net Working Capital (which may be a negative number), plus the
Closing Date Cash, minus the Closing Date Indebtedness, minus the Closing Date
Company Transaction Expenses and minus any Unpaid Taxes, in each case as shown
on the Closing Statement, exceeds or is less than (B) the sum (which may be a
negative number) of the Net Working Capital (which may be a negative number),
plus the Closing Date Cash, minus the Closing Date Indebtedness, minus the
Closing Date Company Transaction Expenses and minus the Unpaid Taxes, in each
case as shown on the Estimated Closing Statement (the amount of such excess
(including any decrease in a negative sum) being a " ** _Net Increase_** ",
and the amount of such shortfall (including any increase in a negative sum)
being a " ** _Net Decrease_** "), which statement shall also set forth in
reasonable detail Purchasers calculation of such amounts in the preceding
_clauses (i)_ through _(v)_. The Closing Statement and the determinations and
calculations contained therein shall be prepared in accordance with this
Agreement, including _Section 1.11(f)_.

 



 

(b) During the thirty (30) day period following the Shareholder
Representatives receipt of the Closing Statement, Purchaser shall cause the
Company to afford the Shareholder Representative and its representatives
reasonable opportunity to review the necessary books and records of the
Company relating to the preparation of the Closing Statement and discuss the
same with appropriate Company employees, in each case as reasonably requested
by the Shareholder Representative in connection with its review of the Closing
Statement; _provided_ that any such access will be at reasonable times, upon
reasonable notice and will not unduly interfere with the Companys normal
business operations.

 



 

(c) If the Shareholder Representative disagrees with the calculations set
forth on the Closing Statement, the Shareholder Representative may, within
thirty (30) days following delivery of the Closing Statement to the
Shareholder Representative, deliver to Purchaser written notice (the " **
_Objection Notice_** ") of its objections to any item contained in the Closing
Statement, which notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for
each such disagreement and the Shareholder Representatives determination of
the Net Increase or Net Decrease, as applicable. The Shareholder
Representative may only deliver one Objection Notice. If the Shareholder

 



      
 

 



 

Representative does not deliver an Objection Notice within such thirty (30)
day period, the Equityholders and the Shareholder Representative shall be
conclusively deemed to have waived any right to object to the Closing
Statement delivered by Purchaser and the Closing Statement shall become final
and binding on the Parties upon expiration of such thirty (30) day period. If
the Shareholder Representative delivers to Purchaser an Objection Notice
within such thirty (30) day period, Purchaser and the Shareholder
Representative shall endeavor in good faith to resolve the objections, for a
period not to exceed fifteen (15) days from the date of delivery of the
Objection Notice.

 



 

(d) If Purchaser and the Shareholder Representative resolve all of the
disputed items in the Objection Notice within fifteen (15) days following
Purchasers receipt of the Objection Notice (or such longer period as
Purchaser and the Shareholder Representative may mutually agree in writing),
the Closing Statement shall be revised to reflect such resolution, and as so
revised shall be final and binding on the Parties. If at the end of such
fifteen (15) day period (or such longer period as Purchaser and the
Shareholder Representative may mutually agree in writing) there are any
objections that remain in dispute regarding the items detailed in the
Objection Notice, then the remaining objections in dispute shall be submitted,
but only such matters and amounts that were included in the Objection Notice
and not then resolved in writing by Purchaser and the Shareholder
Representative, for resolution to Duff and Phelps or if Duff and Phelps is unable
or unwilling to take such assignment, a nationally recognized accounting firm
to be selected jointly by the Shareholder Representative and Purchaser or, if
Purchaser and the Shareholder Representative cannot agree on an accounting
firm within thirty (30) days after timely delivery of the Objection Notice,
each of Purchaser and the Shareholder Representative shall select a nationally
recognized accounting firm and such two accounting firms shall designate a
third nationally recognized accounting firm that neither presently is, nor in
the past three years has been, engaged by any Party or their Affiliates. Duff
and Phelps, the accounting firm so agreed to by Purchaser and the Shareholder
Representative or the third accounting firm so selected by the two accounting
firms is hereinafter referred to as the " ** _Accounting Firm_** ". The
Accounting Firm shall act as experts and not arbitrators and shall decide all
issues set forth in the Objection Notice that remain disputed by the Parties
and required to be decided in order for the Accounting Firm to make its final
determination of the Net Working Capital, Closing Date Cash, Closing Date
Indebtedness and Closing Date Company Transaction Expenses, including issues
of contract construction, identification of the issues that are disputed by
the Parties, and whether an issue is subject to determination by the
Accounting Firm. In resolving the items in the Objection Notice that are still
in dispute and in determining the Net Working Capital, Closing Date Cash,
Closing Date Indebtedness or Closing Date Company Transaction Expenses, the
Accounting Firm shall (i) not assign to any item in dispute a value that is
(A) greater than the greatest value for such item assigned by Purchaser, on
the one hand, or the Shareholder Representative, on the other hand, or (B)
less than the smallest value for such item assigned by Purchaser, on the one
hand, or the Shareholder Representative, on the other hand, (ii) make its
determination based on an independent review (which will be in accordance with
the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement), (iii) at the
Accounting Firms discretion, hold a one-day conference concerning the
dispute, at which conference each of Purchaser and the Shareholder
Representative shall have the right to present their respective positions with
respect to the dispute and have present their respective advisors, counsel and
accountants, (iv) render a final resolution in writing to Purchaser and the
Shareholder Representative (which final resolution shall be delivered not more
than forty-five (45) days following submission of such

 



      
 

 



 

disputed matters), which shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties
with respect to the Net Working Capital, Closing Date Cash, Closing Date
Indebtedness and Closing Date Company Transaction Expenses and not subject to
any further adjustment under _Article IX_ or otherwise, and (v) provide a
written report to Purchaser and the Shareholder Representative, if requested
by either of them, which sets forth in reasonable detail the basis for the
Accounting Firms final determination. Each Party shall pay its own costs and
expenses in connection with any disagreement as to the Net Working Capital,
Closing Date Cash, Closing Date Indebtedness or Closing Date Company
Transaction Expenses. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be
allocated between Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Equityholders, on the
other hand, in the proportion that (A) the difference between the amount of
the payment referred to in _Section 1.11(e)_ that would have been paid to or
by Equityholders based upon the Shareholder Representatives submission to the
Accounting Firm and the amount actually paid to or by Equityholders (which
shall be Equityholders portion) bears to (B) the difference between the
amount of the payment referred to in _Section 1.11(e)_ that would have been
paid to or by Purchaser based upon Purchasers submission to the Accounting
Firm and the amount actually paid to or by Purchaser (which shall be
Purchasers portion). For the avoidance of doubt, any dispute between the
Parties concerning Closing Date Indebtedness, Company Transaction Expenses or
Unpaid Taxes that is not specifically included in the objections submitted to
the Accounting Firm (regardless of when such dispute is first identified by
the Parties) shall be resolved by mutual agreement of the Parties or in
accordance with _Section 5.2_ or _Article VIII_, as applicable

 



 

(e) " ** _Final Net Working Capital_** ", " ** _Final Closing Date Cash_** ",
" ** _Final Closing Date Indebtedness_** ", " ** _Final Closing Date Company
Transaction Expenses_** " and " ** _Final Unpaid Taxes_** ") mean the amount
of the Net Working Capital, the Closing Date Cash, the Closing Date
Indebtedness, the Closing Date Company Transaction Expenses and the Unpaid
Taxes, respectively, (i) as set forth on the Closing Statement if the
Shareholder Representative does not duly deliver an Objection Notice pursuant
to _Section 1.11(c)_ or (ii) if the Shareholder Representative duly delivers
an Objection Notice, (A) as mutually agreed between Purchaser and the
Shareholder Representative or (B) as determined by the Accounting Firm
pursuant to _Section 1.11(d)_. Within five (5) Business Days following the
determination of the Final Net Working Capital, Final Closing Date Cash, Final
Closing Date Indebtedness, Final Closing Date Company Transaction Expenses and
Final Unpaid Taxes:

 



 

(i) If (A) the sum (which may be a negative number) of the Final Net Working
Capital (which may be a negative number), plus the Final Closing Date Cash,
minus the Final Closing Date Indebtedness, minus the Final Closing Date
Company Transaction Expenses and minus the Final Unpaid Taxes, is less than
(B) the sum (which may be a negative number) of the Net Working Capital (which
may be a negative number), plus the Closing Date Cash, minus the Closing Date
Indebtedness, minus the Closing Date Company Transaction Expenses and minus
the Unpaid Taxes, in each case as shown on the Estimated Closing Statement,
then the Shareholder Representative shall pay or cause to be paid to Purchaser
an amount equal to the absolute value of such negative amount, up to One
Million Dollars ($1,000,000), and if the absolute value of such negative
amount exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), the Shareholder
Representative and Purchaser shall deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent to pay to Purchaser an amount equal to such excess from the
Escrow Fund.

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) If (A) the sum (which may be a negative number) of the Final Net Working
Capital (which may be a negative number), plus the Final Closing Date Cash,
minus the Final Closing Date Indebtedness, minus the Final Closing Date
Company Transaction Expenses and minus the Final Unpaid Taxes exceeds (B) the
sum (which may be a negative number) of the Net Working Capital (which may be
a negative number), plus the Closing Date Cash, minus the Closing Date
Indebtedness, minus the Closing Date Company Transaction Expenses and minus
the Unpaid Taxes, in each case as shown on the Estimated Closing Statement,
then Purchaser shall pay to the Shareholder Representative an amount equal to
such positive amount, which shall be paid by the Shareholder Representative to
the Equityholders in accordance with _Schedule 1.5_. Purchaser agrees that the
payments required pursuant to this _Section 1.11(e)_ will not be reduced by
any Transaction Payroll Taxes.

 



 

(iii) All payments required under this _Section 1.11(e)_ shall be made in
cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank account as
shall be designated in writing by the Shareholder Representative, if such
payment is to the Equityholders, or Purchaser, if such payment is to
Purchaser, at least three (3) Business Days prior to the applicable payment
date. If any payment required under this _Section 1.11(e)_ is not made in
full within five (5) Business Days after it is determined under this _Section
1.11_ that such payment is due, the unpaid payment shall thereafter bear
simple interest at a rate equal to the prime rate in effect from time to time
(as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ ) plus two (2) percentage points,
until paid in full.

 



 

(f) _Accounting Procedures_. The determinations and calculations of Net
Working Capital and Closing Date Cash contained in the Estimated Closing
Statement and the Closing Statement shall be determined and calculated in
accordance with the Agreed Accounting Principles; _provided, however_ , that
such determinations and calculations (i) shall not include any purchase
accounting or other adjustment arising out of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) shall calculate any
reserves, accruals or other non-cash expense items on a pro rata (as opposed
to monthly accrual) basis to account for a Closing that occurs on any date
other than the last day of a calendar month. By way of example, the
calculation of Net Working Capital as of the date of the Latest Balance Sheet
is set forth on _Schedule 1.11_.

 



 

(g) _Treatment of Payments_. Any payments made pursuant to this _Section
1.11_ shall be treated for all Tax purposes as adjustments to the Merger
Consideration unless a contrary treatment is required by applicable Law.

 



 

Section 1.12 _Tax Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, each of Purchaser and the Company shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement to any Person such
amounts as Purchaser or the Company is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts payable to a recipient are so
withheld by Purchaser or the Company and deposited with the appropriate Taxing
Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction
and withholding were made. Purchaser agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to consult with the Shareholder

 



       
 

 



 

Representative if it determines that any withholding is required with respect
to the Merger Consideration (other than with respect to amounts payable to
holders of Participation Shares). Any amounts deducted and withheld pursuant
to this _Section 1.12_ shall be remitted to the appropriate Taxing Authority
in accordance with applicable Tax Law.

 



 

Section 1.13 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon receipt of (i) an affidavit of that fact from the
holder claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, (ii) a
customary indemnity for lost certificates and (iii) any other documents
necessary to evidence and effect the bona fide exchange thereof, Purchaser
shall issue to such holder the consideration into which the Common Stock
represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate shall have been
converted.

 



 

Section 1.14 _Concurrent Agreements_. Concurrently with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, each Shareholder set forth on _Schedule 1.14_ has
entered into an employment arrangement with Purchaser or its Affiliates
related to the post-Closing period or a subscription agreement to acquire
shares of the common stock of Parent (collectively, the " ** _Subscription
Agreements_** ").

Document will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent,

enforceable against Parent, Purchaser and Merger Sub (to the extent that they

modification, acceleration or cancellation of any obligation under **,** any
Contract to which Purchaser is a party or by which it or its properties or
assets are bound.

of Purchaser, threatened against Parent, Purchaser or Merger Sub that (a)
questions the validity of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document to
which Parent, Purchaser or Merger Sub will be a party or any action taken or
to be taken by Parent, Purchaser or Merger Sub in connection herewith or
therewith, (b) seeks to enjoin the consummation of the transactions

responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
all estimates, projections, forward-looking statements and other forecasts and
plans so furnished to them (including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections, forward-looking statements, forecasts
or plans), and that none of Parent, Purchaser or Merger Sub will have any

Section 4.4 _Access_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall (a)
provide to Purchaser and the employees, officers, directors, agents or
representatives of Purchaser (collectively, the " ** _Purchaser
Representatives_** "), upon reasonable prior notice to the Company, reasonable
access, during normal business hours, and in such a manner as not to
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of any Group Companys business, to
(i) the facilities, assets, properties, books and records of each Group
Company and (ii) the employees, managers, officers, directors (or equivalent),
agents or representatives of each Group Company (collectively, the " **
_Company Representatives_** "), and (b) furnish to Purchaser and the Purchaser
Representatives such documents, additional financial and operating data and
other information related to the business of the Group Companies, or any of
them, as Purchaser and the Purchaser Representatives may reasonably request.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Group Companies shall be required
to afford such access or information (i) if doing so would constitute a
violation of Law or (ii) if the Company reasonably determines after
consultation with counsel that doing so would reasonably be expected to result
in the loss of privilege to any Group Company (in which case the Company shall
promptly notify Purchaser of the potential for such loss of privilege and,
unless Purchaser agrees in writing otherwise, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonably efforts to cooperate with Purchaser to facilitate
Purchasers access to such information prior to the Closing in such manner as
would not reasonably be expected to result in such loss of privilege). From
the date hereof until the Closing, except as otherwise expressly contemplated
hereby, neither Purchaser nor any Purchaser Representatives shall initiate any
contact or other communication with the employees, customers or suppliers of
any Group Company about the Group Companies or their respective assets,
properties, operations or businesses or in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents without the
Companys prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed); _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) Purchaser and its
Affiliates may contact and communicate with their employees, customers,
suppliers and other business relations about their assets, properties,
operations and businesses, and (y) if Purchaser, any of its Affiliates, or any
of their respective Representatives is contacted by, or receives any
communication from, any employee, customer, supplier, or other business
relation of a Group Company about any of the Group Companies, their respective
assets, properties, operations, or businesses, or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, then
Purchaser, such Affiliate, or such Representative shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to respond in manner designed to limit the communications
insofar as they are about any of the Group Companies, their respective assets,
properties, operations or businesses or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents to what

 



       
 

 



 

Purchaser, the Company or their respective Affiliates have publicly announced
in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents in accordance with the terms hereof. Prior to the
Closing, all information disclosed by or on behalf of the Group Companies to
Purchaser or any of the Purchaser Representatives shall be received and held
in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

Section 4.5 _Exclusivity_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company and the
Key Shareholders shall not, and the Company shall cause each of the Company
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate, encourage,
entertain, facilitate or participate in any inquiries, proposals or offers
from, discuss or negotiate with, provide any information to, consider the
merits of any inquiries, proposals or offers from, or enter into any letter of
intent, term sheet or Contract with, any Person (other than Parent, Purchaser
and Merger Sub), in each case relating to (a) except as set forth on _Schedule
4.5_ , any sale, assignment or transfer of any of the Shares or Warrants or
any direct or indirect interest therein, (b) any merger, consolidation,
recapitalization, business combination or other similar transaction involving
any Group Company, (c) any sale of any assets or properties of any Group
Company outside of the Ordinary Course or (d) any issue by any Group Company
of any Equity Interests or other securities (any such transaction referred to
in the preceding _clauses (a)_, _(b)_ , _(c)_ or _(d)_ , an " **
_Alternative Transaction_** "). If, during the Pre-Closing Period, any Key
Shareholder, any Group Company or any Company Representative receives any
inquiry, offer or proposal concerning a proposed Alternative Transaction, such
Key Shareholder or the Company, as applicable shall not (and the Company shall
cause the other Group Companies and the Company Representatives to not) make
any written or oral response to such inquiry, offer or proposal (other than to
state that a contractual obligation precludes a substantive response) and
shall provide written notice to Purchaser, promptly (and in any event within
two (2) Business Days) of receipt of such inquiry, offer or proposal by any
Key Shareholder, Group Company or any of the Company Representative, which
notice shall include a reasonable description of the material terms and
conditions of the proposed Alternative Transaction (including the identity of
the Person making the inquiry, offer or proposal) and accurate and complete
copies of any documents supplied by such Person in connection with the
proposed Alternative Transaction. The Key Shareholders and the Company shall,
and shall cause the other Group Companies and the Company Representatives to,
cease immediately any discussions regarding any potential Alternative
Transactions that were ongoing as of the date of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 4.6 _Notification_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company, on the
one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall notify the other as soon as
reasonably practicable (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) after
such Partys Knowledge Persons become aware of any change, effect, matter,
event, fact, condition, circumstance, occurrence or development that,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to cause the
Party to not be able to satisfy _Section 6.1(a)_ or _(b)_ in the case of the
Company or _Section 6.2(a)_ or _(b)_ in the case of Parent, Purchaser or
Merger Sub, in each case prior to the Termination Date. Except as provided in
the next sentence, such notice shall not (i) be deemed to supplement or amend
the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule or any
such representation and warranty or covenant and agreement of the Company or
Purchaser for the purpose of determining whether any of the conditions set
forth in the above-referenced sections above have been satisfied or (ii)
affect the right of any Purchaser Indemnified Party or Company Indemnified
Party to indemnification pursuant to _Article VIII_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, to

 



      
 

 



 

the extent such notice is from the Company and (A) relates to _Section
2.10(a)(i)_ or _Section 2.10(a)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
(relating to customers and suppliers), _Section 2.9_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (ageing of accounts receivable), _Section 2.15_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (relating to Material Contracts, but solely with
respect to the additions to or deletions of any Material Contracts arising in
the Ordinary Course), _Section 2.19_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
(relating to employment agreements, but solely with respect to the additions
to or deletions of any Contracts thereon arising in the Ordinary Course) or
_Section 2.21_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (relating to the list of
insurance policies, but solely with respect to the additions to or deletions
of any insurance policies thereon arising in the Ordinary Course) and (B) the
disclosure in such notice is only as to changes that do not result from a non-
fulfillment or breach of any covenant of the Company set forth in this
Agreement (or, with respect to deletions from _Section 2.15_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, that do not result from or relate to any breach or other
non-performance of any Contract), from and after the Closing, Purchaser shall
be deemed to have waived any and all rights it and all other Purchaser
Indemnified Parties may have arising from or relating to a breach of
representation or warranty with respect to such sections that is described in
such notice (including any right to indemnification pursuant to _Article
VIII_); _provided, however_ , that no such waiver shall apply if and to the
extent the breach described in such notice related to the failure of a
representation or warranty of the Company to be true and correct on and as of
the date of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 4.7 _Company Cooperation Concerning Financing_. The Company shall from
time to time as and when requested by Purchaser cooperate with Purchaser and
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company Representatives,
including legal and accounting representatives, to provide all reasonable
cooperation requested by Purchaser in connection with Purchasers efforts to
obtain the Financing, as Purchaser may reasonably request; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Companys cooperation shall be limited to providing and
commenting on information regarding the historical performance of the Group
Companies and Purchaser shall be solely responsible for providing and
commenting on information concerning the Group Companies and their anticipated
performance from and after Closing and in no event shall any Group Company or
Company Representative be liable for any act or omission in connection with
such assistance that results an inability to obtain the Financing or to obtain
certain terms for the Financing. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company shall, shall cause the other Group Companies to, and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company
Representatives, including legal and accounting representatives, to, at the
request of Purchaser:

 



 

(a) participate in meetings (including customary one-on-one meetings with the
parties acting as lead arrangers, underwriters or agents for, and prospective
lenders and purchasers of, the Financing and senior management and
representatives, with appropriate seniority and expertise, of the Company or
its Subsidiaries), presentations, drafting sessions, due diligence sessions
(including bring-down diligence sessions), and sessions with rating agencies
in connection with the Financing;

 



 

(b) furnish Purchaser, as promptly as reasonably practicable following
Purchasers request, with such pertinent historical financial and operating
data information, to the extent reasonably available to the Company regarding
the Group Companies, or any of them, and the business of the Group Companies,
or any of them, as

any Party, each other Party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed
and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to

requesting Party, except to the extent such cost or expense constitutes a Loss
for which such Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Article
VIII_) to evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.

 



 

Section 5.2 _Tax Matters_. The following provisions govern the allocation
between Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company and Shareholder
Representative, on the other hand, of responsibility for certain Tax matters
following the Closing Date:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) _Liability for Taxes_.

 



 

(i) _Equityholder Tax Liabilities_. Following the Closing Date, the
_Equityholder_ s will be liable for and shall hold each Purchaser Indemnified
Party harmless from any and all Indemnified Taxes.

 



 

(ii) _Straddle Period Tax Allocation_. The Taxes of the Group Companies, if
any, attributable to a Straddle Period shall be allocated to the Equityholders
for the period ending on and including the Closing Date, and to Purchaser for
the period beginning after the Closing Date. For purposes of this _Section
5.2(a)(ii)_, the parties agree to use the following conventions for
determining the amount of Taxes of the Group Companies attributable to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and
the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date: (A) in
the case of a Tax that is an income Tax or that is a business activity Tax
otherwise based on gross income, sales or gross receipts, or other specific
transactions, (I) the amount attributable to the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on and including the Closing Date shall be determined as if the
Group Company (or any one or more of the Group Companies as determined based
upon past Tax Returns) filed a Tax Return with respect to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date using a "closing of
the books" methodology, except that any permitted deductions attributable to
Company Transaction Expenses, payments made pursuant to _Section 1.9_ or
payments of Unpaid Taxes shall be treated as having been made during the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on or including the Closing Date
regardless of when such payments were actually made; _provided_ , that the
parties agree that seventy percent (70%) of any success-based fees paid by the
Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be deductible under Rev. Proc. 2011-29 and shall be deducted in the
portion of any Straddle Period ending on or before the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _further_ , that no compensation or wages included in the Company
Transaction Expenses shall be treated as a success-based fee and (II) the
remaining amount shall be attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period
beginning after the Closing Date and (B) in the case of a Tax, including real
property and ad valorem Taxes, that is not an income Tax or a Tax based upon
gross income, sales or gross receipts, the amount attributable to the portion
of the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date shall be
determined by multiplying the amount of such Taxes for the Straddle Period by
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax period
ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in the Straddle Period, and the remainder shall be the amount
attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after the Closing
Date.

 



 

(iii) _Payment of Indemnified Taxes_. As between Purchaser and the
Equityholders, Indemnified Taxes initially shall be paid by either: (A) paying
such Tax with the filing of the Tax Return with respect to which the Tax is
reported where the responsibility to prepare and file such Tax Return is
assigned to Shareholder Representative under this Agreement or (B) paying an
amount to Purchaser as provided in _Section 5.2(b)_ where the responsibility
to prepare and file the Tax Return with respect to which the Tax is reported
is assigned to Purchaser.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Preparation of Tax Returns_.

 



 

(i) _Tax Returns Due Prior to the Closing Date_. Prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall timely file all Tax Returns for Pre-Closing Tax Periods that
are required to be filed by it on or prior to the Closing Date and shall pay
or cause to be paid all Taxes shown due thereon. All such Tax Returns shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with prior practice, procedures and accounting
methods, except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Laws. The
Company shall provide Purchaser with copies of such completed Tax Returns at
least fifteen (15) days prior to the due date for filing thereof, along with
supporting work papers, for Purchasers review and shall consider in good
faith any comments thereto.

 



 

(ii) _Tax Returns for Pre-Closing Tax Periods Due After the Closing Date_. The
Shareholder Representative, at the Equityholders cost and expense, shall (A)
prepare or cause to be prepared and Purchaser shall cause the Company to
timely file all income Tax Returns of the Group Companies for Pre-Closing Tax
Periods that are due after the Closing Date (the " ** _Shareholder Prepared
Returns_** ") and (B) timely pay all Taxes that are shown as payable with
respect to such Shareholder Prepared Returns. All Shareholder Prepared Returns
shall be prepared by The MB Group, LLC in accordance with existing procedures,
practices, and accounting methods of the Group Companies, unless otherwise
required by applicable Law. Purchaser shall provide (or cause to be provided)
to Shareholder Representative, at the Shareholder Representatives expense,
any information reasonably requested by Shareholder Representative relating to
the Group Companies within its possession or control to facilitate the
preparation and filing of the Shareholder Prepared Returns. Each Shareholder
Prepared Return shall be submitted to Purchaser for Purchasers review and
approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) at least
twenty (20) days prior to the due date of such Shareholder Prepared Return
(taking into account extensions). To the extent allowed under applicable Law,
any deductions attributable to Company Transaction Expenses and deductions
associated with payments made pursuant to _Section 1.9_ and payments of
Unpaid Taxes shall be deducted on the Tax Returns of the Group Companies for
the taxable period that ends on the Closing Date; _provided_ , that the
parties agree that seventy percent (70%) of any success-based fees paid by the
Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be deductible under Rev. Proc. 2011-29 and shall be deducted in the Pre-

included in the Company Transaction Expenses shall be treated as a success-
based fee.

 



 

(iii) _Other Tax Returns_ _._ Except for the Shareholder Prepared Returns,
Purchaser shall prepare and timely file (or cause the Group Companies to
prepare and timely file) all Tax Returns of the Group Companies for Pre-
Closing Tax Periods and Straddle Periods that are due after the Closing Date
(the " ** _Purchaser Prepared Returns_** "). Each Purchaser Prepared Return
shall be submitted to the Shareholder Representative for the Shareholder
Representatives review and approval (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) at least twenty (20) days prior to the due date of such
Purchaser Prepared Return (taking into account extensions). The Shareholder
Representative shall pay to Purchaser those Indemnified Taxes shown on any
such

 



      
 

 



 

Purchaser Prepared Return (with respect to any Straddle Period allocated to
the Company in a manner consistent with _Section 5.2(a)(ii)_) no later than
five (5) Business Days before Purchaser is required to file such Purchaser
Prepared Returns with the applicable Taxing Authority (taking into account any
extensions timely filed by a Group Company), except to the extent the amount
of any such Taxes was included as a Current Liability in the calculation of
Net Working Capital, as finally determined in accordance with _Section 1.11_.

 



 

(iv) _Amendments to Tax Returns_. Unless otherwise required under applicable
Law, Purchaser covenants that it will not and will not cause or permit any
Group Company to amend or modify any Tax Return of a Group Company for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period without the prior written consent of
Shareholder Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. A copy of any such proposed amended or modified Tax
Return shall be provided to the Shareholder Representative for its review and
approval pursuant to the above provisions of this _Section 5.2(b)(iv)_ prior
to the filing of such amended or modified Tax Return. Upon the request of the
Shareholder Representative and at the Shareholder Representatives expense,
Purchaser shall cause the Group Companies to promptly file amended Tax Returns
carrying back any net operating or other losses, or credits, from the final
Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Group Companies and seeking a refund of Taxes
with respect to prior years, so long as the Tax position taken in each such
return is consistent with the Tax position taken by the Group Companies in
prior years and is otherwise in compliance with applicable Law.

 



 

(v) The Shareholder Representative and Purchaser shall attempt in good faith
to resolve any disagreements regarding Tax Returns (including amended or
modified Tax Returns) for Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Straddle Periods prior
to the due date for filing. In the event that the Shareholder Representative
and Purchaser are unable to resolve any dispute with respect to any such Tax
Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period at least ten (10) days
prior to the due date for filing, such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to
_Section 5.2(g)_, which resolution shall be binding on the parties.

 



 

(c) _Tax Refunds_. The Equityholders will be entitled to all refunds, credits
for overpayment of Taxes or reductions of Tax of any Group Company for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period and, with respect to a Straddle Period, to the extent
attributable to the Taxes for the Straddle Period allocated to the
Equityholders pursuant to _Section 5.2(a)(ii)_) relating to any Group
Company. If Purchaser, any Group Company or any Affiliate thereof receives any
refund, credit for overpayment of Taxes or benefit from any reduction in Tax
to which the Equityholders are entitled pursuant to this _Section 5.2(c)_,
Purchaser, a Group Company or any Affiliate thereof, as applicable, will
promptly pay to the Shareholder Representative for distribution to the
Equityholders the entire amount of such refund (including interest received
from a Taxing Authority thereon), credit or reduction in Tax, net of the
amount of any Taxes and out-of-pocket expenses that Purchaser, any Group
Company or any Affiliate thereof incurs with respect to such refund, credit or
reduction in Taxes. The net amount due to the Shareholder Representative shall
be payable within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of the refund from the
applicable Taxing Authority (or, if the refund is in the form of a direct
credit, within ten (10) Business Days after filing the Tax Return claiming
such credit). In the event that any Tax refund

 



      
 

 



 

or credit is subsequently determined by any Taxing Authority to be less than
the amount paid by Purchaser, any Group Company or any of their Affiliates to
the Shareholder Representative pursuant to this _Section 5.2(c)_, the
Shareholder Representative shall promptly return any such disallowed amount
(plus any interest or penalties in respect of such disallowed amount owed to
any Taxing Authority) to Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i)
Purchaser agrees not to carry back any net operating loss or other Tax
attribute or Tax credit incurred in a taxable period (or portion thereof)
beginning after the Closing Date to any Pre-Closing Tax Period of a Group
Company until Shareholder Representative has filed all amended Tax Returns or
claims for refund that it desires to file with respect to such Pre-Closing Tax
Periods and (ii) nothing in this _Section 5.2(c)_ shall require that
Purchaser, any Group Company or any of their Affiliates make any payment with
respect to any Tax refund (and such refund shall be for the benefit of
Purchaser) that is with respect to (A) any refund that is the result of the
carrying back of any net operating loss or other Tax attribute or Tax credit
incurred in a taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing
Date, (B) any refund resulting from the payment of Taxes made on or after the
Closing Date to the extent the Equityholders are not required to and have not
indemnified Purchaser or the Group Companies for such Taxes or (C) any refund
that gives rise to a payment obligation by the Group Companies to any Person
other than a Group Company, Purchaser or any of their Affiliates under
applicable Law or pursuant to a provision of a Contract or other agreement
entered (or assumed) by the Group Companies on or prior to the Closing Date.
Purchaser agrees that the payments of Tax refunds required pursuant to this
_Section 5.2(c)_ will not be reduced by any Transaction Payroll Taxes.

 



 

(d) _Transfer Taxes_. Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Equityholders, on
the other hand, shall each be responsible for one-half (1/2) of all transfer,
value-added, documentary, sales, excise, use, stamp, registration and other
such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and
charges (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively,
the " ** _Transfer Taxes_** "), and Purchaser shall also file all necessary
Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes
and, if required by applicable Laws or to the extent reasonably requested,
each party shall, cooperate in the preparation and filing and join in the
execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

 



 

(e) _Cooperation and Records Retention_. The Shareholder Representative and
Purchaser shall (and Purchaser shall cause each Group Company to) (i) each
provide the other with such assistance as may reasonably be requested by any
of them in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return, audit, or other
examination by any Taxing Authority or Proceedings relating to liability for
Taxes, (ii) each retain and provide the other with any records or other
information that may be relevant to such Tax Return, audit or examination,
proceeding or determination and (iii) each provide the other with any final
determination of any such audit or examination, proceeding or determination
that affects any amount required to be shown on any Tax Return of the other
for any period. Each Party shall bear its own expenses in complying with the
foregoing provisions.

 



 

(f) _Tax Contests_.

 



 

(i) After the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause each Group Company to,
promptly notify the Shareholder Representative in writing upon receipt of any
written

 



      
 

 



 

notice, or becoming aware, of any audit, examination, or proceeding with
respect to Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period or other
Taxes which, if determined adversely to the taxpayer, would be reasonable
grounds for a Tax indemnification claim in favor of Purchaser under _Section
8.3(b)(v)_ (a " ** _Tax Claim_** "); _provided_ , that no failure or delay of
the Purchaser in providing such notice shall reduce or otherwise affect the
obligations of the Equityholders pursuant to this Agreement, except to the
extent that the Equityholders are materially and adversely prejudiced as a
result of such failure or delay.

 



 

(ii) Purchaser shall control the defense of any Tax Claim, _provided_ that:
(A) the Shareholder Representative, at the Equityholders sole cost and
expense, shall have the right to participate in all aspects of any such Tax
Claim, (B) with respect to any Tax Claim for a Pre-Closing Period, Purchaser
shall not settle such audit or proceeding without the prior written consent of
the Shareholder Representative; provided, however, that if such settlement
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the liability for Taxes of
the Purchaser or the Group Companies for any taxable year or period beginning
after the Closing Date, the prior written consent of the Shareholder
Representative shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. In
the event the Shareholder Representative withholds consent to settle any Tax
Claim as set forth in the preceding sentence, and Purchaser and the
Shareholder Representative, after working in good faith, are unable to resolve
any dispute as to whether such settlement would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the liability for Taxes of the Purchaser or the Group
Companies for any taxable year or period beginning after the Closing Date, the
parties shall retain the Accounting Firm in accordance with the provisions of
_Section 1.6_ to determine if such settlement would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the liability for Taxes of the Purchaser or the Group
Companies for any taxable year or period beginning after the Closing Date and
such consent was reasonably withheld under applicable Law. Neither the
Purchaser nor any of the Group Companies may settle any Tax Claim relating to
a Straddle Period without the prior written consent of the Shareholder
Representative.

 



 

(iii) To the extent this _Section 5.2(f)_ conflicts with the provisions and
limitations of _Article VIII_ with respect to any Tax matters, this _Section
5.2(f)_ shall control.

 



 

(g) _Disputes_. Any dispute as to any matter described in this _Section 5.2_
shall be resolved by the Accounting Firm in accordance with the provisions of
_Section 1.11(d)_. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be
borne equally by Purchaser and the Shareholder Representative. If any dispute
with respect to a Tax Return is not resolved prior to the due date of such Tax
Return, such Tax Return shall be filed in the manner that the party
responsible for preparing such Tax Return deems correct.

 



 

Section 5.3 _Restrictive Covenants of Key Shareholders_. _General
Acknowledgement_. (a) Each Key Shareholder agrees and acknowledges that (i)
the Group Companies have spent and will continue to spend substantial money,

Agreement, each Key Shareholder hereby agrees to the following provisions of
this _Section 5.3._

 



 

(b) _Confidentiality_. Until the third anniversary of the Closing Date, such

induce to leave the employ of or engagement by any Group Company, any
individual who is, on the Closing Date or who was, during the six (6) month
period preceding the Closing Date, a manager, officer, director (or
equivalent), employee or consultant to any Group Company; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no general advertisement or general solicitation for
employment not targeted to the managers, officers, directors (or equivalent),
employees or consultants of the Group Companies or any Group Company shall be
deemed to be in violation of this _Section 5.3(e)_.

 



 

(f) _Appropriate Restrictions; Authority for Judicial Enforcement and
Revision_. Such Key Shareholder agrees and acknowledges that the covenants of
such Person set forth in this _Section 5.3_ (i) are reasonable in duration,
geographic scope, area and nature of restrictions and in all other respects
and (ii) have been made in order to induce Purchaser to enter into this
Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, and Purchaser
would not have entered into this Agreement or consummated the transactions
contemplated hereby, in each case but for the covenants of the Key
Shareholders contained in this _Section 5.3_, which are necessary to protect
the goodwill, trade secrets and business of the Group Companies. If, at any
time of enforcement of any of the provisions of this _Section 5.3_, a
Governmental Authority determines that the duration, geographic scope or area
or nature of restrictions stated in this Agreement are not enforceable under

and area or nature of restrictions (as applicable) permitted by applicable Law
shall be substituted for the duration, geographic scope and area or nature of
restrictions (as applicable) stated herein and the Governmental Authority
shall be authorized by the Parties to revise the restrictions contained herein
to cover such maximum duration, geographic scope and area or nature of
restrictions (as applicable). This _Section 5.3(f)_ shall be

 



      
 

 



 

read in conjunction with (and not to the exclusion of) _Section 10.6_
(Severability), but in the event of any conflict between the immediately
preceding sentence of this _Section 5.3(f)_, on the one hand, and the first
sentence of _Section 10.6_, on the other hand, the immediately preceding
sentence of this _Section 5.3(f)_ will control and govern.

 



 

(g) _Injunctive Relief_. The Parties agree that any breach or attempted breach
of this _Section 5.3_ would cause irreparable injury to Purchaser, which
cannot be adequately compensated in monetary damages. Therefore, Purchaser
shall have, in addition to, and not in lieu of, any of the other rights and
remedies available hereunder, the right to have the provisions of this
_Section 5.3_ specifically enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction by
way of an injunction or other equitable relief. Purchaser shall not be
required to post a bond or other security or to prove actual damages or the
inadequacy of monetary damages in connection with its efforts to obtain
equitable relief concerning this _Section 5.3_.

 



 

(h) _Non-Exclusive Obligations_. Such Key Shareholder agrees and acknowledges
that such Persons obligations set forth in this _Section 5.3_ are in
addition to, and not in lieu of, any obligations such Key Shareholder has to
any Group Company or its Affiliates pursuant to any other agreement between
such Key Shareholder and any Group Company or its Affiliates, at common law or
otherwise.

** _Key Shareholder Person_** "), hereby irrevocably waives, releases and
discharges each of the Group Companies, its Affiliates and each of its and
their respective officers, directors (or equivalent), managers, members,

Parties of any kind or nature whatsoever arising from or relating to the
period up to and including the Closing Date or any condition, action, inaction
or other matter relating to the Group Companies or the business operated
thereby during, occurring or existing during the period up to and including
the Closing Date, in each case whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or
unliquidated, known or unknown, and whether arising under any agreement or
understanding or otherwise (collectively, but excluding the Retained Claims,
the " ** _Released Claims_** ").

 



 

(b) _Waiver of Claims_. Except for the Retained Claims, effective upon the
Closing, such Key Shareholder agrees that such Key Shareholder shall not make,
or permit any other Person to make, for such Key Shareholder or on behalf of
any Key Shareholder Person any claim against any of the Released Parties with
respect to any of the Released Claims, for indemnification or otherwise
(whether such claim is for judgments, damages, penalties, fines, costs,
amounts paid in settlement, losses, expenses or otherwise and whether such
claim is pursuant to any statute, charter document, bylaw, agreement or
otherwise), and such Key Shareholder hereby acknowledges and agrees that such
Key Shareholder shall not have any claim or right to contribution or indemnity
from any Released Party with respect to any amounts

 



      
 

 



 

paid by such Key Shareholder with respect to any Released Claim pursuant to

prior to Closing of the Released Party caused such amounts to become payable.

 



 

(c) _Retained Claims_. The covenants, agreements, releases and waivers
provided in _Section 5.4(a)_ and _Section 5.4(b)_ shall not apply to (i) any
rights of such Key Shareholder or any Key Shareholder Person under this
Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents (for the avoidance of
doubt, inclusive of rights to indemnification and coverage by the "tail
policy" under _Section 5.5_), (ii) any rights of such Key Shareholder or any
Key Shareholder Person with respect to any unpaid salary or other compensation
for the period prior to the last payroll paid before the Closing, (iii) any
rights of such Key Shareholder or any Key Shareholder Person under any Company
Benefit Plan, (iv) any rights of such Key Shareholder against Parent arising
from such Key Shareholders ownership of any of the common stock of Parent and
(v) the right or ability to make, pursue, enforce or prosecute a claim for
fraud against any manager, trustee, employee, officer, director or agent of
the Group Companies to the extent that such Key Shareholder has been required
to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified Parties in connection with such claim
of fraud brought by a Purchaser Indemnified Party against such Key Shareholder
(but with respect to this _clause (v)_ , only if such manager, trustee,
employee, officer, director or agent of the Group Companies, in turn, is not
entitled to indemnification from Parent, Purchaser or any Group Company as a
result of such claim for fraud)(collectively, the " ** _Retained Claims_** ").

 



 

(d) _Specific Waiver_. Except for the Retained Claims, such Key Shareholder
acknowledges and agrees that in no event shall a Released Party have any
liability to such Key Shareholder whatsoever for any breaches of the
representations or warranties of or regarding any Key Shareholder or the
Company set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

(e) _Release to Stay in Effect_. Such Key Shareholder, on behalf of such Key
Shareholder and any Key Shareholder Persons, agrees and acknowledges that such
Key Shareholder may hereafter discover facts different from or in addition to
those now known or believed to be true regarding the Released Claims and
agrees that this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect,
notwithstanding the existence or nature of any such different or additional
facts. Such Key Shareholder agrees and acknowledges that the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the payment of the
Merger Consideration provided to such Key Shareholder, constitutes sufficient
and adequate consideration for the releases, covenants and agreements set
forth in this _Section 5.4_.

 



 

(f) _Intended Scope_. For the avoidance of doubt, such Key Shareholder agrees,
acknowledges and covenants that (i) such Key Shareholder intends the releases
hereunder to be as comprehensive and broad as is permissible under applicable
Law with respect to the Released Claims, (ii) such Key Shareholder shall be
forever barred from, directly or indirectly, bringing any Proceeding of any
kind, nature or character against or involving any of the Released Parties
arising out of, relating to or constituting any of the Released Claims and (c)
such Key Shareholder shall not otherwise have any recourse of any kind against
any of the Released Parties with respect to any of the Released Claims.

 



 

(g) _Independent Consideration of Release_. In making its decision to provide
the releases set forth in _Section 5.4_, such Key Shareholder has relied
solely on its own knowledge

 



      
 

 



 

and judgment and the advice of its legal counsel and, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, is not relying on any promises, inducements,
representations or warranties of any of the Released Parties or any of their
respective officers, directors (or equivalent), managers, members, partners,
principals, employees, agents or representatives to the extent not expressly
referred to in this Agreement and (ii) there has been no assignment or other
transfer by or on behalf of such Key Shareholder of any interest in any
Released Claim.

Surviving Corporation to exculpate, indemnify and advance expenses to each
individual who was an officer or director of the Company immediately prior to
the Closing (such officers and directors, each a " ** _D andO Indemnified
Party_**") on terms and conditions equivalent to those Purchaser makes
available and causes the Surviving Corporation to make available to their
respective officers and directors from time to time after the Closing;
_provided_ that notwithstanding the foregoing, no DandO Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to exculpation or to indemnification or advancement of expenses
pursuant to this _Section 5.5_ with respect to or in connection with any
matter for which any Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to _Article VIII_.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall purchase a six (6) year
"tail" coverage covering acts or omissions of the DandO Indemnified Parties
prior to the Closing on terms substantially similar to the directors and
officers liability insurance policy or policies maintained by the Company at
the date of this Agreement. The cost of such "tail" coverage shall be deemed
to be a Company Transaction Expense. During the period after the Closing and
during the term of such policy, Purchaser shall not (and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation not to) cancel, amend or waive such policy; _provided_ ,
that neither Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation nor any Affiliate thereof
shall be obligated to pay any premiums or other amounts in respect of such
policy.

 



 

(c) Each of Purchaser and the DandO Indemnified Party shall cooperate, and cause
their respective Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense of any DandO Claim and
shall provide access to properties and individuals as reasonably request and
furnish or cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals,
as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

 



 

(d) In the event Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Purchaser
or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.6_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this _Article VIII_, from and
after the Closing, the Equityholders, severally (not jointly and severally) in
accordance with their Allocation Percentages, shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Purchaser, each of Purchasers Affiliates (including each of the
Group Companies after the Closing) and each of its and their respective
officers, directors, managers, members, partners, equityholders, employees,
representatives and agents and each of the heirs, executors, successors and
assigns of any of the foregoing (collectively, the " ** _Purchaser Indemnified
Parties_** ") from and against, and pay on behalf of and reimburse each
Purchaser Indemnified Party in respect of, any and all Losses incurred,
suffered, sustained or required to be paid, directly or indirectly, by any
Purchaser Indemnified Party arising out of, resulting from or relating to:

 



 

(i) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation and warranty made by the
Company in _Article II_;

 



 

(ii) any non-fulfillment or breach of any covenant or agreement made by or to
be performed by the Company at or prior to the Closing or any covenant or
agreement made by or to be performed by the Shareholder Representative (in its
capacity as such);

 



 

(iii) any Company Transaction Expenses that are outstanding after the Closing;

 



 

(iv) any Indebtedness of the Company outstanding immediately prior to the
Closing that is (A) Funded Debt but not satisfied in full at the Closing or
(B) other Indebtedness that is not reflected in the Merger Consideration at
the Closing or the adjustment to the Merger Consideration contemplated by
_Section 1.11_;

 



 

(v) any Indemnified Taxes;

 



 

(vi) any Proceeding in which any Person asserts an ownership interest in any
Group Company that is in breach of the representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in _Section 2.2_ or _Section 2.4(a)_; or

 



 

(vii) the exercise of any dissenters rights pursuant to Section 10.356 of the
TBOC by any holder of Dissenting Shares (in which case the Losses of the
Purchaser Indemnified Party relating thereto shall equal the amount by which
the "fair value," as finally determined pursuant to the TBOC, of the Company
Common Stock held by each such holder exceeds the Merger Consideration paid or
to be paid for such Company Common Stock pursuant to _Article I_, together
with all Losses arising out of the determination, adjudication, or settlement
of such dissenting shareholder claims).

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, and for the avoidance of doubt, no Company
Indemnified Party will be a Purchaser Indemnified Party by reason of such
Company Indemnified Partys position with any Group Company or otherwise.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this _Article VIII_, Purchaser,
from and after the Closing, shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
Equityholder, each of such Equityholders Affiliates and each of their
respective officers, directors, managers, members, partners, equityholders,
employees, representatives and agents and each of the heirs, executors,
successors and assigns of any of the foregoing (collectively, the " **
_Company Indemnified Parties_** ") from and against, and pay on behalf of and
reimburse each Company Indemnified Party in respect of, any and all Losses
incurred, suffered, sustained or required to be paid, directly or indirectly,
by any Company Indemnified Party arising out of, resulting from or relating to
(i) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation and warranty made by
Parent, Purchaser or Merger Sub in _Article III_ or (ii) any non-fulfillment
or breach of any covenant or agreement made by or to be performed by Parent,
Purchaser or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.4 _Indemnification Claim Procedure_.

 



 

(a) If any Purchaser Indemnified Party or Company Indemnified Party, as
applicable (in the capacity as a Person seeking indemnification under this
_Article VIII_, the " ** _Indemnified Party_** "), obtains actual knowledge
of any matter not involving a Third Party Claim that the Indemnified Party
reasonably believes will entitle the Indemnified Party to indemnification from
Purchaser or the Equityholders under this _Article VIII_ (in the capacity as
a Person against whom indemnification is sought under this _Article VIII_,
the " ** _Indemnifying Party_** "), the Indemnified Party shall promptly
thereafter deliver to the Indemnifying Party a notice thereof (a " ** _Notice
of Claim_** ") describing such matter in reasonable detail and, to the extent
reasonably estimable, the estimated Losses resulting therefrom; _provided,
however_ , that any failure to give such notification on a timely basis or to
provide any particular details therein shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligation to indemnify any Indemnified Party hereunder except to
the extent that such failure to provide, delay in providing or omission of any
particular detail actually prejudices the ability of the Indemnifying Party to
defend against such matter.

 



 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall respond to the Indemnified Party within
twenty (20) Business Days following the date that the Notice of Claim is
delivered to pursuant to _Section 8.4(a)_ (the " ** _Response Period_** "),
specifying whether or not the Indemnifying Party disputes the claim(s)
described in the Notice of Claim, describe in reasonable detail the basis for
each such dispute and include reasonable supporting materials (a " ** _Claim
Response_** "). If the Indemnifying Party fails to give a Claim Response
within the Response Period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed not to
dispute the claim(s) described in the related Notice of Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party gives a Claim Response within the Response Period but does
not in such Claim Response dispute all of the claim(s) made in the related
Notice of Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed not to dispute the
undisputed claim(s) described in the related Notice of Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party elects not to dispute any claim described in a Notice of
Claim, whether by failing to give a timely Claim Response or otherwise, then,
subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 8.6_, the amount of Losses
alleged in such Notice of Claim shall be conclusively deemed to be an
obligation of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall be paid
the amount specified in the Notice of Claim as provided in _Section 8.8_ (it
being acknowledged that the amount of any estimated Losses shall be revised by
the Indemnified Party from time to time as the same are determined, all of
which Losses shall be indemnified by the Indemnifying Party). If the
Indemnifying Party delivers a Claim Response within the Response

 



      
 

 



 

Period indicating that the Indemnifying Party disputes one or more of the
matters identified in the Notice of Claim, Purchaser and Shareholder
Representative, on behalf of the Equityholders, shall promptly meet in good
faith to resolve the dispute. If Purchaser and Shareholder Representative do
not resolve a dispute regarding a claim within thirty (30) days after the
delivery of the Claim Response, either the Indemnifying Party or the
Indemnified Party may submit the dispute to a court of competent jurisdiction
for resolution. Upon resolution of such dispute, whether by agreement or by a
court of competent jurisdiction, if it is determined that any indemnification
payment is required pursuant to this _Article VIII_ such amount shall be paid
to the Indemnified Party as provided in _Section 8.8_.

 



 

(c) For purposes of this _Section 8.4_, with respect to any matter for which
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties may seek indemnification pursuant to
_Section 8.3(b)_, all actions to be taken (or not taken), the exercise (or
failure to exercise) of any rights and all notices to be delivered by the
Indemnifying Party shall be taken (or not taken), exercised (or not exercised)
or delivered by the Shareholder Representative on behalf of the Equityholders,
and each Equityholder shall be bound thereby as if all the Equityholders had
taken (or omitted to take) such action, exercised (or failed to exercise) such
rights or delivered such notice.

 



 

Section 8.5 _Defense of Third Party Claims_.

 



 

(a) With respect to any matter for which an Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification from an Indemnifying Party under this _Article VIII_ that
relates to a Proceeding by a third party (a " ** _Third Party Claim_** "), the
Indemnified Party shall provide to the Indemnifying Party a Notice of Claim
relating to such Third Party Claim promptly after receiving written
notification of such Proceeding; _provided, however_ , that any failure to
give such notification on a timely basis shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligation to indemnify any Indemnified Party hereunder except to
the extent that such failure to provide or delay in providing actually
prejudices the ability of the Indemnifying Party to defend against such Third
Party Claim.

 



 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume and pursue the
defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel selected by it and reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party, upon delivery to the Indemnified Party,
within thirty (30) days after notice of the Third Party Claim has been
delivered to the Indemnifying Party, of an acknowledgement and agreement that
(i) any Losses resulting therefrom are indemnifiable Losses for which the
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this _Article VIII_
(subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 8.6_) and (ii) that the
Indemnifying Party shall post any bond or other security to the extent
required in connection with the defense or appeal of such Third Party Claim
(an " ** _Assumption of Defense Notice_** "), _provided_ that the Indemnifying
Party shall have an additional thirty (30) days after the delivery of such
notice to revoke such acknowledgement and agreement with respect to any
portion of such Losses based on matters that become known to the Indemnifying
Party during such period and which indicate that such Losses would not be
indemnifiable Losses for which the Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification under this _Article VIII_ (and if a notice of such revocation
is not delivered by the Indemnifying Party during such thirty (30) day period,
such Losses shall conclusively be deemed indemnifiable Losses).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to
assume the defense of a Third Party Claim if (i) such Third Party Claim
involves a purported class action,

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) such Third Party Claim involves criminal allegations, (iii) such Third
Party Claim demands injunctive or other equitable relief that, if granted,
would have an adverse effect on any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or
their respective businesses (if a Purchaser Indemnified Party is the
Indemnified Party) or any of the Company Indemnified Parties or their
respective businesses (if a Company Indemnified Party is the Indemnified
Party), (iv) the Indemnified Party reasonably determines that the Losses
associated with such Third Party Claim are likely to exceed the then-remaining
amount of the Indemnification Cap or (v) the Indemnified Party reasonably
determines that it would be inappropriate for a single counsel to represent
both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party in connection with such
Third Party Claim under applicable standards of legal ethics.

 



 

(c) Unless and until the Indemnified Party receives, with respect to any Third
Party Claim, an Assumption of Defense Notice from the Indemnifying Party
within the thirty (30)-day period provided above or if, at any time after the
Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party fails diligently to defend such Third Party Claim (i) the
Indemnified Party may, but shall not be obligated to, fully assume, commence
and pursue its defense of such Third Party Claim in any such manner as it may
deem appropriate, (ii) the Indemnified Party shall thereafter promptly inform
the Indemnifying Party of all material developments related to such Third
Party Claim (including copying the Indemnifying Party on court filings and
correspondence); _provided, however_ , that the Indemnified Party shall not be
obligated to turn over any attorney-client privileged information, (iii) the
Indemnifying Party shall reasonably cooperate in the defense or prosecution of
such Third Party Claim, including the retention and (upon the Indemnified
Partys request) the provision to the Indemnified Party of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and
making employees and other representatives and advisors available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder and (iv) the Indemnified Party shall not
settle any such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. For the avoidance of doubt, any attorneys fees and
expenses and other costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with a Third Party Claim prior to the time at which such Third
Party Claim has been assumed by the Indemnifying Party as provided herein or
during any subsequent time in which the Indemnified Party is conducting its
own defense of a Third Party Claim in accordance with this _Section 8.5_
shall be Losses hereunder.

 



 

(d) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, it
shall control and direct the defense of such Third Party Claim, but the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of such
Third Party Claim and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the
counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party. During any period in which the
Indemnifying Party is defending a Third Party Claim (i) the Indemnifying Party
shall promptly inform the Indemnified Party of all material developments
related to such Third Party Claim (including copying the Indemnified Party on
court filings and correspondence) and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall
reasonably cooperate in the defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim,
including the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Partys request) the
provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees and other
representatives and advisors available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Indemnifying
Party

 



      
 

 



 

shall not settle any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) unless (A) the compromise or settlement does not
involve any statement, finding or admission of any fault of, breach of
Contract by, or violation of Law by, the Indemnified Party, (B) the sole
relief provided in the compromise or settlement is monetary damages that are
paid in full by the Indemnifying Party and does not include any requirement
that the Indemnified Party take or refrain from taking any actions other than
compliance with any non-disclosure obligations related to the terms of such
settlement contained in the settlement agreement, (C) the compromise or
settlement includes an unconditional and irrevocable release of the
Indemnified Party, (D) the settlement agreement includes a reasonable
confidentiality obligation by the Third Party claimant of the terms of the
settlement and (E) the Indemnified Party is a party to, or an express Third
Party beneficiary of, the settlement agreement, entitled to enforce such
settlement agreement. The Indemnified Party shall have no Liability with
respect to any compromise or settlement of any Third Party Claims made without
its consent (if such consent is required by this _Section 8.5_) and any such
compromise or settlement shall be void.

 



 

(e) This _Section 8.5_ shall not apply to Tax Claims, which shall be governed
by _Section 5.2(f)_.

 



 

(f) For purposes of this _Section 8.5_, with respect to any matter for which
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties may seek indemnification pursuant to
_Section 8.3(b)_, all actions to be taken (or not taken), the exercise (or
failure to exercise) of any rights and all notices to be delivered by the
Indemnifying Party shall be taken (or not taken), exercised (or not exercised)
or delivered by the Shareholder Representative on behalf of the Equityholders,
and each Equityholder shall be bound thereby as if all the Equityholders had
taken (or omitted to take) such action, exercised (or failed to exercise) such
rights or delivered such notice.

 



 

Section 8.6 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) _Purchaser Limitations_. Subject to _Section 8.6(e)_, the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification with respect to
any claim for indemnification made pursuant to S _ection 8.3(a)(i)_ unless
and until the aggregate dollar amount of all Losses of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties in excess of the De Minimis Claim Threshold for all claims
relating to Losses that would otherwise be indemnifiable pursuant to _Section
8.3(a)(i)_ exceeds One Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($1,250,000)
(the " ** _Threshold Amount_** "), after which point the Equityholders shall
be required to provide indemnification with respect to all indemnifiable
(subject to the De Minimis Claim Threshold) Losses with respect to any such
claim for indemnification made pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)(i)_ from dollar
one. In addition, subject to _Section 8.6(e)_, the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification with respect to any claim for
indemnification made pursuant to _Sections 8.3(a)(i)_, _(vi)_ or _(vii)_ or
with respect to any Pre-Closing Covenants pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)(ii)_ to
the extent that all claims made under such Sections are in an aggregate amount
in excess of Nine Million Dollars ($9,000,000) (the " ** _Indemnification
Cap_** ").

 



 

(b) _Company Limitations_. Subject to _Section 8.6(e)_, the Company
Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification with respect to
any claim for indemnification made pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)(i)_ (i) unless
and until the Losses associated with all claims for

 



      
 

 



 

indemnification made pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)(i)_ incurred by the Company
Indemnified Parties aggregate at least the Threshold Amount, after which point
Purchaser shall be required to provide indemnification with respect to all
indemnifiable Losses with respect to any claim for indemnification made
pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)(i)_ that are in excess of the Threshold Amount or
(ii) in an aggregate amount in excess of the Indemnification Cap; _provided_
that, the foregoing limitations shall not apply to the failure of Parent,
Purchaser and Merger Sub to pay the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(c) _No Special, Exemplary or Punitive Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this _Article VIII_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, in no
event shall any Indemnified Party be entitled to receive indemnification under
this _Article VIII_ for any Losses relating to special, exemplary or punitive
damages; _provided, however,_ that this limitation shall not apply if, and
solely to the extent that, an Indemnified Party is seeking to obtain through
indemnification reimbursement of such Losses resulting from an award in a
Third Party Claim against such Indemnified Party of such Losses.

 



 

(d) _No Double Recovery_. Notwithstanding the fact that any Indemnified Party
may have the right to assert claims for indemnification under or in respect of
more than one provision of this Agreement in respect of any fact, event,
condition or circumstance, no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover
the amount of any Losses suffered by such Indemnified Party or its Affiliates
more than once, regardless of whether such Losses may be as a result of a
breach of more than one representation, warranty or covenant. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, no Indemnified Party shall be able to recover
any Loss for which it is otherwise entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement if such Loss has already been taken into account in determining the
Final Net Working Capital, Final Closing Date Cash, Final Closing Date
Indebtedness or Final Closing Date Company Transaction Expenses in accordance
with _Section 1.11_.

 



 

(e) _Exceptions; Overall Indemnity Cap_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the
provisions of _Sections 8.6(a)_ and _(b)_ shall not apply with respect to
any Losses arising out of, resulting from or relating to any action or
inaction that constitutes fraud, intentional misrepresentation or intentional
breach, and (ii) the De Minimis Claim Threshold and the Threshold Amount shall
not apply to any indemnification claims made with respect to the Fundamental
Representations or the representations and warranties set forth in _Section
2.16_ (Taxes) and (iii) to the extent the Indemnification Cap does not apply
to any indemnification claims by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in
accordance with _Section 8.6(a)_, the maximum aggregate amount of Losses for
which indemnification is required to be made with respect to such items not
covered by the Indemnification Cap shall be the portion of the Merger
Consideration actually received by each such Indemnifying Party on account of
such Indemnifying Partys Shares or Warrants (but not on account of any Funded
Debt).

 



 

(f) _Waivers of Closing Condition_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, no Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be entitled to make any
claim for indemnification hereunder with respect to the failure of the Company
to obtain any Governmental Approval or Contract Consent set forth on _Schedule
6.1(c)_ if such Governmental Approval or Contract Consent has not been
obtained prior to the Closing Date and Purchaser

 



      
 

 



 

waives the condition to Closing in _Section 6.1(c)_ with respect to the
receipt of such Government Approval or Contract Consent.

 



 

Section 8.7 _Determination of Loss Amount; Reliance_.

 



 

(a) For purposes of determining whether there has been a breach of any
representation and warranty of the Company set forth in _Article II_ and the
Losses for any such breach, all materiality qualifications contained in such
representations and warranties (however they may be phrased and including the
word "material", the term "Material Adverse Effect" and words or terms of
similar import) shall be ignored and not given any effect; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that materiality qualifications shall not be ignored, and they
shall be given effect, for purposes of the definition of Permitted Liens or
Material Contracts and any use of such terms in this Agreement or for purposes
of _Section 2.6(a)_.

 



 

(b) Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Group Companies to, in good faith,
diligently seek recovery, at its or their own expense, of all insurance
proceeds from insurers with respect to all Losses with respect to which any
Purchaser Indemnified Party makes a claim for indemnification under this
_Article VIII_; _provided that_ (i) the expenses incurred by Purchaser or the
Group Companies in connection with such recovery and the net present value of
any increase in premiums of the applicable insurance policies relating to the
claims so made shall be a Loss related to such claim for indemnification and
(ii) no Indemnifying Party shall delay making any payment under this _Article
VIII_ pending resolution of any such insurance claim. To the extent that
Purchaser or any Group Company (following the Closing) receives any amount
under insurance coverage with respect to a matter for which a Purchaser
Indemnified Party has previously obtained payment in indemnification under
this _Article VIII_, Purchaser shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after
receipt of such insurance proceeds, pay and reimburse to the Escrow Agent (if
such reimbursement is to be delivered prior to the expiration of the Escrow
Account) or to the Shareholder Representative (if such reimbursement is to be
delivered after the expiration of the Escrow Account) for further allocation
to the Equityholders, for any prior indemnification payment (up to the amount
of the insurance proceeds, less any premium increases directly attributable
thereto).

 



 

(c) The representations and warranties made by the Company, on the one hand,
and Parent, Purchaser and Merger Sub, on the other hand, in this Agreement are
made with the knowledge and expectation that the Equityholders are (in the
case of representations and warranties made by Parent, Purchaser and Merger
Sub) and Parent, Purchaser and Merger Sub are (in the case of representations
and warranties made by the Company) placing reliance thereon in entering into,
and performing its obligations under, this Agreement. No investigation made by
or for the benefit of a Party, nor any knowledge of information held or
obtained by such Party either in the course of such investigation or
otherwise, shall negate or limit the effect of the representations and
warranties made for the benefit of such Party in this Agreement or any right
to indemnification with respect to any breach of or inaccuracy therein.

 



 

Section 8.8 _Source of Recovery; Payment of Amounts Due_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the application of _Section 8.6_, within five (5) Business
Days after it is determined pursuant to this _Article VIII_ that any amount
is due to any Purchaser Indemnified

 



      
 

 



 

Party under _Section 8.3(a)_, such amount shall be satisfied: (i) first, by
release to Purchaser from the Escrow Account of the amount of the Escrow
Deposit equal to the lesser of (A) such amount or (B) the full amount of
Escrow Deposit then remaining in the Escrow Account and (ii) second, if such
amount is greater than the full amount of Escrow Deposit then remaining in the
Escrow Account, by payment by the Equityholders to Purchaser, in accordance
with their respective Allocation Percentages, of the excess within such five
(5) Business Day period, in each case by wire transfer of immediately
available funds. Any payment of the Escrow Deposit pursuant to this _Section
8.8_ shall be accompanied by payment of all of the interest and other income
thereon in the Escrow Account, if any, which amount shall not reduce or offset
the amount of the payment due to any Purchaser Indemnified Party under this
_Article VIII_.

 



 

(b) Subject to the application of _Section 8.6_, within five (5) Business
Days after it is determined pursuant to this _Article VIII_ that any amount
is due to any Company Indemnified Party hereunder, such amount shall be paid
by Purchaser to such Company Indemnified Party by wire transfer of immediately
available funds.

 



 

(c) If any payment required under this _Section 8.8_ is not made in full
within five (5) Business Days after it is determined under this _Article
VIII_ that such payment is due, the unpaid payment shall thereafter bear
simple interest at a rate equal to the prime rate in effect from time to time
(as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ ) plus six (6) percentage points,
until paid in full.

 



 

Section 8.9 _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, except: (a) as set forth in _Section 1.11_ with respect to
adjustments to the Merger Consideration, (b) as set forth in _Section 10.12_
with respect to specific performance or injunctive relief, (c) as set forth in
_Section 5.2_ with respect to Taxes, or (d) for any claim based upon fraud or
intentional misconduct, after the Closing the indemnification rights set forth
in this _Article VIII_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of (i) the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any breach of or inaccuracy in any of the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement, any
non-fulfillment or breach of any of the covenants and agreements of the
Shareholder Representative contained in this Agreement or any non-fulfillment
or breach of any of the covenants and agreements of the Company to be
performed prior to or at the Closing and contained in this Agreement and (ii)
the Company Indemnified Parties for any breach of or inaccuracy in any of the
representations and warranties of Parent, Purchaser or Merger Sub contained in
this Agreement or any non-fulfillment or breach of any of the covenants and
agreements of Purchaser contained in this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, (A) the limitation set forth in this _Section 8.9_ shall apply to all
of the Transaction Documents, except for any employment agreements to be
entered into in connection herewith and the Subscription Agreements, (B) shall
not apply to any covenants of the Key Shareholders contained in this Agreement
and (C) to the extent that any matter is subject to indemnification under
alternative provisions of this Agreement, an Indemnified Party may seek such
indemnification under such alternative provisions of this Agreement, but such
Indemnified Party may not recover duplicate amounts for its Losses relating to
such matter.

 



 

Section 8.10 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Any indemnification
payments made pursuant to this _Article VIII_ shall be treated as adjustments
to the Merger Consideration unless a contrary treatment is required by
applicable Law.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 8.11 _Limitations on Contribution and Certain Other Rights_. If,
following the Closing, any payment is made by the Equityholders, or any of
them, or otherwise becomes due from the Equityholders, or any of them,
pursuant to this _Article VIII_ in respect of any Losses, no Equityholder
shall have any rights against the Company or any of its Affiliates, whether by
reason of contribution, indemnification, subrogation or otherwise, in respect
of any such payment, and shall not take any action against the Company or any
of its Affiliates with respect thereto.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX** 
**SHAREHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE**

 



 

Section 9.1 _The Shareholder Representative_. The Shareholder Representative
shall act as the representative of the Equityholders in respect of all matters
arising under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, and shall be authorized
to act, or refrain from acting, in each case as the Shareholder Representative
believes is necessary or appropriate under this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, for and on behalf of the Equityholders, including any and all
actions required or permitted to be taken by the Shareholder Representative
under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement with respect to any claims
(including the defense and settlement thereof) made by a Purchaser Indemnified
Party against the Escrow Fund (including the exercise of the power to (i)
authorize the delivery of any or all of the Escrow Fund to a Purchaser
Indemnified Party in satisfaction of claims by a Purchaser Indemnified Party,
(ii) agree to negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and comply
with orders of courts with respect to such claims against the Escrow Fund and
(iii) take any and all actions necessary in the judgment of the Shareholder
Representative for the accomplishment of any or all of the foregoing). The
Equityholders shall be bound by all such actions taken by the Shareholder
Representative and no Equityholder shall be permitted to take any such
actions. The Shareholder Representative is serving as the Shareholder
Representative solely for purposes of administrative convenience, and in such
capacity is not personally liable for any of the obligations of the Company or
any of the Equityholders hereunder (except to the extent the Shareholder
Representative is itself an Equityholder), and Purchaser agrees that except as
may be provided in _Article VIII_ if the Shareholder Representative is also
an Equityholder, it will not look to the Shareholder Representative or the
underlying assets of the Shareholder Representative for the satisfaction of
any obligations of the Company or any of the Equityholders. As between the
Shareholder Representative and the Equityholders, the Shareholder
Representative shall not be liable for any error of judgment, or any action
taken, suffered or omitted to be taken, in connection with the performance by
the Shareholder Representative of the Shareholder Representatives duties or
the exercise by the Shareholder Representative of the Shareholder
Representatives rights and remedies under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement, except in the case of its bad faith or willful misconduct. As
between the Shareholder Representative and the Equityholders, no bond shall be
required of the Shareholder Representative. The Shareholder Representative may
consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants and other experts
selected by it and as between the Shareholder Representative and the
Equityholders, shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken
in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants
or experts. As between the Shareholder Representative and the Equityholders,
the Shareholder Representative shall not have any duty to ascertain or to
inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or
conditions of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. In all matters relating
to the Escrow Fund or indemnification claims by

 



       
 

 



 

Company Indemnified Parties, the Shareholder Representative shall be the only
party entitled to assert the rights of the Equityholders. The Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to conclusively rely on all statements,
representations and decisions of the Shareholder Representative relating to
the Escrow Fund or indemnity claims as those of the Equityholders without any
independent investigation or verification. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, in the event of a claim hereunder against a single
Equityholder, and not any other the Equityholders, such affected Equityholder
shall be entitled to control the defense of such claim.

 



 

Section 9.2 _Limitation on the Purchaser s Liability_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein, Purchaser shall not be liable for
any Losses to any Person, including any Equityholder, for any action taken or
not taken by the Shareholder Representative or for any act or omission taken
or not taken in reliance upon the actions taken or not taken or decisions,
communications or writings made, given or executed by the Shareholder
Representative, including any failure of the Shareholder Representative to
distribute, or to distribute or subdivide in the correct amounts, any payments
made to the Shareholder Representative by Purchaser for distribution to the
Equityholders and the other Person(s) entitled to receive distributions
thereof.

 



 

Section 9.3 _Replacement of the Shareholder Representative_. If the
Shareholder Representative (a) is dies or terminates its legal existence (if
not an individual), (b) becomes legally incapacitated or (c) resigns from its
position as the Shareholder Representative, then the Equityholders shall
promptly notify Purchaser in writing of the replacement Shareholder
Representative; _provided, however_ , that: (i) any such replacement
Shareholder Representative shall be subject to the consent of Purchaser, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; (ii) until a replacement
Shareholder Representative has been selected and consented to by Purchaser,
the Shareholder Representative to be replaced by such replacement Shareholder
Representative shall continue to serve as the Shareholder Representative
hereunder, except in the case of any of the events described in _clause (b)_
or _clause (c)_ above; and (iii) in the case of any of the events described
in _clause (b)_ or _clause (c)_ above, a replacement Shareholder
Representative shall be selected as soon as is possible, subject to
Purchasers consent as provided above, but until such replacement Shareholder
Representative begins to serve in such capacity, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, any time limit applicable to any covenant,
agreement, right or remedy of Purchaser or any of the other Purchaser
Indemnified Parties under this Agreement that must be performed or otherwise
fulfilled or must be elected or otherwise notified to the Shareholder
Representative shall be tolled until five (5) Business Days after such
replacement Shareholder Representative begins to serve in such capacity. Such
appointment shall be effective upon delivery of written notice to Purchaser
and, thereafter, the replacement Shareholder Representative shall be deemed to
be the Shareholder Representative for all purposes of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement. Any obligation of Purchaser to take any action in respect of
the Shareholder Representative shall be suspended during any period that the
position of the Shareholder Representative is vacant.

 



 

Section 9.4 _Shareholder Representative Fund_. Upon the Closing, in accordance
with _Section 1.9(e)_, Purchaser shall wire to the Shareholder Representative
the Shareholder Representative Deposit Amount, which shall be held by the
Shareholder Representative as agent and for the benefit of the Equityholders
in a segregated account (the " ** _Shareholder Representative Fund_** ") and
shall be used for the purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing the
Shareholder Representative for, any third party expenses pursuant to this
Agreement, the Escrow

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement or any other Transaction Document; _provided, however_ , that One
Million Dollars ($1,000,000) of the Shareholder Representative Deposit Amount
shall be retained by the Shareholder Representative until final determination
and payment of any post-Closing adjustment under _Section 1.11_ to serve as a
source of payment of any amounts due to Purchaser pursuant to _Section
1.11(e)_. Shareholder Representative will hold these funds separate from his
personal funds and will not use these funds for any personal purposes. The
Equityholders shall not receive interest or other earnings on amounts in the
Shareholder Representative Fund. The Equityholders acknowledge that the
Shareholder Representative is not providing any investment supervision,
recommendations or advice. The Shareholder Representative shall have no
responsibility or liability for any loss of principal of the Shareholder
Representative Fund other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful
misconduct. As soon as practicable following the later of (i) the three year
anniversary of the Closing or (ii) the final resolution in accordance with
_Article VIII_ of any indemnification claims by any Purchaser Indemnified
Party prior to the three year anniversary of the Closing, the Shareholder
Representative shall distribute the remaining Shareholder Representative Fund
(if any) among the Equityholders in accordance with their respective
allocation percentages set forth on _Schedule 1.5_. For tax purposes, the
Shareholder Representative Fund shall be treated as having been received and
voluntarily set aside by the Equityholders at the time of Closing. The Parties
agree that the Shareholder Representative is not acting as a withholding agent
or in any similar capacity in connection with the Shareholder Representative
Fund.

hereby (other than the Consents set forth on _Section 3.3_ of the Purchaser
Disclosure Schedule). Any purported assignment or delegation of this Agreement
or any rights, interests or obligations hereunder in violation of this

upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns.

 



 

Section 10.4 _Amendment and Waiver_. This Agreement may not be amended except
by an instrument in writing executed by Purchaser and the Company (prior to
the Closing) or the Shareholder Representative (after the Closing), which
states that it constitutes an amendment to this Agreement and specifies the
provision(s) that are being amended; _provided_ , that this _Section 10.4_,

10.11_ (Remedies) and any related definitions used in such Sections shall not
be amended in a manner adverse to the Financing Sources without the Financing
Sources prior written consent. Any provision of this Agreement may be waived
at any time by (a) Purchaser, by delivery to the Company (prior to the
Closing) or the Shareholder Representative (after the Closing) of a written
instrument executed by Purchaser, which states that it constitutes a waiver of
this Agreement and specifies the provision(s) that are being waived, (b) the
Company Holders and the Company (prior to the Closing), by delivery by the
Company to Purchaser of a written instrument executed by the Company, which
states that it constitutes a waiver of this Agreement and specifies the
provision(s) that are being waived and (c) the Company Holders (after to the
Closing), by delivery by the Shareholder Representative to Purchaser of a
written instrument executed by the Shareholder Representative, which states
that it constitutes a waiver of this Agreement and specifies the provision(s)
that are being waived. Any such waiver shall be effective only to the extent
specifically set forth in such written instrument. Neither the exercise (from
time to time

 



      
 

 



 

and at any time) by a Party of, nor the delay or failure (at any time or for
any period of time) to exercise by a Party, any right, power or remedy shall
constitute a waiver of the right to exercise, or impair, limit or restrict the
exercise of, such right, power or remedy or any other right, power or remedy
at any time and from time to time thereafter. No waiver of any right, power or
remedy of a Party shall be deemed to be a waiver of any other right, power or
remedy of such Party or shall, except to the extent so waived, impair, limit
or restrict the exercise of such right, power or remedy.

 



 

Section 10.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including the annex, exhibits
and schedules hereto, along with the other Transaction Documents and the
Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire agreement of the Parties, and
supersedes all other prior or contemporaneous Contracts (whether written or
oral), by or among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof, including any letter of intent, term sheet or memorandum of terms
entered into or exchanged by the Parties or any of their respective
Affiliates. The annex, exhibits and schedules specifically referred to herein,
and delivered pursuant hereto, are an integral part of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.6 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this
Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement shall hereafter
be held to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, in whole or in part, in any
jurisdiction under any circumstances for any reason (a) such provision shall
be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to cause such provision to be
valid, enforceable and legal while preserving the intent of the Parties as
expressed in, and the benefits to such Parties provided by, such provision or
(b) if such provision cannot be so reformed, such provision shall be severed
from this Agreement and an equitable adjustment shall be made to this
Agreement (including addition of necessary further provisions to this
Agreement) so as to give effect to the intent as so expressed and the benefits
so provided to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law. Such holding
shall not affect or impair the validity, enforceability or legality of such
provision in any other jurisdiction or under any other circumstances. Neither
such holding nor such reformation or severance shall affect or impair the
legality, validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement.

counterpart signature pages have been signed by each Party and delivered by
each Party to the other Parties, it being understood that the Parties need not
sign the same counterpart. Counterparts may be delivered by facsimile or other
electronic transmission method (including pdf), and any counterpart so
delivered shall be deemed to have been duly and validly delivered and be valid
and effective for all purposes.

HEREBY, ALL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE PARTIES HEREUNDER AND ALL DISPUTES AND
PROCEEDINGS (IN CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
ANY OF THE FOREGOING SHALL

SOURCE THAT MAY BE BASED UPON, ARISE OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY FINANCING, OR
THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE OF ANY DOCUMENTATION IN CONNECTION
THEREWITH, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF
THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW WHICH
WOULD REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION.

 



 

Section 10.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

(a) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY AGREES THAT ALL
PROCEEDINGS (IN CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO

BETWEEN THE PARTIES HEREUNDER AND ANY DISPUTES WITH RESPECT TO ANY OF THE
FOREGOING SHALL BE COMMENCED AND PROSECUTED EXCLUSIVELY IN THE FEDERAL AND
STATE COURTS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE AND ANY APPELLATE COURT THEREFROM
(COLLECTIVELY, THE " ** _DELAWARE COURTS_** "). EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY CONSENTS AND SUBMITS, FOR ITSELF AND ITS ASSETS, TO THE
EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY OF THE DELAWARE COURTS IN RESPECT OF ANY SUCH
PROCEEDING. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY CONSENTS TO

AGREEMENT TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW.

 



 

(b) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT IT MAY LEGALLY AND EFFECTIVELY DO SO, ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY NOW OR
HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR

ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY, ANY RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE PARTIES HEREUNDER AND ANY DISPUTES WITH

AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDING.

 



 

(d) EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY PROCEEDING ARISING UNDER OR

Section 10.11 _Remedies_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the provisions of _Section 8.9_, each of the Parties shall
have and retain all rights and remedies, at law or in equity, including rights
to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief, arising out
of or relating to a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 10.11(a)_, each of the
Parties acknowledges that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for
any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement and that the non-breaching
Parties would be damaged irreparably and would have no adequate remedy of law
if any provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or otherwise is breached. Accordingly, each Party agrees that
the other Parties shall be entitled to a decree of specific performance to
enforce the rights and obligations of the Parties from any court of competent
jurisdiction, and appropriate injunctive relief may be applied for and granted
in connection therewith, without the necessity of posting a bond or other
security or proving actual damages and without regard to the adequacy of any
remedy at law.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided herein or in any other
document delivered pursuant hereto or in connection herewith, this Agreement
may only be enforced against, and any action for breach of this Agreement may
only be brought against, the entities that are parties hereto. For the
avoidance of doubt, no claim shall be brought or maintained by the
Equityholders, the Shareholders Representative, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates, successors or assigns against any Financing Source in
connection with this Agreement, any financing commitment letter or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby whether at law or equity, in
contract tort or otherwise.

 



 

Section 10.12 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. No Person other than the Parties
has, is intended to have, or shall have any rights, remedies, obligations or
benefits under any provision of this Agreement, other than (a) any permitted
successors and assigns of the Parties under _Section 10.3_ (who are intended
third party beneficiaries of this Agreement), (b) the Covered Parties (who are
intended third party beneficiaries of _Section 5.5_), and (c) the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties and the Company Indemnified Parties (who are intended
third party beneficiaries of _Article VIII_). Notwithstanding the foregoing
or anything herein to the contrary, the Financing Sources shall be third party
beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to enforce, _Section 10.4_ (Amendment
and Waiver), _Section 10.9_ (Governing Law), _Section 10.10_ (Consent to
Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial ), _Section 10.11_ (Remedies) and this
_Section 10.12_, which Sections shall survive any termination of this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.13 _Interpretation_. All references in this Agreement to annexes,
exhibits, schedules, articles, sections, subsections and other subdivisions
refer to the corresponding annexes, exhibits, schedules, articles, sections,
subsections and other subdivisions of or to this Agreement unless expressly
provided otherwise. Any capitalized term used but not defined in an annex or
schedule to this Agreement have the meaning set forth in this Agreement. The
words "this Agreement," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and "hereof," and
words of similar import, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular article, section, subsection or other subdivision hereof unless
expressly so limited herein. The words "either," "or," "neither," "nor," and
"any" are not exclusive, and the word "or" is deemed to have the meaning
"and/or". The word "including" (in its various forms) means including without
limitation. All references to "$" and dollars shall be deemed to refer to
United States currency unless otherwise specifically provided. Pronouns in
masculine, feminine or neuter genders shall be construed to state and include
any other gender, and words, terms and titles (including terms defined herein)
in the singular form shall be construed to include the plural and vice versa,
unless the context otherwise requires. Unless expressly stated to the
contrary, references in this Agreement or Annex A to any Contract are to that
Contract as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time in accordance
with the terms thereof. References in this Agreement to a Person shall include
the successors and assigns thereof. All references to materials in this
Agreement, including any report, record, file or other document, shall, in
each case, include any form or medium of such materials (including electronic
form).

 



 

Section 10.14 _Construction_. The language used in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be the language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual
intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any Party
based on any claim that such Party or counsel to such Party drafted this
Agreement or any provision hereof. The information contained in this Agreement
and in the schedules hereto is disclosed solely for purposes of this
Agreement, and no

 



      
 

 



 

information contained herein or therein shall be deemed to be an admission by
any Party to any third party of any matter whatsoever (including any violation
of Law or breach of Contract). Each representation and warranty contained
herein is independent of all other representations and warranties contained
herein (whether or not covering an identical or a related subject matter) and
must be independently and separately complied with and satisfied. Exceptions
or qualifications to any representations or warranties contained in the text
thereof or schedules thereto shall not be construed as exceptions or
qualifications to any other representation or warranty, except that the
Parties acknowledge and agree that with respect to the Company Disclosure
Schedule, any exception to a representation and warranty of the Company that
is disclosed in a section thereof under a caption referencing such
representation and warranty shall be deemed to also be an exception to each
other representation and warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement
for which a separate section is provided in the Company Disclosure Schedule,
notwithstanding the absence of a cross reference thereto, if and to the extent
that it would be reasonably apparent that such exception is applicable to such
other representation and warranty.

 



 

Section 10.15 _Retention of Counsel_. In any dispute or proceeding arising
under or in connection with this Agreement following the Closing, Shareholder
Representative and the Company Holders shall have the right, at their
respective elections, to retain Locke Lord LLP to represent them in such
matter, and Parent, Purchaser and Merger Sub, for itself and, after the
Closing, for the Company, and for their respective successors and assigns,
hereby irrevocably waive and consent to any such representation in any such
matter and the communication by such counsel to Shareholder Representative and
any Company Holder in connection with any such representation of any fact
known to such counsel arising by reason of such counsels prior representation
of the Group Companies.

 



 

Section 10.16 _Protected Communications_. The parties to this Agreement agree
that, immediately prior to the Closing, without the need for any further
action (a) all right, title and interest of the Group Companies in and to all
Protected Communications shall thereupon transfer to and be vested solely in
Shareholder Representative solely for the benefit of the Company Holders, and
(b) any and all protections from disclosure, including, but not limited to,
attorney-client privileges and work product protections, associated with or
arising from any Protected Communications that would have been exercisable by
any Group Company shall thereupon be vested exclusively in Shareholder
Representative solely for the benefit of the Company Holders and shall be
exercised or waived solely as directed by Shareholder Representative. All
rights, files, and information that are not Protected Communications,
including matters that relate to the operation of the Group Companies and the
Liabilities of the Group Companies shall belong to the Company. Neither the
Company, its Subsidiaries, Parent, Purchaser, Merger Sub or any Person acting
on any of their behalf shall, without the prior written consent of Shareholder
Representative, assert or waive or attempt to assert or waive any such
protection against disclosure, including, but not limited to, the attorney-
client privilege or work product protection with respect to, or to discover,
obtain, use or disclose or attempt to discover, obtain, use or disclose any
Protected Communications in connection with any dispute or Proceeding with
Shareholder Representative or the Company Holders relating to or in connection
with, this Agreement, the events and negotiations leading to this Agreement,
or any of the transactions contemplated herein; _provided_ , _however_ , the
foregoing shall neither prohibit Purchaser from seeking proper discovery of
such documents nor Shareholder Representative from asserting that such
documents are not discoverable to the extent that applicable attorney-client
privileges and

 



      
 

 



 

work product protections have attached thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event that a dispute arises between Parent, Purchaser, Merger Sub, or
any Group Company, on the one hand, and a Person other than Shareholder
Representative, a Company Holder or one of their Affiliates, on the other
hand, after the Closing, Parent, Purchaser, Merger Sub and any Group Company,
as applicable, may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure
of Protected Communications to such third party.
