set forth in this Agreement, whereby, except as expressly provided in Section

the Company as of the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
receive the Offer Price, in cash, without interest and (ii) the Company shall
become a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent as a result of the Merger.

Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, are fair

stockholders, (ii) agreed that the Merger shall be effected under Section
251(h) and other relevant provisions of the DGCL, (iii) approved the

1 AGREEMENT

 

The Parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

 

SECTION 1\. THE OFFER

1.1 The Offer.

(a) Commencement of the Offer. Provided that this Agreement shall not have
been terminated in accordance with Section 8, as promptly as practicable
after the date of this Agreement but in no event more than ten (10) business
days after the date of this Agreement, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange
Act) the Offer.

(b) Terms and Conditions of the Offer. The obligations of Purchaser to, and
of Parent to cause Purchaser to, accept for payment, and pay for, any Shares
(including Shares issued pursuant to Company Restricted Stock Awards) tendered
pursuant to the Offer are subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, including the prior satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the
satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions set forth in Annex I
(collectively, the " _Offer Conditions_ "). The Offer shall be made by means
of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ") that contains the terms
set forth in this Agreement, the Minimum Condition and the other Offer
Conditions. Purchaser expressly reserves the right to (i) increase the Offer
Price, (ii) waive any Offer Condition and (iii) make any other changes in the
terms and conditions of the Offer not inconsistent with the terms of this
Agreement; _provided, however,_ that unless otherwise provided by this
Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Company, Purchaser shall
not (A) decrease the Offer Price, (B) change the form of consideration payable
in the Offer, (C) decrease the maximum number of Shares sought to be purchased
in the Offer, (D) impose conditions or requirements to the Offer in addition
to the Offer Conditions, (E) amend or modify any of the Offer Conditions in a
manner that adversely affects, or reasonably could adversely affect, any
holder of Shares, (F) change or waive the Minimum Condition, (G) extend or
otherwise change the Expiration Date in a manner other than as required or
permitted by this Agreement, or (H) provide any "subsequent offering period"
within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The
Offer may not be withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date (or any rescheduled
Expiration Date) of the Offer, unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with Section 8.

 

(c) Expiration and Extension of the Offer. The Offer shall initially be
scheduled to expire at one minute following 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on the
date that is twenty business days following the Offer Commencement Date,
determined as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and Rule 14e-1(a) under the
Exchange Act (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company)
(the " _Initial Expiration Date,_ " such date or such subsequent date to
which the expiration of the Offer is extended in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, but subject to the Parties respective
termination rights under Section 8: (i) if, as of the scheduled Expiration
Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived, Purchaser
may, in its discretion (and without the consent of the Company or any other
Person), extend the Offer on one or more occasions, for an additional period
of up to ten (10) business 

 



2  days per extension, to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied; (ii)
Purchaser shall extend the Offer from time to time for: (A) any period
required by any Legal Requirement, any interpretation or position of the SEC,
the staff thereof or NASDAQ applicable to the Offer; and (B) periods of up to
ten (10) business days per extension, until any waiting period (and any
extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Offer under the HSR
Act and the Antitrust Laws in the jurisdictions specified in Schedule 1.1(c)
shall have expired or been terminated; and (iii) if, as of the scheduled
Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been
waived, at the request of the Company, Purchaser shall extend the Offer on one
or more occasions for an additional period of up to ten (10) business days per
extension, to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied;
_provided, however,_ that in no event shall Purchaser: (1) be required to
extend the Offer beyond the earliest to occur of (the " _Extension Deadline_
") (x) the valid termination of this Agreement in compliance with Section 8
and (y) the first business day immediately following the End Date; or (2) be
permitted to extend the Offer beyond the Extension Deadline without the prior
written consent of the Company. Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior
to any scheduled Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the
Company except in the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 8.

 

(d) Termination of Offer. In the event that this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 8.1, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser
to) promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours of such
termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and shall
not acquire any Shares pursuant to the Offer. If the Offer is terminated
or withdrawn by Purchaser, Purchaser shall promptly return, and shall cause
any depository acting on behalf of Purchaser to return, in accordance with
applicable Legal Requirements, all tendered Shares to the registered holders
thereof.

 

(e) Offer Documents. As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of
the Offer (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent
and Purchaser shall (i) file with the SEC a tender offer statement on Schedule
TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto and including exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") that will
contain or incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase and form of the
related letter of transmittal and (ii) cause the Offer to Purchase and related
documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares. Parent and Purchaser agree
that they shall cause the Schedule TO and all exhibits, amendments or
supplements thereto (which together constitute the " _Offer Documents_ ")
filed by either Parent or Purchaser with the SEC to comply in all material
respects with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and
other applicable Legal Requirements. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company
agrees to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent further agrees to take
all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed
with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and
to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company
shall promptly furnish or otherwise make available to Parent and Purchaser or
Parents legal counsel all information concerning the Company, its
Subsidiaries and the Companys stockholders that may be required in connection
with any action contemplated by this Section 1.1(e). The Company and its
counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Offer Documents prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. Parent and Purchaser
agree to provide the Company

 



3  and its counsel with any comments Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may
receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly
after receipt of such comments. Each of Parent and Purchaser shall respond
promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents or the Offer. Parent and Purchaser shall provide the Company and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in the formulation of any
response to any such comments of the SEC or its staff.

(f) Funds. Without limiting the generality of Section 9.10, Parent shall
cause to be provided to Purchaser all of the funds necessary to purchase any
Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer, and
shall cause Purchaser to perform, on a timely basis, all of Purchasers
obligations under this Agreement.

(g) Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Offer Acceptance Time, the outstanding Shares are changed into a different
number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of
shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then
the Offer Price shall be appropriately adjusted.

1.2 Company Actions. 

(a) Schedule 14D-9. As promptly as practicable on the day that the Offer is
commenced, following the filing of the Schedule TO, the Company shall file
with the SEC and disseminate to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable federal securities laws, a Tender Offer
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with
any exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ")
that, subject to Section 6.1(b), shall reflect the Company Board
Recommendation. The Company agrees that it shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to
comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and other applicable
Legal Requirements. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to
respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff and to promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and
to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect, and the Company further agrees to take all steps
necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the
SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and Purchaser
shall promptly furnish or otherwise make available to Company or
Companys legal counsel all information concerning Parent and Purchaser and
their stockholders that may be required in connection with any action
contemplated by this Section 1.2(a). Parent and its counsel shall be given
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 and any
amendment thereto prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. The Company agrees
to provide Parent and its counsel with any comments the Company or its counsel
may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9
promptly after receipt of such comments. The Company shall respond promptly to
any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9. The
Company shall provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the formulation of any response to such comments of the SEC or
its staff.

(b) Stockholder Lists. The Company shall cause its transfer agent to promptly
furnish Parent with a list of its stockholders, mailing labels and any
available listing or

 



4  computer file containing the names and addresses of all record holders of
Shares and lists of securities positions of Shares held in stock depositories,
in each case accurate and complete as of the most recent practicable date,
and shall provide to Parent such additional information (including updated
lists of stockholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and
such other assistance as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the
Offer. Parent and Purchaser and their agents shall hold in confidence the
information contained in any such labels, listings and files, shall use such
information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if
this Agreement shall be terminated, shall deliver, and shall use their
reasonable efforts to cause their agents to deliver, to the Company (or
destroy) all copies and any extracts or summaries from such information then
in their possession or control. 

SECTION 2\. MERGER TRANSACTION

 

2.1 Merger of Purchaser into the Company. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the Section
251(h) of the DGCL, at the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall
consummate the Merger, whereby Purchaser shall be merged with and into the
Company, and the separate existence of Purchaser shall cease. The Company
will continue as the Surviving Corporation.

2.2 Effect of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this
Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

2.3 Closing; Effective Time.

 

(a) Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to Section 8,

and Purchaser, the consummation of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take
place at the offices of Hogan Lovells US LLP, 975 Third Avenue, New York, NY
10022, at 8:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on the first business day following the
Offer Acceptance Time except if the condition set forth in Section 7.1 shall
not be satisfied or waived by such date, in which case on no later than the
first business day on which Section 7.1 is satisfied or waived. The date on
which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing
Date_."

 

(b) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the
Closing Date, the Company and Purchaser shall file or cause to be filed a
certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
with respect to the Merger, in such form as required by, and executed and
acknowledged in accordance with, Section 251(h) of the DGCL. The Merger shall
become effective upon the date and time of the filing of such certificate of
merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or such later date
and time as is agreed upon in writing by the Parties and specified in the
certificate of merger (such date and time, the " _Effective Time_ ").

2.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers.

(a) Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time:

 

(i) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated as of the Effective Time to conform to Exhibit B;

 



5 (ii) the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as
of the Effective Time to conform to the Bylaws of Purchaser as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

(iii) the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately

on Schedule 2.4(a)(iii) and (2) the amendment and restatement of the Bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation as contemplated by Section 2.4(a)(ii)). The
Company and Parent agree that any such resignation as a director does not
terminate any employment relationship of such individual with the Company, and
shall be without prejudice to any rights that such director may have under
any existing employment, severance or other similar agreement with the Company
or under applicable Legal Requirement.

 

2.5 Conversion of Shares.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or any other Person:

Company (or held in the Companys treasury) shall automatically be canceled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor;

 

(ii) any Shares then held by Parent, Purchaser or any other wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

Section 2.5(b), each Share then outstanding (other than any Dissenting Shares)
shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash, without
interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), subject to any withholding of
Taxes required by applicable Legal Requirements in accordance with Section
2.6(e) upon surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share
representing such Share in accordance with Section 2.6(b); and

(iv) each share of the common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of Purchaser
then outstanding shall be converted into one share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or class of shares by
reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend,
reverse stock split, consolidation of 

 



6  shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction,
then the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted.

 

2.6 Surrender of Certificates; Stock Transfer Books.

 

(a) Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company, reasonably acceptable to the Company, for the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock and Non-Employee Equity Awards to receive the funds to
which holders of such shares and such Non-Employee Equity Awards shall become
entitled pursuant to Section 1.1(b) and to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_
") for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock or Non-Employee Equity
Awards to receive the funds to which holders of such shares and such Non-
Employee Equity Awards shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.5 (along
with applicable amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.8(d)). The Paying Agent
agreement pursuant to which Parent shall appoint the Paying Agent shall be in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company. At or prior to the
Offer Acceptance Time, Parent or Purchaser shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent cash sufficient to make payment of the cash
consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.1(b) and with the Paying
Agent cash sufficient to make payment of the cash consideration payable
pursuant to Sections 2.5 and, if applicable, Section 2.8(d) (together, the "
_Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five (5)
business days thereafter), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to
each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of the shares
of Company Common Stock or Non-Employee Equity Awards entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5 (including in connection with an
exercise or deemed exercise of a Company Warrant) or Section 2.8(d) a form of
letter of transmittal (which shall be in reasonable and customary form and
shall specify that, in the case of the shares of Company Common
Stock, delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
certificates evidencing such shares (the " _Certificates_ ") shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent), and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to such letter of
transmittal. With respect to shares of Company Common Stock, upon surrender to
the Paying Agent of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions,
the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of
Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, and such Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall then be canceled. No
interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon the
surrender of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the benefit of the
holder thereof. If the payment of any Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificates
formerly evidencing the shares of Company Common Stock is registered on the
stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that
the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other

 



7  than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes
either have been paid or are not applicable. Payment of the applicable Merger
Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the
Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.

 

(c) At any time following twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, the
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying
Agent to deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying
Agent and not disbursed to holders of Non-Employee Equity Awards, Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares (including all interest and other income received by the
Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to it), and, thereafter,
such holders shall be entitled to look to the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar Legal
Requirements) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger
Consideration that may, in the case of holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, be payable only upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares held by them (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Non-Employee Equity Awards,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration delivered in
respect of such share to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Legal Requirements. Any amounts remaining unclaimed
by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to
or become property of any Governmental Body shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the property of the Parent or its
designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

 

(d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company with respect to the shares of Company Common
Stock shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of the shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise provided
herein or by applicable Legal Requirements.

 

(e) Each of the Surviving Corporation, Paying Agent, Parent and Purchaser
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause the Paying Agent to deduct
and withhold) from the Merger Consideration payable to any holder of the
Shares or any other consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as it is required by any Legal Requirement to deduct and
withhold with respect to Taxes. Each such payor shall take all action that
may be necessary to ensure that any such amounts so withheld are promptly and
properly remitted to the appropriate Governmental Body. If any withholding
obligation may be avoided by a payee providing information or documentation
to the applicable payor, such payor shall request such information from such
payee and use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid such withholding
obligation. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and properly remitted
to the appropriate Governmental Body, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of
Company Common Stock or other recipient of consideration hereunder in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



8 (f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as Parent or Paying Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate (which shall not
exceed the Merger Consideration payable with respect to such Certificate), the
Paying Agent will pay (less any amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld
pursuant to Section 2.6(e)), in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, as
contemplated by this Section 2.

2.7 Dissenters Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and held by holders who are entitled to demand appraisal
rights under Section 262 of the DGCL and have properly exercised and perfected
their respective demands for appraisal of such shares in the time and manner
provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, have
neither effectively withdrawn nor lost their rights to such appraisal and
payment under the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted
into the right to receive Merger Consideration, but shall, by virtue of the
Merger, be entitled to only such consideration as shall be determined pursuant
to Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided, that_ if any such holder shall have
failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such holders
right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, such holders shares of Company
Common Stock shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (less any amounts entitled
to be deducted or withheld pursuant to Section 2.6(e)), and such shares shall
not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give prompt notice
to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock,
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL received by the Company, and Parent shall have the right to participate
in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will not, without prior written
consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle,
or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of
the foregoing.

2.8 Treatment of Company Options and Company RSUs; Company Restricted Stock
Awards and Company Warrants. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if
appropriate, any committee administering the Company Equity Plans) shall
adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as may be required to
provide that:

(a) Each Company Option that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by an individual who, as of the Effective
Time, is an active employee, director or consultant of the Company (each a "
_Company Accelerated Option_ "), shall accelerate and become fully vested and
exercisable effective immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the Effective
Time. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
further action on the part of the holders thereof, the Parent, Purchaser or
the Company, each Company Option that is then outstanding and unexercised
shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount
equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to the vested portion of such

 



9  Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (taking into account
any acceleration of vesting), multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of (x)
the Merger Consideration over (y) the exercise price payable per Share under
such Company Option, which amount shall be paid in accordance with Section
2.8(d). No holder of a Company Option that has an exercise price per Share
that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be entitled
to any payment with respect to such cancelled Company Option before or after
the Effective Time.

 

 __(b) __Each Company RSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by an individual who, as of the Effective Time, is an
active employee, director or consultant of the Company (each a " _Company
Accelerated RSU_ "), shall accelerate and become fully vested effective
immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the Effective Time. In lieu of any
issuance of shares of Company Common Stock in settlement of such Company RSU,
as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of the holders thereof, the Parent, Purchaser or the
Company, each Company RSU that is outstanding shall be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive cash in an amount in cash equal to the product of
(i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable in settlement
of the vested portion of such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective
Time (taking into account any acceleration of vesting), multiplied by (ii) the
Merger Consideration, which amount shall be paid in accordance with Section
2.8(d). __

(c) Each Company Restricted Stock Award that is outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Offer Acceptance Time shall accelerate and become fully vested
such that the Companys right of reacquisition or repurchase, as applicable,
shall lapse in full effective immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the
Offer Acceptance Time. As of the Offer Acceptance Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any further action on the part of the holders thereof, the
Parent, Purchaser or the Company, each share of Company Common Stock
underlying each Company Restricted Stock Award shall be treated as an
outstanding Share for purposes of this Agreement, including for purposes of
tendering pursuant to the Offer.

(d) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but no later
than the later of ten (10) business days after the Effective Time or the first
payroll date after the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration, net of any applicable
withholding Taxes, payable with respect to Company Options and Company RSUs
through, to the extent applicable, the Surviving Corporations payroll
(subject to any required tax withholdings) to the holders of Company Options
and Company RSUs; _provided, however,_ that to the extent the holder of a
Company Option or a Company RSU is not, and was not at any time during the
vesting period of the Company Option or Company RSU, as applicable, a Company
employee (each such Company Option or Company RSU a " _Non-Employee Equity
Award_ "), the consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.8(a) with respect
to such Company Options or pursuant to Section 2.8(b) with respect to such
Company RSUs shall be paid by the Paying Agent in the manner described in
Section 2.6.

 

(e) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall satisfy all notification
requirements under the terms of any Company Warrants.

 



10 2.9 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation
with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of
Purchaser and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Purchaser, in
the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

 

SECTION 3\. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Section or subsection in this Section 3; (b) any exception or disclosure set
forth in any other part or subpart of the Company Disclosure Schedule to the
extent it is reasonably apparent from the wording of such exception or
disclosure that such exception or disclosure is applicable to qualify such

equity interest of, or any equity interest of any nature in, any other Entity,
other than the Entities identified in Part 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and securities in a publicly traded company held for investment by

number of Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer to satisfy the Minimum Condition, no vote of stockholders of the
Company shall be required to authorize the Merger.

(c) Each Subsidiary of the Company is an Entity duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization, except where

 



11  the failure to be in good standing does not have, and would not reasonably
be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

3.2 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. The Company has delivered or made
available to Parent or Parents Representatives accurate and complete copies

nor is it bound by any Contract pursuant to which it may become obligated, to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock or other securities other than pursuant to the Company
Convertible Notes. The Company Common Stock constitutes the only outstanding

3.4 SEC Filings; Financial Statements.

 

 __(a) __Since January 1, 2014, the Company has filed or furnished on a
timely basis all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents
(including exhibits and all other information incorporated therein) required
to be filed or furnished by the Company with the SEC (the " _Company SEC
Documents_ "). As of their respective dates, the Company SEC Documents
complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act,
the Exchange Act or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the "
_Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of
the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Documents and,
except to the extent that information contained in such Company SEC Document
has been revised, amended, modified or superseded (prior to the date of this
Agreement) by a later filed Company SEC Document, none of the Company SEC
Documents when filed or furnished contained any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. __

 

 __(b) __The consolidated financial statements (including any related notes
and schedules) contained or incorporated by reference in the Company SEC
Documents: (i) complied as to form in all material respects with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC applicable thereto; (ii) were
prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
covered (except as may be indicated in the notes to such financial statements
or as permitted by Regulation S-X, or, in the case of unaudited financial
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q, Form 8-K or any successor form under
the Exchange Act); and (iii) fairly present, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the
respective dates thereof and the results of operations and cash flows of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the periods covered thereby

the case of the unaudited financial statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of
the SEC, and except that unaudited financial statements may not contain
footnotes and are subject to year-end adjustments). No financial statements of
any Person other than the Subsidiaries of the Company are required by GAAP to
be included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. __

 

(c) The Company maintains, and at all times since January 1, 2014 has
maintained, a system of internal controls over financial reporting (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) which is
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures
that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in
accordance 

 



14  with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of the Company
that could have a material effect on the financial statements. The Companys
management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys
system of internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2015, and such assessment concluded that such controls were
effective. Except as set forth in Part 3.4(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule or the Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this
Agreement, since January 1, 2014, neither the Company nor the Companys
independent registered accountant has identified or been made aware of: (1)
any significant deficiency or material weakness in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting utilized by the Company; (2) any
illegal act or fraud, whether or not material, that involves the management
or other employees of the Company; or (3) any claim or allegation regarding
any of the foregoing.

(d) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that all
material information required to be disclosed in the Companys reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to enable each of the principal executive officer of
the Company and the principal financial officer of the Company to make the
certifications required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. 

(e) The Company is not a party to nor has any obligation or other commitment
to become a party to any securitization transaction, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among the Company, on the one hand, and
any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance,
special purpose or limited purpose Entity, on the other hand, or any "off-
balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under
the Exchange Act)) where the result, purpose or intended effect of such
Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, the Company in the Companys published financial
statements or other Company SEC Documents.

 

(f) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved
comments in comment letters received from the SEC with respect to the Company
SEC Documents. To the knowledge of the Company, none of the Company SEC
Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review and there are no inquiries or
investigations by the SEC or any internal investigations pending or
overtly threatened, in each case regarding any accounting practices of the
Company.

__(g) __Each document required to be filed by the Company with the SEC in
connection with the Offer (the " _Company Disclosure Documents_ ") (including
the Schedule 14D-9), and any amendments or supplements thereto, when filed,
distributed or disseminated, as applicable, will comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act. The
Company Disclosure Documents, at the time of the filing of such __

 



15  Company Disclosure Documents or any supplement or amendment thereto with the
SEC and at the time such Company Disclosure Documents or any supplements or
amendments thereto are first distributed or disseminated to the Companys
stockholders, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

(i) The information with respect to the Company that the Company furnishes to
Parent or Purchaser in writing specifically for use in the Schedule TO and
the Offer Documents, at the time of the filing of the Schedule TO and at the
time of any distribution or dissemination of the Offer Documents, will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no representation with
respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Purchaser for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Company Disclosure Documents.

 

(h) Since January 1, 2013 there have not been any disagreements with the
current or former independent accountants engaged as the principal
accountants to audit the Companys financial statements, or an independent
accountant who was previously engaged to audit a significant subsidiary of the
Company and on whom the principal accountants expressed reliance in
their report, on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial
statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreement(s),
if required to be disclosed in the Company SEC Documents pursuant to the
published rules and regulations of the SEC applicable thereto, were not so
disclosed in a timely manner.

(i) Since January 1, 2013, except as set forth on Part 3.4(i) of the Company

(l) There is no agreement, plan, arrangement or other Contract covering any
employee or independent contractor or former employee or independent

considered collectively with any other such Contracts, will give rise to the
payment of any amount in connection with the Merger that would not be
deductible pursuant to Section 280G of the Code. The Acquired Corporations
are not a party to any Contract that would require, nor do the Acquired
Corporations have any obligation (current or contingent), to compensate any

required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

reasonable advance notice to the Company, the Acquired Corporations shall, and
shall cause the respective Representatives of the Acquired Corporations to:
(a) provide Parent and Parents Representatives with reasonable access during

Tax Returns, work papers and other documents and information relating to the
Acquired Corporations, and with such additional financial, operating and other
data and information regarding the Acquired Corporations, as Parent may
reasonably request; _provided, however,_ that any such access shall be
conducted at Parents expense, at a reasonable time, under the supervision of
appropriate personnel of the Acquired Corporations and in such a manner as
not to unreasonably interfere with the normal operation of the business of the
Acquired Corporations. Nothing herein shall require the Acquired Corporations
to disclose any information concerning Acquisition Proposals, which shall be
governed by Section 5.3(c), or any information to Parent if such disclosure
would, in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Company (i) jeopardize any
attorney-client or other legal privilege or (ii) contravene any applicable
Legal Requirement, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to
the date of this Agreement (including any confidentiality agreement to which
the Acquired Corporation or its Affiliates is a party); _provided, further_ ,
that with respect to clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 5.1, the Company,
as applicable, shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (A) obtain the
required consent of any such third party to provide such inspection
or disclosure, (B) develop an alternative to providing such information so as
to address such matters that is reasonably acceptable to Parent or (C) utilize
the procedures of a joint defense agreement or implement such other techniques
if the parties determine that doing so would reasonably permit the disclosure
of such information without violating applicable Law or jeopardizing such

 



36 _ _ privilege; ___provided, further,_ __that information shall be disclosed
subject to execution of a joint defense agreement in customary form, and
disclosure may be limited to external counsel for Parent, to the extent the
Acquired Corporation determines doing so may be reasonably required for the
purpose of complying with applicable Antitrust Laws. To the extent that any of
the information or material furnished pursuant to this Section 5.1 or
otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement may include material
subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other
applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or
governmental investigations, the parties understand and agree that they have a
commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is their desire,
intention and mutual understanding that the sharing of such material is not
intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality
of such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All such
information that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain
entitled to such protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under
the joint defense doctrine. With respect to the information disclosed
pursuant to this Section 5.1, Parent shall comply with, and shall instruct
Parents Representatives to comply with, all of its obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement dated October 23, 2015, between the Company and
Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). __

declare advisable, or propose to approve, recommend or declare advisable, or
allow the Company to execute or enter into any Contract with respect to any

paying for such number of Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn

good faith, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer, (x) the
Companys Board of Directors may make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation,

stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (B) the Company shall have
given Parent prior written notice of its intention to consider making a
Company Adverse Change Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to

and (3) after considering the results of such negotiations and giving effect
to the proposals made by Parent, if any, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, the Companys Board of Directors shall have determined, in good
faith, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer and that the
failure to make the Company Adverse Change Recommendation or terminate this

fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the Company to the Companys
stockholders under applicable

 



43  Legal Requirements. Issuance of any "stop, look and listen" communication by
or on behalf of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) shall not be considered

Board of Directors may make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation in

the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (B) the
Company shall have given Parent a Determination Notice at least five (5)
business days prior to making any such Company Adverse Change Recommendation;

business days after the Determination Notice to propose revisions to the terms
of this Agreement or make another proposal so that such Change in Circumstance
would no longer necessitate a Company Adverse Change Recommendation, and
shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent with respect to such proposed
revisions or other proposal, if any, and (3) after considering the results of
such negotiations and giving effect to the proposals made by Parent, if any,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, the Companys Board of
Directors shall have determined, in good faith, that the failure to make the
Company Adverse Change Recommendation in response to such Change in
Circumstance would reasonably constitute a breach of fiduciary duties of the
Board of Directors of the Company to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Legal Requirements. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of
this Section 6.1(b)(ii) shall also apply to any material change to the facts
and circumstances relating to such Change in Circumstance and require a new
Determination Notice, except that the references to five (5) business days
shall be deemed to be three (3) business days.

action with respect to, or Parents ability to retain any of the businesses,
product or service lines or assets of, the Company or its Subsidiaries after
the Effective Time, or

 



45  otherwise limits Parents ability to receive the full benefits of this
Agreement and the Transactions.

 

(c) None of the parties to this Agreement shall agree to participate in any
substantive meeting, telephone call or discussion with any Governmental Body
in respect of any filings, investigation (including any settlement of the

party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Body,
gives the other parties the opportunity to attend and participate at such
meeting, telephone call or discussion. The parties to this Agreement shall,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, provide each other with copies
of all correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of their
respective Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Body or
members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and

6.3 Company Stock Awards; ESPP.

(a) Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all actions
(including obtaining any necessary determinations and/or resolutions of the
Board of Directors of the Company or a committee thereof) that may be
necessary (under the Company Equity Plans and award agreements pursuant to
which Company Stock Awards are outstanding or otherwise) to (i) accelerate
the vesting and exercisability (as applicable) of each unexercised Company
Accelerated Option and Company Accelerated RSU then outstanding so that each
such Company Stock Award shall be fully vested and exercisable effective
as of immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the Effective Time in
accordance with Section 2.8(a) and 2.8(b), (ii) accelerate the vesting of each
Company Restricted Stock Award then outstanding so that each such Company
Restricted Stock Award shall be fully vested effective as of immediately
prior to, and contingent upon, the Offer Acceptance Time in accordance with
Section 2.8(c), and (iii) terminate each Company Equity Plan (except as
otherwise agreed by Parent and a holder thereof) effective as of and
contingent upon the Effective Time, and (iv) following the vesting
acceleration described in (i) above, cause, as of the Effective Time, each
unexpired and unexercised Company Option and each unexpired Company RSU then
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (and each plan, if
any, under which any Company Stock Award may be granted except, with respect
to any such plan, as otherwise agreed by Parent and a holder thereof) to
be cancelled, terminated and extinguished, subject, if applicable, to payment
pursuant to Section 2.8.

(b) The Company shall take all actions necessary or required under the ESPP
and Legal Requirements to, contingent on the Effective Time, (i) ensure that,
except for the 6-month offering period under the ESPP that commenced on
February 1, 2016, no offering period or purchase period shall be authorized
or commenced on or after the date of this Agreement and (ii) if the Closing
shall occur prior to the end of the offering period in existence under the
ESPP on the date of this Agreement, cause the rights of participants in the
ESPP with respect to any such offering period (and purchase period thereunder)
then underway under the ESPP to be determined by treating the last business
day prior to the Offer Acceptance Time as the last day 

 



46  of such offering period (such date or the date such offering period
terminates by its terms, if earlier, the " _Final Purchase Dat_ e") and
purchase period and by making such other pro-rata adjustments as may be
necessary to reflect the shortened offering period and purchase period but
otherwise treating such shortened offering period and purchase period as a
fully effective and completed offering period and purchase period for all
purposes under the ESPP. The Company shall cause the exercise (as of the Final
Purchase Date) of each outstanding purchase right under the ESPP and terminate
the ESPP in its entirety effective as of the Offer Acceptance

service to the Company earned prior to the Effective Time for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and determination of the level of benefits, vacation
accrual and severance benefit determinations, under any benefit or
compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement in which a Continuing
Employee participates that may be established or maintained by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates on or after the Effective Time

Continuing Employees shall not receive credit for service prior to the
Effective Time for purposes of benefit accrual under any Parent benefit plan
that is a defined benefit pension plan. In addition, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to and instruct its Affiliates to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i) to be waived all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements and similar
limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any New Plans to the extent waived or satisfied by a
Continuing Employee under any Acquired Corporation benefit plan as of the
Effective Time and (B) any deductible, co-insurance and covered out-of-pocket
expenses paid on or before the Effective Time by any Continuing Employee (or
covered dependent thereof) to be taken into account for purposes of satisfying
the corresponding deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
provisions after the Effective Time under any applicable New Plan in the same
plan year in which the Effective Time occurs. Nothing in this Section 6.4 or
elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any
employee to employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other
Affiliate of the Surviving Corporation and the employment of each Continuing
Employee shall be "at will" employment. __

 

 __(b) __If requested in writing by Parent at least ten business days prior to

necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the day
immediately preceding the date on which the Company becomes a member of the

Code) as Parent (the " _Plan Termination Date_ "), any Employee Plan that
contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section
401(k) of _ _

 



47  the Code (a " _Company 401(k) Plan_ "). If the Company is required to
terminate any Company 401(k) Plan, then the Company shall provide to Parent
prior to the Plan Termination Date written evidence of the adoption by the
Companys Board of Directors of resolutions authorizing the termination of
such Company 401(k) Plan (the form and substance of which resolutions shall be
subject to the prior review of Parent). The Company also shall take such
other actions in furtherance of terminating such Company 401(k) Plan as Parent
may reasonably request. Any actions taken under this Section 6.4(b) shall be
made contingent upon the consummation of the Offer.

 

 __(c) __If requested in writing by Parent at least ten business days prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions
necessary, including the provision of notice to all insurance carriers and
third party administrators (provided that Parent has submitted such written
request to the Company prior to the date notice is required by such insurance
carrier or third party administrator), to terminate such Employee Plans as

6.4(b) shall instead apply (each, an " _Other Company Benefit Plan_ "). Any
termination, early surrender, early withdrawal or other charges incurred as a
result of the termination of an Other Company Benefit Plan at such request of
Parent shall be paid for, or reimbursed to the Company, by Parent. Any
actions taken under this Section 6.4(c) shall be made contingent upon the
consummation of the Offer. __

 

 __(d) __ The provisions of this Section 6.4 are solely for the benefit of the
Parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 6.4 is intended
to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to
any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise and no current or
former employee or any other individual associated therewith shall be
regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of the Agreement or have
the right to enforce the provisions hereof. __

 

6.5 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

 

 __(a) __All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any person
who is or prior to the Effective Time becomes, or has been at any time prior
to the date of this Agreement, a director, officer, employee or agent
(including as a fiduciary with respect to an employee benefit plan) of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors (the
" _Indemnified Persons_ ") as provided by the Certificate of Incorporation,
bylaws or other organizational documents of any Acquired Corporation (as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement) and as provided in any
indemnification agreement between the Company and said Indemnified Persons in
effect as of the date of this Agreement in the forms made available by the
Company to Parent or Parents Representatives prior to the date of this
Agreement, shall survive the Merger and shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right
thereunder of any such Indemnified Person. __

__(b) _ _ From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect, the
existing policy of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by
the Company as of the date of this Agreement (an __

Company to Parent or Parents Representatives prior to the date of this
Agreement), or an alternative policy or policies of at least the same
coverage containing terms and conditions no less favorable than the existing
policy, for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons who are currently covered
by such existing policy with respect to their acts and omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time in their capacities as directors and officers of
the Company (as applicable), (or at or prior to the Effective Time Parent or
the Company may (through a nationally recognized insurance broker approved by
Parent (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned)) purchase a six-year "tail" policy for the existing policy
effective as of the Effective Time) and if such "tail policy" has been
obtained, it shall be deemed to satisfy all obligations to obtain and/or
maintain insurance pursuant to this Section 6.5(b); _provided, however,_ that
in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any one
(1) year an amount in excess of 300% of the annual premium currently payable
by the Company with respect to such current policy, it being understood that
if the annual premiums payable for such insurance coverage exceeds such
amount, Parent shall be obligated to cause the Surviving Corporation to
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost equal to such
amount. __

 

 __(c) __ In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
Entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Parent shall ensure that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, or at Parents option, Parent, shall assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 6.5. __

 

 __(d) __ The provisions of this Section 6.5 shall survive the acceptance of
Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the Merger
and are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each of the Indemnified Persons and their successors, assigns and heirs and
(ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or
otherwise. Unless required by applicable Legal Requirement, this Section 6.5

or any of their successors, assigns or heirs without the prior written consent
of the affected Indemnified Person. __

such litigation, and the Company shall in good faith take Parents views
into account, but no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents
prior written consent. The Company shall promptly notify Parent of any such
litigation.

 

6.7 Additional Agreements. Without limitation or contravention of the
provisions of Section 6.2, and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to

the Merger and make effective the other Transactions. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each Party to this Agreement shall (i) make all filings (if any)
and give all notices (if any)

 



49  required to be made and given by such Party in connection with the Offer and
the Merger and the other Transactions; (ii) use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain each Consent (if any) required to be obtained pursuant to
any applicable Legal Requirement or Material Contract by such Party in

with respect to the Transactions shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by
the parties. From the date of such announcement through the Closing Date, and
so long as this Agreement is in effect, none of the Company, Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries shall issue or cause the publication of any public press
release or other public announcement or any internal announcement to employees
concerning the Transactions without the prior consultation and consent of the
other parties hereto (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) each Party may, without such
consultation or consent, make any public statement in response to questions
from the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences,

be, applicable to the Transactions, each of Parent and the Company and the
members of their respective Boards of Directors shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are

Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(b) and any payments pursuant to
Section 8.3(d) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent Related
Parties against the Company and any of their respective former, current or
future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, optionholders, managers,
members or Affiliates (collectively, " _Company Related Parties_ ") for any
loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Offer or the Merger to be

among or between any of the Parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof; _provided, however,_ that the Confidentiality Agreement shall

shall automatically terminate and be of no further force and effect. This
Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original and all of which shall constitute one and the same
instrument. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts
or otherwise) by PDF shall be sufficient to bind the Parties to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

9.5 Applicable Legal Requirements; Jurisdiction; Specific Performance;
Remedies.

__(a) __This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might
otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.
Subject to Section 9.5(c), in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement: (i) each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally consents
and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Chancery Court of
the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom or, if such
court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District Court
sitting in New Castle County in the State of Delaware, (it being agreed that
the consents to jurisdiction and venue set forth in this Section 9.5(a) shall
not constitute general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware
and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph
and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the Parties
hereto); and (ii) each of the Parties irrevocably consents to service of
process by first class certified mail, return receipt requested, postage
prepaid, to the address at which such Party is to receive notice in
accordance with Section 9.8. The Parties hereto agree that a final judgment in
any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by applicable Legal Requirements; _provided, however,_ that nothing in the
foregoing shall restrict any Partys rights to seek any post-judgment relief
regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial court judgment. __

 



56 (b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the Parties hereto do not perform their obligations under the provisions of
this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. Subject to the following sentence, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that (i) the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions,
specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the
courts described in Section 9.5(a) without proof of damages or otherwise, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this
Agreement, (ii) the provisions set forth in Section 8.3 (A) are not intended
to and do not adequately compensate for the harm that would result from a
breach of this Agreement and (B) shall not be construed to diminish or
otherwise impair in any respect any Partys right to specific enforcement and
(iii) the right of specific performance is an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, neither
the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. Each of the
Parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other
Parties hereto have an adequate remedy at law or an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with
this Section 9.5(b) shall not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with any such order or injunction.

 

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

__9.6 Assignability __. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall be
enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the Parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns; _provided, however,_ that
neither this Agreement nor any of the rights hereunder may be assigned
without the prior written consent of the other Parties hereto, and any
attempted assignment of this Agreement or any of such rights without such
consent shall be void and of no effect; _provided, further, however,_  that
Parent or Purchaser may assign this Agreement to any of their Affiliates (
_provided_ that such assignment shall not impede or delay the consummation of
the Transactions or otherwise impede the rights of the stockholders of the
Company under this Agreement); _provided_ that no such assignment or pledge
permitted pursuant to this Section 9.6 shall relieve Parent of its obligations
hereunder. __

implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other than the
