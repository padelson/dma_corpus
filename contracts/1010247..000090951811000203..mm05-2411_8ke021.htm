AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  

  

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of May 23, 2011 (this
"Agreement"), is by and among The Doctors Company, a California domiciled
reciprocal inter-insurance exchange ("Parent"), Fountain Acquisition Corp., a
Florida corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"),
and FPIC Insurance Group, Inc., a Florida corporation (the "Company").

  

  

RECITALS

  

  

WHEREAS, the Board of Governors of Parent and the respective Boards of
Directors of Merger Sub and the Company have approved and declared advisable
this Agreement and the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the
"Merger") upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and
in accordance with the Florida Business Corporation Act (the "FBCA"); and

  

  

WHEREAS, the Board of Governors of Parent and the respective Boards of
Directors of Merger Sub and the Company have determined that the Merger is in
the best interest of their respective shareholders or policyholders, as
applicable;

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree
as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE 1

  

  

THE MERGER

  

  

Section 1.1. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to satisfaction or waiver
of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the
FBCA, at the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined), Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").

  

  

Section 1.2. Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take
place at the offices of the Company (or such other place as agreed by the
parties) at 9:00 a.m., eastern time, on a date to be specified by the parties,
which shall be no later than the second Business Day following the date on
which all of the conditions set forth in Article 6 are satisfied or, if
permissible, waived (other than those conditions to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver thereof),
unless the parties hereto agree to another place, time or date.

  

  

Section 1.3. Effective Time. At the Closing, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing articles of merger (the "Articles of Merger") with the
Florida

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

   
 

Secretary of State, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance
with the relevant provisions of, the FBCA (the date and time of such filing,
or at such later date and time as Parent and the Company shall agree and
specify in the Articles of Merger, such specified date and time being the
"Effective Time").

  

  

Section 1.4. Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the FBCA. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, except as
otherwise provided herein, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger
Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

  

  

Section 1.5. Articles of Incorporation; By-laws. At the Effective Time, the
Articles of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as permitted by the FBCA; provided,
however, that the name shall be changed to "FPIC Insurance Group, Inc." At the
Effective Time, the By-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as permitted by Law, the Articles of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation and such By-laws. The Articles of Incorporation and the
By-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall be in accordance with Section
5.12.2 hereof.

  

  

Section 1.6. Directors and Officers. The directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Articles of
Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation. The officers of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of
the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Articles
of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

ARTICLE 2

  

  

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

  

  

Section 2.1. Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holders of any of the following securities:

  

  

2.1.1. Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of common stock, $0.10
par value per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of
Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.1.2) shall be
converted into the right to receive $42.00 in cash, payable to the holder
thereof, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). All such shares of
Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Certificate previously representing any such share shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor.

  

  

2.1.2. Cancellation of Certain Company Common Stock. Each share of Company
Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company or by any Company Subsidiary
shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and no
payment shall be made with respect thereto.

  

  

2.1.3. Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and be exchanged for one newly and validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

  

  

2.1.4. Change in Company Common Stock. If between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock
shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different
class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, the Merger
Consideration shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares; provided, that the aggregate Merger Consideration
payable shall not exceed the aggregate amount contemplated pursuant to Section
2.1.1 as of the date hereof.

  

  

Section 2.2. Treatment of Company Equity Awards. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board") or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof shall adopt appropriate resolutions and
take all other actions necessary and appropriate to provide that, immediately
prior to the Effective Time:

  

  

(i) each unexpired and unexercised option to purchase Company Common Stock
(the "Company Options") then outstanding under any stock option plan of the
Company, including the Company's Director Stock Plan, as amended and restated,
the Company's Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the "Company
Omnibus Plan"), the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended (the
"Company ESPP"), or any other plan, agreement or arrangement (collectively,
the "Company Stock Option Plans"), shall become fully vested and exercisable
and, effective as of the Effective Time, each such Company Option shall be
cancelled, and in exchange therefor each former holder of any such cancelled
Company Option shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the
cancellation of such Company Option and in settlement therefor, a payment in
cash (subject to Section 2.3.8) of:

  

  

(A) in the case of each Company Option other than those issued under the
Company ESPP, an amount equal to the product of (u) the total number of shares
of Company Common Stock previously subject to such Company Option and (v) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

   
 

price per share of Company Common Stock previously subject to such Company
Option; or

  

  

(B) in the case of Company Options issued under the ESPP, an amount for each
holder equal to (x) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (y) the total
amount of each such holder's 2011 payroll deductions prior to the Effective
Time under the Company ESPP, and divided by (z) $30.71 (85% of the fair market
value (determined in accordance with the terms of the ESPP) of Company Common
Stock on January 14, 2011).

  

  

(the total amounts payable hereunder with respect to all Company Options being
referred to as the "Option Consideration");

  

  

(ii) each unvested share of restricted stock awarded and outstanding under the
Company Stock Option Plans, including without limitation those issued under
the Company ESPP, as to which the restrictions thereon shall not have lapsed
("Company Restricted Stock"), shall become a fully vested and unrestricted
share of Company Common Stock and shall be converted into the Merger
Consideration as provided by Section 2.1.1;

  

  

(iii) each unpaid performance unit awarded under the Company Omnibus Plan
("Company Performance Units ") shall become fully vested and payable and,
effective as of the Effective Time, each such Company Performance Unit shall
be cancelled, and in exchange therefor each such cancelled Company Performance
Unit shall be converted into the right to receive, in consideration of the
cancellation of such Company Performance Unit and in settlement therefor, a
payment in cash (subject to Section 2.3.8) (such amounts payable hereunder
being referred to as the "Performance Unit Consideration") equal to the
product of (x) the Payout Percentage (as defined in the related award
agreements and determined as set forth below) applicable to such Company
Performance Unit, and (y) the Merger Consideration (it being agreed that the
Payout Percentage shall be 143% for Company Performance Units granted on
January 4, 2010 and 100% for Company Performance Units granted on December 10,
2010); and

  

  

(iv) from and after the Effective Time, any such cancelled Company Option and
Company Performance Unit shall no longer be exercisable by or payable to the
former holder thereof and each such former holder shall only be entitled to
the payment of the Option Consideration or the Performance Unit Consideration,
as applicable. To the extent then in effect, after the Effective Time, all
Company Stock Option Plans shall be terminated and no further Company Options
or other awards shall be granted thereunder.

  

  

Section 2.3. Exchange Procedures.

  

  

2.3.1. Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "Paying
Agent"), to

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

   
 

act as agent for Parent for purposes of, among other things, mailing and
receiving letters of transmittal, and distributing the Merger Consideration to
the Company's shareholders.

  

  

2.3.2. Exchange Procedures for Company Common Stock. (a) At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
for payment in accordance with this Article 2, cash in U.S. dollars in an
amount sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration (the
"Exchange Fund"). No later than three Business Days after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail or otherwise transmit to each
holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificate
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificate to the Paying Agent
and shall be in customary form) or in the case of Book-Entry Shares, a similar
notification in accordance with industry standards and (B) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for the Merger Consideration, to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to this Agreement. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation
to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal (as required by
Paying Agent), properly completed and duly executed (or, in the case of Book-
Entry Shares, upon adherence to the applicable procedures set forth in such
letter of transmittal or similar notification for surrendering such shares),
and upon surrender of such other documents as may be required by the Paying
Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration that such holder has
the right to receive in respect of the Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, and the Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall thereupon be canceled. No interest will
be paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of any
Certificate or Book-Entry Share. In the event of a permitted transfer of
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate that
is not registered in the transfer records of the Company or the Company's
transfer agent on behalf of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid
to a transferee if the Certificate is presented to the Paying Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as
applicable, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.3.2, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration.

  

  

(b) The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Earnings on the Exchange Fund shall be
the sole and exclusive property of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and
shall be paid to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs. No
investment of the Exchange Fund shall relieve Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent from making

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

   
 

the payments required by this Article 2, and following any net losses from any
such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying
Agent for the benefit of the applicable holders of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time in the amount of such net losses,
which additional funds shall be deemed to be part of the Exchange Fund. No
investment of the Exchange Fund shall have maturities that could prevent or
delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

2.3.3. Payment for Company Equity Awards. At the Closing, Parent shall make
(or cause to be made) payment to the Surviving Corporation, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated by the
Company in writing no later than two Business Days prior to the Closing, in an
amount equal to the sum of the aggregate Option Consideration plus the

Section 3.1. Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries. The Company is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of the State of Florida. Each Company Subsidiary is duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of
its incorporation or organization, as the case may be. The Company and each of
the Company Subsidiaries has the requisite corporate power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted. The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated
by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification, licensing or
good standing necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified, licensed
or in good standing that would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect or otherwise prevent or delay (beyond the Outside
Date) consummation of the Merger. Section 3.1 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a true, complete and correct list of all of the
subsidiaries of the Company (each a "Company Subsidiary" and, collectively,
the "Company Subsidiaries"), together with the jurisdiction of incorporation
of each Company Subsidiary, the jurisdictions in which each Company Subsidiary
is licensed to conduct business, the authorized and issued shares of capital
stock of each Company Subsidiary, the names of the holders thereof and the
number of shares held by each holder. All of the outstanding shares of capital
stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, each Company Subsidiary that
is owned directly or indirectly by the Company have been validly issued, were
issued free of pre-emptive rights and are fully paid and non-assessable, and
are free and clear of all liens, including any restriction on the right to
vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other equity or
voting interests (other than restrictions imposed by Law). Except as set forth
in Section 3.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, none of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary owns, directly or indirectly, an Equity Interest
representing more than three percent (3%) of the voting power of any other
Person.

  

  

Section 3.2. Articles of Incorporation and By-laws. The copies of the
Company's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended (the
"Company Articles"), and Amended and Restated By-laws (the "Company By-laws"),
as amended, which were previously furnished or made available to Parent, are
true, complete and correct and Company is not in material violation of any
provisions of the Company Articles or Company Bylaws. The Company has made
available to Parent a true, complete and correct copy of the charter and by-
laws (or equivalent organizational documents) of each of the Company
Subsidiaries and none of the Company Subsidiaries is in violation of any
provisions of its organizational documents.

  

  

Section 3.3. Capitalization.

of 100 million shares of capital stock, of which 50 million are designated
Company Common Stock and 50 million are designated preferred stock, $0.10 par
value per share ("Company Preferred Stock"). As of May 20, 2011 (A) 8,339,434
shares of Company Common Stock were issued and outstanding, all of which were
validly issued,

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

8

specified in Section 2.2(iii)) for issuance upon exercise of Company
Performance Units granted under the Company Omnibus Plan. As of May 20, 2011,
and as of the Effective Time, (i) no shares of Company Preferred Stock were
(or will be) designated, issued and outstanding and (ii) no shares of Company
Common Stock were (or will be) held in the treasury of the Company or by the
Company Subsidiaries. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other debt
securities issued by the Company that have the right to vote (or are
convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on
any matters on which holders of Company Common Stock may vote.

  

  

3.3.2. Stock Option Plans and Performance Units. As of May 20, 2011, there
were 4,909,500 shares of Company Common Stock authorized for issuance under
the Company's Stock Option Plans and only 1,207,907 remained available for

list of all of Company Options outstanding, their exercise prices and the name
of the holder, the number of shares of unvested Company Restricted Stock
(other than under the Company ESPP) outstanding, and the number of Company

Interests of the Company, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for
capital stock or other Equity Interests of the Company. Since January 1, 2009
and through the date hereof, the Company has not issued any shares of its
capital stock or other Equity Interests or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for capital stock or other Equity Interests of the Company, other
than Company Equity Awards and the issuance of shares pursuant to Company
Equity Awards. All shares of Company Common Stock subject to issuance under
the Company Stock Option Plans or the Company ESPP, upon issuance prior to the
Effective Time on the terms and conditions specified in the instruments
pursuant to which they are issuable, will be duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. All outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock, all outstanding Company Equity Awards and all
outstanding shares of capital stock, voting securities or other ownership
interests in any Company Subsidiary, have been issued or granted, as
applicable, in compliance in all material respects with all applicable
securities Laws.

  

  

3.3.3. No Contractual Obligations. Except (i) as set forth in Section 3.3.3 of

or other Equity Interests in, the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Except

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

9  

  

 

 

 

   
 

as set forth in Section 3.3.3 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, each
outstanding share of capital stock of each Company Subsidiary is validly
issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights and is owned,
beneficially and of record, by the Company or another Company Subsidiary free
and clear of all security interests, liens, pledges, options, rights of first
refusal, agreements, limitations on the Company's or such other Company
Subsidiary's voting rights, charges and other encumbrances of any nature
whatsoever, in each case, other than Permitted Liens. No bonds, debentures,
notes or other indebtedness issued by the Company or any of Company
Subsidiaries having the right to vote on any matters on which stockholders or
equityholders of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries may vote (or
which is convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having such right),
are issued and outstanding.

  

  

Section 3.4. Authority.

  

  

3.4.1. Power and Authority; Execution and Delivery; Binding Effect. The
Company has requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and, subject to the
adoption of this Agreement by the Required Company Shareholders, to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated by the
Company. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby have been
duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company and no shareholder votes are
necessary to authorize this Agreement or the Merger or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby subject, with respect to the Merger, to the
adoption of this Agreement by the Required Company Shareholders. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming
due authorization, execution and delivery by each of the other parties hereto,
constitutes a legally valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
preference, fraudulent transfer, moratorium or other similar laws relating to
or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors and by general principles of
equity regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair
dealing, and the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor
may be brought.

  

  

3.4.2. Inapplicability of Takeover Statutes. No "fair price," "moratorium,"
"control share acquisition," "business combination" or other similar anti-
takeover statute or regulation enacted under any federal, state, local or
foreign laws applicable to the Company (including without limitation Section
607.0901 and 607.0902 of the FBCA) is applicable to this Agreement, the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company
Board has taken all actions so that the restrictions contained in the FBCA
applicable to a business combination will not apply to the execution, delivery
or performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby. Assuming the accuracy of the
representation and warranty set forth in the first sentence of Section 4.11,
the action taken by the Company Board in approving this Agreement and the
Merger is sufficient to

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

10  

  

 

 

 

   
 

render inapplicable to the Merger the restrictions on business combinations
contained in Section 607.0901 of the FBCA.

  

  

Section 3.5. No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.

  

  

3.5.1. No Conflict. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company does not, and the performance of this Agreement and the consummation
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby by the Company
will not, (A) assuming the Required Company Shareholders adopt this Agreement,
conflict with or violate or breach any provision of the Company Articles or
the Company By-laws or any equivalent organizational documents of any Company
Subsidiary, (B) assuming that all consents, approvals, authorizations and
permits described in Section 3.5.2 have been obtained and all filings and
notifications described in Section 3.5.2 have been made and any waiting
periods thereunder have terminated or expired, conflict with or violate any
Law applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or by which any
property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound or (C)
assuming that all consents, approvals, authorizations and permits described in
Section 3.5.2 have been obtained and all filings and notifications described
in Section 3.5.2 have been made and any waiting periods thereunder have
terminated or expired or except as set forth in Section 3.5.1 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, require any consent or approval under, result in any
breach of or any loss of any benefit under, or constitute a change of control
or default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both would become
a default) under, or give to others any right of termination, acceleration or
cancellation of, or result in the creation of a lien or other encumbrance on
any property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant to,
any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license,
Company Permit or other legally binding obligation to which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is a party, except, as to clauses (B) and (C),
respectively, for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other
occurrences that would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect or otherwise prevent or delay (beyond the Outside Date)
consummation of the Merger.

  

  

3.5.2. Filings and Consents. Except as set forth in Section 3.5.2 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the Company does not, and the performance of this Agreement by the Company
will not, require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing
with or notification to, any Governmental Authority, except (A) as may be
required under the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations of Nasdaq, the HSR
Act, the filing of the Articles of Merger as required by the FBCA and as may
be required under Laws respecting the business of insurance and (B) where
failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to
make such filings or notifications, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or otherwise prevent or delay (beyond the
Outside Date) consummation of the Merger.

  

  

Section 3.6. Permits; Compliance With Law. Except for permits respecting the
business of insurance, which are the subject solely of Section 3.19, each of
the Company

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

11  

  

 

 

 

   
 

and each Company Subsidiary is in possession of all authorizations, licenses,
permits, certificates, approvals, consents and clearances of any Governmental
Authority (the "Company Permits") necessary for the Company and each Company
Subsidiary to own, lease and operate its properties or to carry on its
respective business substantially as it is being conducted as of the date
hereof, and all such Company Permits are valid and in full force and effect,
and there is no pending, or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened action or
proceeding to terminate, suspend, limit or adversely modify any Company
Permit, except where the failure to be in possession of, or the suspension or
cancellation of, or failure to be valid or in full force and effect of, any of
the Company Permits has not or would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed in Section 3.6 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company and each Company Subsidiary has at
all times since January 1, 2009 been and is in compliance with all applicable
Laws, regulations and orders and neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary is in conflict with, or in default or violation of, or, with the
giving of notice or the passage of time, would be in conflict with, or in
default or violation of, (a) any Law applicable to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is bound or affected, (b) any of the Company Permits, or (c) any of
the provisions of its certificate of incorporation or By-laws (or other
organizational or governing instruments), other than such non-compliance,
conflict, default or violation as would not materially and adversely impact
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries considered as a whole.

  

  

Section 3.7. SEC Filings; Financial Statements.

  

  

3.7.1. Company SEC Filings. Except as set forth in Section 3.7.1 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company has timely filed all registration
statements, prospectuses, forms, reports, definitive proxy statements,
schedules and documents required to be filed by it under the Securities Act or
the Exchange Act, as the case may be, from and after January 1, 2008
(collectively, the "Company SEC Filings"). Each Company SEC Filing, as amended
or supplemented if applicable, (A) as of its date, or, if amended or
supplemented, as of the date of the most recent amendment or supplement
thereto, complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (B) did not, at
the time it was filed (or became effective in the case of registration
statements), or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of the most recent
amendment or supplement thereto, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of the date of
this Agreement, no Company Subsidiary is separately subject to the periodic
reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.

  

  

3.7.2. GAAP Financial Statements. Each of the consolidated financial
statements contained in the Company SEC Filings, including, any notes thereto,
as amended, supplemented or restated, if applicable, was prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto
and, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial statements, as permitted by
Form 10-Q under the Exchange

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

12  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Act) on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto), and each of such consolidated financial
statements, as amended, supplemented or restated, if applicable, presented
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position, results
of operations and cash flows of the Company and the consolidated Company
Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and for the respective periods
indicated therein (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial
statements, to normal and immaterial year-end adjustments). This
representation and warranty shall not be deemed to be breached as a result of
any change in GAAP or Law after the date of this Agreement.

  

  

3.7.3. STAT Financial Statements. Company has made available to Parent true,
complete and correct copies of the annual and quarterly statements of each of
the Company Insurance Subsidiaries for the most recently ended quarterly
period and the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, as appropriate, as
filed with the insurance regulatory authorities of its jurisdiction of
domicile, and audited statutory financial statements for the Company Insurance
Subsidiaries as of and for the period ended December 31, 2009 as filed with
the domestic insurance regulatory authority, together, in each case, with the
exhibits, schedules and notes thereto and any affirmations and certifications
filed therewith (the "STAT Financial Statements"). The STAT Financial
Statements of each such Company Insurance Subsidiary fairly present in all
material respects the financial position and results of operations of such
Company Subsidiary as of the respective dates thereof and for the respective
periods set forth therein, in each case in accordance with Statutory
Accounting Principles applied on a consistent basis. This representation and
warranty shall not be deemed to be breached as a result of any change in
Statutory Accounting Principles or Law after the date of this Agreement. Each
of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries has filed or submitted all STAT
Financial Statements required to be filed with or submitted to the insurance
regulatory authorities in its state of domicile. The STAT Financial Statements
complied in all material respects, on their respective dates of filing or
submission, with the Laws of their respective states of domicile and no
material deficiency of any nature has been asserted with respect to such STAT
Financial Statements by any Governmental Authority which has not been cured,
waived or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of any such Governmental
Authority. None of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries had, at the relevant
balance sheet date of each balance sheet included in the STAT Financial
Statements, any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would be required to be reflected or
reserved against on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with Statutory
Accounting Principles and none have arisen since such date through the date of
this Agreement, except in each case for liabilities or obligations (i)
reflected in the STAT Financial Statements, (ii) contemplated by or under this
Agreement or incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
(iii) incurred in the ordinary course of business and in a manner consistent
with past practice or (iv) incurred outside the ordinary course of business
that individually or in the aggregate, in the case of this subsection (iv)
only, do not exceed $1,000,000.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

 

   
 

3.7.4. Actuarial Information. The Company has made available to Parent, prior
to the date hereof, true, complete and correct copies of all actuarial
reports, actuarial certificates, loss and loss adjustment expense reserve
reports, and deferred acquisition cost and loss recognition analyses prepared
by the Company or by any third party actuarial consultant on behalf of or made
available to the Company relating to the adequacy of the reserves of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary for any period ended on or after December
31, 2008 (the "Actuarial Analyses"). Each such Actuarial Analysis was
generated from the same underlying sources and systems that were utilized by
the Company Insurance Subsidiaries to prepare the STAT Financial Statements,
was derived from the books and records of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries
at the relevant time of preparation (which preparation was accurate in all
material respects) and was prepared in conformity in all material respects
with applicable Law.

  

  

3.7.5. Absence of Liabilities. Except as and to the extent set forth (A) on
the consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the consolidated Company
Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 included in the Company's annual report
filed on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, including the notes
thereto, (B) in the Company SEC Filings filed after December 31, 2010 or (C)
in Section 3.7.5 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, none of the Company or
any consolidated Company Subsidiary had at the relevant balance sheet date,
any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) that would be required to be reflected or reserved
against on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP and none have
arisen since such date through the date of this Agreement, except in each case
for liabilities or obligations (i) contemplated by or under this Agreement or
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii)
incurred in the ordinary course of business and in a manner consistent with
past practice or (iii) incurred outside the ordinary course of business that
individually or in the aggregate, in the case of this subsection (iii) only,
do not exceed $1,000,000.

  

  

3.7.6. Indebtedness. Section 3.7.6 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
accurately lists all Indebtedness of the Company, including for each item of
Indebtedness, as applicable, the interest rate, maturity date and any assets
or properties securing such Indebtedness.

  

  

3.7.7. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. Section 3.7.7 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a list of any material joint venture, off balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract or arrangement to which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is a party (including any contract relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among the Company and any of the
Company Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, including any structured finance,
special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any
"off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K
of the SEC)).

  

  

3.7.8. Controls. Since January 1, 2007, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has received any "complaints" (within the meaning of Exchange

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Act Rule 10A-3) in respect of any accounting, internal accounting controls or
auditing matters. To the Company's knowledge, no complaint seeking relief
under Section 806 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("SOX") has been filed
with the United States Secretary of Labor and no employee has threatened to
file any such complaint. The Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer have made all certifications and statements required by
Sections 302 and 906 of SOX and the related rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder with respect to the Company SEC Filings. The Company maintains
disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 under
the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that all material information
concerning the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is made known on a timely
basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation of the Company SEC
Filings and other public disclosure documents. Except as set forth in Section
3.7.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, since January 1, 2007, neither the
accountants for nor the board of directors or audit committee of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary have been advised of (A) any significant
deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of the internal
controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect in any material respect its ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data or (B) any fraud that involves management or other
employees who have a role in the financial controls over financial reporting
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. The Company is otherwise in material
compliance with all applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the
applicable listing and corporate governance rules of the NASDAQ.

  

  

3.7.9. Obligations to Lend. Except for insurance policies issued by the
Company or a Company Insurance Subsidiary in the ordinary course of business,
to which this Section 3.7.9 does not apply, neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has any obligations of any kind to make any loan or advance
to, guarantee any Indebtedness of, or otherwise incur Indebtedness on behalf
of, any third party.

  

  

Section 3.8. Disclosure Documents.

the shareholders of the Company, and (B) the time of the Company Shareholders'
Meeting, as applicable, will comply as to form in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and other applicable Law.

  

  

3.8.2. Not Misleading. The Proxy Statement or any Other Filing, and any
amendments or supplements thereto, that the Company is responsible for filing,
insofar as it reflects information supplied by the Company for use therein, at
(A) the time the Proxy Statement (or any amendment thereof or supplement

knowledge of the Company, there exists no condition or set of circumstances in
connection with which the Company could reasonably be subject to any material
liability (other than for routine benefit liabilities) under the terms of, or
with respect to, such Company Benefit Plans, ERISA, the Code or any other Law
applicable to such Company Benefit Plans. All due contributions, premiums, or

could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any
such Company Benefit Plan, except as could not reasonably be expected to
result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the Company's knowledge, there
has been no prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA
or Section 4975 of the Code, other than a transaction that is exempt under a
statutory or administrative exemption) with respect to any Company Benefit
Plan. No suit, administrative proceeding, action or other litigation is

acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or funding of, or other rights in
respect of, any benefits under any Company Benefit Plan, or (iv) give rise to
the imposition of any excise tax or the payment of any amount that will not be
deductible by reason of Sections 280G (assuming that the Company Employment
Agreement with Mark Adams as currently in effect is not extended), 404 or
162(m) (assuming that the Company does not file with the SEC after the
Effective Time information concerning executive compensation of any Company
Employee with respect to any period of 2011) of the Code under any contract,
agreement, plan or arrangement covering any former employee of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a

or suspension of any such Insurance Permit. None of the Insurance Permits
owned or held by any of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries will be adversely
affected by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

issuance of, or refusal to sell, any insurance product to insureds or
potential

insureds of any race, color, creed or national origin. None of the Company
Insurance Subsidiaries is subject to any market conduct claim or complaint
with respect to any insurance products that any such person has marketed,
sold, issued or adjusted claims thereunder and, to the knowledge of Company,
there are no facts or circumstances relating to the Company Insurance
Subsidiaries that could reasonably be expected to give rise to a market
conduct claim relating to any insurance products that any such person has
marketed, sold, issued or adjusted claims thereunder.

  

  

3.19.6. Reserves. The reserves, and other liability amounts required by
Statutory Accounting Principles to be determined using actuarial methods, of
each of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries reflected in the STAT Financial
Statements were determined in accordance with commonly accepted actuarial
methods and standards, consistently applied (it being understood by Parent and
Merger Sub that the representations made in Sections 3.7.2, 3.7.3, 3.7.4, and
3.7.5 and this Section 3.19.6 do not constitute a guarantee that such reserves
or liabilities will ultimately prove sufficient or adequate for the purposes
for which they were established or that reinsurance recoverables taken into
account in determining the amount of liability will be collectible). The
reserves of each of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries reflected in the STAT
Financial Statements: (i) were determined in accordance with commonly accepted
actuarial standards and were fairly stated in accordance with sound actuarial
principles; (ii) were based on actuarial assumptions that produce reserves at
least as great as those called for in any contract provision applicable to the
reserves of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries as to reserve basis and method
and are in accordance with all other contract provisions to which any of the
company or the Company Insurance Subsidiaries is subject; (iii) met, in all
material respects, the requirements of the Laws and regulations of its state
of domicile and each state in which it is admitted as an insurer and were at
least as great as the minimum aggregate amount required by such Laws; and (iv)
were computed on the basis of assumptions consistent with those used in
computing the corresponding items in the STAT Financial Statements of the
preceding year-end.

  

  

3.19.7. Reports of Examination. The Company has made available to Parent with
respect to the Company Insurance Subsidiaries any reports of examination
(including, without limitation, financial, underwriting, claims, market
conduct and similar examinations) issued (whether in draft, preliminary or
final form) by any Governmental Authority since January 1, 2007. The
deficiencies or violations, if any, noted in the examination reports described
above have been resolved to the satisfaction of the Governmental Authority
that noted such deficiencies or violations. No examination of the Company
Insurance Subsidiaries by any Governmental Authority is currently pending or
in progress.

  

  

3.19.8. Certain Notices. Except as set forth in Section 3.19.8 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, since December 31, 2008, neither the Company nor any of
the Company Insurance Subsidiaries has received written notice from a
Governmental Authority that could reasonably be expected to give rise to an

Authority.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

26

Disclosure Schedule, all Insurance Contract benefits payable by or on behalf
of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries have in all material respects been paid
in accordance with the terms of the Insurance Contracts under which they
arose, except for such exceptions for which a Company Insurance Subsidiary has
a reasonable basis to believe that there is a reasonable basis to contest
payment.

  

  

3.19.10. No Restrictions on Operations. No Company Insurance Subsidiary is
subject to any orders, requirements, undertakings, commitments, consent
decrees, settlements or stipulations from or with any state insurance
regulatory authorities that would subject a Company Insurance Subsidiary to
any material restrictions or limitations on its business or operations (except
pursuant to Law).

  

  

Section 3.20. Vote Required. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
in voting power of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the

holders of any class or series of capital stock or other Equity Interests of
the Company necessary to adopt this Agreement, and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

Section 3.21. Brokers. Except as set forth in Section 3.21 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, no broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any
brokerage, finder's or other fee or commission in connection with the Merger,
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein based upon arrangements
made by or on behalf of the Company.

  

  

Section 3.22. Opinion of Financial Advisor. On or prior to the date hereof,
the Company Board has received the opinion of Sandler O'Neill and Partners, LP,
financial advisor to the Company Board, to the effect that, as of the date of
such opinion, the Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of
view, to the holders of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, and as of

modified.

any Company Subsidiary is a beneficiary or named insured and (ii) any claims

three years. True and complete copies of all such policies have been made
available to Parent. All premiums due on such policies have been paid, and the
Company and each Company Subsidiary is otherwise in compliance with the terms
of such policies in all material respects. To the Company's knowledge, neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has failed to give any notice or

which the Producer produced or serviced such business.

calculating such compensation as a straight percentage of premium.

  

  

Section 3.25. Interested Party Transactions. Except as set forth in the
Company SEC Filings prior to the date hereof, since January 1, 2011, neither
the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement or

advances or investments (including any obligation relating to any currency or
interest rate swap, hedge or similar arrangement), in respect of any of the
Investment Assets.

  

  

3.26.4. Investment Company Matters. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has agreed or otherwise committed to invest in, lend money to, or
guarantee any obligations of, any "investment company," or a company
"controlled" by an "investment company," within the meaning of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as

Parent and Merger Sub hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to
the Company as follows:

insurance exchange duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the Laws of the State of California. Merger Sub is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State
of Florida. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has the requisite corporate power

business as it is now being conducted. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly
qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated
by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification, licensing or
good standing necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified, licensed
or in good standing that would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect or otherwise prevent or delay (beyond the Outside
Date) consummation of the Merger.

  

  

Section 4.2. Authority. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has requisite corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its
obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this

Agreement by each of Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, and the
consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby
have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and
no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are
necessary to authorize this Agreement or the Merger or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming due authorization, execution
and delivery by the Company, constitutes a legally valid and binding
obligation of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub
in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, preference, fraudulent transfer,
moratorium or other similar Laws relating to or affecting the rights and
remedies of creditors and by general principles of equity regardless of
whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law,
concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, and the
discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefore may be brought.

which any property or asset of Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent Subsidiary is
bound or (C) require any consent or approval under, result in any breach of,

Subsidiary is party, except, as to clauses (B) and (C), respectively, for any
such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences that would
not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or
otherwise prevent or delay (beyond the Outside Date) consummation of the
Merger.

  

  

4.3.2. Consents. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub do not, and the performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger

Section 5.3. Proxy Statement.

  

  

5.3.1. Proxy Statement. As promptly as practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement
relating to the Company Shareholders' Meeting (together with any amendments
thereof or supplements thereto, the "Proxy Statement"). In addition, each of
the Company and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC any Other Filings
as and when required or requested by the SEC. Each of the Company and Parent
shall use reasonable efforts to respond to any comments made by the SEC with
respect to the Proxy Statement and any Other Filings. Each of the Company and
Parent shall furnish all information concerning it and the holders of its
capital stock as the other party may reasonably request in connection with

As promptly as reasonably practicable, the Company shall mail the Proxy
Statement to its shareholders. Subject to Section 5.6, the Proxy Statement
shall include the unanimous recommendation of all members of the Company Board
that adoption of this Agreement by the Company's shareholders is advisable and
that the Company Board has determined that the Merger is fair to and in the
best interests of the Company's shareholders (the "Company Recommendation").
Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall provide Parent with the
opportunity to review the Proxy Statement and any Other Filings that relate to
the transactions contemplated hereby and consider any comments Parent has on
such filings in good faith prior to the filing thereof with the SEC (other
than the Proxy Statement and any Other Filing to the extent announcing any
action taken by the Company pursuant to, or as permitted by, Section 5.6).
Except with respect to the Proxy Statement and any Other Filing to the extent
announcing any action taken by the Company pursuant to, or as permitted by
Section 5.6, the Company and Parent each shall advise the other promptly after
it receives notice of any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy
Statement or any Other Filings or comments thereon and responses thereto or
requests by the SEC for additional information.

  

  

5.3.2. Certain Notices. Parent shall promptly inform the Company if, at any
time prior to the Effective Time, any event or circumstance relating to
Parent, any Parent Subsidiary or Merger Sub, or any of their respective
officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent and should be set forth
in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement or any Other Filing.
The Company shall promptly inform Parent if, at any time prior to the
Effective Time, any event or circumstance relating to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, or any of their respective officers or directors, should
be discovered by the Company and should be set forth in an amendment or a
supplement to the Proxy Statement or any Other Filing.

  

  

Section 5.4. Company Shareholders' Meeting; Consent of Parent as Sole
Shareholder of Merger Sub.

  

  

5.4.1. Company Shareholders' Meeting. As promptly as reasonably practicable
after the date hereof, the Company shall establish a record date for, duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders
(including any adjournments thereof, the "Company Shareholders' Meeting") for
the purpose of voting

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

   
 

upon the adoption of this Agreement. Subject to Section 5.6, the Company shall
(i) include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, and (ii) use
commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from its shareholders proxies in
favor of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company
shall keep Parent updated with respect to proxy solicitation results as
reasonably requested by Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 5.4.1, at any time prior to the Company Shareholders' Meeting and
subject to compliance with Section 5.6, the Company may adjourn or postpone
the Company Shareholders' Meeting in response to an Acquisition Proposal if
the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel) that there is a reasonable likelihood that such Acquisition Proposal
will lead to a Superior Proposal.

  

  

5.4.2. Parent Consent. Parent, as sole shareholder of Merger Sub, shall
prepare, execute and deliver to Merger Sub, a copy of which shall be provided
to the Company, a written consent to adopt this Agreement immediately after
execution of this Agreement. Parent shall cause Merger Sub (i) to perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and (ii) prior to the Effective Time,
not to conduct any business or activities, not to make any investments other
than as specifically contemplated by this Agreement, and not to incur or
guarantee any Indebtedness.

  

  

Section 5.5. Access to Information; Confidentiality.

  

  

5.5.1. Confidentiality; Access. Except as required pursuant to any
confidentiality agreement or similar agreement or arrangement to which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, and subject to applicable Law,
from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and
shall cause each Company Subsidiary to: (A) provide to Parent and Merger Sub
and their respective officers, directors, employees, accountants, consultants,
legal counsel, advisors, agents and other representatives (collectively,
"Parent Representatives"), upon reasonable prior notice to the Company,
reasonable access during normal business hours to the officers of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries and to the books and records thereof and (B)
furnish promptly such information concerning the business, properties,
contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel and other aspects of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries as Parent or the Parent Representatives may
reasonably request; provided, however, that any such access shall be conducted
at a reasonable time, upon reasonable advance notice to the Company and in
such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the operation of any
business conducted by the Company or any Company Subsidiary; provided further,
that the Company shall not be required to (or cause any Company Subsidiary to)
so afford such access or furnish such information to the extent that doing so
would result in the loss of attorney-client privilege (it being agreed that
the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
information to be provided in a manner that would not result in such jeopardy
or contravention). No investigation shall affect the Company's representations
and warranties contained herein, or limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available to Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

   
 

5.5.2. Confidentiality Agreement. With respect to the information disclosed
pursuant to Section 5.5.1, the parties shall comply with, and cause their
respective representatives to comply with, all of their obligations under the
letter agreement, dated as of March 2, 2011, entered into by the Company and
Parent (as has been or may be amended from time to time, the "Confidentiality
Agreement").

  

  

5.5.3. The Company shall provide Parent with (i) copies of all internal
quarterly financial packages and related internal actuarial analyses prepared
by or for the Company after the date hereof within two (2) days of final
reporting packages becoming available and (ii) monthly updates regarding any
new ECO/XPL claims or any significant developments in the Company's ECO/XPL
claims as of the Effective Time.

  

  

Section 5.6. Acquisition Proposals.

  

  

5.6.1. No Solicitation. Subject to Section 5.6.2, from the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company agrees that it shall not, and
shall not authorize any Company Subsidiary or any of the respective directors,
officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, advisors, agents
and other representatives of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
(collectively, "Company Representatives") to, directly or indirectly, take any
action to (A) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate any Acquisition
Proposal or any proposal that is reasonably likely to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, (B) participate in any way in discussions or negotiations with, or
furnish any non-public information to, any person that has made an Acquisition
Proposal, (C) withdraw, modify, amend or materially qualify the Company
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent, (D) other than the Merger,
approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal, or (E) enter into any
agreement, letter of intent or term sheet with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal (each a "Company Acquisition Agreement"). Subject to Section 5.6.2,
neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall fail to recommend
against acceptance of any tender offer or exchange offer for the shares of
Company Common Stock within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of
such offer, or make any public statement inconsistent with the Company
Recommendation, or resolve or agree to take any of the foregoing actions. On
the date of this Agreement, the Company shall immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any negotiations with any person conducted theretofore by the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any Company Representative with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal, and shall use (and shall cause the Company
Representatives to use) commercially reasonable efforts to require other
parties thereto to promptly return or destroy any confidential information
previously furnished by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or the Company
Representatives thereunder.

  

  

5.6.2. Permitted Actions; Fiduciary Out. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in Section 5.6.1, at any time prior to obtaining the
adoption of this Agreement by the Required Company Shareholders, the Company
shall be permitted to:

  

  

(i) take, and disclose to the Company's shareholders, a position with respect
to any tender or exchange offer by a third party or amend or withdraw

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

   
 

such a position in accordance with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under
the Exchange Act;

  

  

(ii) if the Company has received an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal from a
third party and the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with its independent financial advisor and outside counsel) that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, so long as the Company
is in compliance with Section 5.6.1 other than as specifically permitted by
this Section 5.6.2, effect a change in the Company Recommendation, approve and
recommend such Superior Proposal or enter into an agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal;

  

  

(iii) effect a change in the Company Recommendation if the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
shareholders of the Company under applicable Law; or

  

  

(iv) so long as the Company is in compliance with Section 5.6.1(A) and the
last sentence of Section 5.6.1, participate in any discussions or negotiations
(including, as a part thereof, making counterproposals) with, or provide any
non-public information to, any person in response to an unsolicited
Acquisition Proposal by any such person, pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement containing confidentiality provisions substantially similar to those
set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood and agreed
that such confidentiality agreement need not restrict the making of
Acquisition Proposals), if the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its independent financial advisor and outside counsel) that
there is a reasonable likelihood that such Acquisition Proposal will lead to a
Superior Proposal; provided, that the Company shall notify Parent in writing
of such determination and its intention to participate in discussions or
negotiations with, or provide non-public information to, any person in
response to an Acquisition Proposal;

  

  

provided, however, that with respect to clauses (ii) or (iii) above, the
Company Board shall not take any action until after the third Business Day
following Parent's receipt of written notice from the Company advising Parent
that the Company Board intends to take such action and specifying the reasons
therefor, including (if such proposed action is in connection with receipt of
a Superior Proposal) the material terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal and a copy of the most current version of the proposed agreement
(which version shall be updated on a prompt basis) and the identity of the
third party making such Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed
that, (A) prior to taking any such action, the Company shall discuss with
Parent and consider in good faith any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent in response to such Superior Proposal or otherwise and (B)
any amendment to the financial terms of the Superior Proposal shall require
the Company to provide Parent with a new notice of such Superior Proposal and
a new three Business Day period as set forth above). The Company shall
promptly provide Parent with a list of any non-public information concerning
the Company's business, present or future performance, financial condition or
results of

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

   
 

operations, provided to any third party, and, to the extent such information
has not been previously provided to Parent, copies of such information.

  

  

Section 5.7. Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings.

  

  

5.7.1. Appropriate Actions. Subject to Section 5.6, each of the Company and
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) take, or cause to be
taken, all appropriate action, and do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under any applicable Law to consummate and make
effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as promptly as reasonably practicable, (B) obtain from Governmental
Authorities any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals,
authorizations or orders required to be obtained or made by Parent or the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or to avoid any action or
proceeding by any Governmental Authority (including, without limitation, those
in connection with Antitrust Laws), in connection with the authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated herein, (C) make or cause to be made
the applications or filings required to be made by Parent or the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries under or with respect to the HSR Act or
any other Laws in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated herein, and to pay any fees due of it in connection with such
applications or filings, as promptly as is reasonably practicable, and in any
event within ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof, (D) comply at the
earliest practicable date with any request under or with respect to the HSR
Act and any such other Laws for additional information, documents or other
materials received by Parent or the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries from the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or
any other Governmental Authority in connection with such applications or
filings or the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (E) coordinate and cooperate with, and give due consideration to
all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by the other party in
connection with, making (1) any filing under or with respect to the HSR Act or
any such other Laws, and (2) any filings, conferences or other submissions
related to resolving any investigation or other inquiry by any such
Governmental Authority. Each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause
their respective affiliates to, furnish to the other party all information
necessary for any such application or other filing to be made in connection
with the Merger or other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of
the Company and Parent shall promptly inform the other of any communication
with, and any proposed understanding, undertaking or agreement with, any
Governmental Authority regarding any such application or filing. If a party
hereto desires to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority
in respect of any such filings, investigation or other inquiry, then such
party shall give the other party reasonable prior notice of such meeting and
the opportunity to participate in such meeting. The parties shall coordinate
and cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

   
 

of any party in connection with all meetings, actions and proceedings under or
relating to any such application or filing.

  

  

5.7.2. Filings. As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than fifteen
(15) Business Days following the date of this Agreement, Parent shall, at its
own expense, make all reasonably necessary filings with state insurance
regulatory authorities required by applicable insurance Laws (the "Applicable
Insurance Laws") that are required to be filed prior to the Effective Time,
including, without limitation, (i) the filing of a Form A with the insurance
regulatory authorities of each of the States of Florida (which shall be the
first Form A to be filed), Missouri and Texas, and (ii) Form E filings with
the insurance regulatory authority of the States of Arkansas and Georgia, in
order to obtain the necessary authorizations, approvals and consents in order
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. In connection therewith,
the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly resolve any
objections and respond to any inquiries that may arise in connection with any
such filings. The Form A for the State of Florida will include an affirmative
statement to the effect that First Professionals Insurance Company, Inc. and
Anesthesiologists Professional Assurance Company will continue as Florida
domiciled insurers after the Closing and not be redomesticated absent further
communications with the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation ("OIR").

  

  

5.7.3. Notices and Consents. The Company and Parent shall give (or shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use,
and cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any third party consents necessary, proper or advisable for
such party to consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. In
addition, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
consent of each reinsurer of a Third Party Reinsurance Contract that is
designated on Section 3.13.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule prior to the
Closing (it being understood that the Company shall not be required to make
any payments or agree to any restrictions or changes in connection therewith).
Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall coordinate and
cooperate in determining whether any actions, consents, approvals or waivers
are required to be obtained from parties to any Company Material Contracts in
connection with consummation of the Merger and seeking any such actions,
consents, approvals or waivers; provided further, that except as expressly
provided in Article 6, no such actions, consents, approvals or waivers shall
constitute conditions to Closing and the Company shall not be obligated to
offer any payment or other concession in connection with any consent under any
Company Material Contract. In the event that either party shall fail to obtain
any third party consent described in the first sentence of this Section 5.7.3
, such party shall use commercially reasonable efforts, and shall take any
such actions reasonably requested by the other party hereto, to mitigate any
adverse effect upon the Company and Parent, their respective subsidiaries, and
their respective businesses resulting, or that could reasonably be expected to
result after the Effective Time, from the failure to obtain such consent.

  

  

5.7.4. Notice of Proceedings. From the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company shall promptly notify the other
in

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

   
 

writing of any pending or, to the knowledge of Parent or the Company (as the
case may be), threatened action, suit or other proceeding or investigation by
any Person (A) challenging or seeking material damages in connection with the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) seeking
to restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Merger. From the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company shall promptly notify Parent
in writing of any pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
action, suit or other proceeding or investigation by any Governmental
Authority.

  

  

5.7.5. Governmental Authorities. Each of the Company and Parent shall, and
shall cause their respective affiliates to, use their commercially reasonable
efforts to (A) cause the expiration of the notice periods under or with
respect to the HSR Act and any other Laws with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as is reasonably practicable after
the execution of this Agreement and (B) resolve such objections, if any, as
may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger or
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject to the terms of
this Section 5.7.5. In connection therewith, if any administrative or judicial
action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
challenging the transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any
Law, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective
affiliates to, cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to contest
and resist, except insofar as the Company and Parent may otherwise agree, any
such action or proceeding, including any action or proceeding that seeks a
temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction that would prohibit,
prevent or restrict consummation of the Merger or other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Section 5.7.5 or elsewhere in this Agreement, in connection with
the actions contemplated by the first sentence of this Section 5.7.5, none of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries shall
be required to become subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or
otherwise take any action with respect to, any Governmental Authority
Requirement if such Governmental Authority Requirement would reasonably be
expected to give rise to a Regulatory Material Adverse Effect. Parent agrees
that if the Governmental Authority Requirement would not reasonably be
expected to give rise to a Regulatory Material Adverse Effect, then Parent
shall consent and agree to such Governmental Authority Requirement and take
such actions as are contemplated thereby. The Company shall not agree to a
Governmental Authority Requirement without Parent's prior consent. The
following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:

  

  

"Governmental Authority Requirement" means any requirement, condition,
limitation, understanding, agreement or order of or with any Governmental
Authority to (i) sell, license, assign, transfer, divest, hold separate or
otherwise dispose of any stock, assets, business or portion of business of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective subsidiaries (all of the foregoing, the "Combined Entity"), (ii)
conduct, restrict, operate, invest or (exclusive of the matters set forth in
clause (i) hereof) otherwise change the assets, business or portion

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

   
 

of business of the Combined Entity in any manner, or (iii) impose any
restriction, requirement or limitation on the operation of the business or
portion of the business of the Combined Entity (including without limitation a
rate decrease imposed on the Combined Entity by the Florida OIR).

  

  

"Regulatory Material Adverse Effect" means, (A) with respect to clause (i) of
the definition of Governmental Authority Requirement, any such sale, license,
assignment, transfer, divestiture, holding separate or other disposal
involving $10,000,000 or more in annualized revenues and (B) with respect to
clauses (ii) and (iii) of the definition of Governmental Authority
Requirement, any such requirement, condition, limitation, understanding,
agreement, order, restriction or change that would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to decrease the Combined Entity's annual
revenues and/or increase the Combined Entity's annual costs, in the aggregate,
by an amount greater than $10,000,000; provided, however, that the imposition
of any restriction on the ability of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries to
upstream cash to the Company, whether through contractual agreement or the
payment of dividends, shall not constitute a "Regulatory Material Adverse
Effect."

  

  

5.7.6. No Control by Parent. Subject to Section 5.1, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right
to control or direct the operations of the Company prior to the consummation
of the Merger. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
unilateral control and supervision over its business operations.

  

  

Section 5.8. Certain Notices. From and after the date of this Agreement until
the Effective Time, each party shall promptly notify the other party of (i)
the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that would reasonably be
expected to result in any condition to the obligations of any party to effect
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be
satisfied and (ii) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging
that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided, however, that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.8 shall not cure any breach
of any representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter prior to
the date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice and in no event shall any
disclosure by the Company or Parent be deemed to amend or supplement the
Company Disclosure Letter or constitute an exception to any representation or
warranty.

  

  

Section 5.9. Public Announcements. Parent and the Company shall, as promptly
as practicable after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, issue a
mutually agreed press release with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the Merger. In connection with press releases or
public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, other than any press release by the Company
to announce action taken by the Company pursuant to, or as permitted by,
Section 5.6, Parent and the Company shall coordinate and

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

   
 

consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to
review and comment upon, giving due consideration to all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith, such press releases or
public statements. Parent and the Company shall not issue any such press
release (other than any press release by the Company to announce action taken
by the Company pursuant to, or as permitted by, Section 5.6) or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by
applicable Law, court process, applicable stock exchange rule or any listing
agreement; provided that Parent and the Company shall coordinate and consult
with respect to the timing, basis and scope of such disclosure requirement.
The parties acknowledge that the Company will be required to file with the SEC
a Current Report on Form 8-K reporting the execution of this Agreement and
summarizing the material terms hereof as determined by the Company, and that
the Company will file a copy of this Agreement as an exhibit to such report.

  

  

Section 5.10. Employee Benefit Matters.

  

  

5.10.1. Credit for Prior Service; Recognition of Co-payments and Deductibles.
With respect to any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA maintained by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary (collectively, "Parent
Benefit Plans") in which any director, officer or employee of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary (the "Company Employees") will participate effective as
of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, recognize all service of the Company Employees with the Company or a
Company Subsidiary, as the case may be, for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate, vesting and accrual or entitlement to benefits
where length of service is relevant in any Parent Benefit Plan in which such
Company Employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time,
other than benefit accruals under any defined benefit plan; provided that such
service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of service. Parent
shall permit the Company Employees to carry over and take vacation days with
pay in accordance with the applicable policies of the Company as in effect on
the Closing Date. Parent shall waive or cause to be waived any pre-existing
condition exclusions, evidence of insurability provisions, waiting period
requirements or any similar provision under any of the Parent Benefit Plans
that are welfare plans (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA). Further, to the
extent allowable under applicable Law, Company Employees shall be eligible to
receive credit under the Parent Benefit Plans for the 2011 calendar year
towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for expenses
incurred under the corresponding Company medical plan during the 2011 calendar
year but prior to the Closing Date.

  

  

5.10.2. Honoring Existing Employment Arrangements. From and after the
Effective Time, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Parent
Subsidiary, as applicable, shall, and Parent shall cause the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or any Parent subsidiary, as applicable, to perform all
obligations and to pay all amounts due, in accordance with their terms as may
be amended from time to time, under all Company Benefit Plans, including
without limitation all Company Employment Agreements and Company Severance
Agreements. Parent and the Company acknowledge and agree that

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(i) the consummation of the Merger shall constitute a "Change in Control" or a
"Change of Control" under the Company Severance Agreements and each other
Company Benefit Plan to which such term is relevant, (ii) after the Effective
Time, the Parent will not, and will not permit the Surviving Corporation to,
dispute any assertion by any of the Company Employees specifically listed in
Section 5.10.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (provided that such Company
Employee provides any required notices required by such Company Employee's
Company Severance Agreement) that the consummation of the Merger constitutes
valid grounds for the Company Employee to terminate his or her employment with
the Surviving Corporation by reason of his or her "Constructive Discharge"
within the meaning of such Company Employee's Company Severance Agreement, and
(iii) with respect to any such Company Employee who asserts under (ii) above
that the consummation of the Merger constitutes valid grounds for the Company
Employee to terminate his or her employment with the Surviving Corporation by
reason of his or her "Constructive Discharge," the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay (with the time
and manner of such payments all being in accordance with the terms specified
in each Company Employee's respective Severance Agreement, as the same may be
modified from time to time in the manner contemplated below in Section 5.11,
and except as the time and manner of such payments is affected (if at all) by
the last sentence of this Section 5.10.2) such Company Employee the severance
payments and such other severance benefits required to be paid under such
Company Employee's respective Company Severance Agreement, the amounts of
which, other than any tax gross ups, are quantified and set forth in Section
5.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. In furtherance of the foregoing, the
Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, take the
actions described on Section 5.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule with
respect to the payment of such payments and benefits to the Company Employees
listed on Section 5.10.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

5.10.3. Post-Closing Benefit Plan Matters. For the one (1) year period
following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide to each Company Employee, during his or her employment, benefits and
compensation that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, to such person than
those provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing (but
not taking into account for these purposes any stock-based compensation or
other equity incentive plans). Notwithstanding the foregoing, during said one
(1) year period, Parent's severance policy, a copy of which has been provided
to the Company, rather than any severance policy or customary severance
practice of the Company, shall apply in the case of a terminated Company
Employee without a Company Severance Agreement.

  

  

5.10.4. No Requirement of Continued Employment; Permitted Amendments to
Company Benefits Plans. Nothing in this Agreement shall require the continued
employment of any person, and, except as specifically set forth in this
Section 5.10, no provision of this Agreement shall prevent Parent or the
Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating any Company Benefit Plan to
the extent permitted by such Company Benefit Plan.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

   
 

5.10.5. Annual Executive Incentive Compensation Program. Parent shall comply,
and cause the Surviving Corporation to comply, with the terms of the Company's
2011 Executive Incentive Compensation Plan and 2008 Senior Executive Annual
Incentive Plan, as in effect on the date hereof; provided, that all bonuses in
respect of 2011 shall be paid at 100% of the target bonus; and provided
further, that Company Employees whose employment with the Company is
terminated effective at or after the Effective Time shall be entitled to, in
addition to their severance benefits, if any, a portion (equal to the portion
of the calendar year elapsed to the date of termination of employment) of
their respective target bonuses under the 2011 Executive Incentive
Compensation Plan and/or 2008 Senior Executive Annual Incentive Plan, payable
at the date of termination of employment or as soon thereafter as reasonably
practicable. In no event will any such Company Employee be entitled to receive
any portion of such 2011 target bonus to the extent such amount is included as
a separate part of such Company Employee's severance benefits, it being agreed
that the multiple of prior year bonuses included in the lump sum severance
benefit shall not be deemed to be a 2011 target bonus.

  

  

5.10.6. Third Party Beneficiaries. The Company Employees immediately prior to
the Effective Time, including without limitation those employees listed on
Section 5.10.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, shall be third party
beneficiaries of the provisions of this Section 5.10. The provisions of this
Section 5.10 are intended to be for the benefit of each such person and his or
her successors, heirs or representatives.

  

  

Section 5.11. Cooperation Regarding Company Benefit Plans. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall jointly work with Parent to (i) bring all
Company Benefit Plans in compliance with Section 409A of the Code, including
without limitation, amending such Company Benefit Plans if required in
connection therewith (including amendments requiring a Code Section 409A valid
release from each Company Employee who may claim under Section 5.10.2 that
there has been a "Constructive Discharge" of such Company Employee after the
consummation of the Merger within the meaning of such Company Employee's
Company Severance Agreement and whose Company Severance Agreement, as the same
may be modified from time to time, requires a release from such Company
Employee in that event) and (ii) amend the Company Benefit Plans to eliminate
(A) any interest or additional taxes imposed by Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the
Code that employees of the Company (or the Company on behalf of the employee)
would be required to pay in connection with any payments received from the
Company or Parent pursuant to any Company Benefit Plan as a result of an event
closely related to the Parent's acquisition of the Company or (B) any excise
tax imposed by Sections 280G or 4999 of the Code or any interest, penalty or
addition to tax with respect to such excise tax that employees of the Company
(or the Company on behalf of the employee) would be required to pay in
connection with any payments received from the Company or Parent pursuant to
any Company Benefit Plan as a result of an event closely related to the
Parent's acquisition of the Company; provided that in no event shall the
Company materially reduce the severance payments provided to any employee
under any existing Company Benefit Plan to comply with the foregoing
obligation.

Section 5.12. Indemnification of Directors and Officers.

  

  

5.12.1. Indemnification. For not less than six years from and after the
Effective Time, Parent agrees to, and to cause the Surviving Corporation to,
to the extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless all
past and present directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company
("Covered Persons") to the same extent such persons are indemnified as of the
date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to the Company Articles, the
Company By-laws and indemnification agreements in existence on the date of
this Agreement with any Covered Persons against and from any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit
proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that Parent
agrees to, and to cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold
harmless such persons to the fullest extent permitted by Law for acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each Covered Person
shall be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation with respect to any matters
subject to indemnification hereunder, provided that any person to whom
expenses are advanced undertakes, to the extent required by the FBCA, to repay
such advanced expenses if it is ultimately determined that such person is not
entitled to indemnification. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
if any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising
before, at or after the Effective Time) is made against any Covered Person
with respect to matters subject to indemnification hereunder on or prior to
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section
5.12 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Section 5.12.1 or elsewhere in this Agreement,
Parent shall not (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to)
settle or compromise or consent to the entry or any judgment or otherwise seek
termination with respect to any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination
includes an unconditional release of all of the Covered Persons covered by the
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from all liability arising
out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, without the
prior consent of such Covered Person (not to be unreasonably withheld);
provided, however, the Surviving Corporation or Parent will not be liable for
any settlement effected without the Surviving Corporation's or Parent's prior
written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld).

  

  

5.12.2. Articles and By-Laws. For not less than six years from and after the
Effective Time, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Articles of
Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation of Covered Persons than are currently set forth in
the Company Articles and the Company By-laws.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

   
 

5.12.3. DandO Insurance. For six years from the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
provide the Company's current directors and officers, covered under the
Company's existing directors and officers insurance policies prior to the
Effective Time (the "Existing Policies") one or more policies or insurance
that provide coverage with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
occurred on or before the Effective Time, including, without limitation, in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby ("DandO Insurance"), that are no less favorable than the
Company's Existing Policies. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, prior to the Effective Time, the Company may purchase a
"tail" insurance policy to cover for a period of six years after the Effective
Time the individuals covered by the Company's directors' and officers'
liability insurance immediately prior to the Effective Time. In the event that
the Company purchases such a "tail" policy prior to the Effective Time, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation will maintain such "tail" policy in full force
and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the Surviving Corporation or
Parent be required to expend an annual premium for such coverage in excess of
two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the last annual premium paid by the
Company for such insurance prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Maximum
Premium"). If such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at an annual premium
equal to or less than the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation or Parent
will obtain, that amount of directors' and officers' insurance (or "tail"
coverage) obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium.

  

  

5.12.4. Assumption of Obligations. In the event Parent or the Surviving
Corporation (A) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (B) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee
of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 5.12.

  

  

5.12.5. No Modification without Consent. The obligations under this Section
5.12 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to affect
adversely any Covered Person without the consent of such affected Covered
Person, unless such change is required to comply with applicable Law. The
provisions of this Section 5.12 shall survive the consummation of the Merger
and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
of the Covered Persons and their respective successors, heirs and personal
representatives.

  

  

Section 5.13. Rule 16b-3. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the extent permitted by Law, any
dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Company Common Stock) that are treated as dispositions under such
rule and result from the Merger or other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each individual who is subject to the

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

   
 

reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company.

continuing and (iii) the conditions in Section 6.2 are still capable of being
satisfied, then Parent shall pay the Company, within three (3) Business Days
after such termination, an amount equal to the Termination Fee, which shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company in the event of such termination
(provided that the Termination Fee shall not be the sole and exclusive remedy
of the Company in the case where such termination occurs and Parent has
breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of the covenants and
agreements set forth in Section 5.7).

Section 8.6. Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Unless otherwise expressly stated herein,
references to sections and Articles are references to the sections and
Articles of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 8.7. Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to

acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

  

  

Section 8.8. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits,

the subject matter hereof.

  

  

Section 8.9. No Reliance. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has conducted its own

liabilities, results of operations, financial condition, technology and
prospects of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and acknowledges that
each of Parent and Merger Sub has been provided access to personnel,
properties, premises and records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
for such purposes. In entering into this Agreement, except as expressly
provided herein, each of Parent and Merger Sub has relied solely upon its
independent investigation and analysis of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and each of Parent and Merger Sub. Each party acknowledges and
agrees that the other party has not made and is not making any representations
or warranties whatsoever

regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, express or implied, except as
provided herein or in any certificate delivered under the terms of this
Agreement and that it has not been induced by and has not relied upon any
representations, warranties or statements, whether express or implied, made by
the other parties, or any of their respective directors, officers,

are not expressly set forth in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered
under the terms of this Agreement, whether or not such representations,
warranties or statements were made in writing or orally.

law or otherwise and any purported assignment hereof shall be null and void.

  

  

Section 8.11. Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
other than as provided in Section 5.10 and Section 5.12, is intended to or
shall confer upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 8.12. Mutual Drafting. Each party hereto has participated in the
drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of
extensive negotiations between the parties.

8.13.1. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the internal laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to

in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of Florida, without regard
to conflicts of laws principles.

  

  

8.13.2. Jurisdiction. Each of the parties irrevocably and unconditionally
submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
U.S. District Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, and any appellate
court therefrom, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or enforcement
of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally (A) agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding
except in such courts, (B) agrees that any claim in respect of any such action
or proceeding may be heard and determined in the U.S. District Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware, (C) waives, to the fullest extent it may
legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in the U.S.
District Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, and (D) waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in the U.S. District Court of
Chancery of

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

67  

  

 

 

 

   
 

the State of Delaware. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment
in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process
in the manner provided for notices in Section 8.3. Nothing in this Agreement
will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any
other manner permitted by law.

  

  

8.13.3. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER OR OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE
CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION PERMITTED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH PARTY
MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

  

  

Section 8.14. Disclosure Schedule. The fact that any item of information is
disclosed in a Disclosure Schedule to this Agreement shall not be construed to
mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement. Such
information and the dollar thresholds set forth herein shall not be used as a
basis for interpreting the terms "material" or "Material Adverse Effect" or
other similar terms in this Agreement.

  

  

Section 8.15. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. The parties agree
that this Agreement shall be legally binding upon the electronic transmission,
including by facsimile or email, by each party of a signed signature page to
this Agreement to the other party.

  

  

Section 8.16. Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.

  

  

Section 8.17. Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (A)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the other, (B) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
the other contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and
(C) waive compliance by the other with any

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

68  

  

 

 

 

   
 

of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the
party or parties to be bound thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure
to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other failure.

  

  

Section 8.18. Specific Performance. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement, the parties agree that immediate, extensive and irreparable damage
would occur for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached. Accordingly,
the parties agree that, if for any reason Parent, Merger Sub or the Company
shall have failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement, then the
party seeking to enforce this Agreement against such nonperforming party under
this Agreement shall be entitled to specific performance and the issuance of
immediate injunctive and other equitable relief without the necessity of
proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy, and the parties further
agree to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with the obtaining of any such injunctive or other equitable
relief, this being in addition to and not in limitation of any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. Without limiting the foregoing,
each of the parties hereby acknowledges and agrees that it may be difficult to
prove damages with reasonable certainty, that it may be difficult to procure
suitable substitute performance, and that injunctive relief and/or specific
performance will not cause an undue hardship to the parties. Each of the
parties hereby further acknowledges and agrees that the existence of any other
remedy contemplated by this Agreement shall not diminish the availability of
specific performance of the obligations hereunder or any other injunctive
relief and agrees that in the event of any action by the other party for
specific performance or injunctive relief, it will not assert that a remedy at
law or other remedy would be adequate or that specific performance or
injunctive relief in respect of such breach or violation should not be
available on the grounds that money damages are adequate or any other grounds.
Any such remedies, and any and all other remedies provided for in this
Agreement, shall be cumulative in nature and not exclusive and shall be in
addition to any other remedies whatsoever which any party may otherwise have.
