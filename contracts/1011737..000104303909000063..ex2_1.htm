2009, by and among Windstream Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("
**Parent** "), Delta Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned

amended (the " **PBCL** "); and

  

_**WHEREAS**_ ,the Board of Directors of each of the Company, Parent and Newco
has approved this Agreement and the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the

share of common stock (" **Company Common Stock** "), par value $0.16  per
share, of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively,
the " **Company Shares** "), other than Company Shares owned by Parent, Newco
or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (collectively, the
" **Parent Companies** ") or held by the Company as treasury shares
(collectively, the " **Excluded  Shares** "), will be converted into the
right to receive cash and shares of the common stock of Parent (the " **Parent

waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof, the appropriate
parties hereto shall execute in the manner required by the PBCL and the DGCL

1.4 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " **Closing** ") shall take
place (a) at the offices of Barley Snyder, LLC, 126 East King Street,
Lancaster, Pennsylvania, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time as soon as practicable,
but in no event  later than the second Business Day following the date on
which the last of the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof shall be

place, time and date as Parent and the Company may agree.

  

**ARTICLE II -** **SURVIVING CORPORATION**

  

2.1 _Certificate of Incorporation_. The certificate of incorporation of

Effective Time, shall become the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation  until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law.

  

2.2 _By-Laws_. The by-laws of Newco (the " **Newco By-Laws** "), as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall become the by-laws of

shall be replaced by references to the name of the Surviving Company.

  

2.3 _Directors_. The directors of Newco at the Effective Time shall, from
and after the Effective Time, be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and
qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance 
with the Surviving Corporation's articles of incorporation and by-laws.

  

2.4 _Officers_. The officers of Newco at the Effective Time shall, from

**ARTICLE III -** **MERGER CONSIDERATION; CONVERSION OR CANCELLATION OF
SHARES IN THE MERGER**

  

3.1 _Share Consideration for the Merger; Conversion or Cancellation of
Shares in the Merger_.

  

       



     |  

(a)

     |  

_Merger Consideration_.

    
---|---|--- 
   

  



  

(i) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Newco, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
the holders of any Company Shares or the holders of any capital stock of
Newco, each issued and outstanding Company Share (other than Excluded Shares
which are addressed in  _Section 3.1(a)(iv)_ ) shall, by virtue of the
Merger, be converted into the right to receive, pursuant to _Section 3.2_ ,
upon the surrender of the share certificates evidencing the Company Shares,
the Parent Stock Consideration and the Cash Consideration, without interest
thereon, and shall be automatically cancelled and extinguished, in accordance
with _Section  3.2_ herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then any
number or amount contained herein  which is based upon the number of shares
of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, as the case may be, will be
appropriately adjusted to provide to Parent and the holders of Company Common
Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event. For purposes of clarification, there shall be no adjustment to the
Merger Consideration as a result of an exchange or issuance of Parent Common
Stock which occurs in connection with an acquisition or merger by  Parent in
which Parent continues as the surviving corporation. As provided in _Section
3.6_ , the right of any holder of a certificate of Company Common Stock to
receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by the amount
of any withholding under applicable tax Law.

  



  

(ii) _Definitions_. For purposes hereof, the following terms have the
following respective meanings:

  



  

" **Cash Consideration** " means an amount per Company Share in cash equal to
$ 5.00.

  

" **Conversion Ratio** " means 0.650.

  

" **Outstanding Shares** " means the aggregate number of Company Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, but excluding the
Excluded Shares, which number will not be greater than the number of shares
outstanding on the date of this Agreement except as permitted in _Section 6.1_
  herein.

  



  

 

  

3

  



  



  

    

" **Parent Stock Consideration** " means that number of shares of Parent
Common Stock payable in the Merger for each Company Share at a rate of one
share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by the Conversion Ratio.

  

(iii) _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be issued in connection with the Merger. In lieu of the issuance
of any fractional share to which he would otherwise be entitled (taking into
account all shares of Parent Company Stock exchanged by such  holder), each
former stockholder of Company shall receive in cash an amount equal to the
fair market value of his fractional interest, which fair market value shall be
determined by multiplying such fraction by the sum of (A) $5.00 and (B) the
product of (I) the Conversion Ratio and (II) the Closing Market Price (the "
**Per Share Amount** ").

  



  

(iv) _Cancelled Company Shares_. The Excluded Shares shall not be
converted into Parent Common Stock and shall be automatically cancelled and
cease to exist at the Effective Time.

  



  

(v) _Closing Market Price_. For purposes of this Agreement, the "
**Closing Market Price** " shall be the average of the per share closing bid
and asked prices for Parent Common Stock, calculated to two decimal places,
for  the ten (10) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date
which is two (2) business days before the Effective Time, as reported on the
New York Stock Exchange (the " **Exchange** "), the foregoing period of ten
(10) trading days being hereinafter sometimes referred to as the " **Closing
Price Determination Period** ".

  



  

(b) At the Effective Time, each Company Share issued and outstanding and
owned by any of the Parent Companies or any of the Company's direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries or authorized but unissued shares held by
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to be
outstanding, and shall be  cancelled and retired without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

  



  

(c) At the Effective Time, each share of common stock of Newco issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation and shall be owned by Parent.

  



  

3.2 _Exchange of Stock Certificates_. Company Common Stock certificates
(or evidence of shares in book entry form) shall be exchanged for certificates
(or evidence of shares in book entry form) evidencing the Parent Stock
Consideration and the Cash Consideration in accordance with the following 
procedures:

  

(a) Parent shall appoint Computershare Investor Services, LLC, as the
Person to act as exchange agent under this Agreement (the " **Exchange Agent**
") and who shall serve pursuant to an agreement between Parent and the
Exchange Agent (the " **Exchange Agent  Agreement** ") that is approved by
the Company. The Company's approval of the Exchange Agent Agreement shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deliver to the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders
of Company Shares, (i) certificates (or evidence of shares in book entry form)
representing, as nearly as practicable, an aggregate number of shares of
Parent Common Stock  equal to the number of shares to be converted into
Parent Common Stock and (ii) an amount in cash equal to the Cash Consideration
to be paid to holders of Company Shares to be converted into the right to
receive the Cash Consideration.

  



  

 

  

4

  



  



  

    

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Common Stock a
form of letter of transmittal (the " **Letter of Transmittal** ") (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of  loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions
(including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an "agent's
message" with respect to shares held in book-entry form) as Parent may specify
subject to the Company's reasonable approval), together with instructions
thereto. Upon (i) in the case of shares of Company Common Stock represented 
by a certificate, the surrender of such certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, or (ii) in the case of shares of Company Common Stock held in
book-entry form, the receipt of an "agent's message" by the Exchange Agent, in
each case together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly, completely and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such shares  shall be entitled to receive (and the Exchange Agent shall
deliver) (i) certificates (or electronic equivalents) representing the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock into which such Company Shares shall have
been converted in the Merger and (ii) a bank check for an amount equal to the
Cash Consideration multiplied by the number of Company Shares to be converted.

  

(c) No dividends or distributions that have been declared, if any, with
respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time
will be paid to Persons entitled to receive certificates (or electronic
equivalents) for shares of Parent Common Stock until such Persons surrender
their certificates (or electronic equivalents) for  Company Shares in
accordance with the procedure described in _Section 3.2(b)_ , at which time
all such dividends and distributions shall be paid. In no event shall the
Persons entitled to receive such dividends be entitled to receive interest on
such dividends. If any certificate (or electronic equivalents) for such Parent
Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the
certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is  registered, it shall be a
condition of such exchange that the certificate so surrendered shall be
endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and that the
Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer
taxes or other taxes required by reason of issuance in a name other than the
registered holder of the certificate (or electronic equivalent) surrendered,
or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has
been paid  or is not applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Exchange Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of Company
Shares for any Parent Common Stock or dividends thereon delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.

  



  

 

  

5

  



  



  

    

(d) In no event shall the holder of any such surrendered certificates (or
electronic equivalents) be entitled to receive interest on any of the Cash
Consideration to be received in the Merger except as set forth in any
agreement between Parent and the Exchange Agent. If such check is to be issued
in the name of a Person other than the Person in  whose name the certificates
(or electronic equivalents) surrendered for exchange therefor are registered,
it shall be a condition of the exchange that the certificate so surrendered
shall be endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and that
the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of issuance of such check to a
Person other than the registered holder of the certificates (or electronic 
equivalents) surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any party hereto
shall be liable to a holder of Company Shares for any amount paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.

  

(e) Any funds deposited with the Exchange Agent (including any interest
received with respect thereto) that remains undistributed to the holders of
Company Common Stock for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered
to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not
theretofore complied with this Article III  shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares and any dividends and distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to this Article III, in each case without any interest
thereon. The Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be authorized to pay the
Merger Consideration to any holder of Company Common Stock whose certificate
has been lost or destroyed, upon receipt of appropriate indemnification and 
satisfactory evidence of ownership of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented thereby.

  

(f) None of Parent, the Company, Newco or the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the funds deposited with the
Exchange Agent delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of such funds which
remains undistributed to the holders of  certificates of Company Common Stock
for two years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier
date on which the funds would otherwise escheat to, or become the property of,
any Government Entity), shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

  

(g) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash in the funds deposited with
the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent.

  

3.3 _No Further Rights or Transfers; Cancellation of Treasury Shares_.
Except for the right to surrender of the certificate(s) (or evidence of shares
in book entry form) representing the Company Shares in exchange for the right
to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to each Company  Share and
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, at and after the
Effective Time, all Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist at the Effective Time and
each holder of Company Shares shall cease to have any rights as a shareholder
of the Company, and no transfer of Company Shares shall thereafter be made on
the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. Each Company Share 
held in the Company's treasury immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
by virtue of the Merger, be canceled and retired and cease to exist without
any conversion thereof.

     |  

_Stock Options; Restricted Stock. _

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

(a) As of the Effective Time, each option (" **Company Option** ") which
has been granted under the Company's Amended and Restated 1999 Long Term
Incentive Plan or 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan or any predecessor plans
thereto (collectively, the  " **Company Stock Plan** ") and is outstanding at
the Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable, will either, at the
election of the holder of a Company Option made not less than ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Effective Time: (A) be exchanged for, and the
holder of each such Company Option will be entitled to receive, upon surrender
of the Company Option for cancellation, cash in an amount equal to the number
of shares  of Company Common Stock covered by such Company Option multiplied
by the excess, if any, of the Per Share Amount over the exercise price per
share of such Company Option (the " **Option Payment** "), or (B) shall remain
outstanding under the Company Stock Plan except that the holder of such
Company Option will be entitled to receive Parent Common Stock Consideration
upon exercise thereof on the following terms: (A) the number of  shares of
Parent Common Stock which may be acquired pursuant to such Company Stock
Option shall be equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common
Stock covered by the Company Option multiplied by 1.2025; provided that any
fractional share of Parent Common Stock resulting from such multiplication
shall be rounded up to the nearest whole share; (B) the exercise price per
share of Parent Common Stock shall be equal to the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock of  such Company Option, divided by 1.2025, provided
that such exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent; (C)
the duration and other terms of such Parent Stock Option shall be identical to
the duration and other terms of such Company Option (giving effect to the
terms of the Company Stock Option Plans or the Company Options providing for
accelerated vesting as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) except that all references to Company shall be  deemed to be
references to Parent and its affiliates, where the context so requires, and
shall remain exercisable until the stated expiration date of the corresponding
Company Option. In the absence of an election by the holder of a Company
Option, Company Options held by such holder shall be converted to cash and
delivered to the holder of the Company Option.

  

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Board of Directors (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof)
shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as it may deem
necessary to provide that, at the Effective Time, each share of restricted
stock or stock equivalents under the Company Stock  Plan outstanding under
the Company Stock Plan (" **Company Restricted Stock** ") granted subject to
vesting or other lapse restrictions pursuant to the Company Stock Plan which
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall vest and become
free of such restrictions as of the Effective Time and, at the Effective Time,
the holder of such share of Company Restricted Stock shall, subject to this
Article  III, be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to

Subsidiary  may vote, and (ii) there are not any outstanding or authorized
options, warrants, calls, rights (including preemptive rights), commitments or
any other agreements of any character to which the Company is a party, or by

into, exchangeable for, or evidencing the right to subscribe for, any shares
of capital stock of the Company or  any of its Subsidiaries. There are no

any kind obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock or other voting

(a) The Company has furnished or filed all forms, reports and documents
required to be furnished or filed by it with the SEC since January 1, 2007,

thereunder (such documents, together with any documents filed with the SEC
during such period by  the Company on a voluntary basis on a Current Report
on Form 8-K, but excluding the Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement,

all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the " **Securities  Act** ") or the SOX Act, respectively. Except
to the extent that information contained in any such Company SEC Report has
been revised, amended, supplemented or superseded by a subsequent Company SEC
Report, none of the Company SEC Reports, including, without limitation, any
financial statements or schedules included therein, as of their respective
dates, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be  stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they

thereto, were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles (" **GAAP** ") applied on a basis consistent with prior periods

therein), and present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of
their respective dates, and the  consolidated results of their operations and
their cash flows for the periods presented therein (subject, in the case of
the unaudited interim financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments).

  



  

(c) Except as reflected or reserved against in the Company's
consolidated audited balance sheet at December 31, 2008, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature
that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material  Adverse Effect. The Company SEC Reports
describe and the Company has delivered to Parent copies of the documentation
creating or governing, all securitization transactions and "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(c) of Regulation S-K promulgated under
the Securities Act) effected by the Company or its Subsidiaries since

(e) The Company and each Subsidiary of the Company maintains accurate
books and records reflecting its assets and liabilities and maintains a system
of "internal control over financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which provide assurance that (i)
transactions are  executed with management's authorization; (ii) transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the consolidated financial
statements of the Company in conformity with GAAP; (iii) access to the
Company's assets is permitted only in accordance with management's
authorization; (iv) the reporting of the Company's assets is compared with
existing assets at regular intervals; and (v) accounts, notes and other

(f) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required
by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act; such controls and procedures

Subsidiaries required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under  the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time period specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC and that all such information required to be disclosed is accumulated and
communicated to the management of the Company, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure to enable the chief executive officer
and chief financial officer of the Company to make the certifications required
under the Exchange Act with respect to such  reports. _Schedule 4.6(f)_

descriptions of, and all policies, manuals and other documents promulgating,

set forth in the Company SEC Reports, each director and executive officer of
the Company has filed with the SEC on a timely basis all statements required
by Section 16(a) of the  Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder since January 1, 2007. As used in this _Section 4.6(f)_ , the term
"file" shall be broadly construed to include any manner in which a document or
information is furnished, supplied or otherwise made available to the SEC.
None of the Company's or any of its Subsidiary's records, systems, controls,
data or information are recorded, stored, maintained, operated or  otherwise
wholly or partly dependent on or held by any means (including any electronic,
mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not) which
(including all means of access thereto and therefrom) are not under the
exclusive ownership and direct control of the Company or such Subsidiary or
their independent accountants.

  



  

(g) Each of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer
of the Company has signed, and the Company has furnished to the SEC, all
certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of the SOX Act; such certifications contain no
qualifications or exceptions to the  matters certified therein and have not
been modified or withdrawn; and, except as set forth on _Schedule 4.6(g)_ ,
since January 1, 2007 neither the Company nor any of its officers has received
notice from any federal, state, local or foreign government, any court, any
administrative, regulatory (including any stock exchange) or other
governmental agency, commission or authority (each, a " **Government 
Entity** " or " **Governmental Entity** ") questioning or challenging the
accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing or submission of such
certifications.

  



  

(h) The statements contained in all certifications filed with the SEC
pursuant to Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and
906 of the SOX Act were true as of the date thereof. None of the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company has outstanding, or has arranged any
outstanding, "extensions of  credit" to directors or executive officers
within the meaning of Section 402 of the SOX Act.

(i) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.6(i)_ , since January 1, 2007,
none of the Company, the Company's independent accountants, the Board of
Directors or the audit committee of the Board of Directors has received any
oral or written notification of any (x)  "significant deficiency" in the
internal controls over financial reporting of the Company, (y) "material
weakness" in the internal controls over financial reporting of the Company or
(z) fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees of the Company who have a significant role in the internal controls
over financial reporting of the Company.

Code ( **" Company ERISA Affiliate"**), to any material liability, tax, or

engaged in, a transaction described in Sections 4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA or
(ii) incurred, or reasonably expects to incur prior to the Effective Time (a)
any liability under Title IV of ERISA arising in connection with the
termination of, or a complete or partial withdrawal  from, any Title IV Plan

Except as disclosed in any filed Parent SEC Report (as defined in _Section
5.5(a)_ below) since February 19, 2009 and prior to the date hereof (excluding
any disclosures in such Parent SEC Reports under the heading "Risk Factors"
and any other disclosures of risks and uncertainties, including, without
limitation, disclosures  about potential regulatory developments, that are
predictive and forward looking in nature and solely to the extent the
relevance of the information disclosed in such Parent SEC Reports to the
representations and warranties set forth in this Article V is readily apparent
on its face) or as set forth in the disclosure letter (consisting of the
Schedules hereto delivered by Parent) delivered by Parent to the Company on or
prior to the date of this Agreement (the  " **Parent Disclosure Letter** ")
it being understood that any information set forth in one section or
subsection of the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to apply to each
other section or subsection of this Article V to the extent that it is
reasonably apparent that such information is relevant to such other section or
subsection (to the extent any information disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports
conflicts with or is  otherwise inconsistent with the information disclosed
in the Parent Disclosure Letter, the information disclosed in the Parent
Disclosure Letter shall control for purposes of qualifying the representations
and warranties set forth in this Article V) the Parent represents and warrants
to the Company as follows:

  

5.1 _Corporate Organization and Qualification_. Each of Parent and its
Subsidiaries (as defined in _Section 9.10_ below) is a corporation or limited
liability company, as applicable, duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the  laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and
is qualified to do business and in good standing as a foreign corporation or
limited liability company in each jurisdiction where the properties owned,
leased or operated or the business conducted by it require such qualification,
except, in the case of any Subsidiary of Parent, where failure to so qualify
or be in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not have and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent  Material Adverse Effect
(as defined in _Section 9.10_ below). Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has
all requisite organizational power and authority to own its properties and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted except where failure to
have such power and authority would not have and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent and Newco have
heretofore made available  to the Company complete and correct copies of its
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the **" Parent Charter"**)
and By-Laws (the **" Parent By-Laws"**), with respect to Parent, and the Newco
Charter and Newco By-Laws with respect to Newco, each in effect as of the date
of this Agreement.

  



  

 

  

28

  



  



  

    



  

5.2 _Capitalization_. As of the date hereof, the authorized capital stock
of Parent consists of 1,000,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock, of which,
as of April 30, 2009, 436,753,317 shares were issued and outstanding; and
200,000,000 shares of preferred stock of which, as of the date hereof,  no
shares were issued and outstanding. All of the outstanding shares of capital
stock of Parent have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully
paid and nonassessable, and not subject to, or issued in violation of, any
purchase option, call option, right of first refusal, preemptive right,
subscription right or any similar right under any provision of the DGCL, the
Parent Charter, the Parent By-Laws or any Contract to which Parent is a party
or otherwise bound. As of April  30, 2009, 3,561,141 shares of Parent Common
Stock were reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding awards pursuant
to the Windstream 2006 Equity Incentive Plan. Except as set forth above and on
_Schedule 5.2_ , there are not, as of the date hereof, any outstanding or
authorized options, warrants, calls, rights (including preemptive rights),
commitments or any other agreements of any character to which Parent is a
party, or by which  it may be bound, requiring it to issue, transfer, sell,
purchase, redeem or acquire any shares of capital stock or any securities or
rights convertible into, exchangeable for, or evidencing the right to
subscribe for, any shares of capital stock of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries. The shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued to shareholders
of the Company as part of the Merger Consideration in the Merger will be, when
issued, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and  nonassessable.

  

5.3 _Authority Relative to This Agreement_. Each of Parent and Newco has

executed and delivered by Parent and Newco and, assuming this Agreement
constitutes the valid and binding agreement of the Company, constitutes the
valid and binding agreement of  Parent and Newco, enforceable against Parent
and Newco in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be
limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors' rights
generally and (b) general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law).

  



  

 

  

29

  



  



  

    

5.4 _Consents and Approvals; No Violation_. Neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Newco nor the consummation by Parent
and Newco of the transactions contemplated hereby will:

  

(a) conflict with or result in any breach of any provision of the Parent
Charter or the Parent By-Laws, or the Newco Charter or Newco Bylaws;

obtain such consent, approval, authorization or permit, or to make such filing
or notification, would not have and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect and  would
not materially and adversely affect the ability of the Parent to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise prevent or materially
impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the Merger.

  

(c) except as set forth in _Schedule 5.4(c)_ , conflict with, or result in
a violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse
of time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration or lien or other charge or encumbrance) under 
any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any agreement, indenture, lease,
instrument, permit, concession, franchise, license, understanding or
undertaking or other instrument or obligation to which Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent or any of their assets may be bound, except for such
violations, breaches and defaults (or rights of termination, cancellation or
acceleration or lien or other charge or encumbrance) as to which requisite
waivers or consents have been obtained or which  individually or in the
aggregate have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect; or

  

(d) assuming the consents, approvals, authorizations or permits and filings
or notifications referred to in this _Section 5.4_ are duly and timely
obtained or made, violate any order, award of an arbitrator, writ, injunction,
decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to the Parent or any 
Subsidiary of the Parent or to any of their respective assets, except for
violations which individually or in the aggregate have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

period by Parent on a voluntary  basis on a Current Report on Form 8-K, but
excluding the Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement, being
collectively referred to as the " **Parent SEC Reports** "), all of which, as

applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act or the SOX
Act, respectively. Except to the extent that information contained in any such
Parent SEC Report has been  revised, amended, supplemented or superseded by a
subsequent Parent SEC Report, none of the Parent SEC Reports, including,
without limitation, any financial statements or schedules included therein, as
of their respective dates, contained any untrue statement of a material fact
or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. Except  as set forth on _Schedule
5.5_ , to the Parent's Knowledge, as of the date hereof, none of the Parent
SEC Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review.

  



  

 

  

30

  



  



  

    

(b) The consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements
of operations and cash flows (including the related notes thereto) of the
Parent included in the Parent SEC Reports, as of their respective dates,
complied in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and
the published rules and regulations of the  SEC with respect thereto, were
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with prior
periods (except, in the case of unaudited interim statements, as otherwise
noted therein), and present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of the Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of their
respective dates, and the consolidated results of their operations and their
cash flows for the periods presented therein (subject, in the case of the 
unaudited interim financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments).

  

(c) Except as reflected or reserved against in the Parent's consolidated
audited balance sheet at December 31, 2008, neither the Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature that,
individually or in the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

  

(d) PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is and has been (x) since September 24,

"independent" with respect to Parent within the meaning of Regulation S-X, and
(z) since May 6, 2003, in  compliance with subsections (g) through (l) of
Section 10A of the Exchange Act and the related rules of the SEC and the

(e) The Parent and each Subsidiary of Parent maintains accurate books and
records reflecting its assets and liabilities and maintains a system of
"internal control over financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and

are executed with  management's authorization; (ii) transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of the consolidated financial statements of

only in accordance with management's authorization; (iv) the reporting of

(f) The Parent maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by
Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act; such controls and procedures are
designed to ensure that all information concerning Parent and its Subsidiaries
required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded,  processed, summarized and reported
within the time period specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that
all such information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated
to the management of Parent, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure to enable the chief executive officer and chief
financial officer of Parent to make the certifications required under the
Exchange Act with respect to such reports. To Parent's Knowledge, except  as
set forth in Parent SEC Reports, each director and executive officer of Parent

thereto and therefrom) are not under the exclusive ownership and direct
control of Parent or such Subsidiary or their independent  accountants.

Parent has signed, and Parent has furnished to the SEC, all certifications
required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and

exceptions to the matters certified therein and  have not been modified or
withdrawn; and, except as set forth on _Schedule 5.5(g)_ , neither Parent nor
any of its officers has received notice from any Governmental Entity
questioning or challenging the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of
filing or submission of such certifications.

  

(h) The statements contained in all certifications filed with the SEC
pursuant to Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and
906 of the SOX Act were true as of the date thereof. None of Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent has outstanding, or has arranged any outstanding,
"extensions of credit" to directors or  executive officers within the meaning
of Section 402 of the SOX Act.

  

(i) Except as set forth in the Parent SEC Reports, since January 1, 2007,
none of Parent, Parent's independent accountants, the Board of Directors or
the audit committee of the Board of Directors has received any oral or written
notification of any (x) "significant deficiency" in the internal controls over
financial  reporting of Parent, (y) "material weakness" in the internal
controls over financial reporting of Parent or (z) fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees of Parent who have a
significant role in the internal controls over financial reporting of Parent.

5.7 _Litigation_. Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports, there is
no legal action, suit, complaint, arbitration or other legal, administrative
or other governmental investigation, inquiry or proceeding (whether federal,
state, local or foreign) pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,  threatened
against or affecting Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties, assets, business, or governmental approvals before any
Governmental Entity or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction, which,
individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected (a) to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, (b) to materially and adversely affect the
ability of Parent to carry out the Merger or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, or (c) to delay,  materially interfere with, prevent or
otherwise make unduly burdensome, the Merger or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or
order of any nature of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding or,
to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries having or which would be reasonably expected to have any such
effect.

  

5.8 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Parent or Newco for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i)
the Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement or any

     |  

_No Solicitation of Transactions_.

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

(a) The Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to,
nor shall it authorize or permit any officer, director or employee of, or any
investment banker, attorney or other advisor or representative (a "
**Representative** ") of, the Company or any Subsidiary to, directly  or
through another Person, (A) solicit or initiate, or knowingly encourage, or
take any other action designed to, or which could reasonably be expected to,
lead to or facilitate, directly or indirectly, any inquiries relating to, or
the submission of (i) any proposal or offer, whether in writing or otherwise,
from any Person other than Parent, Newco or any affiliates thereof (a "
**Third Party** ") to acquire, directly or  indirectly in one transaction or
a series of transactions, beneficial ownership (as defined under Rule 13(d)
promulgated under the Exchange Act) of assets or businesses that constitute
15% or more of either the revenues, net income or assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 15% or more of any class of equity or
voting securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 15% of the
consolidated  assets of the Company pursuant to a merger, consolidation or
other business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint
venture, binding share exchange, reorganization, sale of shares of stock, sale
of assets, tender offer, exchange offer or similar transaction or series of
related transactions, or (ii) any other substantially similar transaction or
series of related transactions that would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially impair or delay the  consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (a " **Competing Transaction** "); (B) enter into, continue
or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
furnish to any Person any information or afford access to the properties,
books or records of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, or otherwise
cooperate in any way with, any Person relating to or in connection with a
Competing  Transaction or otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or
attempt by any Person to make or implement a Competing Transaction; (C) enter
into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement or similar document, agreement or
commitment with respect to any Competing Transaction, approve or recommend or
resolve to approve or recommend any Competing Transaction or enter into any
agreement requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to  consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (D)
waive, amend, modify or grant any release under any standstill or similar
agreement or confidentiality agreement relating to a Competing Transaction
(other than the Confidentiality Agreement) to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that
any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any 
Subsidiary of the Company or any Representative of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company shall be a breach of this _Section 6.2(a)_ by the
Company. The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted
heretofore with respect to any Competing Transaction and request the prompt
return or destruction of all confidential information  previously furnished.

  



  

 

  

39

  



  



  

    



  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing subsection (a) or anything else in this
Agreement to the contrary, if the Company receives a bona fide, written
proposal or offer for a Competing Transaction by a Third Party at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, which the Company's Board
determines in good faith (after  consultation with the Company's outside
legal counsel and financial advisor) may reasonably be likely to result in a
transaction that, if consummated, would result in such Third Party (or its
shareholders) owning, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the shares of
Company Common Stock then outstanding (or of the shares of the surviving
entity in a merger or the direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in
a merger) or all or substantially all the assets of the Company  on terms
more favorable to the shareholders of the Company from a financial point of
view than the terms set forth in this Agreement (as the same may be amended or
supplemented by Parent from time to time) and is reasonably capable of being
consummated on the terms so proposed (taking into account all the terms and
conditions of such proposal, all financial, legal, regulatory and other
aspects of such proposal and this Agreement) (a " **Superior Competing 
Transaction** "), then the Company may, in response to an unsolicited request
therefor and subject to compliance with _Section 6.2_ , (A) furnish
confidential information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to
the Third Party proposing such Competing Transaction (and its Representatives)
pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement not materially more
favorable to such Person than the  confidentiality provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement, provided that all such information has previously
been provided to the Parent and Newco or is provided to the Parent and Newco
prior to or concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person, and (B)
participate in discussions and negotiations with the Third Party proposing
such Competing Transaction (and its Representatives) regarding such Competing
Transaction; if and only to the extent that (1) prior to taking such  actions
outlined in (A) and (B) above, the Company's Board of Directors determines in
good faith (after taking into account advice of outside counsel) that it is
required to do so in order for the Board of Directors to comply with its
fiduciary obligations to the Company's shareholders under applicable Law, (2)
prior to providing any information to any Person or entering into discussions
or negotiations with any Person, the Company's Board of Directors notifies
Parent  promptly of any such inquiry, proposal or offer received by, any such
information requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations sought to
be initiated or continued with, the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or
any of their respective Representatives indicating, in connection with such
notice, the material terms and conditions of the Competing Transaction and the
identity of the Person making such Competing Transaction, and (3) the
Competing Transaction was not solicited  after the date hereof and was made
after the date hereof and did not otherwise result from a breach of this
_Section 6.2_. The Company agrees that it shall keep Parent reasonably
informed, on a current basis, of the status and material terms of any such
proposals or offers and the status of any such discussions or negotiations and
will notify Parent promptly of any determination by the Company's Board of
Directors that a Superior Competing  Transaction has been made. The Company
and its Subsidiaries will immediately cease and cause their respective
Representatives to cease any and all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations regarding a Competing Transaction made prior to the date hereof,
or which could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Competing
Transaction, with any parties previously contacted; provided that the Company
may inform such parties that this Agreement has been entered  into.

  



  

 

  

40

  



  



  

    



  

(c) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.2_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its shareholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its shareholders if, in  each
case, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors, with the advice of
outside counsel, making such disclosure to the Company's shareholders is
required under applicable Law; provided, however, that in no event shall the
Company or its Board of Directors take, or agree or resolve to take, any
action prohibited by _Section 6.2_.

  

(d) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs
(a) and (b) of this _Section 6.2_, the Company shall promptly advise the
Parent and Newco in writing of any Competing Transaction or any request for
material nonpublic information relating to the Company or any  Subsidiary of
the Company or for access to the properties, books or records of the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company by any Person related to or in connection
with a Competing Transaction or which could reasonably be expected to lead to
a Competing Transaction, identifying the material terms and conditions of any
such Competing Transaction or request (including any material changes thereto)
and the identity of the Person making any such Competing Transaction or
request. The  Company shall keep the Parent and Newco informed in all
material respects of the status and details (including any material change to
the terms thereof) of any Competing Transaction.

  

(e) The Board of Directors shall not (i) (a) withdraw (or amend or modify
in a manner adverse to the Parent or Newco), or publicly propose or resolve to
withdraw (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to the Parent or Newco), the
Board Recommendation, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or (b) adopt or  recommend, or propose publicly to adopt or
recommend, any Competing Transaction (any action described in this clause (i)
being referred to as a " **Company Adverse Recommendation Change** ") or (ii)
adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt or recommend, or allow the
Company or any Subsidiary to execute or enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition  agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other similar contract constituting or related to, or
that is intended to or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Competing
Transaction (other than a confidentiality agreement expressly permitted by in
_Section 6.2(b)_ ) (an " **Acquisition Agreement** ").

  



  

 

  

41

  



  



  

    



  

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Shareholder Approval and subject to prior compliance with _Section
6.2(b)_ , the Board of Directors may (x) make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or (y) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement  pursuant to
_Section 8.4(b)_ if:

  

(1) an unsolicited Competing Transaction that the Board of Directors
reasonably determines (after consultation with the Company's outside counsel
and financial advisors) constitutes a Superior Competing Transaction was made
after the date hereof and not withdrawn;

  

(2) the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after taking into
account advice of outside counsel) that, in light of such Superior Competing
Transaction, the making of a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
termination this Agreement is required in order for the Board of Directors to
comply with its fiduciary  obligations to the Company's shareholders under
applicable Law;

  

(3) neither the Company, its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective
Representatives shall have violated any of the restrictions set forth in
_Section 6.2_ in any material respect;

  

(4) the Company delivers written notice to Parent (a " **Notice of
Superior Competing Transaction** ") advising Parent that the Board of
Directors intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor,
including the material terms and conditions of any Superior  Competing
Transaction that is the basis of the proposed action by the Board of Directors
(it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or
any other material term of such Superior Competing Transaction shall require a
new Notice of Superior Competing Transaction and a new five Business Day
period), and after the fifth Business Day following delivery of the Notice of
Superior Competing Transaction to Parent the Board of Directors continues to
determine in good  faith that the Competing Transaction constitutes a
Superior Competing Transaction; and

  



  

 

  

42

  



  



  

    

(5) in the event of termination of this Agreement (a) the Company pays
to Parent the amount specified in _Section 8.5(b)_ at or prior to such
termination and (b) the Company enters into an Acquisition Agreement to effect
the Superior Competing Transaction concurrent with such  termination.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of the
parties hereto shall use all reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be

Governmental Entity, (iii) cooperate with one another in connection with any
filing under the HSR Act and in connection with resolving any investigation or
other inquiry concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
initiated by the FTC, the Antitrust  Division or any other Governmental
Entity, and (iv) cause the waiting periods under the HSR Act or any other
foreign antitrust merger control authority to terminate or expire at the

(d) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
Parties hereto shall take any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate
any impediments under any applicable antitrust, competition or trade
regulation laws that may be asserted by any Government Entity with respect to

possible, including, without limitation, proposing, negotiating, committing to
and effecting, by consent decree or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of such assets or businesses of Parent, Newco or any of their
respective Subsidiaries as may be required in order to avoid the entry, or to
effect the dissolution, of any injunction, temporary restraining order or
other order in any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect
of preventing,  delaying or restricting the consummation of the Merger or any
transactions contemplated in this Agreement; provided that the Company shall
not be permitted and the Parent will not be required to agree to any term,
condition or restriction or to amend any Company License in order to obtain
any such authorizations, consents, orders or approvals if such term, condition
or restriction or amendment (1) would have or would reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a  Parent Material Adverse Effect,
(2) would prevent Parent from consummating the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement on the material terms set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

 

  

45

  



  



  

    



  

(e) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, take or cause to be taken all actions necessary to
effect the mergers effective immediately after the Effective Time of: (i)
Conestoga Management Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation, with and into its
parent Conestoga Telephone and Telegraph  Company, a Pennsylvania
corporation, (ii) DandE Management Services, Inc., a Nevada corporation, with
and into its parent Denver and Ephrata Telephone and Telegraph Company, a
Pennsylvania corporation, and (iii) Buffalo Valley Mgmt Services, Inc., a
Delaware corporation, with and into its parent Buffalo Valley Telephone

shall, and shall cause its  Subsidiaries to, execute or cause to be executed
by the appropriate entities, conveyancing, assumption and such other
instruments, in such forms as shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent, and
take such actions as reasonable requested by Parent in each case necessary to
effect the Restructuring.

  

6.5 _Access to Information_. Upon reasonable notice, the Company shall
(and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford to officers, employees,
counsel, accountants and other authorized representatives of Parent ("
**Parent  Representatives** "), in order to evaluate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, reasonable access, during normal business
hours and upon reasonable notice throughout the period prior to the Effective
Time, to its officers, employees, accountants, consultants, representatives,
plants, properties, contracts, commitments, books and records and during such
period, shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) furnish or make
available  reasonably promptly to such Parent Representatives all information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as may reasonably be
requested. The Company shall furnish to Parent (i) unaudited interim
consolidated statements of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
prepared on a basis consistent with past periods, in each case, as soon as
practicable following the end of each fiscal month, but in any event no later
than thirty (30) days following the end of such  fiscal month and (ii) all
statistical and financial reports regularly provided to management in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice (in terms of
frequency, timing and level of information), promptly following the time such
reports are made available to Company management. Parent agrees that it will
not, and will cause its Parent Representatives not to, use any information
obtained pursuant to this _Section 6.5_   for any purpose unrelated to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Confidentiality Agreement, dated March 18, 2009 (the " **Confidentiality
Agreement** "), by and between the Company and Parent shall apply with respect
to information furnished by the Company, its Subsidiaries and authorized
Representatives hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries  shall not be obligated to disclose (a) any information that, in
the reasonable judgment of the Company, would result in the loss of attorney-
client privilege with respect to such information or (b) any information that
would result in a breach of an agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party. No information obtained in any investigation pursuant
to this _Section 6.5_ shall be deemed to modify any representation  or
warranty in Article IV.

  



  

 

  

46

  



  



  

    

6.6 _Publicity_. The parties will consult with each other and will
mutually agree upon any press releases or public announcements pertaining to
the Merger and shall not issue any such press releases or make any such public
announcements prior to such consultation and agreement (which shall not be 
unreasonably withheld), (i) except as may be required by applicable Law or by
obligations pursuant to any agreement with any national securities exchange or

(a) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor
of the current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company as
provided in the Company Charter and the Company By-Laws or any indemnification
agreement between such directors,  officers or employees and the Company (in
each case, as in effect on the date of this Agreement) shall be assumed by the
Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, as of the
Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms.

  

(b) The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of individuals who
were directors, officers or employees of the Company prior to the Effective
Time than are presently set forth in the Company Charter  and the Company By-
Laws, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals.

  

(c) It is understood and agreed that prior to the Effective Time the
Company shall indemnify and hold harmless, and for a period of six years after
the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, indemnify and hold harmless, as and
to the full extent permitted by applicable  Law, each present or former
directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(the " **Indemnified Party** ") against any losses, damages, liabilities,
costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal or  administrative (each, a " **Claim** ") based in

(A) the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, employee,

trust or other enterprise or (B) the negotiation, execution or performance of
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and in the
event of any such threatened or actual Claim (whether asserted or arising
before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Company prior to the Effective
Time, and for a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall,
and shall  cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation
shall, promptly pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any Claim
to each Indemnified Party to the full extent permitted by law, subject to the
provision by such Indemnified Party of an undertaking to provide reasonable
cooperation in the defense of such Claim and to reimburse the amounts so
advanced in the event of a final non-appealable determination by a court of
competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified  Party is not entitled to such
amounts, (ii) the Indemnified Parties may retain one counsel reasonably
acceptable to them and the Parent (except in case of a conflict of interest
among two or more Indemnified Parties, in which case more than one counsel may
be retained both of whom must be reasonably acceptable to the Parent), and the
Company, and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, pay all
reasonable  fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties
within 30 days after statements therefor are received and (iii) the Company
will, and Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use its
best efforts to assist in the defense of any such matter and neither the
Company, Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual Claim for
which indemnification could be sought by an  Indemnified Party hereunder,
unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such
Claim, or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing to such
settlement, compromise or consent; provided that neither the Company, Parent
nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected
without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld); and  provided further, that neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when
and if, but only to the extent that, a court of competent jurisdiction shall
ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final and non
appealable, that indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.

  

(d) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this
_Section 6.7_ , upon learning of any such Claim, shall notify the Company and,
after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation, thereof,
provided, that the failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of 
the Company, Parent and the Surviving Corporation except to the extent such
failure to notify materially prejudices such party.

  

(e) Parent and Newco agree that all rights to indemnification existing in
favor of, and all exculpations and limitations of the personal liability of,
the directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in the Company Charter and Company By-Laws as in effect as of the
date hereof with respect to matters occurring  at or prior to the Effective
Time, including the Merger, shall continue in full force and effect for a
period of not less than six years from the Effective Time; provided, however,
that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Claims asserted or made
within such period shall continue until the disposition of such Claim.

the Surviving Corporation to cause to be maintained in effect the existing
directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary insurance policies
with an amount of coverage not less than 100% of the amount of existing
coverage, or policies that are no  less favorable to the Indemnified Parties,
and with an amount of coverage not less than 100% of the amount of existing
coverage, than the policies which are currently maintained by the Company,
with respect to Claims arising from facts or events which occurred at or
before the Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event shall the
Surviving Corporation or Parent be required to expend an amount in excess of
$400,000.00 for such insurance, and, if the premiums of such insurance 
coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain a policy that in the reasonable opinion of
Parent is the best available for such amount.

  

(g) This _Section 6.7_ is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to
grant third party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on
all successors and assigns of Parent, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other 
rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have from
the Company or any other Person by contract or otherwise. Each of the
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained in
this _Section 6.7_.

  

(h) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys a majority of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, proper  provision shall be made so that the
successors, assigns and transferees of the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.7_.

  

(i) To the extent permitted by law, all rights of indemnification under
this _Section 6.7_ for the benefit of any Indemnified Party shall be mandatory
rather than permissive.

be a guarantee of employment to any employee or officer of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or to impose any obligation on the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries to continue the employment of any  Person.

than the (I) greater of the actual award level achieved under the STIP or (II)
the target level under the STIP; which amounts  shall be paid in accordance
with the STIP and the awards thereunder (provided that such amounts may be
increased on an individual basis in a manner consistent with past practice);

weeks' salary or (ii) two weeks salary for each year of service with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or with a predecessor of the Company or

that the foregoing obligation shall not apply to employees of the Company who
were either subject to a collective bargaining agreement or listed on
_Schedule 6.8(b)(i)_ , or any successor employee to the forgoing positions
(the " **Contract Employees** "). In the event an officer's or employee's

service with Parent and its Subsidiaries in connection with any 401(k) savings
plan and welfare benefit plan or policy (including vacations and severance
policies) maintained by  Parent or one of its Subsidiaries which is made
available following the Effective Time by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries
for purposes of satisfying or determining any waiting period, vesting,
eligibility or benefit entitlement (but excluding benefit accruals
thereunder); provided that nothing in this _Section 6.8(c)_ shall create a
right for any employee or officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries to
participate in or receive  benefits under any of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries' severance plans, practices and policies until Parent's
obligation to honor the Company's severance and retention plans, practices and
policies pursuant to _Section 6.8(a)_ has expired.

provisions of this _Section 6.8_ shall not operate to require Parent to
duplicate any payments or benefits payable pursuant to any compensation or
benefits plans, policies, programs, agreements or  other arrangements of the
Company and its Subsidiaries; (ii) except as set forth in _Sections 6.8(a) and

nothing contained in this _Section 6.8_ , whether express or  implied, shall
be deemed to create an obligation of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to pay

Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

be a party to such reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the
Code, and such opinion shall not have been withdrawn, revoked or modified.

  

7.4 _Failure of Conditions_. A party to this Agreement may not rely on the
failure of any condition set forth in _Section 7.1_ , _Section 7.2_ or
_Section  7.3_ , as the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure was
caused by such party's failure to act in good faith or to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, as required by and subject to _Section 6.4_.

  

**ARTICLE VIII -** **TERMINATION; AMENDMENT; WAIVER**

Merger and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final

8.2_ shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any of its
obligations under this Agreement results in such failure to close.

  

8.3 _Termination by Parent_. This Agreement may be terminated by Parent
prior to the Effective Time, if:

  

(a) prior to the Closing, there shall have been a breach or inaccuracy of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company
contained in this Agreement, which breach or inaccuracy would (i) give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.3_ to be  satisfied and
(ii) is not cured, or is not capable of being cured, within thirty (30) days
of written notice of such breach or inaccuracy; and

  

(b) (i) the Board of Directors shall have failed to include in the Proxy

Time:

  

(a) if prior to the Closing, there shall have been a breach or inaccuracy

or Newco contained in this Agreement, which breach or inaccuracy would (i)
give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.2_ to  be
satisfied and (ii) is not cured, or is not capable of being cured, within
thirty (30) days of written notice of such breach or inaccuracy; and

  

       



     |

     |  

in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of _Section

     |  

8.5

     |  

_Effect of Termination_.

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

(a) In the event of the termination and abandonment of this Agreement
pursuant to Article VIII, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have
no effect, without any liability on the part of any party hereto or its
affiliates, directors, officers or shareholders, other than the provisions of
this _Section  8.5_ and the provisions of _Sections 9.1_ and _9.2_. Nothing
contained in this _Section 8.5_ shall relieve any party from liability for any
willful breach of any covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement.

  

(b) In the event of termination of this Agreement without consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby: (i) (A) by Parent pursuant to _Section
8.3(b)_ and (B) prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after such
termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect  to,
or consummates, a Competing Transaction; or (ii) by the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.4(b)_ , then the Company shall make payment to Parent by wire
transfer of immediately available funds of a fee in the amount equal to
$5,500,000 (the " **Termination Amount** "), such amount to constitute
liquidated (and exclusive) damages.

  



  

 

  

58

  



  



  

    

(c) In the event that (i) at any time after the date of this Agreement a
Competing Transaction shall have been made known to the shareholders of the
Company or publicly disclosed; (ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Parent
or the Company pursuant to _Sections 8.3(a)_ , or  _8.2(a)_ ; and (iii)
within twelve (12) months after this termination, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries enters into an agreement in respect of any Competing Transaction
or a transaction pursuant to which any Competing Transaction is consummated,
then the Company shall pay to the Parent the Termination Amount. Solely for
purposes of this _Section 8.5(c)_ , the term "Competing  Transaction" shall
have the meaning assigned to such term in _Section 6.2_ , except that all
references to "15%" shall be changed to "35%."

  

(d) Payment of the Termination Amount shall be made within two (2) Business
Days of the event triggering such payment occurs and shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing to
the Company by the Parent.

  

(e) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section
8.5_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, Parent would not have entered into this
Agreement. Accordingly, in the event that the Company shall fail to  pay the
Termination Fee when due, and in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a suit which results in a judgment against such other party for such
fee, then the Company shall pay Parent's reasonable costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of enforcement) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts owed at the
prime lending rate prevailing at such time, as published in the Wall Street
Journal, plus two percent  (2%) per annum from the date such amounts were
required to be paid until the date actually received by Parent.

  

8.6 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each of
Parent and Newco, on one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations  and
warranties of the other party contained herein or in any document, certificate
or writing delivered pursuant hereto, or (c) waive compliance by the other
party with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement
on the part of either party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in any instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
party. The failure of either party hereto to assert any of its rights
hereunder shall not constitute  a waiver of such rights.

  

**Article IX \- MISCELLANEOUS AND GENERAL**

  

9.1 _Payment of Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger shall be consummated,
each party hereto shall pay its own expenses incident to preparing for,
entering into and carrying out this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, Parent and Company each shall bear and pay 
one-half of the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the filing,
printing and mailing of the Proxy Statement. The fees and expenses related to
any filing made pursuant to the HSR Act or any competition, merger control,
antitrust or similar Law shall be paid by Parent.

  



  

 

  

59

  



  



  

    

9.2 _Survival of Representations and Warranties; Survival of
Confidentiality_. The representations and warranties made herein shall not
survive beyond the earlier of (i) termination of this Agreement or (ii) the
Effective Time. This _Section 9.2_   shall not limit any covenant or
agreement of the parties hereto which by its terms contemplates performance
after the Effective Time. The Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any
termination of this Agreement, and the provisions of such Confidentiality
Agreement shall apply to all information and material delivered by any party
hereunder.

  

9.3 _Modification or Amendment_. Subject to the applicable provisions of
the PBCL, at any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto may
modify or amend this Agreement, by written agreement executed and delivered by
duly authorized officers of the respective parties; provided, however,  that,
after Shareholder Approval, no amendment shall be made which changes the
consideration payable in the Merger or which would require further shareholder
approval under the PBCL or the rules of any relevant stock exchange, without
the approval of such shareholders.

  

9.4 _Waiver of Conditions_. The conditions to each of the parties'
obligations to consummate the Merger are for the sole benefit of such party
and may be waived in writing by such party against whom the waiver is to be
affected, in whole or in part, to the extent permitted by applicable  Law;
provided that after Shareholder Approval, no such waiver shall, without
further approval of such shareholders, make any change that would require
further shareholder approval under the PBCL or any relevant stock exchange.

  

9.5 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. For the convenience of the parties
hereto, this Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each
such counterpart being deemed to be an original instrument, and all such
counterparts shall together constitute the same agreement. This Agreement
shall  become effective when each party hereto shall have received
counterparts hereof signed by the other party hereto. Until and unless each
party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto, this
Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation
hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other
communication).

  

9.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, without giving
effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof. Any proceeding relating
to this Agreement shall be brought in a state court of Pennsylvania  or a
court of the United States of America located in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania. Each party to this Agreement hereby consents to personal
jurisdiction in any such action, consents to service of process by mail and
waives any objection to venue in any such court or to any claim that such
court is an inconvenient forum.

  

9.7 _Notices_. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be
given hereunder by any party to the other parties shall be in writing and
delivered personally or sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid,
or by facsimile transmission (with a confirming copy sent by overnight 
courier), as follows:

the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Any capitalized term used in
any Exhibit but not otherwise defined therein shall have the meaning assigned
to such term in this Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation". The words "hereof",  "hereto", "hereby",

referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or Law as from time to
time amended, modified or supplemented, unless otherwise specifically
indicated. References to a Person are also to its permitted successors and
