Each share (a " _Common Share_ ") of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Closing (other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled or converted pursuant to _Section 2.1.3_) shall thereupon be converted into and become the right to receive the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration as determined pursuant to _Section 2.1.5_ hereof.

automatically canceled upon the Closing and no consideration shall be payable
therefor.

 _Section 2.1.4 Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Closing shall be converted into and be exchanged for one hundred (100) newly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 _Section 2.2.1.2 _to Wells Fargo, N.A., (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), $15,000,000 (the " _Escrow Amount_ ") to be held in escrow pursuant to the provisions of the Escrow Agreement; 

  

 _Section 2.2.1.3 _to the Stockholders Representative, $100,000 (the " _Stockholders  Representative Expense Amount_") to be deposited in an account specified by the Stockholders Representative (the " _Stockholders  Representative Expense Account_"), which shall be used by the Stockholders Representative as the first recourse to fund any expenses incurred by the Stockholders Representative in accordance with the performance of its obligations hereunder; and

 _Section 2.2.2.2 _No interest will be paid or accrued on any of the Merger Consideration. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Common Shares which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the transferee shall be treated in the same fashion as any other Selling Stockholder with respect to the Common Shares held by such transferee, but only if the Certificate(s) representing such Common Shares are presented to Parent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Closing to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender such Selling Stockholders applicable portion of the Merger Consideration determined in accordance with _Section 2.1.5_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 _Section 2.2.3 Further Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger Consideration paid upon conversion of the Common Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Common Shares. 

  

 _Section 2.2.4 No Liability_. The portion of the Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this _Section 2.2_ and the payment of the applicable Escrow Percentage of any Escrow Funds payable in accordance with this Agreement, if any, in respect of a Certificate or a Company Option, as the case may be, that have been so surrendered shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights of the subject Common Share or Company Option to receive such consideration, as the case may be. 

  

 _Section 2.2.5 Withholding_. Parent, the Holding Company, Merger Sub, the Escrow Agent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Holder such amounts as Parent, the Holding Company, Merger Sub, the Escrow Agent or the Surviving Corporation are required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Holding Company, Merger Sub, the Escrow Agent or the Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

  

 _Section 2.2.6 Satisfaction of Payment Obligations_. Upon (i) payment by Parent of the Funding Amount to the Selling Stockholders pursuant to the Funds Flow Memorandum and (ii) delivery by Parent of the Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent, Parent shall be deemed to have satisfied its obligations to make payments in respect of the Merger Consideration. 

  

 _Section 2.3 __Stock Transfer Books_. Upon Closing, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock theretofore outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after the Closing, the holders of certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Closing shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock except as otherwise provided herein or by Law. On or after the Closing, any Certificates presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for any reason shall be converted into the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration determined in accordance with _Section 2.1.5_. 

  

 _Section 2.4 __Net Working Capital Adjustments_. 

  

 _Section 2.4.1 _The Company has delivered to Parent: (a) an estimated balance sheet of the Company (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ ") immediately prior to the close of business on the date of the Closing (the " _Closing Date_ ") and (b) a written statement setting forth its good faith estimate of Net Working Capital immediately prior to the close of business on the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_ ") determined without giving effect to the consummation of the Merger or any financing transactions in connection therewith. The Closing Balance Sheet shall be the Companys good faith estimate of its balance sheet immediately prior 

   ##### 

  

 

to the close of business on the Closing Date based on the Companys review of
financial information then reasonably available and inquiries of personnel
responsible for the preparation of the Audited Company Financial
Statements. 

   

 _Section 2.4.2 _If the Estimated Net Working Capital is less than negative $1.0 million (the " _Target Net Working Capital_ "), the Merger Consideration to be paid upon the Closing shall be decreased on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the difference between the Target Net Working Capital and the Estimated Net Working Capital. 

  

 _Section 2.4.3 _As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing, and in any event within ninety (90) calendar days thereof, Parent shall prepare and deliver to the Stockholders Representative a written computation of Parents calculation of Net Working Capital (" _Closing Net Working Capital_ ") as of the Closing Date (determined as of the close of business immediately prior to such date). Following delivery by Parent of its calculation of Closing Net Working Capital and until final determination of any adjustment to the Estimated Net Working Capital pursuant to this _Section 2.4.3_, the Stockholders Representative shall be entitled to have reasonable access to and review the work papers, trial balances and other documents utilized or compiled by Parent or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, counsel, accountants, advisors, representatives and agents in preparation of Parents calculation of Closing Net Working Capital. 

  

 _Section 2.4.4 _The Stockholders Representative shall have thirty (30) days after receiving Parents calculation of Closing Net Working Capital in which to deliver written notice of objection thereto to Parent setting forth in reasonable detail the basis of the objections. Failure to object in writing within such 30-day period shall constitute the Stockholders Representatives final and binding acceptance of Parents calculation of Closing Net Working Capital. The Stockholders Representative and Parent shall in good faith attempt jointly to resolve any disputed objection so raised by the Stockholders Representative with respect to Parents calculation of Closing Net Working Capital within 30 days after Parents receipt of the notice of such objection from the Stockholders Representative. If Parent and the Stockholders Representative cannot resolve all such objections within such 30-day period, the parties shall select a mutually acceptable nationally recognized accounting firm (the " _Auditor_ ") that is independent from, and has not been retained as the principal audit firm in the prior three (3) years by, the Company, the Selling Stockholders, or Parent, to resolve the remaining issues. The parties agree to jointly instruct the Auditor that it may not determine an amount of Net Working Capital in excess of that claimed by the Stockholders Representative or less than that claimed by Parent. The Auditors fees and expenses shall be paid by Parent if the amount of Net Working Capital determined by the Auditor is more than that claimed by Parent, and by the Selling Stockholders if the amount of Net Working Capital determined by the Auditor is less than that claimed by the Stockholders Representative. The parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Auditor to make its determination as promptly as possible and in any event within 60 days after the Auditor has been retained, including, without limitation, by promptly complying with all reasonable requests for information, books, records and similar items. Each of Parent and the Stockholders Representative will be afforded the opportunity to present to the Auditor any materials related to the determination and to discuss the determination with the Auditor. The determination of the Auditor will be conclusive and binding on the parties 

   ##### 

   

 

and shall be reflected in a final Closing Net Working Capital approved or
prepared by the Auditor. 

   

 _Section 2.4.5 _If, upon final determination of the Closing Net Working Capital pursuant to this  _Section 2.4_, the Closing Net Working Capital is less than both the Target Net Working Capital and the Estimated Net Working Capital, then Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall execute written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse the following amount, which amount the Escrow Agent shall pay to Parent out of the Escrow Funds pursuant to and in accordance with the Escrow Agreement: 

  

 _Section 2.4.5.1 _if the Estimated Net Working Capital is less than the Target Net Working Capital, the amount by which Closing Net Working Capital is less than the Estimated Net Working Capital; or 

  

 _Section 2.4.5.2 _if the Estimated Net Working Capital is greater than the Target Net Working Capital, the amount by which Closing Net Working Capital is less than the Target Net Working Capital.

such failure or to the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby.
Within 30 days after delivery of such notification, the Indemnifying Party
may, upon written notice thereof to the Indemnified Party, assume control of
the defense of such Third Party Action with counsel reasonably satisfactory
to the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party
may not assume control of the defense of any Third Party Action involving
criminal liability or in which equitable relief is sought against the

Indemnifying Party assumes control of such defense and representation of the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party by the same counsel would
constitute a conflict of interest under applicable standards of professional
conduct. The Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement of, or the
entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party Action without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall not
agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any
such Third Party Action without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
