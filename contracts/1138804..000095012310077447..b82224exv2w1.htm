properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the

of shares in book-entry form that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Appraisal
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair
value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section&nbsp;262. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the
right to appraisal under Section&nbsp;262 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section&nbsp;262, then the right of such holder to be
paid the fair value of such holder&#146;s Appraisal Shares under Section&nbsp;262 shall cease and such
Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have

shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common

that all such funds shall be invested as directed by Parent and that any and all interest or other
amounts earned with respect to funds made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement
shall be turned over to Parent.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <U>Exchange Procedure.</U> As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record
of a Certificate (i)&nbsp;a form of letter of transmittal (which shall include an accompanying
substitute IRS Form W-9 or the applicable IRS Form W-8, shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such person shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have such other
provisions (including customary provisions regarding delivery of an &#147;agent&#146;s message&#148; with respect
to shares held in book-entry form) as Parent may reasonably specify and which shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Company) and (ii)&nbsp;instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash equal to the Merger Consideration
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.01(c), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer books of the Company, payment of the
Merger Consideration in exchange therefor may be made to a person other than the person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such
tax has been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash
payable upon surrender of any Certificate.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <U>No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock.</U> All Merger Consideration
paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the terms of this Article&nbsp;II shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company
Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate. At the close of business on the day on
which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article&nbsp;II.</DIV>
