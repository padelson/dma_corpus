 WHEREAS the Board of Directors of each of the Company and Sub deems it in the best interests of their respective stockholders to consummate the merger (the " _Merger_ "), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, of Sub with and into the Company in which the Company would become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and such Boards of Directors have approved this Agreement, declared its advisability and recommended that this Agreement be adopted by the stockholders of the Company or Sub, as the case may be;

  

 WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger;

  

 WHEREAS concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as a condition to the willingness of Parent and Sub to enter into this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company are entering into a stockholders agreement with Parent (the " _Stockholders Agreement_ "), pursuant to which such stockholders shall agree, among other things, to take certain actions in furtherance of the Merger;

  

 WHEREAS concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as a condition to the willingness of Parent to enter into this Agreement, certain employees of the Company are entering into agreements with Parent pursuant to which such employees shall agree, among other things, to certain non-competition, non-solicitation and no hire restrictions; and

  

 WHEREAS concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as a condition to the willingness of Parent to enter into this Agreement, certain employees of the Company have executed offer letters (the " _Offer Letters_ ") regarding the employment of such employees following the consummation of the Merger.

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

    ##### 

  

     

ARTICLE I 

   

 _The Merger_  

 

 SECTION 1.01. _The Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

  

 SECTION 1.02. _Closing._ The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m., New York time, on a date to be specified by the parties, which shall be not later than the second business day after satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by law) waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those that by their terms are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing, it being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall remain subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at Closing), at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10019, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that if all the conditions set forth in Article VI shall not have been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by law) waived on such second business day, then the Closing shall take place on the first business day on which all such conditions shall have been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by law) waived. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ".

  

 SECTION 1.03. _Effective Time of the Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, the parties shall file a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") in such form as is required by, and executed and acknowledged in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such date and time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, at such subsequent date and time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger. The date and time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Effective Time_ ".

  

 SECTION 1.04. _Effects of the Merger._ The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

  

 SECTION 1.05. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws._ (a) The certificate of incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended by virtue of the Merger at the Effective Time to read in the form of Exhibit A hereto and, as so amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the

    ##### 

  

     

Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein
or by applicable Law. 

  

 (b) Parent shall cause the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to be amended and restated in their entirety so that the bylaws of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law, except that all references to the name of Sub shall be changed to refer to the name of the Company.

  

 SECTION 1.06. _Directors._ The directors of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

  

 SECTION 1.07. _Officers._ The officers of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

   

ARTICLE II 

   

 _Conversion of Securities_  

 

 SECTION 2.01. _Conversion of Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), or the holder of any shares of capital stock of Sub:

    

 (a) _Capital Stock of Sub._ Each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Sub, par value $0.01 per share, shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock._ All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned as treasury stock by the Company or owned by Parent or Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. 

   

 (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.01(b) and (ii) except as provided in Section 2.02, the Appraisal Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive $21.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time such shares shall no longer be 

   ##### 

  

   

outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate or evidence of shares in book-entry form that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares (a "
_Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement. The right of any holder of any share of Company Common
Stock to receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by
the amount of any withholding that is required under applicable tax Law, such
withholding to be pursuant to the terms of Section 2.03(f) and any applicable
tax Law. 

 

 SECTION 2.02. _Appraisal Rights._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares (the " _Appraisal Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. At the Effective Time, the Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate or evidence of shares in book-entry form that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holderÂ’s Appraisal Shares under Section 262 shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c). The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of any such demands and any other related instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing.

  

 SECTION 2.03. _Exchange of Certificates._ (a) _Paying Agent._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of Certificates (the " _Paying Agent_ "), and, from time to time after the Effective Time, Parent shall make available, or cause the Surviving Corporation to make available, to the Paying Agent funds in amounts and at the times necessary for the payment of the Merger

    ##### 

  

     

Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c) upon surrender of Certificates, it
being understood that all such funds shall be invested as directed by Parent
and that any and all interest or other amounts earned with respect to funds
made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be turned
over to Parent. 

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedure._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall include an accompanying substitute IRS Form W-9 or the applicable IRS Form W-8, shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have such other provisions (including customary provisions regarding delivery of an "agentÂ’s message" with respect to shares held in book-entry form) as Parent may reasonably specify and which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash equal to the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.01(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer books of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

  

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

    ##### 

  

    

 (d) _No Liability._ None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any Merger Consideration that would otherwise have been payable in respect of any Certificate which is delivered to a public official in accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any Merger Consideration payable in accordance with this Article II in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

  

 (e) _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall pay the Merger Consideration in respect of such lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed Certificate.

  

 (f) _Withholding Rights._ Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

  

 (g) _Termination of Fund._ At any time following the six-month anniversary of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) and that have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter, subject to time limitations in Section 2.03(d), such holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates held by such holders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon.

 (ii) Each Pension Plan intended to be tax qualified under the Code has been the subject of a favorable determination, qualification or opinion letter from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ") with respect to all tax Law changes with respect to which the IRS is currently willing to provide a determination letter to the effect that such Pension Plan is qualified and exempt from United States Federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, and no such letter has been revoked (nor, as of the date of this Agreement, has revocation been threatened) and no event has occurred since the date of the most recent such letter or application therefor relating to any such Pension Plan that is reasonably likely to adversely affect the qualification of such Pension Plan or materially increase the costs relating thereto or require security under Section 307 of ERISA. Each Benefit Plan required to have been approved by any non-United States Governmental Entity (or permitted to have been approved to obtain any beneficial tax or other status) has been so approved or timely submitted for approval, no such approval has been revoked (nor, as of the date of this Agreement, has revocation been threatened) and no event has occurred since the date of the most recent approval or application therefor relating to any such Pension Plan that is reasonably likely to affect any such approval relating thereto or increase the costs relating thereto.

There are no understandings, agreements or undertakings, written or oral, that would prevent any Welfare Plan (including any Welfare Plan covering retirees or other former employees) from being amended or terminated without material liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at or at any time after the Effective Time. No Welfare Plan provides benefits, and there are no understandings, written or oral, with respect to the provision of welfare benefits, after termination of employment, except where the cost thereof is borne entirely by the former employee (or his or her eligible dependents or beneficiaries) or as required by Section 4980B(f) of the Code or any similar state statute or foreign Law. The Company and its Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of Section 4980B(f) of the Code, Sections 601-609 of ERISA and any similar state statute or foreign Law with respect to each Benefit Plan that is a "group health plan" (as defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code or any similar state statute).

transactions contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in combination with any
other event, including any termination of employment on or following the
Closing), or any compensation or benefits the value of which would be
calculated on the basis of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (alone or in combination with any other event, including

including any termination of employment on or following the Closing) or any
compensation or benefits related to or contingent upon, or the value of which
will be calculated on the basis of, the Merger and the other transactions

and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in
combination with any other event, including any termination of employment on

grantor trust or otherwise) of, or increase the cost of, or give rise to any
other obligation under, any Benefit Plan, Benefit Agreement or any other
employment arrangement, (B) trigger the forgiveness of indebtedness owed by
any Company Personnel to the Company or any of its Affiliates or (C) result
in any violation or breach of, or a default (with or without notice or lapse
of time or both) under, or limit to the CompanyÂ’s or any of its SubsidiariesÂ’
ability to amend, modify or terminate, any Benefit Plan or Benefit
Agreement.

This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and Sub, as applicable, and, assuming the due execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Parent and Sub, as applicable, enforceable against Parent and Sub, as applicable, in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. The execution and delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the compliance by Parent and Sub with the provisions of this Agreement do not and will not conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) under, or give rise to a right of, or result in, termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to a loss of a material benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien in or upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or Sub under, or give rise to any increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or entitlements under, any provision of (i) the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Parent or Sub, (ii) any Contract or Permit to or by which Parent or Sub is a party or bound or to or by which their respective properties or assets are subject or bound or otherwise under which Parent or Sub has rights or benefits or (iii) subject to the governmental filings and other matters referred to in the following sentence, any Law (assuming receipt of the Stockholder Approval and the adoption of this Agreement by Parent, as the sole stockholder of Sub) or Judgment, in each case, applicable to Parent or Sub or their respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, terminations, cancellations, accelerations, losses, Liens, rights or entitlements that, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to impair in any material respect the ability of each of Parent and Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement or prevent or materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No consent, approval, order or authorization of, registration, declaration or filing with, or notice to, any Governmental Entity is required by or with respect to Parent or Sub in connection

or any of its Subsidiaries is qualified to do business and (C) such other
consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations,
filings and notices, the failure of which to be obtained or made,
individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to impair in any
material respect the ability of each of Parent and Sub to perform
its obligations under this Agreement or prevent or materially impede or
materially delay the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (c) _Information Supplied._ None of the information supplied or to be supplied by Parent or Sub specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders, at the time of the Stockholders Meeting or at the time of any amendment or supplement thereof, as amended or supplemented at such date or time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. 

   

 (d) _Interim Operations of Sub._ Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and has engaged in no business other than in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (e) _Financing._ Parent and Sub have, and will have available to them upon the Effective Time, sufficient funds to perform all of their respective obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including payment in full of the Merger Consideration and the amounts payable to the holders of Cash-Out Options, and to pay all associated fees, costs and expenses.

 For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any binding bona fide written offer which did not result from a breach of Section 4.02(a) made by any person (other than Parent or Sub or any of their Affiliates) that, if consummated, would result in such person (or, in the case of a direct merger between such person and the Company, the stockholders of such person) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting power of the Company Common Stock or all or substantially all the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and which offer, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company (after consultation with a financial advisor of national reputation and outside legal counsel), (i) provides consideration which is more favorable to the stockholders of the Company than the consideration provided in the Merger (taking into account all of the terms and conditions of such offer and this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such Superior Proposal or otherwise)) and (ii) is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal. 

   

 (b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (or shall agree or resolve to) (i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, the recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Board of Directors or any such committee of this Agreement or the Merger (any such action, resolution or agreement to take such action being referred to herein as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), (ii) recommend, declare advisable or propose to recommend or declare advisable, the approval or adoption of any Takeover Proposal or resolve or agree to take any such action, or adopt or approve any Takeover Proposal, or (iii) cause or permit the 

    ##### 

  

 

Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement
or other agreement (each, an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ") constituting or
related to, or which is intended to or is reasonably likely to lead to,
any Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in
Section 4.02(a)), or resolve or agree to take any such action.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the Stockholder Approval,
the Board of Directors of the Company may, in response to a Superior
Proposal or an Intervening Event, effect an Adverse Recommendation Change,
_provided_ that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that the failure to do so
is reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, and _provided_ _further_ ,
that the Board of Directors of the Company may not effect such an Adverse
Recommendation Change unless (A) the Board of Directors of the Company shall
have first provided prior written notice to Parent (an "
_Adverse Recommendation Change Notice_ ") that it is prepared to effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal or an
Intervening Event, which notice shall, in the case of a Superior Proposal,
attach the most current version of any written agreement relating to
the transaction that constitutes such Superior Proposal, and, in the case of
an Intervening Event, attach information describing such Intervening Event in
reasonable detail, and (B) Parent does not make, within five business days
after the receipt of such notice, a proposal that would, in the good faith
judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company (after consultation with a
financial advisor of national reputation and outside legal counsel), (x)
cause the offer previously constituting a Superior Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal or (y) obviate the need for an Adverse
Recommendation Change as a result of an Intervening Event (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment or modification of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new Adverse Recommendation Change Notice and a new
three business day period). The Company agrees that, during the five or three
business day period, as applicable, prior to its effecting an
Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company and its officers, directors and
representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and its officers,
directors and representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed
by Parent. 

   

 For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Intervening Event_ " means an event, circumstance, fact or other information, unknown to the Board of Directors of the Company, as of the date of this Agreement, which becomes known prior to the Stockholder Approval and which causes the Board of Directors of the Company to reasonably conclude in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that its failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change is reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the receipt, existence or terms of a Takeover Proposal or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof constitute an Intervening Event. 

     ##### 

  

     

 (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 4.02, the Company shall, as promptly as possible and in any event within 24 hours after the receipt thereof, advise Parent orally and in writing of (i) any Takeover Proposal or any request for information or inquiry that the Company reasonably believes could lead to or contemplates a Takeover Proposal and (ii) the terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry (including any subsequent amendment or other modification to such terms and conditions) and the identity of the person making any such Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry. Commencing upon the provision of any notice referred to above, the Company (or its outside counsel) shall (A) on a daily basis at mutually agreeable times, advise Parent (or its outside counsel) of the progress of negotiations concerning any Takeover Proposal, the material resolved and unresolved issues related thereto and any other matters identified with reasonable specificity by Parent (or its outside counsel) and the material details (including material amendments or proposed amendments as to price and other material terms) of any such Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry and (B) promptly upon receipt or delivery thereof, provide Parent (or its outside counsel) with copies of all documents and material written or electronic communications relating to any such Takeover Proposal (including the financing thereof), request or inquiry exchanged between the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors or representatives, on the one hand, and the person making a Takeover Proposal or any of its Affiliates, or their respective officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors or representatives, on the other hand. 

   

 (d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company or its Board of Directors or any committee thereof take, agree or resolve to take any action prohibited by Section 4.02(b). 

   

 SECTION 4.03. _Conduct by Parent._ During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, except as consented to in writing by the Company prior to such action or as specifically contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, take any action that is reasonably likely to result in (a) any representation and warranty of Parent or Sub set forth in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality becoming untrue (as so qualified) or (b) any such representation and warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue in any material respect.

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, (x) if the Company does not receive comments from the SEC with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement and is not notified by the SEC that it will receive comments, absent any Legal Restraint that has the effect of preventing such action, the Company shall file with the SEC the definitive Proxy Statement, and shall cause the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the Company, on or prior to the second business day after the tenth calendar day immediately following the date of filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC, and (y) if the Company does receive comments from the SEC with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement, absent any Legal Restraint that has the effect of preventing such action, the Company shall file with the SEC the definitive Proxy Statement, and shall cause the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the Company, on or prior to the second business day immediately following clearance by the SEC with respect to such comments. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning such person to the other as may be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between it and its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand.

made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.
If the Company receives a Takeover Proposal or if an Intervening Event
occurs, the ten calendar day periods referenced in this Section 5.01(a) and
the two business day period referenced in clause (y) of the second sentence
of this Section 5.01(a) will be extended by three calendar days. 

   

 (b) The Company agrees that the Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and that none of the information included or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date the Proxy Statement is filed with the SEC or mailed to the stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, or at the time of any amendment or supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, except that no covenant is made by the Company with respect to statements made in the Proxy Statement based on information supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent or Sub specifically for inclusion or incorporation for reference therein. Parent agrees that none of such information will, at the date the Proxy Statement is filed with the SEC or mailed to the stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, or at the time of any amendment or supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. 

   

 (c) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall, in compliance with applicable Law, the Company Certificate, the Company By-Laws and the rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, establish a record date (which will be as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement) for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders, which meeting the Company shall, absent any Legal Restraint that has the effect of preventing such action, cause to occur on the 30th calendar day (or, if such calendar day is not a business day, on the first business day subsequent to such calendar day) immediately following the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement (the " _Stockholders Meeting_ "), for the purpose of obtaining the Stockholder Approval, regardless of whether the Board of Directors of the Company determines at any time that this Agreement is no longer advisable or recommends that the stockholders of the Company reject it or any other Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred at any time; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if the Company is unable to obtain a quorum of its stockholders at such time, the Company may extend the date of the Stockholders Meeting to the extent (and only to the extent) necessary in order to obtain a quorum of its stockholders and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such a quorum as promptly as practicable, (ii) the Company may adjourn or postpone the Stockholders Meeting to the 

      ##### 

  

    

extent (and only to the extent) the Company reasonably determines that such
adjournment or postponement is required by applicable Law to comply with
comments made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and (iii) if the
Company receives a new Takeover Proposal, the price or material terms of a
previously received Takeover Proposal are modified or amended or an
Intervening Event occurs, in any such case during the five calendar day
period immediately prior to the day of the Stockholders Meeting, the Company
may delay the Stockholders Meeting until the date that is the fifth business
day after the date on which the Stockholders Meeting would otherwise have been
held; provided, however, that the Company may delay the Stockholders Meeting
pursuant to this clause (iii) no more than once. The notice of such
Stockholders Meeting shall state that a resolution to adopt this Agreement
will be considered at the Stockholders Meeting. Subject to Section

of Company Common Stock that they adopt this Agreement and shall include such
recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (y) the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to solicit the Stockholder Approval.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that its
obligations pursuant to this Section 5.01(c) shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company or any other person of any Takeover Proposal. The Company
shall provide updates to Parent with respect to the proxy solicitation for
the Stockholders Meeting (including interim results) as reasonably requested
by Parent. 

   

 SECTION 5.02. _Access to Information; Confidentiality._ (a) Subject to compliance with applicable Laws, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and to ParentÂ’s officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants and other representatives and advisors full access upon reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement to all their respective properties, assets, books, records, Contracts, Permits, documents, information, directors, officers and employees, and during such period the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, make available to Parent any information concerning its business as Parent may reasonably request (including the work papers of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, subject to the customary requirements of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP). Following the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, Parent may (but shall not be required to), following reasonable notice to the Company, contact and interview any Company Personnel and review the personnel records and such other information concerning the Company Personnel as Parent may reasonably request. No investigation by Parent or any of its officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors or representatives and no other receipt of information by Parent or any of its officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors or representatives shall operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other provision of this Agreement, or the obligations of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under the Agreement. Except as required by 

      ##### 

  

    

any applicable Law or Judgment, Parent will hold, and will direct its
officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other
advisors and representatives to hold, any and all information received from
the Company confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. 

   

 (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, as and to the extent reasonably requested by Parent, provide Parent, to the extent applicable, with (i) a materially complete and correct list of all licenses issued by the Federal Communications Commission (the " _FCC_ ") and held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _FCC Licenses_ "), (ii) materially complete and correct copies of each FCC License, (iii) if available, the address and physical location of the device(s) covered by each FCC License, (iv) if available, a written description of the purpose of the device(s) covered by each FCC License, (v) materially complete and correct copies of any Notices of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture issued by the FCC against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (vi) all reasonably available information in the possession of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries necessary for Parent to make an independent determination that the Company and its Subsidiaries have complied with FCC rules regarding changes of ownership control of the FCC Licenses (including descriptions of any transactions that effected a change of ownership or control of the FCC Licenses (including any intracompany reorganizations) and corporate organizational charts depicting the ownership structure of the holder of the FCC Licenses before and after any such change of ownership or control). 

   

 (c) Subject to applicable law, the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate to ensure an orderly transition and integration process in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement in order to minimize the disruption to, and preserve the value of, the business of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries. 

   

 SECTION 5.03. _Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Consultation and Notice._ (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including transactions under the Stockholders Agreement), including using its commercially reasonable efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Article VI, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from, and the giving of any necessary notices to, Governmental Entities and other persons and the making of all necessary registrations, declarations and filings (including filings under the HSR Act and other registrations, declarations and filings with, or notices to, Governmental Entities, if any), (iii) the taking of all reasonable steps to provide any supplemental information requested by a Governmental Entity, including participating in meetings with

taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid any suit, claim,
action, investigation or proceeding by any Governmental Entity or third party
and (v) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers
from any third party, _provided_ , that this clause (v) shall not limit the
rights of the Company or its Board of Directors under Section 4.02(b). In
connection with and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of
the Company and its Board of Directors shall, if any state takeover statute
or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or
any of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including transactions under the Stockholders Agreement, take all actions
necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on this Agreement, the Stockholders Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, in no event shall Parent or Sub be obligated to, and the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall not without the prior written consent of Parent, agree
or proffer to divest or hold separate, or enter into any licensing, business
restriction or similar arrangement with respect to, any assets (whether
tangible or intangible) or any portion of any business of Parent, the Company
or any of their respective Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries be obligated to litigate or participate in the
litigation of any suit, claim, action or proceeding, whether judicial or
administrative, brought by any Governmental Entity (A) challenging or
seeking to restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including transactions under the
Stockholders Agreement, or seeking to obtain from Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries any damages in relation therewith; (B) seeking to prohibit
or limit in any respect, or place any conditions on, the ownership or
operation by the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates of all
or any portion of the business or assets or any product of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or Parent or its Subsidiaries or to require any such person to
dispose of, license (whether pursuant to an exclusive or nonexclusive license)

case as a result of or in connection with the Merger or any of the other

vote Company Common Stock or the shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation or any of ParentÂ’s Subsidiaries on all matters properly presented
to the stockholders of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of
ParentÂ’s Subsidiaries, respectively; or (D) seeking to (1) directly
or indirectly prohibit Parent or any of its Affiliates from effectively
controlling in any respect any of the business or operations of the Company
or its or ParentÂ’s Subsidiaries or (2) directly or 

      ##### 

  

    

indirectly prevent the Company or its or ParentÂ’s Subsidiaries from operating
any of their business in substantially the same manner as operated by the
Company and its or ParentÂ’s Subsidiaries immediately prior to the date of
this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall provide such assistance,
information and cooperation to each other as is reasonably required to obtain
any such actions, nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and
authorizations and, in connection therewith, shall notify the other person
promptly following the receipt of any comments from any Governmental Entity
and of any request by any Governmental Entity for amendments, supplements or
additional information in respect of any registration, declaration or filing
with, or notice to, such Governmental Entity and shall supply the other
person with copies of all correspondence between such person or any of its
representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity, on the other
hand.

 (ii) Except as prohibited by applicable Law, the Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing of: 

   

 (A) the occurrence of any matter or event that (1) is, or that is reasonably likely to be, material (individually or in the aggregate) to the business, assets, properties, condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (2) has resulted, or is reasonably likely to result, in (I) any representation and warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality becoming untrue, (II) any such representation and warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue in any material respect or (III) any condition to the transactions contemplated hereby and set forth in Section 6.02 not being satisfied;

 _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall operate as a waiver
or otherwise affect any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or
other provision in this Agreement, or the obligations of the parties (or
remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties under this Agreement.

 (d) Immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of the parties hereto, Parent, as the sole stockholder of Sub, will adopt this Agreement. 

   

 SECTION 5.04. _Equity Awards._ (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions (including obtaining any required consents) as may be required to effect the following: 

    

 (i) at the Effective Time, each Cash-Out Option shall be cancelled and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive in consideration for such cancellation an amount of cash equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that are subject to such Cash-Out Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Stock Option, which amount shall be payable to such holder at or as soon as practicable following the Effective Time; 

   

 (ii) at the Effective Time, each Rollover Option shall be converted into an option to acquire, on substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the Rollover Option (other than as set forth in this Section 5.04(a)(ii) or any applicable Offer Letter), the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Rollover Option by the Exchange Ratio (as defined below), at an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock equal to (A) the per share exercise price for the shares of Company Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Rollover Option divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio (each, as so adjusted, an " _Adjusted Option_ "); provided that such exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent. The adjustments provided in this Section 5.04(a)(ii) with respect to any Stock Options, whether or not they are "incentive stock options" as defined in Section 422 of the Code, are intended to be effected in a manner which is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the holders of Adjusted Options appropriate notices setting forth such holdersÂ’ rights pursuant 

   ##### 

  

   

to the Company Stock Plans and Stock Option Agreements evidencing the grants
of such Adjusted Options and that such Adjusted Options and related
agreements shall be assumed by Parent and shall continue in effect on the
same terms and conditions (other than as specifically set forth in any
applicable Offer Letter or with respect to exercisability prior to vesting
and subject to the adjustments required by this Section 5.04 after
giving effect to the Merger);

      ##### 

  

    

stockholders of the Company and thereafter (A) this Agreement is terminated by
either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) or Section

forth in the definition of Takeover Proposal contained in Section 4.02(a)
except that all references to 10% shall be deemed references to 35%) or (ii)
this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(c), then the

 SECTION 8.07. _Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of Laws thereof. 

   

 SECTION 8.08. _Assignment._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior written consent of the other parties, except that Sub may assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Sub of any of its obligations hereunder.

 SECTION 8.09. _Consent to Jurisdiction; Service of Process; Venue._ Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, any Delaware State court and the Federal court of the United States of 

      ##### 

  

    

America sitting in the State of Delaware) for the purposes of any suit, action
or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement (and agrees that no such action,
suit or proceeding relating to this Agreement shall be brought by it or any
of its Subsidiaries except in such courts). Each of the parties
further agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail
to such personÂ’s respective address set forth above shall be effective
service of process for any action, suit or proceeding in the State of
Delaware with respect to any matters to which it has submitted to
jurisdiction as set forth above in the immediately preceding sentence. Each
of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives (and agrees not
to plead or claim), any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit
or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in the Delaware Court of Chancery
(and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, in any Delaware
State court or the Federal court of the United States of America sitting in
the State of Delaware) or that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in
any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. 

   

 SECTION 8.10. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL._ EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 8.10. 

   

 SECTION 8.11. _Enforcement._ The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, in any Delaware State court or the Federal court of the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that (x) any party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. 

       ##### 

  

     

 SECTION 8.12. _Consents and Approvals._ For any matter under this Agreement requiring the consent or approval of any party to be valid and binding on the parties hereto, such consent or approval must be in writing and executed and delivered to the other parties by a person duly authorized by such party to do so. 

   

 SECTION 8.13. _Severability._ If any provision of this Agreement or the application of any such provision to any person or circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of any other provision hereof and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.
