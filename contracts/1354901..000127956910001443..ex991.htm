respect to the Closing Cash Balance Statement as promptly as practicable. If

Business Days after receipt of the objecting Party's written objection to the
Closing Cash Balance Statement pursuant to Section 2.4(b), then those items or
calculations in dispute shall be submitted for resolution to the Independent
Accountant. The Independent Accountant shall consider only those items or
amounts in the Closing Cash Balance Statement as to which the objecting Party
has objected in accordance with Section 2.4(b). The Parties shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accountant to submit
its determination in a written statement delivered to the Parties as promptly
as practicable, but in no event later than ten Business Days following
submission of the dispute by the Vendors and Buyer, and such determination,
together with any items that were otherwise resolved between the Vendors and
Buyer in accordance with this Section 2.4(c) and the original Closing Cash
Balance Statement, shall become the Closing Cash Balance Statement and shall
be final and binding upon all Parties hereto and shall constitute an arbitral

Conversion Rights

  

  

    

(a)

  |  

A holder of Class C Non-Voting Shares shall be entitled at such holder\'s
option at any time and from time to time to have all or any of the Class C
Non-Voting Shares registered in the name of the holder on the books of the
Corporation converted into fully paid and non-assessable Class A Subordinated
Voting Shares as the same shall be constituted at the time of conversion upon
the basis of one (1) Class C Non-Voting Share for every one (1) Class A

---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(b)

  |  

Subject to paragraph (c) of this section, the conversion right provided for
herein may be exercised by notice in writing given to the Corporation at its
registered office accompanied by the certificate or certificates representing
the Class C Non-Voting Shares in respect of which the holder thereof desires
to exercise such right of conversion and such notice shall be executed by the
person registered on the books of the Corporation as the holder of the Class C
Non-Voting Shares in respect of which such right is being exercised or by his

holder desires to have converted. The conversion shall be deemed to take
effect upon the date which the said certificate or certificates shall be
surrendered to the Corporation at its registered office accompanied by the
said notice in writing unless such date be a Saturday, Sunday or a holiday, in
which event it shall take effect on the next business day. Upon due exercise
of the conversion right and subject to paragraph (c) of this section, the
Corporation shall register such conversion and indicate that such shareholder
is the registered owner of the Class A Subordinated Voting Shares on the books
of the Corporation. If the conversion right is exercised in respect of less
than all of the Class C Non-Voting Shares represented by any share
certificate, the Corporation shall also issue a new share certificate
representing the number of Class C Non-Voting Shares in respect of which the
conversion right is not being exercised.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(c)

  |  

Notwithstanding this section, the power of the Corporation to issue, and the
right of any holder of Class C Non-Voting Shares to receive, any Class A
Subordinated Voting Shares in connection with this conversion right is limited
by the restrictions set out in article 9 of the articles of the Corporation.
For greater certainty, so long as the Direction shall prohibit the CRTC from
issuing a Licence under the Broadcasting Act (Canada) to the Corporation (or
to any corporation in which the corporation has a direct or indirect interest
through the holding of shares in that or other corporations) or renewing or
amending any such Licence held by the Corporation (or by any corporation in
which the Corporation has a direct or indirect interest through the holding of
shares in that or other corporations), if the number of votes attached to
Voting Shares or the number of Voting Shares held by members of the Restricted
Class exceeds 33.33% (or some different specified percentage thereof as may be
specified, from time to time, under the Direction) of the aggregate voting
rights attached to all Voting Shares or of the total number of issued and
outstanding Voting Shares, no Voting Share shall be transferred to a member of
the Restricted Class if, immediately following its transfer, Voting Shares to
which are attached more than 33.33% (or such different specified percentage
thereof as may be specified, from time to time, under the Direction) of the
voting rights attached to all the issued and outstanding Voting Shares or
Voting Shares which represent more than 33.33% (or such different specified
percentage thereof as may be specified, from time to time, under the
Direction) of the total number of issued and outstanding Voting Shares would
be held in the aggregate by or for persons who are members of such Restricted
Class at any time. For further certainty, the power of the Corporation to
issue, and the right of any holder of Class C Non-Voting Shares to receive,
any Class A Subordinated Voting Shares in connection with this conversion
right is restricted if such conversion requires the prior approval of the CRTC
or any other governmental body or authority having or purporting to have
jurisdiction unless and until such approval has been received.

Restrictions on Transfer of Shares

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(a)

  |  

Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement and without limiting the
powers of the Board under the articles of the Corporation to restrict the
issue, Transfer and voting of Shares, the Corporation shall not issue Shares
to any Person and the Shareholder may not Transfer any Shares to any Person
unless such issuance or Transfer has received all required approvals of the
CRTC and of any other regulatory authority having jurisdiction.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(b)

  |  

Except as may otherwise be agreed to in writing by each of the Significant
Shareholders, the Shareholder shall not Transfer any Shares, or any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement, to any Person (a "Transferee"),
except as specifically permitted by this Agreement and only in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement. The Corporation shall not be required: (i) to
Transfer on its books any Shares, nor (ii) to treat as the legal or beneficial
owner of any Shares, or otherwise to accord voting or dividend rights to, any
Transferee to whom any Shares have been Transferred in contravention of this

terms of this Agreement, first agrees, in writing, to become a party to and be
bound by the terms of this Agreement that are applicable to the Shareholder by
signing a joinder to this Agreement, and (ii) the Shareholder shall guarantee
and be responsible for the performance and observance by such Transferee of
all of its obligations under this Agreement. [The Parties acknowledge that, as
of the date hereof, certain Shares are beneficially owned by XM Satellite
Radio Inc., an Affiliate of the Shareholder and that (x) concurrently with the
execution of this Agreement, XM Satellite Radio Inc. has signed a joinder to
this Agreement pursuant to which it has agreed to become a party to and be
bound by the terms of this Agreement that are applicable to the Shareholder,
and (ii) the Shareholder agrees to guarantee and be responsible for the
performance and observance by XM Satellite Radio Inc. of all of its
obligations under this Agreement.][NTD: For Sirius XM agreement only.]

The Shareholder may, after giving written notice (a "Transfer Notice") to the
Corporation specifying the number and class of Shares proposed to be
Transferred and the date of the proposed Transfer (which date shall not be
less than three Business Days following the date of the Transfer Notice),
Transfer all or any part of the Shares owned it:

  

  

    

  |  

(a)

  |  

subject to Section 5.1(a) and 5.1(c), as applicable, to an Affiliate of the
Shareholder; or

  |  

(b)

  |  

subject to Section 5.1, 5.3 and 5.4, as applicable, to a Person other than an

Shares not of the publicly traded class shall first be converted into the
publicly traded class of Shares in accordance with the articles of the
Corporation prior to such Transfer.

5.3

  |  

Transition Period

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(a)

  |  

During the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the earlier of
date that is six months following the date hereof or the Cancellation Date
(defined below) (the "Transition Period"), the Shareholder covenants and
agrees that it shall not Transfer any of the Initial Shares pursuant to
Section 5.2(b) except in compliance with this Section 5.3 or pursuant to the
Registration Rights Agreement.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(b)

  |  

As promptly as practicable following receipt of a Transfer Notice (and in any
event within three Business Days thereof) that is received by the Corporation
during the Transition Period with respect to a Transfer contemplated by
Section 5.2(b), the Corporation shall provide a copy of the Transfer Notice to
each other Significant Shareholder. Each Significant Shareholder (other than
the Significant Shareholder who delivered the Transfer Notice (the "Initiating
Shareholder")) shall have ten Business Days following receipt of the Transfer
Notice to provide written notice (a "Participation Notice") to the Corporation
that it will also participate in a sale or offering of its Initial Shares in
the manner contemplated in Section 5.3(c) and the number and class of Initial
Shares that such Significant Shareholder wishes to Transfer pursuant to such
sale or offering. If any Significant Shareholder (other than the Initiating
Shareholder) does not provide such notice within such ten Business Day period,
it will be deemed to have elected to not participate in the Transfer of Shares
by the Initiating Shareholder and shall not Transfer any Initial Shares
pursuant to Section 5.2(b) prior to the earlier of (i) the expiration of the
60 calendar day period referred to in Section 5.3(c) below, and (ii) the
consummation of the sale or offering of the Selling Shares (defined below)
pursuant to Section 5.3(c) below (provided that any such Transfer during the
Transition Period will be subject to the provisions of this Section 5.3). As
promptly as practicable following receipt of each Participation Notice (and in
any event within three Business Days thereof), the Corporation shall provide a
copy of each such Participation Notice to the Initiating Shareholder and each
other Significant Shareholder who has delivered a Participation Notice in
accordance with this Section 5.3(b).

\- 12 -  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

    

  |  

(c)

  |  

Following the expiration of the ten Business Day period referred to in Section
5.3(b), the Corporation shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
facilitate a sale or offering of the Initial Shares specified in the Transfer
Notice together with all Shares specified in each Participation Notice
delivered in accordance with Section 5.3(b) (collectively, the "Selling
Shares"), all in a manner reasonably acceptable to the Corporation, the
Initiating Shareholder and each Significant Shareholder that delivered a
Participation Notice in accordance with Section 5.3(b) (collectively, the
"Selling Shareholders"). Any such sale or offering shall be at the sole
expense, liability and risk of the Selling Shareholders (pro rata based on the
number of Selling Shares beneficially owned by each Selling Shareholder). If
such Transfer does not occur within 60 calendar days following receipt of the
last Participation Notice received in accordance with Section 5.3(b), then the
Transition Period shall automatically expire (such date being the
"Cancellation Date") and each of the Significant Shareholders may, subject to
Section 5.2 and Section 5.4, Transfer all or a portion of their Initial Shares
in their sole and absolute discretion and in accordance with applicable
securities laws and the other terms and conditions of this Agreement.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(d)

  |  

For greater certainty, the provisions of Section 5.4(b) shall apply to any
Significant Shareholder to the extent it may be an Affected Shareholder
(defined below) as a result of the Transfer of Selling Shares or Initial
Shares by a Significant Shareholder in accordance with the terms of this
Section 5.3.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(e)

  |  

Each Selling Shareholder shall cooperate with the Corporation and the other
Selling Shareholders in order to assist the Corporation to facilitate a sale
or offering of the Selling Shares in a manner reasonably acceptable to the
Corporation and the Selling Shareholders. In the event that the Corporation
and the Selling Shareholders agree on a distribution process for the Transfer
of the Selling Shares, each Selling Shareholder will provide such further
documents or instruments required by the Corporation or any other Selling
Shareholder as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to effect the purpose
of this Section 5.3 and carry out its provisions.

pursuant to Section 5.2(a) and the date that is no less than 5 Business Days
prior to the sale or offering of the Selling Shares in accordance with Section
5.3(c), if applicable, the Corporation shall provide the Shareholder (a
"Transferring Shareholder") with written notice specifying either:

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(i)

  |  

that such Transfer would not result in any other Significant Shareholder,
following such Transfer, having a Voting Interest (calculated without regard
to any Shares acquired by a Significant Shareholder after the Closing) that is
greater than its Maximum Threshold, in which case the Transferring Shareholder
may, subject to Section 5.2 and Section 5.3 (if applicable), Transfer all or
any portion of the Shares specified in the Transfer Notice within ten Business
Days following receipt by the Corporation of such Transfer Notice; or

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 13 -

(ii)

  |  

that such Transfer would result in one or more other Significant Shareholders,
following such Transfer, having a Voting Interest (calculated without regard
to any Shares acquired by any such Significant Shareholder(s) after the
Closing) that is greater than its Maximum Threshold (each an "Affected
Shareholder"), in which case the Transferring Shareholder may, subject to
Section 5.2 and Section 5.3 (if applicable), Transfer all (but not a portion)
of the Shares specified in the Transfer Notice on the date specified by the
Corporation (which date shall not be more than 10 Business Days following the
date of the Corporation's notice pursuant to this Section 5.4(a)(ii)).

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(b)

  |  

If the Corporation provides the Transferring Shareholder with notice pursuant
to Section 5.4(a)(ii), the Corporation shall concurrently provide a copy of
such notice together with a copy of the applicable Transfer Notice to each
Affected Shareholder and such Affected Shareholder shall, on the date
specified in the Corporation's notice pursuant to this Section 5.4(a)(ii) and
conditional upon the Transferring Shareholder Transferring all (but not less
than all) of the Shares specified in the Transfer Notice, convert such number
of Class B Shares beneficially owned by it into Class A Shares (or, in the
case of Sirius XM, if necessary, convert such number of Class A Shares
beneficially owned by it into Class C Shares) that would result in such
Affected Shareholder, following the Transfer of the Shares specified in the
Transfer Notice, having a Voting Interest (calculated without regard to any
Shares acquired by the Significant Shareholder after the Closing Date) that is
equal to the Affected Shareholder's Maximum Threshold.
